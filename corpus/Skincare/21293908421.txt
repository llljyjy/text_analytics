TLDR: Got it for my Mom and she loves it!I originally bought this in the mini pack that came with the cleanser, and my mom tried the mousturizer out and said she really liked it. I bought the full size for her as a birthday gift and I believe she used up the whole jar over the course of 1 -2 years as she likes to put it in the under eye area and her cheeks whenever she feels she needs a boost of hydration. She has very sensitive skin that if she puts on any makeup or skin care with harsh chemicals her face gets really red and she has no issues when putting it on. Iâ€™m getting her another jar now! Great for Sensitive Skin
