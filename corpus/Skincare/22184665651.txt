I bought sample of this cream from ranavat website. I have extremely sensitive, dry and acne prone skin. After using this cream for a week my redness was gone, acne spots are lighter and dryness is decreased. I love this product. It is worth the price. I have used Re- Nutrive, Sisley, Dior, Chanel, Armani and many more products. By far this is the best product I have used for my tricky skin. I use it after Skin inc. Collagen serum. Not a paid review
