I have been using this product for about 2 months now. I have seen no improvement around my eyes. It is hydrating but my main issue with this product is the packaging and product amount. I tend to take my skincare with me on overnight trips. I paced this in my overnight bag almost completely full and when I reached my destination, it was less than half full. It did not spill or anything. I can only assume that there is not nearly as much product as they say there is or I wouldnâ€™t be needing a new eye cream false packaging
