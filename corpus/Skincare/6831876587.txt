This is a oil -based treatment, so I don’t know why people who are extremely oily are even trying it, tbh. It’s a non-drying formula for dry skin. Most people seem to be complaining about it being greasy because they have oilier skin or they’re complaining that it doesn’t smell good. People constantly complain about skincare having fragrance, and then if it isn’t included, people whine that it doesn’t smell good. It smells like nothing to me, but that’s besides the point- if it doesn’t have fragrance, it’s likelihood of irritating the skin is lower. If you don’t want fragrance, you have to expect and deal with a formula that isn’t going to be olfactively pleasing. You can’t have it both ways.Personally, I have been using this in place of the very expensive salicylic oil from Sunday Riley and so far, so good. I haven’t had any issues with it yet and I think it’s similar in its effectiveness. Make sure this product is for YOUR skin type!
