Love the simplicity of this brands design! Looks stunning on my skincare shelf & while not the point of the product it’s a bonus for sure. This cream was rich without feeling greasy or suffocating. Love the ingredients for an overnight treatment. My skin has experienced no irritation or issues with this cream so far. I know it takes a few weeks of consistent use to see results but my immediate impression is good! Skin looks soft, bright & less red in the morning. It’s not greasy so putting this on an hour before bed means my pillow case & sheets don’t suffer for it. I wasn’t sure what to expect but I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoy this cream so far! I’ve tried tons of skincare & celebrity skincare usually doesn’t excite me, but I’m glad I got to try this out. A nice cream!
