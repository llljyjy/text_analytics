First impression is how I love the way it absorbs quickly to the skin. It does not have a scent. It is also very lightweight and does not feel greasy. I think it works to smooth the skin very well. I think it also helps with fine lines and pores better than expected. I havenâ€™t seen it help with puffiness but shall continue to use and see. Absorbs quickly and feels great
