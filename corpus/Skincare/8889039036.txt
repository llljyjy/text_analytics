I really enjoyed this eye cream. It helped the area around my eyes feel more supple and hydrated my skin very well. This eye cream uses Sigesbecia Extract which is a powerful procollagen extract, prized for helping skin maintain its natural density. Hyaluronic acid plumps skin with hydration, helping it look and feel better instantly. The cream has a nice light whipped feeling to it. It has a slight fragrance but not overwhelming. Would definitely recommend. @Clinique #CliniqueSmartEye @influenster #influenster @CliniqueVoxBox #complimentary Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting
