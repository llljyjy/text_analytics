This may be my favorite eye cream that I have used, and I’ve been thru many. The gel cream texture goes on very smooth and feels very luxurious and hydrating. I am 56 years old, so I love the anti-aging ingredients and the collagen, peptide and niacinamide. I also love that it targets all areas of the eye from under-eye to lid to brow bone. I will definitely buy this eye cream again! It’s a keeper! Great Eye Cream!
