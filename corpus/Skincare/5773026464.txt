I have tried many self tanners and most have left me looking like Tom Hanks in the 2004 movie Christmas with the Kranks until I came finally tried Isle of Paradise. The tanning water works absolutely wonders BUT it doesnâ€™t give me the hydration the oil mist provides. Considering it has more hydrating agents and is oil based, I selected a shade darker than what I would normally go for to have that same color the medium tanning water would give. The oil mist is not for beginners as it can be messy and messy often equals to an uneven tan. It can easily grasp onto drier areas as well therefore avoiding knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, hands and feet until the very end with leftovers from the mit is key. Not for beginners
