My skin LOVES this moisturizer. It’s a thick consistency right out of the jar but does not feel thick on your skin. It absorbs really well and a thin layer goes a long way. The only drawback is the scent and the price. It smells strongly like real honey when you apply it to your skin but it does fade. It is worth tolerating the scent while you’re applying it. My skin’s moisture barrier is loving this paired with oil. The spatula is magnetic and sticks to the top of the cap. Amazing packaging for an amazing product. nan
