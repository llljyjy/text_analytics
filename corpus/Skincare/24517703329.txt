It’s a little heavier than YTTP’s Superfood Moisturizer and I felt that it left my face oiler in comparison as well. Because of that, I started only using it at night and then reduced my use even further to just around my eyes and neck. After a couple of weeks of use, I did see an improvement in some of the finer lines, but obviously nothing drastic considering how short of a time I’ve been using this. I’m such a big fan of their superfood moisturizer so just in comparison to that, I can’t see myself getting the full sized product as this doesn’t provide as much benefit to me personally. nan
