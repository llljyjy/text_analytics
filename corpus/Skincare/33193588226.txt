I love the glow recipe sunscreen, it the last step in my skincare routine and it literally is the cherry on the cake I’ve been looking for. As a blak woman, finding a sunscreen that doesn’t leave residue or a whitish or grayish cast can be hard. The glow recipe has SPF50 was very moisturizing and leaves the skin glow. It doesn’t have a smell that would irritate the skin and it glides on very easy. 10/10 would recommend. Darkskin friendly
