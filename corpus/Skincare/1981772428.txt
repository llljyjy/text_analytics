After living in Colorado a few years, I developed deep persistent neck acne as an adult. I had never had acne that wouldn’t go away like this. I started thinking it was hormonal or age related because nothing was working. Fast forward, I move to SF and live close to a Sephora and stop in from time to time to look around and try samples. I asked one of the employees for things to try for this problem and I got this mask. I tried it that night, and I am telling you my neck started looking clearer by the next day! I also used a physical exfoliator when I showered. I went and bought the full size and used the mask several times during the next week, and my acne on my neck finally cleared. It felt like a miracle!  Since then I use it from time to time. I think it still helps me keep my skin clearer, but since I don’t have the persistent acne anymore, I can’t notice a big difference. However I know what happened back then, so this is holy grail for me! HG product
