I can’t even explain how much I love this mask. I was looking for a clay mask that would pull gunk out of my pores but without being so drying like most clay masks are. This one is super creamy and actually feels very hydrating even with the charcoal. I love applying it with a mask spatula so I don’t waste any on my fingers, and it makes it easier to burst the charcoal beads into your skin. It’s so fun to apply and feels really cooling and nice. I will definitely be repurchasing once I go through this tub! Hydrating charcoal mask
