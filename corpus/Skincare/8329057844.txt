I just love this stuff. A must for daily routine. Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth with a beautiful Dewey finish.  The added hyaluronic acid helps keep skin moisturized.  It is creamy and blends well. Held up throughout the day. Applied before sun exposure, I didnâ€™t have any problems with my skin getting pink or burned. I also had no issues with skin sensitivity or blackheads/pimples while using this product. nan
