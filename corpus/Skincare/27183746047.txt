so far I am loving it. I got a sample with my points and used it before applying any makeup and felt so good on my face so I bought some. so far this has been the only cream that does not make me break out. little goes a long way. had a slight fragrance that kind of reminds me on sunscreen. very hydrating and leaves you with a nice glow. hydrating leaving with a nice glow
