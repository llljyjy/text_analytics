I have never used a retinal product before and this had to be careful. I definitely saw the transformation in my skin after my first use. I had a few bumps on my skin and they lessened after use and I also notice brighter skin. I think youth to the people is great with brightening products and I definitely see the difference. I do think the price was a bit high for me and I wouldn’t say it’s essential to my skin care routine but definitely does what it says and if your skin needs it I would recommend. Does what it says!
