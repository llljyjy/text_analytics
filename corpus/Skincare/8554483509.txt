This serum keeps my skin nice and plump.  I feel like my skin looks a bit more hydrated and glowy after applying.  The packaging is so nice and luxe.  The seamless pump works really well.  I canâ€™t really speak on the anti-aging benefits. I think it might be a little o erpriced for what it is. Pricy but Luxe
