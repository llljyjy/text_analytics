I’ve been using this cleanser for 2 years now and I used to love this product but the past couple of times that I have purchased this cleanser I’ve noticed the formula has changed. It smells very fishy for some odd reason and it doesn’t work on my skin like it did before. I will not purchase this product again. nan
