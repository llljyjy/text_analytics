Received a free sample from Butterfly to try.  This is the time I’ve used any Clarins product, so far it’s good.  The sample package is neatly packages and broken out by day for a week’s use.  I would but this sample to take on a week’s trip instead of bringing the full size bottle. The liquid had a nice scent and was very easy to use and put on my skin.  It was absorbed instantly and didn’t leave any grease spots.  I wish I had more of the product for longer use for more visible results.  I found 7 days was a bit too short Clarins serum
