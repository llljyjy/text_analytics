Milky color, fresh texture. Absorbs into skin like water, but does leave a slight tightening sensation after absorption. Good ingredients, but not sure if itâ€™s enough to justify the price point. $80 is a bit much considering other products with similar if not the same ingredients go for much less. The niacinamide in this has evened out my skin texture and the hyaluronic acid has added plumpness and moisture. The green tea ingredient is great for its antioxidant properties. Overall, great product but the cost is much higher than similar competitors. Good product, price point too high
