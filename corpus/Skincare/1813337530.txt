This foaming cleanser works really well. My skin felt clean but never dried out. And a little goes a long way so I can see this bottle lasting for a good while. I like the light mousse consistency and the thick foamy lather it produces. One word of warning, this product has a heavy fragrance. It smells like floral perfume. And the scent lingers after you rinse it. So if you are sensitive to fragrance, maybe pass on this. It doesn’t bother me, but I know it can be an issue for others so that’s why I docked it one star. I received this for free for review purposes. All opinions are my own. Excellent cleanser. But smells like perfume.
