I rarely write reviews but had to make sure I wrote one for this product. I struggle with hormonal acne and my breakouts get pretty bad around my time of the month. I have tried many many things to help clear my breakouts and nothing has worked better than this. I originally bought just the sample 5 pack to see if it would help clear some of the pimples I had on my jawline. However, after just 5 days I saw a major improvement in my skin and decided this was going to be a necessity in my skincare routine. I didn’t tell anyone I was using it and have already had so many people tell me they saw an improvement in my skin. I have already started recommending it to my mom and my friends. The price is very high but I promise the results are worth it. If you aren’t sure just buy the 5 pack and trust me you will see what I am talking about. nan
