Hesitant to tell people about these because they’re just that good. I’m a skincare snob and have used everything under the sun including Peter Thomas Roth (cult favorite) eye patches and these take the cake. Hydrating, stay in place and super cheap! Please never stop selling these. Win win win. suspiciously good
