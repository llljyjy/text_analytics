This is my first Charlotte Tilbury product and I am absolutely obsessed. This serum feels milky and soft and has barely any scent to it, which I love. It applies smoothly to my skin and doesn’t leave any sticky or tacky feeling like some serums. I’ve been using for about 10 days and I’ve already noticed some discoloration on my chin from former pimples starting to fade. I’m also noticing my fine lines disappearing, my skin looking more supple and an overall glow. My aunt actually commented yesterday at a family bbq how good my skin looks! Love!
