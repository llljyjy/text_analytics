I am a lip balm fiend as I have a picking/biting habit that leaves my lips a wreck when going through one of my moments. I bought this on a whim last summer because of the smell and just because I’m always looking for the next best thing. While it smells nice I don’t feel like it soaks in and lasts as good as other products I’ve tried. If you’re looking for a sort of moisturizing shine it definitely hits the mark, but for repair and deep hydration go try the Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm I’ve been using it for 8 years and no matter what else I try it cannot be beat. nan
