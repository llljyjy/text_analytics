This serum works very well for me. It’s the 3rd time using it and i notice my skin gets less tight when i don’t use it. I also like to mix it into my cocktail for microneedling. When applying it the watery texture turns slightly tacky when it starts to dry and absorb, almost resulting in a coup d’éclat effect once dry. Firms skin
