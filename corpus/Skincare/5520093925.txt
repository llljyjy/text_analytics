I was looking for a skin cream but didn’t know what to buy because there are so many different brands out there. My skin is a little dry but I also am acne prone. I have had issues in the past with products that were very moisturizing but made my acne worse. I loved that this cream moisturized but didn’t make my acne worse. The consistency is very thick and creamy which I liked. The only reason why I didn’t give this 5 stars is because it claims to be for day & night but I didn’t like how it made my foundation look patchy. However, I do use this in the morning if I am going without makeup. I would recommend this as a night time face cream but not as a morning time one unless you don’t wear makeup. The plus side to using this in your morning routine is that it has sunscreen in it. Better for night time
