Used for my first time trying dermaplaning and I was shocked how much fine hair it removed. I’ve been using 1-2 times per week and it’s now more noticeable how much dry skin this removes as well. I only do this after a hot shower, in front of a 10x magnify mirror, and follow with my skincare routine. My hairs are not coming in any darker and I wish I had started using these a long time ago. Totally impressed with how smooth my liquid foundation applies now. I'll buy again
