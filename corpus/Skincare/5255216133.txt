I got this as a sample, and I am so obsessed with it, I’m buying the full size. I use it at night, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin is so soft and smooth. I really feel like it’s helping restore my skin barrier after just three uses. My skin is sensitive and acne prone and I haven’t experienced any issues yet. Highly recommend if you are prone to dry skin or have issues with your skin barrier! nan
