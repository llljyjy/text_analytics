I really have enjoyed this GLO Lit whitening kit. It has everything you need in the kit to get started. I have had issues in the past with others that make my teeth and gums hurt after or during using. With GLO kit I had zero issues with sensitivity or pain afterwards. This has brightened up my smile so much . It is easy to use and stays in place very well . The gel is thick not thin so that makes it stay on teeth easier to get them white. I am very pleased with my results . Easy to use
