Wow! This helped speed up the process of fading my acne scars! I tend to get red acne scars around my check area (some that have taken ~2.5 years to completely fade). And I got some new acne scars recently and was bummed because I just cleared my skin. But this product has sped up the process so much! The scars are still there after ~2 months, but are sooo much lighter!! With consistent use this product can be a holy grail! nan
