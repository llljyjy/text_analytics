As I age I’m always looking for new products to combat aging skin. I was so glad to find it confidence in a cream! It’s for all skin types and is so incredibly moisturizing. A tiny bit goes a long long way. And I can tell a big difference in my skin in just a short amount of time. My fine lines are lighter and my skin is so dewy and soft. I’ll be using this for a long time Very moisturizing
