I’ve been a Glow Recipe customer for years, before they pivoted to making their own products. This is the first dud for me. I don’t like the bubblegum/guava smell and I didn’t see any results from using it. Also, the packaging is terrible--there is still a lot of product left that the pump can’t reach. Unacceptable for an expensive item. nan
