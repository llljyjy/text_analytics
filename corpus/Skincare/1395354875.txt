I’ve been using this for about a month. I noticed improvement in my skin’s texture within the first week. My skin is definitely brighter and I’m having fewer breakouts, a few pimples but no deep or cystic acne—even through my period which is a miracle. After washing my face, I use 1-hydrating toner, 2-this product, 3-hylauronic acid serum, 4-moisturizer (PM routine). nan
