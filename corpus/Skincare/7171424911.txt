I used this lotion on my face and my hands.This lotion makes my skin so soft. The lotion sinks right in, and doesn’t feel sticky or leave oily residue. It does have a faint, plant smell that I’m not too keen on, but it’s worth it for the silky skin. It also doesn’t flair up my sensitive skin, which is awesome! I notice I don’t have to reapply my lotion over and over since my skin seems to retain it’s moisture when I use this stuff. All in all, I really like it! So soft, but a little smelly
