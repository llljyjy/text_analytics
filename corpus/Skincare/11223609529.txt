I really like this facial scrub. It leaves my skin soft and clean without irritating it as other scrub formulas have. I donâ€™t use it too often but a dime size strategically applied on different parts of my face and a gentle massage work wonders. I have seen in my 10x mirror that it helps clear clogged pores and the texture of my skin feels improved after using it and following it with moisturizer. I recommend it and will definitely buy it again. Improves skin texture
