Okay so I got this product bc I was on the hunt for a new hyaluronic acid serum and this was super affordable and did not disappoint. I absolutely love the feel of it and instantly my skin was feeling so plump and hydrated . I paired this serum with the  niacinamide serum and boy the combo of those 2 serums is LIFE. Trying out a new skincare routine and this one is my new . My skin feels happy LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!
