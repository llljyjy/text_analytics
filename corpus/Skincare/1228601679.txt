This serum has a great texture & one pump of product enough application for your face & neck! It also had a really nice smoothing effect. However, I noticed that it caused a bit of irritation to my sensitive skin. I may continue to ONLY use it on my neck & chest & see what happens. Not Horrible. Not the Best
