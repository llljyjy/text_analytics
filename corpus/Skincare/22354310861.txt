Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum is a transformative eye cream. Everything about this product is new & different from other eye creams I’ve used before. The tube has a round metal applicator that is different than anything I’ve ever used before. It stays cold to the touch and I think it helps the cream absorb into my skin better. The formula of the eye cream is what I would expect from Dior. It’s thick and luxurious. It has the classic scent that can be overwhelming if you aren’t expecting it. I love it, however. It’s been in all the Dior products I’ve used and now I feel like it’s a sign of luxury. I can really tell a significant improvement in the fine lines and dark circles around my eyes and I’ve only been using it a few days. I will continue using this eye cream and will purchase more when it runs out. If you are looking for an innovative eye cream with dramatic results the Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum is for you! Dior never disappoints!
