bought this product based on all the amazing reviews.. but it just doesn’t stand out to me. It feels more like a light moisturizer than anything. I was looking into something to help out my skin texture/dryness and thought wow a 2 in 1 should be amazing. But unfortunately it just wasn’t it for me. I suffer from acne scars, dryness, and skin texture and this product didn’t help me. I think if you have dry clear skin then this product is for you, it just moisturizes and does not TREAT anything a toner would normally do. I gave it time and have used it religiously everyday, i’m about half way through the bottle and can’t see a difference in my skin like others have claimed in the reviews... I believed the hype, but it just wasn't it....
