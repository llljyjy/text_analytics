I received this Caudalie resveratrol lift firming cashmere moisturizer #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. I have used this for a couple weeks now once a day in combination with the instant firming serum and I love almost everything about this regiment. The one con I have listed is that I did experience pilling after applying the moisturizer over the serum. I admittedly do probably use an excessive amount of product, but it was worth noting. Aside from that, I love the light scent of this super hydrating moisturizer that actually DOES make my skin feel like cashmere, and I love that even the directions for use include the decollete which has been an area of major concern for me lately. This regiment has altogether left me with firmer, brighter, plumper, and all around healthier looking and feeling skin. Great Light moisturizer
