This is my new everyday holygrail moisturizer. Its not sticky and absorbs into the skin moments after you apply it. I love how it does NOT make your face feel oily but is actually absorbed into the skin. After applying my skin looks bright and fresh. This is also great to apply before make up. I highly recommend. My New Favorite Moisturizer!
