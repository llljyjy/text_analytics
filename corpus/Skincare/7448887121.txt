This is a great product if you want to introduce ceramides into your routine like I did. It’s definitely a thicker moisturizer but dries to something lightweight. I’d recommend if you’re feeling particularly dry or are about to travel. The only downside is the smell. The cream itself smells super funny at first but it fades. I was honestly worried my had soured somehow but upon reading other reviews, that’s just the product. Great for dry skin, but funky smell
