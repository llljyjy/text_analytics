I really like that you can mix this in with another product like moisturizer or serum to sort of customize your ingredients. It’s not a very viscous liquid, so I like mixing it to make application easier too. I find that this booster does help my skin look a bit more evenly toned and helps with dryness. When first adding this to my routine, it seemed to cause some blemishes, which I don’t typically deal with on a regular basis. After my skin adjusted, I didn’t see so much of the acne and began to see some slight positive changes. nan
