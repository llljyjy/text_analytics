I finally found something for my suspect anwjairve and acne prone skin. I have tried it ALL. I require something fragrance free, with lots of moisture for my dryness, but am prone to acne and eczema flares on my face. Almost finished my first bottle and I will be repurchasing. I had no issues with acne or eczema flares so far. I use AM and PM but it is thick, so may not be a good day cream for everyone. nan
