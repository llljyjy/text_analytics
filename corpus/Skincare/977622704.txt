I really liked this product I got to try as a #freeproduct from Topbox.   I love serums to begin with and this serum has a great texture that was absorbed by my skin and plumped it up and made those annoying wrinkles that I have starting less noticeable.  No scent is a bonus.  No irritation.  I saw great results after a couple days use.    I would recommend this serum A staple in your antiaging skin Routine!
