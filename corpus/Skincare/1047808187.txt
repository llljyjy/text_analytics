I am such a fan of Clinique moisturizer and have been for years. I was so excited to give this product a try and am in love! It is so hydrating and plumping and it feels like silk going on. My skin feels amazing after using it. I canâ€™t speak to wrinkle correcting since I had a small container but it is a wonderful moisturizer for my combo/sensitive skin. I received this sample product free from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. A new staple!
