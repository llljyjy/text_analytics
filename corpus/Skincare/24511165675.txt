I love this sunscreen! First time using a mineral sunscreen ‘cause  I always thought that they’re sticky, heavy and leave an awful white cast but this one IS NOT!!! Omg, this sunscreen it’s so light, leaves an amazing glowy skin, blends really well and it’s not sticky at all. Also I can wear my makeup over it and it sits amazing. Please, make yourself a favor and buy this. You need this!
