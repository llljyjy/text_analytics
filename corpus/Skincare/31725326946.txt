I’m super happy with my Dermaflash! I’ve tried so many different ways to get rid of the stache hair on my upper lip and this is by far my favorite! I was nervous to try dermaplaning at home, but it was so incredibly easy and you can literally see the hair coming right off. The best part is there is no way to mess it up and it’s totally pain-free. I love the results. The device itself is cute, sleek and easy to store & charge. I don’t know why I had waited so long to get one! Simplest pain-free way to remove hair & dead skin
