Peter Thomas Roth gifted me a complimentary sample of their PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment in exchange for my honest review. This treatment has all the elements of a serum in a cream texture. It’s pale yellow and of medium thickness. It has a nearly undetectable fragrance, spreads easily, and dries down quickly with minimal silicone slickness once it does. It’s extremely gentle, and I’ve experienced no irritation. So far, what I like and notice most is the smoothing effect. My skin feels softer, and while I wondered if it was just the silicone, which, I feel, can be a bit of a cheat, my skin is actually smoother even after I’ve washed it off. I’m also noticing much faster healing of new and old wounds.I realize decreasing my hyperpigmentation will take a minute, so I can’t fully speak to that yet, but it feels promising, and I’ll one hundred percent continue to use this treatment. Gentlest retinoid I’ve used…
