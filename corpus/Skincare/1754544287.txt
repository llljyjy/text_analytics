I received a sample of Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Balm. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is a nice, calming smell, however, itâ€™s not as subtle as I would prefer. It seemed to linger for a little bit after applying. The balm is smooth and easily absorbed. It does seem to leave my skin a little oily, but it does a nice job keeping my skin moisturized.
