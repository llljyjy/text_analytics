I received a sample of this to try though Influenster for my honest opinion. I used this product for a month and while I donâ€™t have many eye area wrinkles this cream was very nice. It made my under eye area very soft and hydrated. It is a nice creamy texture and did not have any fragrance and did not irritate my sensitive skin. Lightweight cream
