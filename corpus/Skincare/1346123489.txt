Just got this today. I splashed some water on my face and used just on my nose. It got so much gunk from my pores! I can’t wait to use with some steam and proper prep! The photo really shows the gunk because my pores were filled with spray tan (among other things). I haven’t tried it yet for infusing serum, but I definitely recommend this for extractions. nan
