I truly donâ€™t understand how someone could like this product. I received a sample with my order and the product was separated in the tube, weird but I mixed together and applied. It gives zero moisture but leaves a greasy cast on your face, not in a natural glow kind of way. Also, it did not work with makeup. I buy lots of moisturizers from sulwhasoo, tatcha, skinfix. All are much better. nan
