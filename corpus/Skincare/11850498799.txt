I received this product as part of a free sample program and I was surprised with how well it works. I am always skeptical about products like this, but I had immediate results. I have normal/dry skin and cleansers typically dry my skin out, but this left my skin feeling smooth. The only complaint I have is about the smell of the wet applicatorâ€”smells like burning chemicals. Silky Smooth Skin
