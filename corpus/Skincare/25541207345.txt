This stuff has always been amazing as it’s been around for the last 10 years. The first formula was awesome but they decided to revamp it and make it that much better! They added six new peptides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and commiphora. The product helps protect the barrier and minimize any irritants, if your skin is missing that youthful glow and bounce this would be for you. It has the lightest thirst quenching gel texture that’s extremely light and refreshing. There are so many positive aspects the list could go on, so if your thinking about getting it just take the plunge you wont be disappointed. nan
