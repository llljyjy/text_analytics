This mask is very “mom on the go” friendly. It only requires a thin layer, five minutes, and it says you can use it a.m. or p.m.  However I must note that this does have AHA in it. This makes your skin more sensitive to the sun (there is a written warning  on the box but not on the jar itself). I personally do my masks at night so this is never an issue for me, but I wanted to note it nonetheless. The additional factor of it being only a five minute mask is an extreme lifesaver to my busy schedule. The smell is pleasant and not overly overpowering. It leaves my skin very much “polished” soft, smooth, without any tingling/burning. It is very gentle. nan
