I liked this product when I first bought it, I was only using it once in a while if I wanted my makeup to look really nice. It does go on silky smooth, and makeup did go on nicely over top of it, but once I started using it every day I started breaking out all over. My skin did not like this product for every day use. Holy breakouts
