This moisturizer is amazing. I have dry skin in the winter and this just hydrates my skin nicely without leaving it oily or greasy. I wear makeup over it and still not oily. I have super sensitive skin and it doesn’t break me out. Has a nice smell to it but it isn’t over powering. Great winter moisturizer
