The INNBEAUTY Project Bright & Tight Eye Cream has been amazing for my under-eyes. I typically do not care for most eye creams but this one impressed me immediately. This eye cream is very light and hydrating, and absorbs into your skin. The texture feels smooth on my fingers and it glides easily on my skin. It also plays very well under makeup (allow time to dry). I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have noticed improvements in my dark circles. This product does help to give your under eyes a natural glow. Looking forward to seeing how it continues to improve my under eyes marks and fine lines. Definitely recommend this eye cream! New favorite eye cream!
