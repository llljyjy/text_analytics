If I try to use this alone, my face is still dry, I get that tight feeling on my skin, almost as if i used nothing. Even when I use it with my face lotion it really adds nothing. I’ve been using it consistently for months and my dark spots have not even budged. This literally did absolutely nothing... Also, the lid broke a few days after I got it and won’t screw on for some reason? The smell is also really strong, kind of a shock if you’re used to unscented products. I really wanted this to be good :( nan
