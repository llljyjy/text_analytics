I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. From the moment I applied Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyluronic Acid to my face, my skin instantaneously absorbed every amount as if it were the Sahara, never receiving a drop of rain. The rich, dense cream, with slight floral scent, encased in an exquisite glass jar with shiny rose gold lid- is pure luxury. A few minutes after applying using the “Tilbury Tapping Technique“ my face felt plump and hydrated. My face felt like it had received the nourishment it had been missing for such a long time. As I continued to use Magic Cream on a daily basis, I developed a glow unlike I’ve ever had before. My primer and foundation application went on smoother and I required much less. My skin tone appeared even and my overall appearance just looked brighter and healthier; I even received complements. Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream is a Miracle Cream for me. It took my dull and tired appearance to radiant and glowing. I truly feel like a celebrity, and for that- I am grateful. Magic Miracle
