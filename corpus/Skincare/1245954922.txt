I do really like this cleanser. Love the microbeads that  do a good job exfoliating my skin because afterwards my skin feels so soft and nice. Not to harsh where my skin ends up red though. The smell is a very pleasant citrusy scent. I’m not sure if I’d buy again at this price- I’ll have to see how long this tube lasts. Works Great!
