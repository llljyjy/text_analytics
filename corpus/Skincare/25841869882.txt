I’ve used this cream for a couple months.  I kept getting swelling, itchy, dryness, and puffiness above my eye and would have to use hydrocortisone to help. That would work but then I forget not to put it over my eye and the same would happen again. I kept using it because it actually helped my under eye brighten up, smoothing out fine lines, and with swelling. I used it again last night over my eyes and woke up this morning finally realizing that it’s this cream that’s doing my upper eyes damage.  I don’t have sensitive skin but the eyes are sensitive in general.  I don’t recommend this cream for all around the eye. For $50 I expect it to moisturize not dry me out and make me look older. If I would’ve noticed sooner. I would’ve asked for a refund. DON’T BUY THIS. I read some of the reviews this morning and saw pictures of the same situation on others.  I’m definitely not the only one. Creates more dryness, puffiness, and redness
