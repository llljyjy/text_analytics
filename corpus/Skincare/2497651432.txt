I never review, but I received this in my boxycharm and I didn’t really think I’d love it as much as I do. I use it before my make up because I like a smooth base instead of tacky, and it’s amazing. It truly hydrates my skin and the glow from my serums still shines through. Definitely worth it. Awesome!
