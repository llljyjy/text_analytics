It has:-dewy, silky finish without making you look like you’ve dabbed your face with a slice of gas station pizza.-natural look, smooths skin-no white cast-lightweight-doesn’t clog pores (sometimes I think breathing clogs my pores, trust me on this one)-and it’s cruelty free! This spf ticks all my boxes. A bit pricey, but definitely worth your while. a spf you’ll actually WANT to use!
