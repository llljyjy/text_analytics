i’ve been using this for a little over a month now and i’ve seen a HUGE improvement in stubborn acne scars. i really don’t think the smell is that bad, definitely a little odd but it really doesn’t bother me that much. i will note i went on vacation for a few days and forgot it at home and i saw the scars coming back so you have to be VERY consistent with it. nan
