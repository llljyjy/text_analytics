I just used this powder to paste exfoliant and already my skin looks brighter. I like the smell of it and the feel of it. My only issue might be that it’s a foaming exfoiliant and I think my dry skin won’t be able to handle it everyday. Maybe once every 3 days. Will be testing out this 7 day pack that was gifted by Demalogica Sampling across 21 days with plenty of mosturizer, and if my skin looks and feels great I’ll by some more! :) nan
