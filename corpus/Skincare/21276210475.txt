This product is one of my ride or dies. After a couple days of use my skin was soft and the redness in the skin was significantly reduced. When I have a bad couple weeks of breakouts, this serum is super soothing. This is great for combo skin like mine, but I could also see this being great for dry or oily skin. My Ride or Die
