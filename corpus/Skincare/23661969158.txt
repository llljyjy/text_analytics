This could be a great moisturizer but I think maybe myself and others were sent a bad batch. I love how thick and moisturizing it was but then I noticed if I didn’t use it my skin would get flaky which it wasn’t before. I absolutely cannot get over the scent. It smells like old musty socks and there were little hairs in it. Maybe there was a bad quality issue I’m not too sure. I wish this was a hit but it’s not for me. nan
