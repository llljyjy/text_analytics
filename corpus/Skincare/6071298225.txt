This is a nice product but would only recommend for VERY OILY skin. If your combo i would not recommend because it is not hydrating enough. My skin feels tight and dry. Not matter how many layers I put on. Disappointed. I found out really how dry it was after the first week of trying this out with the standard one layer and tried to out on makeup and my skin was just awfully dry. The texture and look of makeup was just horrendous. Even now trying to finish the tub, putting on multiple layers my skin still feel tight! It smells great, cool to the touch, and isn’t sensitizing so it does have that going for it. Doesn’t clog the pores. I really wanted to like this but have now bought the other moisturizer apparently for dry skin albeit the mini version due to this experience. nan
