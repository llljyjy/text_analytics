So I think I love this. I have combo skin. Most regular moisturizers makes me greasy. I generally stick with gel moisturizer to avoid the greasy feeling, but feel like they don’t soak in. My skin looks dull. This however, soaks in, gives a little glow, and makes my face feel soft and moisturized without creating an oil slick. I’m kinda in love with this
