I was weary of buying this because of all the negative reviews, but I actually really like it and will be buying it again. It isn’t some miracle cream that will get rid of your blackheads after the first use, but if you use according the directions you will see a difference. After using it morning and night for several days, I could see my blackheads fading and my pores getting smaller. It also makes my skin super soft! I honestly wish I could buy this as an exfoliate because of how soft it makes My skin. I also love the warming sensation but wish it lasted longer. The only thing I don’t particularly love is the bumpy applicator, I found the product mostly gets stuck and it’s more effective to use my fingers. nan
