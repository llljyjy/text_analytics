I received this as a free to test, but honestly i would still repurchase this product. Its easy to use and put on no mixing whatsoever as some other brand i tried. I like the texture and how moist the mask feels when putting on. I left it for 10-15 min and after washing off my face does not feels dry at all nice mate finish. I love this product Moisturizing, no drying
