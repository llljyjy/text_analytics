This is a product I didnâ€™t know I needed until I tried it. First off, the packaging is gorgeous and looks great on my vanity. As for the product itself, it is so smooth and cooling. After I cleansed and toned, I put a few drops on my palms and apply to my face. It absorbs right away and makes my skin instantly hydrated. Will keep using, especially on hot summer days or when my skin feels a little more dry than normal.  I received this complimentary from Laneige. So hydrating!
