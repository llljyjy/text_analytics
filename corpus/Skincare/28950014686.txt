I wasgifted this Bearberry & Vitamin C Glow Serum from Alpyn Beauty in exchange for my honest review, and so far I really like this serum! It immediately gives my skin a healthy glow, and I don’t even need to wear makeup to get that dewy look! I feel like it’s been making a difference so far in fading a few of the dark spots I had recently developed on my skin from old acne/blemishes; they’ve definitely lightened up a bit! I especially like that this serum feels lightweight on the skin and isn’t sticky! I’m very excited to see how this serum works on my dark spots overlong-termusage! nan
