This stuff is amazing! I am guilty of biting my lips when I am working so they’re always dry and sore. This stuff has healed them and conditioned them so well!! It has a nice light cherry scent that isn’t overpowering and this is not sticky at all. I also noticed that it lasts a while too, compared to other lip glosses that don’t. I will always have one on hand. It healed my lips!!
