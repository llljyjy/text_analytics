I have very fair skin which turns orange very easy from makeup foundation and tanning products. I live in Florida where everybody is tan. I tried Isle Of Paradise and Iâ€™m extremely pleased with it. No orange color at all and very natural looking tan like I get from the sun but no harmful rays! AMAZING!!!
