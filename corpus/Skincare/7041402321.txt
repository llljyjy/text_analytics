This product is a cushiony, deep replenishing eye cream with strengthening ceramides and omega-rich plant oils that gives you long-lasting moisture.  It restores elasticity, and soothes signs of fatigue for a refreshed, well-rested look.  It’s a thick but not thick cream if that makes sense.  Application is easy.   I would definitely recommend to family and friends as this product is a game changer to the eyes.  Run don’t walk and pick up this product at your local beauty store. Ceramighty AF Eye Balm
