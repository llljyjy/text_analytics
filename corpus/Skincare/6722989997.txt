I’ve used this product for quite some time now (about 3 years), especially during the summer months when I no longer need a heavy occlusive moisturizer. I work outside in the summer so i tend to grab a more lightweight moisturizer that won’t interfere with sunblock. The gel consistency is perfect for summer months in that it doesn’t sit heavy on the skin when I leave the house in the mornings and is super fast absorbed into the skin! You’re left with plumped up skin without the greasiness of a heavy moisturizer. My foundation also sits well on top of it without primer which is always an added bonus! Definitely recommend trying it out for yourself if you’re in need of a more lightweight, barely there feeling moisturizer (that still packs in a punch)! Great summer moisturizer!
