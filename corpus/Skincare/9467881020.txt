I received this product complementary for testing. As this is a vitamin c serum with oil, this is a really great product for those with dry skin. If you trend towards oily or even normal, you may need to blot later. A little goes a very long way! I keep this product in my beauty fridge for the extra cooling effect. I like to use a tinted moisturizer on top for a natural glowy look. If you are acne-prone, this does have tocopherol (vitamin e) which may clog pores. Glowy
