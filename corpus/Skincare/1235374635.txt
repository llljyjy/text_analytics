I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser! The citrus scent is really nice. There are exfoliating beads to get rid of the dead dry skin. It leaves my face feeling clean and not too tight. I have acne prone skin and this hasn’t made me break out. I do alternate this with a cleanser that has salicylic acid and that’s been working perfectly.  I was happy to receive this to try from Influenster nice cleanser
