I’ve had dry lips all my life, even for someone who is VERY hydrated. My boyfriend use to make fun of my lips being so crackled all the time until I got this mask. I use it before bed after my night routine and I don’t remember having dry lips since then. If you’re looking for a balm this isn’t for you it’s a MASK so it’s a little thicker than a balm. But it works wonders, I asked my bf when the last time he commented about my dry lips and he shockingly realized he’s stopped because I no longer have that problem. NEW HOLY GRAIL! No More Chapped Lips
