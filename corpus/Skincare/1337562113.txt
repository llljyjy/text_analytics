I waited the entire length of the campaign so I could really use these products a while to give an honest and fair assessment. I am always trying new facial regimens and was highly impressed by this line. The cream is a great lock in moisturizer that leaves your face feel luminous but not greasy.

I am definitely going to be repurchasing despite the high price tag because it is that well formulated! I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review My new go to routine
