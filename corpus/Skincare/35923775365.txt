I have used this eye cream most mornings and evenings for about 1 month and I can confidently say that it’s one of the best eye creams I have ever used!  My eye area feels deeply moisturized immediately upon application-No stinging or dry/tight sensation.  I’ve also noticed that my undereye area appears less puffy and generally lighter/brighter (buh-bye dark circles)!This cream goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly with absolutely no issues applying makeup over it.If you’re looking for an eye cream to help with puffiness and fine lines/wrinkles, give this one a shot.  I think you’ll agree that it deserves a spot in your daily beauty regimen. Newest addition to my beauty routine!
