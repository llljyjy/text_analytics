I used the whole bottle and didn’t see much change in my hyperpigmentation. It has a nice smell and goes on the skin nicely but it wasn’t worth the price in my opinion and I will not be repurchasing. I was using it daily for a while but by five-six weeks I wasn’t seeing much difference then I changed to the IT cosmetics dark spot serum ($35) and felt I had seen more change in just a couple weeks of using that instead. Went back to the GR one again to finish the bottle but will just be using the IT cosmetics one from now on. Can see this being more worth it if you have super sensitive skin but there are probably still cheaper alternatives for sensitive skin types. not worth it in my opinion
