Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. So for self care days which I have about 1-2 times a week I’ve been using this product, and I have to say it’s wonderful!!! Normally, my skin is very picky when it comes to new skincare products, however, this one surprised me! Giving that its infused with  Salicylic Acid, and Glycolic Acid its instantly took to my skin, after I take it off it has left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed like no other mask, I’ve every tried has! 10/10 definitely recommends EVERYTHING AND MORE FOR YOUR SKIN!
