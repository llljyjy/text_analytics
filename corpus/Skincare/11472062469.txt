I had high expectations from this I guess. It feels sticky and adds an oily shine post application. Doesnâ€™t fare well under makeup either. I was hoping it will be as light weight as the silk primer, but no, the consistency is simply runny. Tatcha has some great products out there, but this is just average at best. Not worth the price tag for the amount. Just okay
