this is too expensive considering it did not act as a chapstick or lip balm. if you are looking for a nice lip gloss that’s not too sticky then you will love this. but that’s not what I wanted it for. it says it’s supposed to be like a lip balm and it’s not. my favorite is too faced peaches lip balm, sad they stopped making it. so now I’m on the search for something just as good and this is not it. nope
