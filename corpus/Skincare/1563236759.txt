My fave cleanser! I stumbled upon this cleanser when I was looking for something that would leave my face feeling soft and moisturized, instead of feeling tight and  red. With this coming from a clean brand, it makes it more all the worthwhile! A quarter size amount of cleanser is really all you need every morning and night. However, if youâ€™re wearing heavy make-up, you may want to apply the cleanser twice. So happy with this cleanser!
