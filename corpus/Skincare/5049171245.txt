I love niacinamide as a skincare ingredient, so I was really glad I got to try out this formulation. I’ll be using up the product I currently have and would consider repurchasing this again! I would say I only have one caution--if you overapply you might experience some dryness. I did experience a little dryness and flaking on the skin between my undereye and next to my nose. I used a bit less and added some extra moisture into my routine and it worked out, but that’s mostly user error. I believe you can apply this directly to clean skin or over moisturizer and overall, I do like the result. I do have combination skin and my cheeks tend to be my drier area and this product helps combat oiliness,  which I love Good, but can be drying
