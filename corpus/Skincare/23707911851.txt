I bought the trial size a few months ago and really loved it. I have extremely dry skin and need cleansers that don’t feel like they’re stripping my skin and this one does the job perfectly. My skin feels hydrated and refreshed and I feel like I have had less breakouts. Really excellent product. Also the smell doesn’t bother me, I actually kind of enjoy it. worth a try babes
