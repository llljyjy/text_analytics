Love multi use type products! This night face mask + day cream/primer fits the bill, however I prefer it as a night cream/mask over the day cream. The consistency is quite thick and although not greasy per say.. it does feel more mask like (ie. I’m aware I have product on my skin) but My God it’s so moisturizing!! I wake up, wash my face and I actually feel like I’m glowing/ my (combo) skin feels more hydrated and supple.  As a day cream/primer I did find it a little too heavy to wear under my makeup and found it made me look shiny. Very light citrusy smell, and absorbs well. I did feel like my face seems clearer and just more glowy too after consistent use over the week. I also love the compostable packaging - it looks expensive and yet is still environmentally friendly. Very cool. I’d buy this again. Prefer As a Night Cream - But Does The Job Well!
