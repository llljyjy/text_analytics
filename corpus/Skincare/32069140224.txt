The actual gloss is good. Love how moisturizing it is along with the light vanilla scent. However the packaging could use some work. Like others stated, there’s still plenty in the tube but it’s not coming out. Also the tip in a weird way lost its original texture. I would hope they look into making improvements in the immediate future. Nice gloss, needs work
