I have not used it for very long, mainly cause I’m nervous it will hurt my skin. I’m prone to having sensitivities. So what I’ve accomplished with it so far, hasn’t been much. Hasn’t brightened my dark spots too much. But I think over time because of my little use, it will brighten up. It is a bit expensive for something that you have to be very cautious in using, but I’d imagine that’s how it is with most products like this. nan
