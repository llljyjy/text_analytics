I wouldn’t recommend this for oily, combination or acne prone skin but maybe it would work on dry skin? I have combination skin and it just sat on top of my face and left it feeling super greasy. After a couple hours my face almost looked sweaty. Maybe this would work for dryer skin types so I’ll give it 3 stars. very heavy and greasy
