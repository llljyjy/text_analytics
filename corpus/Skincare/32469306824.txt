**I have received this product for free from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.**I would give 4.5 stars if I could. Only reason I am giving it 4 is because of the slight white cast after application. I love the oil free formula and it feels very lightweight. I put it on once for the whole day and didn’t burn at all….and i burn VERY easily. Would definitely recommend. Great Oil-free sunscreen!
