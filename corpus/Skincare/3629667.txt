I’ve been using the Retinol Serum for awhile now, (this is my 3rd tube), and it does take a while to see results. Having said that, I do note that this is a more mild dosing of Retinol and there are others out there that are stronger, but your skin may take a “hit“ in that it might become reddened or peel or sting/burn when the product is applied; which is why I prefer this type of retinol serum. It works on one’s skin without the discomfort associated with many retinoids out there. I also appreciate the price point of the Inkey List’s products, as you can literally build an entire skin care routine from the ground up, and include two to three serums and/or treatment items as well. You can’t say that with many brands out there with the same types of products and get the same type of results. I am often asked “What do you use on your skin?“ I usually answer “Oh I use a few things from different lines.“ because I do, but it’s the products that perform that you tend to not reveal that much, as you want to keep those to yourself!This is one of those products, as it does work and you can recommend it to others knowing that it actually does something for your skin. At least for me, I can say “Yes“ I benefit from this particular serum. If you’re new to retinoids this would be a good one to start off with, as it is gentle, and you wouldn’t have to worry about adverse affects on your skin. But patch testing is always a good idea. Give it a try, It works for me! Doesn't cause peeling or stinging when applied :)
