Hi, I’m Lara, and I’m a Skincare and Beauty Reviewer and Influencer on all platforms. I have tried many Kosas brand products, and I can honestly say that all of them have left me with incredible results to where other’s have actually asked what I’ve been using! Kosas is known for it’s eye catching, famous, Bubble Gum Pink and Orange Shebert packaging that look Gorgeous on your night stand, vanity or bathroom counter! The amount of product that the Spray delivers was perfect. It didn’t over saturate at all, and my skin soaked it up immediately! I have Sensitive Skin, so this was a test to see how the Ingredients such as Collagen, Hylauronicacid, Hibiscus Flower Extract, Probiotics, and Tri-Peptides would treat my Acne Prone skin. I must say that this convenient spray has now become best friend and a vital step in my Skincare Ritual! It’s perfect for those of us that are always on the Go! I experienced no irritation or redness at all, and I even used it on my teenage son who has my same skin type! We both were amazed at how Refreshing and Soothing it left us feeling. I believe that Kosas introducing a product that’s well known in Korea (Kbrands) and Japan is a HUGE step, allowing the general public to experience the benefits from the ingredients that I can now can not live without. I’m a huge Probiotics fan, as I’ve been using it topically and orally to decrease my Acne breakouts. The Plumpness, Hydrating and Soothing results are what have me hooked! I highly recommend this for all skin types, and I will be a forever fan. I will absolutely be repurchasing! Another Innovative, Must Have from Kosas
