This cleanser was included in my birthday gifted and I got Tatcha because Tatcha is more in the pricier side. When I first tried it, I was a little bit skeptical of the texture and how it foamed up. My skin is very dry and sensitive, so cleanser that foam up makes my skin feel tight and irritated. Yet, this rice wash did not do that. It was better than I expected and it is very efficient. I deal with dry spots around the side of my face and my current cleanser couldnâ€™t even clear up my dry spots but I used to this cleanser once and I noticed that it got rid of my dry spots immediately. I will definitely be buying the full size. nan
