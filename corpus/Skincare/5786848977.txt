I have been using Confidence in a Cream for just over two weeks. I have seen no visible reduction in fine lines or pores as of yet. As with most products, two weeks is not enough time for that to happen. However, I love the way the cream feels on my face. I use it both mornings and evenings and it causes no greasy feeling whatsoever. It also does not clog my pores. I am able to apply my makeup within a minute of using the product. My face retains moisture throughout the day instead of getting dry as it previously did. I would recommend the product and plan to update my review once I have used it for several months. So far, so good
