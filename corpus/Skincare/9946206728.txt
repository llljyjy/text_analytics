The old formula was 5 stars, but not this new one. The new formula is watery and much lighter in color. I find myself pumping more product at a time, which is not economical at this price. The bottom also keeps falling off the top, exposing the liquid inside to sunlight each time. Have I seen fewer or decreased results? Hard to say since it is the wintertime, and I like this product for my sun spots. But I don’t know if I’m going to stick around until summer to find out. I really wish that Drunk Elephant would provide the OPTION to mix or to receive it as it used to be. Please offer the old formula as an option
