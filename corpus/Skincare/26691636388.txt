I received this cream for free from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder in exchange for my review.I used this product for about a month before sharing my experience.It has almost no smell, which pleased me. For delicate skin around the eyes, the fewer irritants, the better.The cream has a gel and very delicate texture. It is homogeneous and spreads fairly quickly. Just a small amount of cream is enough to use.The product is absorbed quite quickly, at first the skin is a little shiny, but after a minute it is no longer visible. The cream does not leave a greasy film, the skin becomes very smooth and moisturized.The texture of my skin has clearly improved. It became slightly thicker and less like thin parchment. Visually, fine wrinkles look less deep, the skin has become smoother. The color of the skin around the eyes has also improved, small pigment spots have become almost invisible, and the eyes do not look as tired as before.As a result, I liked the cream, it coped well with the tasks set, gave the necessary hydration to delicate skin without excessive weighting, worked with the texture and color of the skin. nan
