Not for dry skin Patches onto texture not natural lookingConsistency is thick, hard to wash off Not moisturizing at all Appears like foundation or bb cream on skin as matte finishNot a huge difference on redness probably same result as bb cream or probably better off with bb cream since it won’t look white on dry patchesI’m sure for those who don’t have dry skin or rough texture and are probably super white it will appear great on Save money better off with bb cream
