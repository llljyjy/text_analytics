I thought this was going to be way too heavy and make me break out, I have dry - combo skin, my face is dry but my forehead and chin get oily and break out in this adult hormonal acne rage. But I gave it a go since I got it for free to try from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I found that it applies so nice when you have some moisture on your skin like a serum or your toner that way it smoothes on the skin easier. It smells nice, but not strong. I really like it, wish I had a bigger jar! Definitely will keep an eye out for a sale somewhere. Great moisturizer for any skin type.
