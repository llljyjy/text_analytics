I tested it for several weeks, and although my skin felt hydrated and dewy, this cream caused breakouts all over my face including painful below-the-surface blemishes. I have combination (closer to dry), sensitive, acne prone skin and I spent quite some time doing in-depth research about this cream. Not sure which ingredient is to blame, but please be careful with this product if your skin is acne prone I had high hopes for this cream
