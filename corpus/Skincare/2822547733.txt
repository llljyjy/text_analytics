A hydrating glow is the perfect name for this mist as it leaves my skin looking very dewy and fresh without appearing oily or leaving any unwanted residue on the skin. A major pro is just how fine the mist is, this helps tremendously with evenly applying to the face instead of those sprays where you have to hold it a whole arm’s length from your face and hope for the best. I enjoyed using this prior to makeup application or after, as well as at night before applying toner + serums, it’s that great of a hydrating base that I use it at least 3 times a day. The packaging is gorgeous feels heavy and is a frosted glass, and the spray itself has a very faint rose scent. For reference, I have sensitive skin and the light fragrance has never been an irritant nor has the spray ever caused my face to break out. If you are on the fence at all about trying this, you absolutely need in your daily routine! Obsessed
