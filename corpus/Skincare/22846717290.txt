I have dark, medium skin and this does not leave a white cast. It absorbs wonderfully into skin. As a teacher, I have worn this sunscreen all day long without any breakouts. Which is a miracle. I think the reason why people have issues with this product is because they are probably using it as their moisturizer. You do have to prep skin as usual before wearing this sunscreen. That is the only way that I have worn it, and probably why people who have oily skin have the most positive reviews.  Remember: This is a sunscreen not a lotion. Does not leave white cast
