I am pleasantly surprised by this product!! I’ve always been nervous to use a self tanner but this lotion blends really nicely and there were no streaks. That being said, there is a decent amount of color on the first application, at least on my very pale skin. I didn’t think I needed to follow the instructions and wash my hands… I was wrong! Be careful with the application so you don’t have orange fingers like me and you’ll enjoy this product! Great color!
