I got this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox and i really enjoyed it. The product is really thick and moisturizing. It didnâ€™t leave any greasy feeling at all on my face. It made my skin feel really plumped and moisturized. The only problem I have with it is that it smells so strongly of rose, overwhelmingly when you first put it on. The scent does fade rather quickly but if you are sensitive to scents, this might not be for you. Almost perfect
