I got to try Estēe Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-cream, courtesy of Influenster and Estee Lauder.I’ve tried it before and I always remark on the neat texture. It truly is a gel-cream. To me that automatically means it’s more effective because of the texture. I’m always tempted to use it on my whole face, because after being hospitalized for over four years, my skin always feel thirsty.After using this eye treatment for a month, there is improvement enough to notice, but if I stop using the gel-cream, my skin will go back to it’s normal state nan
