I love drunk elephant and use a few products from them.  I use the prontini moisturizer, vitamin c serum, glycolic serum, the baby facial and the bronzer drops and love them all.  This is a miss for me. When I use eye cream I put it on under my eye and on my eyelid.  I like that it’s thick and feels moisturizing.  The issue I have with this is that it some home gets I my eye and stings my actual eyes.  I’ve never had this issue with any other eye creams, even ones with retinol.  I tried to just put it underneath my  and it still got into my eyes and they stung.  I really don’t recommend this product. nan
