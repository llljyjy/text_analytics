I have mixed feelings about this product though I will be returning it. Positives: the formula goes on nicely, feels like a serum, not to heavy or greasy, doesnâ€™t breakout my skin. Negatives: has a major white cast, product explodes every time you open it and gets everywhere, the packaging peels and ends up on your face each use. Wanted to love this product
