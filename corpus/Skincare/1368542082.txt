The most effective thing about this cream is the marketing, which I fell for once, but won’t ever again. Everyone knows there’s no miracle cream that will completely transform your skin, but some things help more than others. And there are items genuinely worth the expense--La Mer eye concentrate, a good Lancome mascara--at nearly $1.50 a day (the 1 oz bottle, used as a day cream, lasted four months), this stuff isn’t even all that good as just a moisturizer. Won’t do it again. Uh-uh
