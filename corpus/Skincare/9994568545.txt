I received a sample of this retinol serum from Topbox for review purposes. I’ve recently starting getting interested in retinol serum. Before this, I had only used the ROC Retinol Serum Capsules. It was working well but it also made my skin a bit sore and sensitive If used too often. The Clinique one felt good and went on smooth. I only had enough for a couple uses so I feel like I can’t really comment much on its wrinkle reduction qualities. So far so good
