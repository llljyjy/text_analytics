I’ve never written a review but with this product I had to. First off, I am 43 and I have extremely sensitive skin, combination, prone to breakouts, etc. I’ve tried every serum out there, high end, low end, you name it. None of them did anything to tame my redness, minimize pores, nada. THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED!! Within three days, my redness was completely gone, I’ve had zero reaction and my skin looks amazing! Even my fiancé commented that it looks so much better. Seriously, friends, run and buy this!No, I was not incentivized to write this post and yes, I’m getting another bottle or two as backup. nan
