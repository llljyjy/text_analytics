I normally use the tanologist tanning drops from target, but I like the way these feel. I personally chose to mix the drops into my lotion and apply it because I feel like it gives a smoother finish. I feel like the tan from these looks really natural. It doesn’t give you a sticky feeling- it literally just feels like your lotion does. There’s no weird scent which is awesome. In my opinion it gives more of a glowy tan than a dark tan- but that’s the beauty of a buildable product… you can always add more to make it darker! There’s no blotchiness at all which is great!I love to travel with these to give myself a touch up on a vacation (since they are TSA approved in size). Great for a natural glow and great to travel with
