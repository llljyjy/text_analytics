I’ve been trying to find a great sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast, and also moisturizes without pilling, and here it is! Love this sunscreen so much, and I’ve tried quite a few! I love how light weight and non-greasy it is. Try pairing it with the niaminicide dew drops for an extra glow. Non-greasy, no white cast, POC friendly!
