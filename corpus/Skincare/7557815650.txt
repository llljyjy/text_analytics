This stuff works!!! Lost a star because I think my new skincare has also contributed to the results but this treatment has helped tremendously. I was so weary to purchase because of the price and the size of the product but after trying a free sample I wanted to continue to get the true effect and I’m so happy I did. My friend recommended it to me who experienced maskne and her results were almost instant and so impressive. Because I suffer from acne and have both new and old scars, it did take about 8 weeks to see the full results. The product lasts a long time even for it’s size and you definitely need patience if you have older scars but this product is definitely worth it. I’m so happy with it. Treats new and old acne!! Trust me, it’s worth it!
