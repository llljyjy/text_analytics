I really loved this product! I haven’t noticed a super drastic change in appearance but I did notice a change in the way my skin feels. At first the oil felt thick, like a massage oil, but after it sits for a few minutes it feels weightless and it definitely makes the skin feel better, not to the touch but to the face. I will definitely continue using it as I use a lot of the drunk elephant products in rotation in my beauty routine. I would recommend this for more mature, regular, skin types as well. Not sure it would sit great on oily skin types. (This is how it sits on a clean, dry face, after a few days of use) the redness IS NOT from this product. A little goes a long way…
