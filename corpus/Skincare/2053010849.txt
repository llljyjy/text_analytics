I received this night cream for free in exchange for my honest review. While it didn’t completely blow me away, it has been really pleasant to use, and it has worked well with the other steps in my routine. It absorbs really nicely, which is important to me, and the ingredients seem like a thoughtful formulation. It didn’t blow my other hydrating night creams out of the water, but I’m really looking forward to continuing with it in my current night routine. Would repurchase based on the quality of my skin after a few weeks of consistent use and pleasant sensorial experience. nan
