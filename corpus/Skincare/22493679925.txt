This is an ok cleanser, I am not usually a foaming face wash kind of person. I don’t use it every day, just when I want a quick and easy cleanse after a mask or in the morning if I feel like I need it. It is a good alternative for when I want to be clean without using any active ingredients. I don’t like that it has perfume in it. They use flower and sage extracts which would give it a nice natural scent but the perfume is over powering and not good for your skin. I won’t buy it again, it is not good for a deep clean or to clean out your pores and I just really hate the perfume. There is also alcohol on the ingredients list. I must say I do feel soft and fresh after using it. nan
