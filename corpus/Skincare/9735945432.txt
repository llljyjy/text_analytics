There are no words for how much this product changed my skin. I did my research before starting a retinol and this is a well recommended and safe option. I donâ€™t necessarily have sensitive skin but it does tend to break out when I introduce new products into my routine, and that did NOT happen with this product. It truthfully practically clears any breakouts overnight, and I have noticed my discoloration has improved overtime. I use it about 1-2x a week for almost 6 months now, every product only works with consistency, give this a genuine try and you could love it. Life Changer
