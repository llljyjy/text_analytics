Daily microfoliant exfoliant by Dermalogica is an amazing way to cleanse the face. Powder form that when moistened granularly exfoliates the face while also cleansing. Helps to get rid of dead skin cells. I do this once or twice a week and my skin is looking amazing.  Complimentary from Dermalogica sampling, will be buying more. Part of my weekly face routine
