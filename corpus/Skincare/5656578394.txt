I have combination skin, however it leans more toward dry. I exfoliate 3-4 times a week. I am in love with the brand Goop because of this product. The scent is not overpowering. It is a slightly fruity smell.  I canâ€™t say I love the scent, it took me several uses to get used to it. I like typically like a foam or something with suds. This is foam less and I do not mind...I am able to see the results fairly quickly.    If you wear makeup you will definitely need a cleanser to remover your makeup. My routine with this has been to was my face with my cleanser. I then use this product. I follow up with a toner and moisturizer.  I would like to try GoopGlow and incorporate an oil into my skincare regime. Goop is Good
