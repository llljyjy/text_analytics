First off, I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve been a fan of Alpyn products since I discovered them a couple years ago and let me say this eye balm does not disappoint! Immediately after applying I noticed a soothing sensation and that the lines around the eyes disappeared. It brightened up my very tired eyes and I was very pleasant to see instant results! My skin tends to be on the drier side, so this also gave a boost of hydration, without feeling heavy or sticky. A little goes a long way with this product.  I appreciate all the clean ingredients that Alpyn uses within their products, which is partially why I decided to give them a try in the first place and so glad I did! Definitely recommend this product! nan
