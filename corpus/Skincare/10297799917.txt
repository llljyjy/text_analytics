I received a sample size of this to review, at first I thought the size was too small to really do a full review on but a small amount goes a long way! This moisturizer feels so refreshing on the skin, super smooth feeling and absorbs fairly fast without leaving a gross left over feeling on the skin.I would totally purchase a full size of this! A refreshing moisturizer!
