When it comes to my skin I have sensitive skin with a pink undertone, the lines, bags etc really stand out! This crème is isn’t thick but also not thin, a little goes a long way! It is a very light orangish color, definitely creamy but just a little greasy. I have not used it before but after testing it out for a few weeks I have seen and felt a difference in my fine lines and hydration. I would say that it is doing exactly as it says it will! I will be continuing to use it to see just how good ot really is over time! I will say after applying it it does feel greasy and would not recommend trying to use make over it because it will get pilly and it’s not a good look! I also love that it is a clean formula and I’m always up for natural and clean ingredients in my choices of skincare. Hasn’t let me down yet!
