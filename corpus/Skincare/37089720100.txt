I absolutely love how this serum feels on my skin! The formula is easy to use and incorporate into your skincare routine! I have visibly noticed my skin getting evened out with the usage of this serum. I usually pair it up with a vitamin c serum, and have also noticed it works great with retinol and BHA cleansers/serums! An essential to my daily routine!
