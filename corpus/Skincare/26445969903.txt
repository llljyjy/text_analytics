So I tried this product for the first time and honestly it wasn’t bad the only complaints I have is that if you have like oily skin it wouldn’t be good because it is an oil based product and it does stay kind of oily and also if you’re like me and hate the feeling of greasiness on your face this is not it either. I have combination skin where I’m only oily in my t-zone but it still felt like I had a ton of grease on my face in that area. So to fix the greasiness I felt in that area I used my super goop resetting powder on top of it, (but I don’t think you should have to buy a whole separate product to enjoy this one).On the parts of my face that were not as oily it worked well like my cheeks, but on my nose and forehead I did not like how this product felt. It is more oily when you first apply and then the oiliness kind of goes away but not fully. I ended up washing it off after having it on for a few minutes, it’s an OK product so I won’t return it instead I will just use it on my hands, neck and chest. But I wouldn’t really recommend it to anybody because there are way better sunscreen sticks out there. Convenient but kind of oily
