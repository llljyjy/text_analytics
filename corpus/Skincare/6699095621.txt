A truly unique formula that is super hydrating and left my skin super soft. A great base for makeup, it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy, it feels light yet really hydrating. Not only is the packaging luxe, but the formula and unique texture are incredible! It dispenses easily and accurately to avoid waste, which is something I really appreciate! It didn’t seem to have fragrance and it didn’t irritate my highly reactive skin! I love that it’s a 2 in 1: Niacinamide and FOUR types of Hyaluronic bc that makes one less step in my skincare routine. 10/10 Highly recommend! Absolutely obsessed, must have product!
