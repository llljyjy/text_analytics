This is a really great and THICK but not greasy cream. I use it with a chemical exfoliant and a serum that Iâ€™ve been using but after the weather changed to cold and windy and having an allergic reaction to the mask I have to wear on set my skin was worn out. When I used this cream (I usually use the philosophy brand cream in the warmer months) there was a noticeable difference immediately and my worn out skin is looking almost fully healed after a week of use. Very much recommend if you have dehydrated, dry or irritated skin. And a little goes a long way! Saved my wind and allergy battered skin.
