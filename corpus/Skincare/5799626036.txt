Initially the treatment was amazing, cleared almost all of my dark spots within 10 days - seriously amazing however, after the 10 days I noticed the development of some small spots, looking like fungal acne. I think the enzymes, and fermented ingredients did not agree with my other skincare products. But for dark spot and hyperpigmentation clearing, this is amazing. WORKS, but irritated my skin
