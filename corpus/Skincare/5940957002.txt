I liked the SPF version little more, I felt it left my skip more glowing and it was definitely convenient. But still the cream is very light and moisturizing, the price is not that high but you get good quality product. Only thing I wish would be more packaging differences between both. They look almost identical. SPF>non-SPF but still good
