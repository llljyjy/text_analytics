Lincoln’s absolue Rich cream moisturizer is an amazing facial cream. At first upon opening the  bottle I was afraid it was going to be too thick or heavy feeling because it is a thicker creamy facial moisturizer. But once I started to apply it to my face it really was not heavy at all and in fact absorbed very quickly and left my face feeling very soft and just overall fresh and dewy looking. It did not cause any breakouts or irritation to my skin. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed a difference in my skin. Before my skin was dry due to the winter weather I think, but since using this product on a regular basis every night my skin is just so much better. It has a very light fragrance nothing heavy. I really really like this product. So luxurious!  Love it!
