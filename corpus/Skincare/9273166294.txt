I have dry, sensitive skin and this made it feel so soft! I had no negative reactions to the product and it didn’t make me break out. The texture is gel-like and applies really smoothly. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a residue. After a few days, I noticed my skin had become a bit softer. Overall, a nice simple moisturizer. It won’t blow your socks off, but it’ll do the trick! Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for my review. Pretty Good!
