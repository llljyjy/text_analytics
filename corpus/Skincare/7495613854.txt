I’ve always been a big fan of the brand and the been using it for about three years now, but I’m so tired of the blending never working out.. never works out and I’m always orange in my knuckles, knees and ankle parts sometimes it’s really bad on my face like I can spend a hour to like a hour in-half just applying it and making sure it’s all well blended in and the next day it’s just completely so patchy… so now I’m gonna be orange for my birthday lolll YAY:) Very orange
