I use this when I want an extra SPF boost for whatever reason. Recently I used it over a fresh face of makeup, fully set with products I know and love, and my makeup started pilling sooo bad! I only sprayed 2-3 times, drying each layer with my fan. I patted in the excess and still pilled my makeup, Very disappointing SO disappointing!
