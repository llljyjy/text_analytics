So I see how this would be nice for some peoples skin as I did notice an overall brightness, even skin tone and a tingling sensation after applying but besides that, a day after I broke out with 6 new pimples on my face even some blackheads I applied this on had turned into full on whiteheads. I understand theres a concept called “purging” and maybe the AHA was bringing everything out but i’ve used other exfoliant toners show results on my skin without the annoying purging breakouts that last for days to weeks leaving dark marks behind since I have ethnic skin. My skin is now calming down as I stopped using it & I am back to my peach slices acne exfoliating toner. Honest Review
