I love this. Not only is the bottle so luxurious and a beauty to add to any vanity, the mist itself is so lovely. It comes out so lightly and gentle and has this scent to it that just smells rich. I love to use this before applying my foundation as a primer but also to be used throughout the day as a refresher. Itâ€™s definitely a splurge item, but so worth it ! Beautiful!
