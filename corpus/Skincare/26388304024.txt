I received this amazing cream for free #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. This cream has a soothing mild flower scent. This cream is thick and spread easily on the face. I have been using this cream for few weeks in the night time and my face really looks hydrated in the morning. I also used this cream before makeup as a moisturizer and it really paired well with my makeupI recommend this cream for dry or combined skin who donâ€™t have acne issues #trywithtopbox Hydrated skin!
