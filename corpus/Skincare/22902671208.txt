End result: This is really nice and does work to clear up my skin and make it smoother.The first time I used it, it was pretty harsh and it stung my skin a bit. It didn’t burn, just stung in a few places where the skin was a bit thinner (i.e. a healing pimple). For the first two weeks I only used once a week until it stopped stinging, and it did! Now I’m up to 2-3x a week. You definitely to work up to using it regularly, but it does get more comfortable after the first couple uses. I kind of expected that given how strong it is. In the end it’s worth it, because it does improve the look of my skin. Be patient, it's worth it!
