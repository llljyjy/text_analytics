I’m loving this, especially using in conjunction with the Even Smoother serum. As someone who’s subjected their skin to everything under the sun, I’m always pleasantly surprised when something tingles because it takes more for my skin to feel those effects anymore. I got that nice tingle with this and was happily surprised. I was even more surprised when I noticed slight dryness around my nose after using this with the serum because usually products I’ve tried in the past aren’t potent enough to dry my skin, so I was actually pleased to see these apparently were more concentrated than competitor brands, which is a big plus! I never expect lightning quick or overnight results with majority of skincare products, but enjoyed how quickly I noticed an improvement in how my skin felt with this. Granted, I’ve been using it in combination with the serum, but I still think it’s worth it by itself. My skin could tolerate using these every night, but I’ve been enjoying only using them every other night or even just twice a week sometimes. I’m excited to continue using this and absolutely love this combo with the Even Smoother serum! Earned a place in my ’skincare staple box’ for sure! I absolutely love Peter Thomas Roth
