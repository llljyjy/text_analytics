This cream is perfect for winter! I have combination skin, so during winter I usually have large patches of very dry skin, however it’s hard to find a moisturizer that works immediately and lasts for a long time. The innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer, was actually perfect and worked amazing! I didn’t experience any irritation either, in fact it calmed my skin and those dry patches dissapeared immediately. I really recommend it! I also received this product in exchange for my honest review. Any dryness dissapears in minutes!
