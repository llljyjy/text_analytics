I received this product from influenster to test and provide a fair review. I had a troublesome dark spot on my upper cheek, and this serum lightened it perfectly! I haven’t been one to use vitamin c serums before, but this product really helped brighten my skin tone. I don’t love the button applicator, but other then that, it’s a great product! My skin and my day is a little brighter :)
