I bought this product in January and now we’re in July and it’s still not finished! I use it 2x daily and a little goes a veryyy long way. First, I apply the Ordinary serums (HA 2% + B5, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc, and Caffeine 5%) and then the moisturizer. Together, they’ve done wonders to my skin. I have been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and it was SO difficult to find a clean, non-toxic and affordable moisturizer. I tried so many different brands and wasted so much money looking for just-the-perfect moisturizer and I can honestly say this is it. Knock on wood, this product works like a charm on my skin. It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth and gives it a healthy glow. It also reduces the redness from the dermatitis so it keeps my skin calm and not irritated at all. I use it on my face, neck and hands. Don’t apply too much of it though. I wait a few minutes and then add an SPF cream afterwards. My only wish is that the Ordinary adds SPF to this product because it is the ONLY missing thing - other than that, it really is wonderful. Will buy it again and again and again. the perfect moisturizer for dry skin
