I received this product complimentary from influenster. This product feels greasy and thick but it actually blends in very smoothly. I’ve been using it for about two weeks and I’m starting to notice a subtle difference in the appearance of my skin. Not drastic but I have been using on the crease area of my neck and on the creases of my eyes and it does seem to lessen the creases a little bit. The scent is very light and it blends in very well. I am able to put my concealer right over top of it without any problems at all. The cream was not irritating to my skin and I think if I used it more I would have better results with time. I would definitely recommend this product for a subtle change in your skin’s appearance. Crease minimizer!!
