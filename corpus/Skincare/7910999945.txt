I think this is a good foundation alternative.  I used this in place of normal foundation. The color blended well for my skin tone, so I applied two layers for a more full coverage look. Itâ€™s has a light sunscreen fragrance but not too overbearing. However, this is not a product that I would purchase in the future. nan
