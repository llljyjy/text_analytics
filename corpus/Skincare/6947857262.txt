My primary concerns are firmness, fine lines and dryness around the eye area and I saw a marked difference in regard to all three in just two weeks. I don’t have major issues when it comes to dark circles but it definitely brightened my eye area made me look more “awake”. The applicator is a nice, as well. It provides a cooling effect as you massage the serum around the eyes - this is especially nice when you wake up with puffiness. I would recommend this to my friends and will be purchasing for myself. Great Results With This Serum!
