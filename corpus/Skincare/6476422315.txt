This is fast becoming my new favorite moisturizer! It’s thick but not super greasy, which is perfect for my combo-dry skin that is absolutely suffering this winter since it is so cold and dry out. This moisturizer also has a lot of ingredients that I love like niacinamide and peptides to make my skin extra hydrated and even-toned. This also is good to layer under sunscreen or makeup—haven’t noticed any product pilling or smudging, although it is a little thicker than what I would recommend under makeup. I’ve been using this daily and reapplying around my cheeks and nose (which get so dry in the cold months) and have noticed that my skin has stayed moisturized all day even under my mask, rather than only for a few hours.Overall, this is just what I needed this winter and I recommend giving this one a try.Gifted by EADEM. Perfect for the dry winter months
