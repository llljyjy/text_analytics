I was so excited to try this product, but after about a week my eyes started watering & we’re so itchy. At first I thought it was just allergies, but by process of elimination, they started to feel better when I discontinued using this product. While it doesn’t go in your eyes, it gets close enough that something in the product was causing a bad reaction. I was really disappointed though, as I really was excited to try the set to see if it was worth the hype. nan
