I am a. Longtime fan of It Cosmetics. and Bye Bye makeup 3 in 1 makeup melting cleansing balm definitely lived up to itâ€™s name and the It Cosmetics line.I was happy to be able to review their product in exchange for my honest feedback.upon opening a sweet rose scent was refreshing.It goes on smooth and can be used with a quick swipe to remove even stubborn waterproof makeup or also used as a cleansing mask .I tried both ways and was pleasantly pleased with both results.a added bonus is being both vegan and Alcohol free.The generous size is a great purchase.I personally love keeping mine in my mini countertop makeup refrigerator. It keeps it cool and refreshing especially in the summertime.I highly recommend this product.you will not be disappointed. My newest obsession
