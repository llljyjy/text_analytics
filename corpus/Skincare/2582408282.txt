This has become my all time favorite sunscreen in a matter of weeks!!!It is soo light weight and hydrating! Has a very mild clean scent!! Makes any makeup put on top of look beautiful!! Absorbes perfectly! There is literally not enough good things to say! If your on the fence it is worth it and you will not be disappointed!! And that’s coming from someone who hates almost all of the other sunscreens I’ve ever tried!! Perfect sunscreen!
