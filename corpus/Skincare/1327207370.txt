other than the fragrance, this is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used in my 45 years.  I don’t know why it needs to be fragranced, the eye base isn’t.  It isn’t ideal, but I can live with it considering how wonderful the product is.  It is super moisturizing but absorbs and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy.  It really does act like a base or a primer in a way.  It feels sort of satiny, or at least how I wish my skin felt on its own.  It does really well under foundation and there is less makeup settling in my creases when I use this. An almost perfect moisturizer
