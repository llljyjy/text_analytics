This is hands-down my favorite daily facial cleanser. I used to use Cetaphil’s Daily Facial Cleanser religiously but made the switch to Youth To The People’s Superfood Antioxidant Cleanser after several friends raved about it. It’s worth dishing out the extra cash. Buy this! You won’t regret it. nan
