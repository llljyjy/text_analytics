I was happy to test this #free product to #trywithtopbox. This is a super gentle vitamin c essence. Since the vitamin c is so gentle, I have yet to be able to tell the full results, but it is nice to use so far. I pat it into my face, so I donâ€™t think I would ever need more than 1 pump, so the suggested 5 pumps at night seems way too much. It has a pleasant light scent and sinks in to the skin really well. I find it to be a good base layer of hydration that pair well with other products. It is very, very watery. Not sure if it's working, but it's nice!
