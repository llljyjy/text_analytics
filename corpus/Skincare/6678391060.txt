I’ve used this product for a long time, and it truly helps a lot! It doesn’t get rid of the spot like manic overnight, but it does reduce the redness and starts the process of minimizing the appearances of it. When it arrives if you order it by mail, make sure to wait for the product to separate, when it’s shaken up it isn’t being used correctly! make sure the clear liquid is at the top so when you dip in a Q tip you go through that then to the product on the bottom, when it’s shaken up you will get less of the drying lotion which will be mixed in with the clear liquid! Works Well!!
