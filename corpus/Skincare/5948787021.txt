I’m on my third or fourth bottle of this stuff, in a span of a few years at least. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. I’ve had terribly dry lips as long as I can remember with a bad habit of hitting and picking at them. I have issues with bleeding, scabbing, flaking, you name it when I don’t proactively take care of my lips. Especially living in a northern climate with regular subzero temps. This lip mask is literally magic. The only thing that has ever worked for me, and I don’t even notice it until I run out and remember what it was like before! Seriously, if you struggle with dryness like I described I would try it. The price is really good with how much product youre actually getting. It is very sticky, and that can take getting used to, but my god I’ve never actually had a beauty product that works as well as this one does. I want to scream it from the rooftops lol I am so thankful I found it So worth it.
