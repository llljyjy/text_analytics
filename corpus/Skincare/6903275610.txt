I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my review. However, my reviews are always unbiased. I really wanted to live this product! Being someone with skin that tends to lean dry I was so excited by how hydrating this moisturizer is. Unfortunately, my skin is extremely sensitive to changes in my routine and this cause my acne to flair up. For someone with less acne sensitive skin this product would be amazing! A near hit!
