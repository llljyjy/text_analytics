Smells nice and not overpowering. I have oily skin, but fortunately its not sensitive or acne-prone. This reduces the oil and leaves my skin very soft. Lighter than other overnight creams I’ve used, which isn’t a pro or con, just a general statement. I like trying new products, but this become my go-to in a very short period of time Love this!
