The texture of this product is nice and I’m a fan of their hybrid serum/moisturizer, but this stuff is way too much for my skin. I tried it multiple times, in different ways, and got subpar results. I’m surprised because I use glycolic acid and retinol every other day. It left my skin red, with lots of dry patches, and no glow. Unfortunately, it’s going to the trash as I’m past the 60-day return date. nan
