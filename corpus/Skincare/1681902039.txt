Dry skin girlsâ€™ best friends. This moisturizer was soooo moisturizing and hydrating. I absolutely loved how well this moisturizer pairs and layers with other products. It feels so smooth and creamy on my skin. The vitamin C is lightening up some of my hyperpigmentation spots and i would recommend. One of my new favorites; I love it! Go get this moisturizer!!!!!!!
