I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest review. This acne calming serum did not do much to help calm my acne. The product itself is in a easy to use squeeze tube. You can dispense a bit on your finger and tap to apply on a problem area. I had a pimple I could feel coming and I rushed to use this new product. I used the product for a week straight and it did little to nothing to reduce the size or appearance of the pimple. I do not recommend this to people with pimples. My friend had a zit and she used it and loved it. She said it reduced the size over night. So I would say if you have small red zits, give it a try. If you have pimples, go for something else. Thank you Influenster and Shiseido! Did not help calm my acne
