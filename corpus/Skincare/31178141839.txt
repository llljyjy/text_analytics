This is for the 7 single-use packets of Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant. I received the product as a complimentary gift from Dermalogica Sampling. At the end of day one my skin felt relief and softer.  My acne has not been nice to me lately. I hadn’t noticed any major changes until day 3-4. I usually try to give a product at least a month but 7 days was enough to see that it was working. My skin felt better even without seeing the results immediately. By day 3-4. I saw reduction in my bumps by more than half and completely flat in other places. By day 7 I knew that I need to find this product. I have recently experienced an extremely bad break out. It’s lasted quite some time. I had been using proactive for the past month. which hasn’t made much difference for me. When I used the free sample. I didn’t use anything else but followed the instructions. I believe this is definitely worth a try if other products have not been working for you. My face is not completely clear after 7 days by any means but the difference is clear and much more mild than it was. My pores look better and my break out is retreating. I’ve never heard of this brand before but I will be looking for this product after this because it’s working for me. And I’ve tried a lot of products and none have shown this kind of progress.  I’m not saying this is a miracle product but I honestly see a difference when I’ve struggled to find any. I am glad I got to experience this product sample gifted by Dermalogica. Must try
