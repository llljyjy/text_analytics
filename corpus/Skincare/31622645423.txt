I tried this moisturizer from an online recommendation. My skin is somewhat sensitive, and moisturizers in particular are often irritating for my skin, especially around the eyes. Much to my satisfaction, this moisturizer doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and feels quite soothing upon application. It’s not crazy hydrating in my opinion, so if you have very dry skin, you may need to apply quite a bit or look for something heavier. I haven’t seen a marked difference in my complexion since I’ve started using this product, but I started in a good place, and I was searching for something that doesn’t irritate my skin, and Ole definitely delivers on that front. My only gripe is that I seem to go through the product pretty fast, but that’s probably a me issue lol. Solid and Soothing for Sensitive Skin
