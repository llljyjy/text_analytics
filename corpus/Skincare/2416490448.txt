I love the thick texture of this cream. It really makes your skin smooth and soft. It’s fragrance free and even though I don’t love the packaging I would certainly purchase this product. A little bit goes a long way and it’s amazing. I’m rarely wowed. I’ve tried other Bader products and this is by far my fav! Amazing cream!
