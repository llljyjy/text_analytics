I received this product for free to try from Influenster and I didnâ€™t think I was going to like it. My skin is combination but tends to lean more towards oily. And moisturizers like this usually leave my skin feeling heavy and greasy. Not the case here! A little goes a long way and once it soaked into my skin it was baby soft. 10/10 A must! My skin is so soft
