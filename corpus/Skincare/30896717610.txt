I got this product complimentary from Dermalogica. Since I have been having acne on my face recently, I really want to use a product like this to smoothen my skin. It turns out that it works after 7-days usage. It’s gentle so the result is not that obvious but I think it’s good for long term use. I think it’s more suitable for oily skin. Works for my acne face
