I’ve never used Korres before. Right off the bat, I’m not a huge fan of scented skincare or grapes in general. I do feel like it does a good job of hydrating but do not use it when you’re going to put on makeup. It made my foundation pill up. I did not notice it doing anything for my pores because they were still very visible. So for me, it’s just an ok product that I wouldn’t purchase because there’s other that work better for me *Product received complimentary from Influenster and Korres for testing purposes* It's just ok
