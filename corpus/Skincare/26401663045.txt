Didn’t leave a white cast, but still appeared VERY oily and sticky even after letting it soak in for at least 20 minutes. Required a significant amount of setting powder on top to dim the shine and hide the pores. I also put liquid foundation over top of it, used a beauty blender, got fairly significant pilling around the eyebrows and nose. Wouldn’t purchase again, no different than cheap drugstore brands.
