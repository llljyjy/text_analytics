I donâ€™t like the texture on this SPF. This product feels heavy on my skin, like what I would expect from a medium-coverage foundation, but it provides no coverage. The price tag, $64 for one ounce, seems ridiculous. I need to use at least 3-4 pumps to get adequate sun protection for my face and neck, and at that rate, I think I would go through this in <2 months of everyday wear. I can find sunscreens with nicer textures at the drugstore. nan
