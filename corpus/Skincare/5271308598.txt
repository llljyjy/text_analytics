I used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks because I wanted to see the difference that it would make on my skin. I have combination skin but more dry during winter of course. I love the moisturizer for night use and is the perfect moisturizer for winter time. Skin is plump after using it each time.I would of loved for it to have a pump to use because I believe it is more hygienic. Great moisture
