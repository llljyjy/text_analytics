Does everything an oil should! It seals in my moisturizer and protects my skin’s moisture barrier. Feels light but substantial. Smells slightly sweet or fruity, not nutty or bitter like some other oils. It’s completely effective without all the false claims that other oils have to bump up their price. Fully effective, no bells and whistles necessary. If you like face oils or need a way to extend the effects of your nighttime serums and moisturizers, this is the perfect final step. nan
