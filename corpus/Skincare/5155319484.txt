I never write reviews however for this gem I have to. I was switching skincare routines and one of the products destroyed my face. It was really red, textured, flaky and super dry I couldn’t even move my face. I have a huge even coming up and i was so sad that I wouldn’t even be able to put anything on my face. After looking for different deep moisturizers I came across this fresh one and seeing the reviews I had to try. Literally all of the redness, dryness and flakiness was gone in 24 hours. I can’t believe it. I’m only using this for the next couple of months until my skin can recover. Worth Every Penny
