I was excited to try a mist designed for the face, and you get a good amount of product. That said, everything beyond application was disappointing. The bottle sprays evenly, and the product gives a nice, subtle glow (good for fair skin like mine). That said, it showed up orange on my neck, faded quickly and unevenly on my face and neck, and really clogged my pores. I’ve never had a tanner fade into such visible patches. At first my clogged pores were caused by something else, but when I switched tanners, they cleared up. There are far better options - I’m sticking with tanologist face drops. Deeper customizable color, doesn’t clog pores, not orange, lasts longer, and fades naturally. Stick to drugstore
