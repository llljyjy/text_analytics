As someone who has tried nearly every skin cream on the market, you could say I’m a little skeptical about the claims of miraculous results. Oh, there are some great products out there and some not so great products. But they all fall short of what I, and most other women, want in a skin cream. Some targeted fine lines but didn’t even skin tone, while others addressed elasticity it didn’t minimize those pesky pores. And then I got the opportunity to try IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer. I was amazed. Those fine lines I hate so much seemed lighter, the texture of my skin was soft and supple. And the pores? What pores?! I love the brightness and energized look and feel of my skin now, no more tired, dull looking skin. I love the subtle scent, not too strong and creamy lushness of the product is luxurious. It feels heavenly going on. This product can definitely claim miraculous results! Miracle in a Cream
