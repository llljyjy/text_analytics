I love the foamy texture. I wash my face with this every morning, and I donâ€™t have issues with my acne as I do with other products. I tend to have large breakouts when trying new things, so I was generally surprised and happy that I found a skincare product that works for me. I tend to have issues with serums interacting with my foundation application and longevity. I will be purchasing the full size of this product. I also let my mom try it and she is also going to purchase it.Thank you Influenster!! GO FOR IT
