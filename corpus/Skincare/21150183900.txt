I have the WORST dry, flaky, sensitive skin and this cleanser takes my makeup off easily without any irritation! It makes my skin feel clean but nice and oiled to then apply my serums and creams. I definitely wouldn’t recommend for oily or acne prone skin as they have more suitable cleansers but if you’re sensitive or dry like the Sahara then this is the cleanser for you!! And it’s CHEAP! SO GOOD IF YOU HAVE DRY & SENSITIVE SKIN!!
