I love the aqua bomb moisturizer, so I had high hopes for this sunscreen. It doesnâ€™t make my face feel or look greasy like normal sunscreen does, and makes me feel like I am really protected from the sun since it is SPF 50! Overall such a great product to add to your daily skin care routine!! Love!
