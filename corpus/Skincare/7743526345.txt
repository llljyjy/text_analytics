The KORRES Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is a great mattifying moisturizer!!! It leaves skin feeling smooth and softly matte, but still with a natural sheen to it. It also blurred my pores! I took a picture with flash and my pores were gone, compared to using a normal moisturizer. It smells similar to like clay or play doh (not a particularly good smell), but goes away once applied. All in all I TRULY love it!!! If you have combo to oily skin like me, I really think you should try this product out! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Great for oily skin!
