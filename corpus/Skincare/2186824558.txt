At first not gonna lie, the texture was chunky and very difficult to apply with a mask applicator that I use for all my masks. So I decided to try my hands, clean of course, and I had much better results. I will say after washing it off my face felt amazing. Definitely did what it said and more. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I do have to use my hands to get and even application. Aside from that though definitely love this product. nan
