I was so excited to try this mask after reading numerous positive reviews. I finally got it and it was love at first sight. From the packaging to the smell and texture, I loved everything about it. I was so happy I finally had found a great mask for my oily acne-prone skin. The first experience was truly amazing, it was like a typical clay mask without the overly stretching feeling, and the smell was heavenly. What was not to like?!…. But oh here comes the day after and I start feeling a little bump on my cheek. I start worrying because I know bumps on my cheeks mean a large cyst that is rrrrrreally hard to treat and would most definitely leave a mark. And so it happened… that was a first. I was, however, not entirely convinced that this amazing product could have such a disastrous effect on my skin and so a few weeks after, when my skin was finally healed, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake!! Same thing happened, this time double trouble. I got two of the worst cysts of my life, and I have been dealing with acne for over 20 years so I have seen a thing or two. I sooo wanted to love this product and give it a five star review but, at least in my case, it works awfully. I will have to throw away an almost full tube. Breaks me out soooo bad
