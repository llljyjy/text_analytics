I have tried many sunscreens and haven’t had much luck finding one that wears well under makeup and works well with my skin. This does it all. It’s translucent, doesn’t bother my sensitive skin, isn’t greasy, wears super well under makeup, and goes on so smoothly. I also love the subtle glow it gives. Definitely worth the price for me. Will buy again. Perfect daily sunscreen
