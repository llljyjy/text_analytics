I was gifted a sample from Influenster that I’ve been using for the last month or so. I love the gel formula, it’s very lightweight and melts into skin. I can tell a difference in how the skin around my eyes feels, and my discoloration has evened out slightly. I’ll keep using this gel cream, it’s everything I’ve been looking for.
