i mean, its ok. I got a sample of this toner and i wanted to trial it and see how my skin felt about this toner and i stopped using my holy grail toner which was the glow recipe watermelon one. to be honest i feel like it did help fade my acne scars and just hyperpigmentation in general, it didn’t break me out and it smells nice. However i noticed upon stopping my holy grail toner my skin texture became BAD. this probably does nothing to help texture since i did my usual skincare minus my usual toner and put on my foundation and usually i get a smooth glasslike finish with my skin and foundation but the texture of my skin showed through so much and it was HORRIBLE on my forehead. Maybe if i used this with my other toner it could help the texture because i like what this does to my hyperpigmentation, just does nothing for my texture and made it WAY worse, probably won’t purchase a full size. tbh the three inital products that came out with the launch aren’t that good, i hate the hydra visor and the cleanser is fine, it cleans and smells nice, not much else to say meh
