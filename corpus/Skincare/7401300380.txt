I received Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum as #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I must said that I am absolutely happy with the results so far. I’ve been using it for two weeks at night after I clean my face and before I apply my night cream. I live in Illinois and at this time of the year the weather is cold and awfully dry so my skin suffers a lot; after the third day applying this Serum I noticed a diference, my skin was moisturized and with a dewy complexion when I wake up. The application is enjoyable as the serum was a nice texture that gets absorbed fast and doesn’t leave any stickiness. The smell is lovely, it has a fresh scent with hints of flowers. I love the presentation too, the color of the bottle is elegant, and the pump is practical as it avoid messiness. I am excited to see how this serum will help to improve the dark spots on my face. So far I am impressed. Impressed!!
