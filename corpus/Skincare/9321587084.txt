I absolutely love this product.  I use at the very end of my skin care routine and it is extremely moisturizing.  I don’t agree with the complaints about smell--any odor is so faint I almost can’t smell it.  Maybe SCANTLY vegetal.  has been very helpful overall to moisturize and soften skin.  FYI, I have dry/mature (50’s) skin. Love this product!!
