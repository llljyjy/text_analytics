I don’t use eye creams frequently, but this is one that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. It makes my under eyes feel so smooth and hydrated. I’ve used it for a few weeks now and I’ve not experienced any milia that some eye creams have given me! I have dry skin and it is hydrating enough to not feel the need for additional hydration. It also doesn’t add any excess oils. I’ve not noticed any improvement to my under eye darkness, but I’m unsure if that is a claim that this eye cream makes! Overall I would repurchase and recommend! Great
