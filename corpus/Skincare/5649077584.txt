For me, this is an absolutely necessary daily skincare step. I’ve been using this for at least 5 years now and I cannot live without it, I even have several travel sizes for work trips and vacations. I have extremely sensitive, eczema-proned skin and this helps a lot when I’m treating a small flare up on my face. It should be noted that it’s not the only tool I use to combat an eczema flare, as I also use a nightly oil and I slug with Aquafor. But it’s super soothing and hydrating for daily use. I also battled vicious cystic acne as a kid and get the occasional spot here or there as an adult, but this cream has never been the culprit. It’s super creamy without clogging my pores. It just truly makes me feel good, I will likely be a life long customer of this product. cannot live without this
