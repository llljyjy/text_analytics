The term “lotion“ is a bit deceiving for this product. It is definitely a toner consistency and I apply it with a cotton ball. That being said, I really like the product. I use it after cleansing and before any serum/lotion. I don’t mind the smell at all - I actually enjoy it!I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my skin since starting this product but I still really enjoy using it and would recommend to my friends as a toner. nan
