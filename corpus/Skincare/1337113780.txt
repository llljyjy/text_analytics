I have VERY sensitive and dry skin, and I live in the harsh Canadian prairies. Most products either just aren’t moisturizing enough or break me out. This doesn’t! I use it on my face and body after the shower and I don’t feel I need any other creams or lotions. I use it on the ends of my hair once in a while too because it is bleached. So it may be a little pricey at first glance but when you consider it’s like three natural products in one, I think it’s a great deal. And by using it, you are saving sharks!! What more could you want? Great Value and Product!
