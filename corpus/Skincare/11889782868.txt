While this has a fine texture and absorbs well, it smells awful—like dirt. I’m okay with natural or even medicinal smells, and prefer products without artificial scents, but this was gross I almost could any get past it, but it was expensive, so I kept using. Gave little white and blackheads on my cheeks, so even more texture. When I stopped using they went away; when I began using again they came back. No noticeable improvements, and I used the whole bottle hoping my skin would adjust. I had MUCH better results with the strivectin retinol+vitamin c product. nope—don’t do it
