I received this from influenster  in exchange for my honest review. However I’m a long time drunk elephant fan. This is a really nice mask. It’s very luxurious and thick without feeling heavy. I’ve only used it for my night routine but it absolutely feels light enough to be worn as part of a morning routine as well. My skin has reacted well to it and I do feel like my skin looks brighter and more even when I wake up. This is a really nice mask. It’s very luxurious and thick without feeling heavy.
