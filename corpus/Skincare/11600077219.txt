lovee this product. leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean after using. I use this about once or twice a week, depends on how my skin is feeling. I got the 30ml one and it’s been a YEAR now since I opened it, and it’s still not finished! lol maybe I’m not using enough? but a little goes a long way. I do find myself breaking out (1 or two pimples) sometimes after using a lot or when I leave it on my face for too long. But overall, a very solid product. my fav exfoliator
