Thank Been using for a little around a month now. Sample size lasts awhile which is nice. It moisturizes and softens. Eyes feel velvety soft after use and crows are less noticeable. Scent reminds me of head lice treatment lol but it’s not too heavy. Is it worth the price tag? No. I feel like there are cheaper alternatives that work just as well or maybe better. That’s why I deducted a star and won’t recommend. Pricey
