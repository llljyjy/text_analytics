I received this product for free to give an honest review. Currently I’ll use it as a hydrator when my skin feels a little dry. There’s a strong rose scent (which maybe seem obvious). The thing is, there’s nothing special about it other than the label. If you want a hydrating mist you can definitely find a cheaper alternative. Mediocre Mist
