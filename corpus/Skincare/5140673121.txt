This is unlike any cleansing agent I’ve ever tried before. The first day I try that, I used it to remove my make up and cleanse my face. I was surprised at how silky the product is and how little you need to be effective. It felt great on my skin, cleansing and moisturizing. It’s even very gentle around her eye area. I prefer this to any liquid make up remover I’ve ever used, and it seems much more gentle than soaps and washes. I read the directions, and the second day I used it as a mask. What a great all in one product! It’s so small and saves room in your bathroom, and serves multiple purposes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great value for a make up remover, cleanser, moisturizer and mask. It’s really an amazing product. So gentle and moisturizing
