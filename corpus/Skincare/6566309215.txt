I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have been noticing that my scarring and dark spots are not as prominent. Iâ€™m a big fan of the formula this serum has and I also really like that it has made my skin feel a lot softer as well. The packaging could be a bit better, as the bottle is so big and plasticity that it is kind of hard to use the product. Otherwise, this has been the best dark spot serum I have used for my skin this far. Awkward packaging
