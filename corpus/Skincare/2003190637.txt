I received my sample 2 1/2 weeks ago so I’m unable to give an accurate review of if all the claims made by the product are true, but I can say I really like this moisturizer so far. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly. I have oily skin and this did not cause any breakouts. It has a light scent that I didn’t mind. I will keep using the cream and hopefully I’ll see the results it claims to have after 4 and 8 weeks. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I haven’t been able to use it long enough and it does have SPF, which I really wish it did. Supercharged
