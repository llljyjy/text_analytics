I really really really wanted to like this day cream. It had the thick creamy texture I like in a moisturizer and had promise even though I hated the smell. After using it for several days the only thing I noticed was slightly oiler skin. It wasn’t a bad product it’s just not for me. #shiseidoskincare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster nan
