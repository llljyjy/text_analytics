I’ve actually used Daily Microfoliant for years now, it is one of my favorite gentle exfoliators that my skin never gets tired of. Dermalogica gifted me single packets of the Daily Microfolant but I will simply be adding it to what I already have. If you are someone who enjoys that feel of a gentle reset to your skin, this is the product for you. I shake a little out into my cleanser and massage it into my skin for 1 minute. Afterwards your skin will feel so soft and ready for the rest of your skincare routine. A little goes a long way and I’d say the mid size is a wonderful investment. A Gentle Exfoliator Everyone Should Own.
