I have very dry skin to normal and this product is very lightweight which I love! Unfortunately, it not hydrating enough for my skin so I will mainly take this as a night cream instead. It does leaves my skin silky smooth so thats a plus! There are other products thats way better, but if youâ€™re on a budget then get this product! It gets the job done! Mainly use it for a night cream
