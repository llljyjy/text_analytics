This is surprisingly my first Paula’s choice product and I will say I can see why people go to her with their acne concerns. I like the small packaging, it’s a clear gel consistency, no strong scent. It does sting on any open acne so I would avoid putting it on those areas. I appreciate that this is safe to put over a large area unlike many spot treatments that are too drying to do that. When I break out it tends to be in one general area so being able to cover the entire region without fear of over drying has been nice. It works well! My spots clear up with a couple of applications. Overall I am happy with it. Works well
