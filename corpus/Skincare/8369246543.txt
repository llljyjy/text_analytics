It’s a gentle retinol for those (like myself) that are hesitant to add a retinol to their routine, and I’ve noticed an improvement in my skin texture and dark spots/hyperpigmentation. I’ve been using it a couple nights a week for the past few weeks and have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin! I definitely recommend checking this out if you’re looking for an introductory retinol serum! nan
