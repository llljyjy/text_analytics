Ive tried a variety of facial creams in the past. Some are too heavy and others don’t maintain the moisture I require, but after trying Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream I can confidently say that it met all my expectations and exceeded the results of other creams I’ve tried in the past. This product addresses dryness, dullness, fine lines and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth well into the next day. Most products I’ve previously tried don’t manage to keep my skin feeling moisturized for more than half the day. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future and it will replace all other creams I’ve been using prior to this one. It felt light on my skin but packed some serious moisture. I’m quite happy with this product. I received this product as a free sample from BzzAgent. nan
