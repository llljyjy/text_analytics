I bought this product because I read about the skincare benefits of Pycnogenol and saw all the rave reviews here on Sephora about this version from The Ordinary. It feels almost like a facial oil (because of the propanediol base) but I didn’t find that it absorbed well. It more or less just sat on top of my skin and kept my moisturizers from absorbing (yes I followed the instructions about when to apply it in my routine). Mixing it with my moisturizer seemed like a feasible fix so I tried that as well, but had the same end result. When I used it at night, whether on its own or mixed with a cream, I woke up with my skin feeling dry and dehydrated. When I used it in the mornings, it felt moisturizing at first and gave my skin a nice glow…but then my face would begin to feel dry by early afternoon (which isn’t a problem I typically have, I usually get a bit oily in my T-zone by then). I halted using it for a night to see if it was the issue, and sure enough my skin felt back to normal the next morning. Me being me, I had to try one more time, so the next evening I used it in my nighttime routine and woke up the next day feeling dehydrated yet again. Needless to say, I discontinued it completely after that. It has an unpleasant smell but it only lasts for a second and then dissipates. All in all, this was a no for me. I’m going to research more and try some other serums with French Maritime Pine Bark Extract to see if my skin just doesn’t like that ingredient or maybe just didn’t like this formulation? One good thing is, a little goes a long way so the 15ml size should still last a while. Skincare is so personal, it’s really all about trial and error, finding what works and doesn’t. I just don’t think my skin digs this product very much. Not For Me :(
