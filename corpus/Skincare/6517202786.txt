The Dernalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 is part of the AGE Smart line. I’ve been loving the gentle cleanser so I was super excited to try this product. It has a strong floral fragrance which smells nice but I don’t like fragrance in my facial products. It is white but didn’t leave a significant cast which was nice and at first felt heavy and oily but then settled nicely into the skin. Overall, If you don’t mind fragrance and have a dry skin type I’d recommend but for my oily, sensitive skinned friends maybe not the one for you! Yes for dry skin, no for oily/fragrance sensitive
