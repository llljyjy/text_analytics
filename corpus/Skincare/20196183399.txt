I love this moisturizer and at first I really hated it. What I didn’t realize is that a little goes a LONG way. It’s super hydrating so I only use it at night, and I use maybe 1/2 a pump instead of a full pump. Using too much made my skin super greasy even throughout the day and my makeup wasn’t staying on. Butttt I don’t think I could ever switch back to Cera Ve after this, I started getting so many compliments on how my skin looks glowy and smooth so I think I’m going to stick with it for now? nan
