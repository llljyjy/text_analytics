I got this complimentary from influenster and shiseido for my honest opinion. This is more my speed when it comes to sunscreen. I used it on an 80 degree day and was in the sun for over 2 hours. I didn’t get burnt. nor did I have to reapply it. when it comes out of the bottle it’s a thick white cream. after you rub it in. it leaves your skin glossy looking. There is little to no smell to it and I would buy it after this experience. Its finally sunny!
