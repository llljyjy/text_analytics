Love this product! I normally do not wear sunscreen unless going to the beach, though I know better. It is lightweight, moisturizing, but not greasy or shiny, and smells nice. It doesn’t smell a ike your typical sunscreen that I hate toSmell on my face, let alone daily when I am not at the beach (who wants to smell that in the winter). I can only say it’s expensive so now I will have to add another expensive product to my list.. but you get what you pay for I guess nan
