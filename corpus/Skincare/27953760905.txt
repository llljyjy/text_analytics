I have been using this product for over a year and it’s a miracle worker. Yes, it smells like sulphur but honestly, the smell doesn’t bother me. I think it was only initially that it affected me. I also found that putting this on right after I wash and dry my face is more effective than putting it on after toner. My secret weapon!
