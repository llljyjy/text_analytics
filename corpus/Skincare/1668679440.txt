I have been using this cleanser for the past 2 weeks and love it so much! It is so gentle and has been amazing for the winter as my skin gets drier. I have acne and my other products make my skin very dry so this is perfect. Itâ€™s creamy and works wells to remove makeup as well. I love everything from Glow Recipe and this is perfect. The smell is minimal as well. Creamy!
