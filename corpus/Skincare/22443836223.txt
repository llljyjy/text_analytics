This is not my first La Mer product that I use and end up loving so much! I immediately fell in love with the consistency of the Treatment Lotion. Itâ€™s not thick or greasy. It is a super lightweight product that quickly absorbs. Since using this, my skin texture and elasticity have improved, and even the redness from my rosacea has diminished and faded a bit more.  This also wears great under makeup! Light weight product
