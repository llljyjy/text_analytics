i have tried SO MANY facial sunscreens and this one takes the cake. it’s super light weight, blends in so well, doesn’t feel greasy and smells amazing. and only $15???!! plus if you’re like me with uber sensitive pale skin, this is a dream come true. RUN TO YOUR LOCAL SEPHORA AND BUY 20 OF THESE. but why is it 36 and not 35 or 30 or something ? BEST SPF EVER.
