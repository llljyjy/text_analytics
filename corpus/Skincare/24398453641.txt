I like this crème moisturizer, the texture is nice and thick. It doesn’t leave my skin oily and has rapid absorption. I personally didn’t find anything extraordinary in this moisturizer, it work well, but I didn’t find a big difference after using it. Maybe because the sample size only lasted for about four applications. nan
