This has been a lifesaver. Before using this, my skin was getting really irritated with dry patches (possible due to new medication that I’m taking) and I was desperate and happened to have a free sample. I ended up buying the value size and haven’t looked back. My skin is so soft and the redness has almost disappeared which is incredible because I’m very prone to redness. I can’t recommend this enough for sensitive combo skin. skin lifesaver!
