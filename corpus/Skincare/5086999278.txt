I received the Face Ball complimentary from FaceGym and I was very excited since I suffer a lot from headaches and face tension from clenching/grinding at night. I was definitely intimidated at first since itâ€™s not your usual type of facial messages, but after watching the videos and trying it out, I was hooked!I started incorporating it into my morning and night time skin/facial message routine and noticed tension relief right away around my temples and neck area. Highly recommend to release facial tension
