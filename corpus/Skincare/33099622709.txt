I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I am a south Asian women in her mid 20s for reference.  I really love the brightening effects of this product. It is made in Korea and has berries, Vitamin C in a stable derivative, and caffeine. It helped me improve the texture and even my skin tone. They recommend that you use it twice a day for 28 days and I can say that it does show results during that time. I will be trying Laneige products in the future. Wow, gamechanger! Even Skin Tone!
