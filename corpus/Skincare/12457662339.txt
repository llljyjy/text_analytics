I have very fair skin, use sunscreen daily. For my face I use a tinted moisturizer with an SPF above 40.  However I would stil need a bronzer and a blush until I came across Super Gloss Face. I apply this lighly over my moisturizer to give me more of a tanned look.  You can apply more or less depending on the depth of color you desire.  It is not shiney or orange and looks very natural plus it has an SPF as well. I do use a cream blush as well, some eyebrows, lipstick and Iâ€™m out the door.  I have used it on my arms to give them a little more color.  Tanning Butter is wonderful too! Why Isn't Super Gloss Talked About More?
