Since this is an exfoliating cleanser, I recommend removing your makeup first and then double cleansing with this jelly cleanser. A little goes a long way and it doesn’t foam so hold back from adding more, because when applied to damp skin it will definitely glide easily. I was hesitant about the micro-exfoliators because I typically use chemical or enzymatic exfoliators, but this was gentle yet effective. The scent was fine, but what I really loved were the results. My dry skin was left smooth and ready for my serum and moisturizer. I wouldn’t use it everyday as directed though, 3x/week seems sufficient for me (and I chemically exfoliate every day). Gentle, yet effective.
