This stuff is great! I had laser eye surgery a month ago and I’m not allowed to rub my eyes. I’m wearing waterproof mascara and shadow since I have to put eye drops in every 2 hours. Green Clean melts away my eye makeup with only light-touch wiping. I also use it to wash off the vaseline-like eye ointment I have to use overnight. It smells amazing, too, and I love that it’s good for me and the planet! nan
