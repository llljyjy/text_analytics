I’ve possibly tried 15+ different makeup removing formulas since my young age... but nothing quite like this! Removing oils are a game changer for me, waaaayyy more efficient than liquid formulas and better for the environment too, since the only thing you need to use it is your hands. I’ve first tried this formula 7-8 years ago (in the old packaging) and loved it immediately. I love the texture, the way it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, I love that it takes seconds for the makeup to be removed... truly, it’s my favourite makeup removing formula on the market. Being honest, I’ve also been into the “Biosource total renew balm-to-oil“ from Biotherm in the last couple of years, which was much more affordable than this one but it’s now unfortunately discontinued... so here I went again, buying the Caudalie formula and let me tell you... I feel right back in love with it... WOW! Love this formula!!!
