I don’t know that I’ve been using this product long enough to give the best review, but so far, my experience has been positive. My skin does feel smoother and slightly hydrated. I haven’t noticed a huge difference with my pores and fine lines, but again, that could be due to limited use. I do have issues with acne, and I’m happy to say that this doesn’t cause my acne to flare up in any way, or make my face feel greasy.  Is it worth the price? I’m not sure yet. $72 is pretty steep. It takes more than 1 pump to do my entire face, so without seeing crazy results in a very short time, it’s hard to back it 100%. I will keep using it to the end though to see what results I get over time. nan
