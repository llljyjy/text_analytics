After two nights of using this my pores are definitely smaller and my skin is so dewy! I have calamine lotion on my pimples that are stubborn. But this definitely gave me better skin!! It is a little oily but once it absorbs it feels fine, it’s probably not the best for oily skin and just make sure you use a small amount:) sadly I don’t have any before pictures but this made my skin soooo nice and glowy. If u want my skin care routine here it is: In the morning I use glow recipe toner, then the salicylic acid from the ordinary, then I use glow recipe dew drops and hyaluronic serum and follow up with a sun screen and then the glow recipe moisturizer. At night once a week I use the salicylic acid face mask by the ordinary and then tone with the ordinary glycolic acid toner, then these drops and the glow recipe avocado eye mask and then cerave moisturizer:) works!!
