I am writing this review after over a year of using this product and I gotta say, I love it. At first glance, the amount of product looks minimal for the price, but I JUST ran out of this after using it for over a year and a half almost every day. I add a tiny drop to my usual moisturizer routine, but have also mixed with sunscreen, bb cream, whatever - it always mixes in super well. I don’t wear foundation, so this adds the perfect tiny amount of colour to my moisturizer and face (plus, removes white cast from my SPF) + glow/blur that I like. Very subtle. If you do want to use it to match your tan you can also do that by adding more drops. I’m very fair and the tiny bit of colour was perfect for adding some life to my face, but not overwhelming. My skin is also very sensitive and have never had any issues. I love this because I am really loyal to my few products I know won’t bother my skin, and I can mix these drops into my tried and true favs to get some tint without needing to branch out and risk new products to get the same effect. This one is for the minimal skin makeup girlies
