be so, so careful with how you use this. I have always had clear clear skin but started having hormonal acne in my twenties, and I panicked and tried everything. This was the only thing that helped. I accidentally overused it, and my breakouts got worse and my skin was beyond irritated. Now that Iâ€™ve repaired it, using it on sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin and on clusters of hormonal comedones works so well, but I definitely have more sensitive skin than when I started and can really only use it once a week before I start to see irritation and redness. If you are struggling with acne definitely try this!! I started to see some improvement when I used it right and felt so much more confident. Just use it sparingly or you will really, really regret it. Good for Hormonal Acne
