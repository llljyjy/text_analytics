Fantastic product! No scent to speak of that I noticed. It goes on very smooth and silky. You can tell you have it on but it isn’t heavy on my face. A little also goes a long way, which is wonderful given the price. I put this on at night, after washing my face before bed. When I wake up in the morning, my face is very soft and has retained moisture through the night. Living in the desert, dry skin is a huge problem so I am always on the lookout for products that keep my skin moisturized. Yes there are cheaper products out there; however, the Lancôme Advanced Génifique Night Cream is absolutely worth the splurge. Treat yourself!
