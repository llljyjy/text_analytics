It is a good moisturizer, packaging is cute, and I was in love with the reusable bottle. However it states for all skin types and for me that is not the case. I have combination/normal skin and this is way to heavy for me to use. I even tried using a VERY small amount and when I woke up I could still feel the heaviness of the moisturizer on my skin. Iâ€™d only recommend this if you have dry skin. Not for all skin types
