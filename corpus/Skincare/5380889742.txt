This is one of my favorite serums from the ordinary. There’s 5% of French maritime pine bark extract which is not only more than what other brands offer but it’s a steal at this price point. I’m writing this review because I feel like it’s an unsung hero from the ordinary line but truly is a powerhouse antioxidant for increasing skin elasticity, preventing photo-aging, and maintaining skin hydration. It pairs really well with other ingredients too. I hope they never discontinue this since it’s a staple for me! My review isn’t sponsored nor was this given to me. I just really like this and hope you do too :) Unsung hero
