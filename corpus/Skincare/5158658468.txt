I have used this oil for about three years now and I will use it until I or this product is discontinued. Which ever comes first. It’s so good! Super hydrating but sinks into the skin without making you feel greasy. The texture is so nice and luxurious and a few drops go a loooonnng way. I use it every night and a bottle lasts me like 4 months. Couldn’t recommend this baby more. Worth the money and your skin will thank you. A real MVP
