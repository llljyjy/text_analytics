I’ve been using this morning and night and while the serum itself is great, applying this with the head completely wakes my eyes up in the morning. After even serious puffiness, when I apply this, with a little bit of cold afterwards, my eyes completely depuff. Beyond that, the serum overall helps hydrate my under eyes , helping with my dark circles. One last note: this has a faint smell—I loved it but should note if you’re sensitive to fragrance. Great eye serum
