This product is amazing! The product itself has a pleasant clean smell, nothing harsh. The consistency is creamy, & went on smooth. I loved the unique twist top! This serum left my skin feeling refreshed. This product works for all types of skin which I appreciate because during the summer months my skin can be very dry. This is a MUST HAVE!
