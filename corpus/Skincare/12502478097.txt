I realllllly wanted to love this. As a California girl living in DC, I miss my tan :( this looked SO GOOD the first day j had it on. I woke up the next day to super patchy skin. I guess the color clung to my dry skin. It just didn’t look cute. Maybe for the one day if you have an event but def doesn’t last a week. Barely a day. nan
