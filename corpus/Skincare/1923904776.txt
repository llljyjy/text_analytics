I got this sample few months ago and put this away thinking itâ€™s for cold dry winter or mature skin. I wish I tried it sooner. I was amazed by how moisturizing but never thick or clogging pores. I bought one value size, and another value size when kiehls offered special discount. I can see how versatile this product is since I can myself using it summer or winter. No regret!
