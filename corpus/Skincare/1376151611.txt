Lip balms are my thing. If I could spend money on any one beauty product it would be lip balm. For the last couple years I’ve searched high and low for the “best lip balm with SPF”. After trying all of the results that turn up on a simple google search, I finally landed on O’Keefe’s chapstick with SPF. BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!! Perfect light vanilla smell, love the silicone lip applicator - hugs my lips perfectly, and LOVE the shine! this is it!!!!
