I bough into the hype and ordered this product to add to my routine. I had to stop using this after 1 week. It causes horrible breakouts around my nose and chin that took 2 weeks to get under control after discontinuing use. I also did not enjoy the greasy look it gave my skin. Product seems to sit on top instead of absorb. Perhaps meant for under 30 crowd. Beware! Horrible breakouts DONâ€™T BUY
