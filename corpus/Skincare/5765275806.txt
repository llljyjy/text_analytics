Been using this balm as a mask as well as makeup remover - works great as both and removes the sunscreen film a lot of cleansers leave behind, which is a huge plus.Wasn’t sure how I’d like it as a mask but it’s quickly become my go-to moisturizing mask (really helpful if you use retinoids). I’ll definitely be purchasing this after it runs out. Love it!!!
