Did not realize this was a brand new product when I got it! First impression is very unusual. It goes on as a clear liquid (like it looks in the bottle), then turns opaque as you spread it across your face. I tried putting it on in various ways (on damp skin, after HA, on dry skin) and it does the same thing regardless. Great for using at night, would absolutely not recommend using during the day because of this quirk. Don’t let that deter you. Great products are great when they’re used the right way! The Ordinary knows what they’re doing with this product. Very simple ingredients list, the active ingredient is the shining star, no scents or perfumes. Strange first impression, Great lasting impression
