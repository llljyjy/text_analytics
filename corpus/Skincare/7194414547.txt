Very tempting pretty because of lavender smells and shiny jar but the product is just as cheap as the packaging. (Plastic gold spoon on top and called it anti bacteria… eye roll) This makes my skin (which is not even sensitive) brea out. It’s very oily feeling and clogs pours. Just not for me. I didn’t even use most of it. It was a waist and I am sad. Cheap dose of good marketing
