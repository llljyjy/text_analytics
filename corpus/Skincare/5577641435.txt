I was really excited to try this product and it wasn’t quite what I expected.  They felt nice and cooling when applied, but after a few minutes I had to take them off because my skin started to feel so dry. Also, didn’t notice much of a difference in the appearance of my skin. This was gifted to me by the brand. nan
