The fragrance is too strong for me. I applied some on before bed and within 10 min I could sense that my skin doesn’t feel right. I touched my upper left cheek and noticed bumps appearing all of a sudden and my entire face felt so uncomfortable. I had to wash my face off right away. Definitely returning this. The packaging is cute and that’s basically it for me. Bummer. nan
