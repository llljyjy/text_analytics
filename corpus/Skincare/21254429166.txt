I have used the Clarins Double serum several times this week, and really  love the soothing effect it has on my skin. Itâ€™s light, non greasy, and seems to prep my skin for my makeup perfectly. Alternatively, I have used it after washing my face before bed, and the same result, non greasy, soothing effect on my skin. A must have for part of the anti-aging routine!
