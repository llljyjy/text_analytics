I like this product, it’s not greasy and goes on smoothly.  It’s not inexpensive, which I wouldn’t mind except that the packaging is ridiculous, poorly designed and wasteful.  I won’t be purchasing this again until/unless Tatcha develops a more sensible and functional container.  I don’t need or want a bottle that’s pretty, but flakes, can’t be stood up on its own, and shoots out expensive liquid sunscreen at the slightest pressure.  Who designed this anyway??? Like product, Hate container
