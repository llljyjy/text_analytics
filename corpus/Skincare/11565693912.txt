Most clay masks are too drying for me and leave me feeling uncomfortable, but this mask isn’t drying like those others. The mask feels like bouncy putty and doesn’t dry down completely, but can be hard to wash off. I find that it does a good job reducing oil around my nose where i usually get clogged pores. If you’re looking for a really unique clay mask, definitely check this out. nan
