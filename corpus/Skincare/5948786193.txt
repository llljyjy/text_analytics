I don’t write reviews unless I feel very strongly about a product and this one has really changed my life. After going off birth control, I had a weird smell and mild discomfort. I had gone to the gyno several times and they assured me there was no infection and that everything was “normal“. Knowing my body, I knew this wasn’t the case. I tried this product as I was quickly losing hope and IT WORKS! No more smell or discomfort whatsoever. I will be a lifetime user of this product! It really works!
