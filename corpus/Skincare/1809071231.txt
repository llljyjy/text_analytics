I like this product for the price. It’s gentle and does the job for a first cleanse. I could use it on its own in the morning, but I always follow with a second cleanse at night. I personally don’t mind the smell. If this cost any more than it did, I would give this 3 stars. But it’s a good cleansing balm for how cheap it is. great product for the price
