I enjoyed this set that was sent to me for free from Influenster. I like that it allowed me to try many different products in one. My favorites were the Hydrating Face Moisturizer and the De-Puff Eye Renewal Serum. The moisturizer kept my face feeling hydrated all day long and I noticed a difference with my dark circles after using the de-puffing serum. I love that the products are clean and cruelty free. However, I think the price point is a little high for the size of the products you get in this kit. Fun Discovery Set!
