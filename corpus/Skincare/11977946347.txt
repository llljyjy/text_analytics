I will give this 4 stars only because there are a few things I’d change about the product in order to use it more frequently. This formula is quite dense in that it requires you to rub it into your skin for a while. I’m huge on scents with products and this one had an interesting one. It wasn’t awful but didn’t agree with my taste in scents. I did feel that this product performed well on my skin. I usually use the CeraVe Moisturizer which is also a little bit more dense but this one felt more slick and didn’t sit on the skin like I feel like the CeraVe one does. All in all, I like this. I don’t know that I’d reach for it as a staple though. Good!
