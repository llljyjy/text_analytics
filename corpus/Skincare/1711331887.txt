This cleanser is amazing - washes off all of my makeup better than cleansers that I’ve tried that are triple the price.  Leaves my skin feeling super clean.  But please Tarte, switch back to your old packaging/Rainforest of the Sea marketing… these new bottles are so dull and boring, totally take away from the appeal the originals had.  Such a shame Love this product, miss the old packaging!!!
