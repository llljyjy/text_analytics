Iâ€™ve been using the Cookies N Clean Whipped Clay Detox Face Mask with Salicylic Acid for about 2 weeks (3x per week) and absolutely love it.  The mask is silky smooth with little charcoal balls that dissolve as you massage it into your skin.  After washing off the mask, my face is silky smooth, I can see that my large pores are clean and seem to be shrinking.  I have sensitive skin an am usually prone to breakouts, but have not experienced any breakouts with this mask. Love it! Love This Face Mask
