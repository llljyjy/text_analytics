This moisturizer is great for combo skin. Iâ€™m dry in some areas and oily in my t zone, so finding the perfect moisturizer is tough, so this moisturizer really helps combat both while leaving my face hydrated and soft. The glow is immaculate and the texture of the cream is almost gel like but once rubbed in is like water! The ingredient list is also great and the scent is very light with natural scents. Love love love this moisturizer! Feels like water
