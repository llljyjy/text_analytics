I love serums. I have tried a lot of serums and I’m happy that I was chosen to try this product for free. I’m now in my 40’s and I’m doing skincare a little bit more than before because of aging. I need more skincare products to help lessen signs of aging and can help my skin be moisturized and hydrated. With a few times that I have tried this product, my skin didn’t react badly and again with continuous usage, that’s when I can say if the product works or not for me. Will add to my routine
