iâ€™ve tried a couple other affordable retinols and really saw no difference. i have purchased this twice now and can really tell and feel it is working! (i am 23 and saw early signs of aging around my eyes, i also have VERY dry skin) i use once a day at nighttime followed with a heavy moisturizer and sometimes aquaphor. this woks.
