No one tells you when you microblade your eyebrows that it’s bad for the skin. Well the damage from all the little cuts is bad for the skin. I’ve gotten very dry and flakey eyebrow skin. The flakey skin is so unattractive. I’m also 52 years old with some crows feet. I really like this eye cream for a couple of reasons. One it’s light so It goes on and absorbs easily without an oily look, which is good for my eyebrows. Two it prevents makeup around my eyes for getting cakey and settling into my crows feet. It has no smell. Recommend! Lightweight and Effective
