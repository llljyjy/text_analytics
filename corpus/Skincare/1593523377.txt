I am not prone to breakouts and have never had any problems with acne so I was at a loss when winter weather started causing major skin problems for me. I had a patch of stubborn acne that has lasted almost 3 months now and I had tried everything. I went into Sephora to ask for recommendations and the SA immediately grabbed this after describing the problem. I’m so glad I trusted him because it’s the only thing that has immediately made a difference in the appearance and severity of my breakout.  It is a spot treatment and does have a clay mask texture so I wear it thick at night but rubbed in during the day. 4 days into using it and it’s made a world of difference. It feels a bit pricey but it’s a spot treatment so amount you get will last quite awhile. When nothing else worked
