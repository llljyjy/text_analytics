Been trying a lot of mineral sunscreens recently since Replenix discontinued my favorite one, and I really like this one. Surprisingly, despite the lack of tint, there is no white cast on my light brown skin (my tone is like Halle Berry). It gets absorbed nicely (after about 5 mins) and feels a bit tacky (which I don’t mind) - it is not just sitting on the surface of my skin so it does not collect in my fine lines and does not just rub off when I touch my face. It does leave a slight shine but it’s way less than all the other mineral sunscreens I have tried (except the Supergoop Matte Sunscreen which has no shine at all). I can use a generous layer of this on my face and know I am protected well from the sun without looking like a super shiny ghost. Gets absorbed, no white cast on light brown skin
