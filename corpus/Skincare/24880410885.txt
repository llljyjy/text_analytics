Ok so this stuff in the beginning feels a bit like your spreading Vaseline under your eyes in the color and the texture kind of, except the texture is more silky and less sticky. And it works amazing for under eyes!! I also used it on different parts of my face that were inflamed and red or dry and it did miracles! My nose was red and has been a good chunk of my life and a day after I used this on my face it was showing huge improvements! Like things I hadn’t ever seen my face look like my whole life!!! I also suffer from skin picking when I’m stressed and this has helped my face heal quick and beautifully!!! Works for more then just the eyes!!
