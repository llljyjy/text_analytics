My skin type is dry, and I apply mist spray when feeling so dry after make-up done. I feel like this spray makes my skin feel even drier after the mist evaporates quickly. Then I have to apply the mist again to feel the dryness consequently. I donâ€™t think it does anything specially good to my skin. My skin feels even drier
