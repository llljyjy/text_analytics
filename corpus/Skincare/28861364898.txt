This is a mask unlike any I’ve ever used before. It did have 2 films on it. I peeled 1 off and then laid it on my face and made application super easy instead of mask folding in on itself. It smelled really good to me. The thing is the longer it sat it was like it was melting into my face. Like becoming one with my skin. Sucked itself right in. Most masks just sit on top of your skin but this became my skin. Doesn’t feel like a normal sheet mask either but also didn’t feel like a gel mask. It’s hard to explain. I didn’t want this mask but it was cheap and got me free shipping and now I think I would buy again for sure. Using at bedtime so I can’t say anything about the mattifying but I like it. It’s almost like it turns into a “peel off” mask it’s so sucked into my skin. Not your average mask
