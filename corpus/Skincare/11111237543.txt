I LOVE THIS! My face gets dry and this helps a lot. I was expecting it to be an oil but thank gosh it isn’t because I’m not fond of oily products that make me look shiny and feel uncomfortable. This is light weight and once you put it on your face it sinks into your skin and you feel 100% hydrated. I paired it with my Laneige Cream Skin Mist. Together they are keeping my face at its best for the rest of the day. I also recommend the Innisfree clay mask as well! It smooths out my skin. It’s a little irritating to my skin. I’m allergic to something but nothing severe and would use it with caution. My skin is on the sensitive side and trying new things that my skin can tolerate is the best it can get. :) LOVE THIS
