Every single serum I’ve ever tried has made me break out in hives all over my face and neck. This serum has been my HOLY GRAIL in my skincare routine AM and PM. I got a sample of this product for Christmas, and instantly noticed a different the next day. I get really dry, REALLY red no irritated skin, especially during the winter, and I couldn’t even believe how clear, moisturized, and not red my face looked the next day. I always rub the product in my hands like a lotion and them pat my face and neck with my hands so it’s not overloaded on my skin, and I can’t believe the difference it has made for my skin. I ended up buying the biggest size I could because I love it so much. The smell is weird at first but seriously goes away the minute you put it on. It’s very earthy, so if you don’t like that smell, wash your hands after. Seriously I can’t recommend this product enough if your skin rejects every other product under the sun!! nan
