I have beginning stages of lines and dryness under eye.  I usually only apply at night to avoid product affecting my makeup. As a result i found my skin was slightly smoother in the am and it also absorbed nicely if I applied makeup after. little to no scent is a plus for me. Looking forward to the long term effects. Little goes a long way
