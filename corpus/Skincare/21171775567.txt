I have never had such a luxurious product before!  I have been using it for a few weeks now and after less than a week, I started  to see less fine lines, smooth supple skin and and wonderful glow. And the way it moisterizes my skin... *swoon* My skin has transformed and feels amazing!  It melts into my face and let me tell you my skin loves this product!  I use it morning and night after cleansing and applying witch hazel toner, then apply this product, then face cream to seal the deal. A little goes a long way IMHO and I have plenty of product left. I would never have given this a chance if it wasnâ€™t  given to me to try and I am so glad I got it! This is IT!
