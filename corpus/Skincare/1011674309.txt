I already trust and love the Shiseido brand, so I already had high hopes for this product. The packaging is vibrant, and the actual sunscreen tube is sleek and modern. The orange cap is quite sturdy, so I feel comfortable keeping this in my bag daily for reapplying, and it absorbs into your skin effortlessly. The SPF 42 is perfect for my fair skin, and I love that it lists sun protection measures to help avoid the sunâ€™s harmful rays! This sunscreen is best for daily use and not for swimming or sweating, so keep that in mind. Overall, I love this line - kudos to Shiseido for helping me protect my skin. Love this Sunscreen!
