Really enjoying it. It’s simple, but that’s why I like it. I use Tretinoin and already had sensitive skin anyways so I need simple, non-irritating products. When I wash my face, I don’t dry it after and just apply 3 drop of this immediately and let it sit. This isn’t a solve-all - I still apply moisturizer and sometimes Vaseline on top, but this definitely helps. And it doesn’t make my face red or sensitive at all which is a huge perk. When it’s dry, not sticky or anything. nan
