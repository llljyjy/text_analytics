I really love this cleanser as part of my morning routine. It has a nice creamy texture that makes my skin feel clean, but still hydrated after using. My skin tends to feel more dry in the winter and I don’t want it to feel dried out after washing. This cleanser doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. nan
