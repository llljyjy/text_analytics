I received this product for free from Influenster and Lancome in exchange for my honest review.I was incredibly impressed with this product! I had always heard that Lancome products were heavily heavily fragranced so I was nervous about trying this. It was not that strong at all and was actually a very pleasant fragrance. The idea of having three serums in one bottle is so nice. It makes my skincare routine really quick. At first I thought it left my face feeling a little sticky, but the more I used the product the better it got. I felt like my skin was glowing after just two uses! The only criticism I have is that it was hard to get all 3 serums to come out at the same time. Easy fix though, I just stored it upside down. Highly recommend this! Excellent serum!
