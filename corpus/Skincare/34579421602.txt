Wow, I am really surprised by this product! Not only has this product probably one of the cleanest formulas, this eye cream really works!!! Let me tell you lil about my skin and my issues with the skin under my eyes. I have very dry and sensitive skin. Also, I am a first time mom, and my baby is 10 months old and I don’t know what sleep is anymore! Not only is the skin under my eyes dark (due to lack of sleep), it is also puffy! I have been using this „magic cream“ for only one week and I really love it so far! I am an aesthetician, and I have tried many face and eye products, and this Vitamin C & Collagen eye cream is by far one of the best ones I have tried! The texture is very important for me! My skin needs a lot of moisture and boost, I get it all from this cream! The texture is very silky and has a lil shine to it, it is lightweight and does not grease! Specially, for summer, it is a perfect product! I will definitely buy this product!!! Absolutely beautiful
