I was gifted this in exchange for my honest review. I have normal-to-dry skin and found this to be drying, although not terribly. I liked the light texture and the scent, which is mild and earthy, but my skin felt tight after using. I truly think for those with normal-to-oily or oily skin this would be perfect. The pump bottle is very nice and I love it when great products are available in travel sizes. It wonâ€™t replace my usual cleanser but I think it might for some. Lovely but not for me.
