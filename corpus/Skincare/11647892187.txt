At first I was a bit iffy about buying this product after a couple reviews Ive seen however I decided to go for it. I love it ! Ive been using it for about a week now and it has made my skin so much better. Im currently on tretinoin and that would make my skin flake so bad specially around my mouth but I have not experienced any flaky skin since ive started using this moisturizer. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy or greasy on the skin but it does give that dewy hydrated look. I have mostly oily skin but I love this moisturizer buy ittt !!
