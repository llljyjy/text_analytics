I really loved this moisturizer!  My skin is normally dry to very dry, and I work in a hospital which means my skin gets drier as the day goes on.  But not with this moisturizer!  My skin stays hydrated and comfortable all day.  Overall my face feels firmer and softer.  I didn’t get enough of a sample to notice a significant improvement in my lines but I did notice my lines looked a little softer while I was using it.  The cons: it doesn’t contain SPF, and the price is kinda high.  Otherwise I’d definitely recommend!  I received this product as a sample in exchange for my review. LOVE this moisturizer!  Must have!
