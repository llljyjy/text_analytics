Between being Wonder Bread white and medication I’m SUPER prone to burning really easily. I went on vacation and needed a good solid sunscreen so I wouldn’t have to check my bag. This stuff came through in a big way, I just smeared it on every morning and never once got burned. I forgot to reapply but I was out in the middle of the Caribbean not avoiding the sun at all and this stuff worked amazingly well. Bonus, it’s Reef Safe so you can take it to all those places where you need to specifically have Reef Safe Sunscreen. Worth it
