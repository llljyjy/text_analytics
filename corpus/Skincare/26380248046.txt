I bought a mini size of this product with a set and I LOVE this sunscreen. this is my ONLY go-to facial sunscreen for the summer. I use it under makeup and OMG it provides a dewy, glowy finish without looking oily at all! my skin literally looks like glass when using this product. I feel so confident and gorgeous when looking in the mirror after application, I love it (cannot emphasize my love for this product enough). while the spf could be higher, I understand for the sake of the glowy effect, a higher spf might cause white cast rather than the dewy-look it’s going for. with that small complaint aside, I’m absolutely astonished, impressed and shocked by this sunscreen and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a sunscreen during the summer! DEWY, GLASSY, GLOSSY, GLOWY FINISH.. FR
