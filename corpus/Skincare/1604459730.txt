This product is packaged nicely and you can use a minimal amount with high impact.  My skin has been very dry lately with crazy weather in the northeast and this eye cream worked wonders.  My under eye area was instantly soft and soothed.  I don’t think I’ve been using long enough to see a huge difference in fine lines yet, but my family commented on how rested I’ve been looking, so I take that as a good sign of things to come. Great product for a rested, youthful look
