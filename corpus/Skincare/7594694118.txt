This Lancome Renergie H.C.F. Anti-Aging Triple Serum is a brilliant idea. The 3 serums are in separate chambers until you pump it and they all come out at the same time. You mix them together and apply them to your clean face and neck. The serum is not oily at all, and it doesn’t cause pilling. It was easy to incorporate into my daily routine and I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now.The results I got after using this for a brief time have been OK. I did not notice any differences in my fine lines and wrinkles. It’s most likely too soon to see results, but I did not feel as if this firmed my face instantly like other products I’ve tried.I have noticed a huge improvement of my complexion and my skin feels more hydrated than it had. I have dry and flaky skin and this product completely eliminates that for me. The price is a bit absurd, in my opinion. Maybe I will feel differently after using this product for a longer period of time, however, I can most likely achieve this same result with cheaper products. It wasn’t a WOW for me.To summarize - the product hydrated my skin, was easy to incorporate into my daily routine, and improved my overall complexion. It did not make any difference in the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles - but it may be too soon to tell. nan
