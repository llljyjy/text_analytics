I use eye cream daily (in the morning and before bed). I typically just use something that is moisturizing - maybe some brightening. This was the first time I used something that was *more*. The texture is very nice and absorbs quickly without being sticky. However, I didn’t notice it making much of a difference in my eye area. It’s a good product, just may not be right for me right now. nan
