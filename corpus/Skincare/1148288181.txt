I was excited about this product as I am always about Tatcha products but this is a hot mess. Packaging probably the worst ever. Paint comes off when you hold it and it us all over your hands. Tips over and spills constantly. The sunscreen feels nice and it is nice but not worth the aggravation. I would not recommend nor would buy it again. Tatcha you could do better for that money. nan
