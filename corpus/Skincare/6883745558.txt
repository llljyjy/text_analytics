I’ve been using this treatment every night for over one month. I am a big skincare enthusiast and have tried so many skincare products at this point that it us not even funny lol. I usually feel good about product made by professionals in the industry and I also expect a lot from them. This one was very mediocre. It didn’t make my skin worse but also not necessarily better. The packaging is nice and convenient, the product feels awesome on my skin but I just didn’t notice any difference in my skin. It definitely didn’t tackle any redness or blemishes/pores. My skin seems somehow smoother but that’s about it. Not enough results for me to purchase again unfortunately. nan
