It is hydrating with a light scent & feels nice on your skin. It helps with the few dry patches I get & keeps moisture in. I used this for over a month & didn’t notice any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles. I can’t say it’s good for anti aging or prevention. So I wouldn’t recommend because there are better products out there. nan
