I love YTTP. The only reasons I am giving a 3 star review is because I need more time to see true results and I do wish the yellow tone would dissipate on the skin a bit more quickly (I have light skin and a neutral yellow undertone and this makes me looks super yellow for hours). I do like how it feels on the skin. Itâ€™s very light and hydrating. It leaves a nice healthy skin glow right after use. Im excited to see my skin improve over time. So far so good!
