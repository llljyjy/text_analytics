I am on my second tube of this, and honestly Iâ€™ll always have it in my kit. I will start off by saying, the smell is not good. but that does not bother me, but I know it can be off-putting to others. but this stuff works! so I can get past the smell. I use this on my dark spots, and there are times where I have a spot appearing in the same area as some of my dark spots. I notice that when I apply it, it stops that spot in its tracks, and it makes it shrink and go away ! I love this stuff! the packaging is not my favorite, it tends to continuously ooze out, but I keep mine in my skincare fridge and it seems to help a bit. would love if the packing was different, then it would be perfect all around! give it a try!!! will always have this in my kit!
