I received this for free to try from Influenster. I have oily skin and I do like this moisturizer! Not greasy and I can use it every day with no irritation or issues. Can I say that it significantly helped brighten my face up? That I’m not really sure about to be honest. It soaks up nicely and makes my skin feel nice but I just took one star off because I didn’t really see a difference in brightness, which this claims to do. Still really like it overall though and will continue to use! :) Overall good!
