This is not your normal sunscreen - it is a glowy face gel that not only provides SPF but also protects from pollution and blue light (making it a must have for indoors and outdoors). It doesn’t clog pores, is a non-greasy gel making it feel light and cool on the skin, it wears well under makeup or on its own and it gives your skin the dreamiest glow.  This isn’t another face sunscreen with a highlighter, it is packed with probiotics to lock in moisture and protect the skin barriers, has papaya and pineapple to promote even skin tone and ginger root to protect against blue light (so essential while we are inside working from home or maybe watching a little extra TV with the kids!). It moisturizes when it needs to and just really evens out your skin. I will mention that its not overly moisturizing either because I have problems with that too. I use my regular face cream let that dry and sink in and then apply the sunscreen over my moisturizer.It also helps to reduce redness in my skin and even out my skin tone. I noticed this within a few days of using the product! My skin was less red and old scarring I had on my skin was slowly starting to minimize. It’s one of the only products that I’ve seen that works and so quickly at that!Overall, my skin feels so smooth and very supple. I feel hydrated, but not overly hydrated. This product helps my skin to know what I need throughout the day and reacts to the changing climates. nan
