I used it as a part of my night routine and def saw a boost in brightness, and long lasting hydration. I didn’t see as much of an improvement in my 11s as I was hoping, but was NOT mad about the compliments I was getting on my complexion. DONT let the initial stickiness fool you, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly w/ no sticky feeling. I’m not sure how it will act once the 100 degree summers start, but a great boost in the dry winter months and worth adding to the routine when needed. nan
