I’ve been using Clinique’s 3 step system for more than a decade, and I’m so disappointed with this new formula. The original version was super gentle, but also powerful enough to remove makeup and other impurities. This new version can’t even handle what little mascara I have on after I use their eye makeup remover, which is also awful. Why mess with a good thing?
