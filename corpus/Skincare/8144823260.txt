I recently started using the Silk Rice cleansing oil and I love how it leaves my skin.   Two pumps is all I needed to cleanse my whole face and take off my makeup.  It worked very effectively. It leaves my face smooth and hydrated without leaving it greasy. I have switched my cleansing balm and Incorporated the cleansing oil in my skin care routine. It has exceeded my expectations. Leaves my skin silky smooth
