I’ve tried a few cleansing balms, and had not found one I liked.  The Bye Bye Makeup Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm was just what I was looking for.  It took off all of my makeup, and left my skin moisturized, something no other cleansing balm I’ve tried has been able to do.  Scent is great, also.  I was worried the large size would not last very long, but a little bit goes a long way. Balm Believer
