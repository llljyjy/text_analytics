I really like the way the mask feels on the skin!!! The cool sensation it felt like it was cleaning up my pores and all the gunk and build up. It was a smooth finish once I removed it. It wasn’t messy like other clay mask I’ve used before it was easy to clean. My face is smooth and not drying. I would see much more results if I use this frequently but for this one time use I loved it!! nan
