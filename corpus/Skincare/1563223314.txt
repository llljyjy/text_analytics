I received this serum as a gift from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. This was such a great surprise to receive! I’ve really enjoyed using this serum at night. I haven’t used it during the day at all because it leaves a little bit of a tacky feeling behind. I do feel like my skin has been more radiant and that’ my dark spots are fading faster. Haven’t noticed lifting benefits yet, but haven’t used it very long yet. The only thing I don’t like about this is the fragrance. It is extremely strong and reminds me of an old perfume. But the feeling is very luxurious! nan
