I LOVE this product! I have Rosacea and a very oily T-zone but everywhere else is extremely dry. This product is safe for sensitive skin (although I never use the mask on my cheeks). I use this in the morning or before Iâ€™m about to go out and it makes my nose squeaky clean. I definitely notice a difference if I forget to use this every other day my nose is soooooooo shiny and full of sebaceous pores. nan
