I don’t think I have ever written a review but immediately no. The original formula is by FAR superior. I’m actually pretty upset about it because finding a really good moisturizer is hard to come by for my dry skin. The other formula left my skin feeling supple and dewy, meanwhile this one is just awful, my skin feels dry and I could tell that would be the case just from the application and feel of it. The artificial fragrance is too strong and I could smell it on my face. Needless to say, I’ll be searching for the OG until it no longer exists. this suck
