The first thing I noticed  was the fragrance. Love it! It smells like my preferred Dior’s perfume , Poison. When I put I’m my hand it was so soft and creamy. It felt wonderful on my skin. It washed off easily and left my skin smooth, nice and fresh feeling.   It didn’t have a stripped feeling at all. I think it is really a treat in the evening, before bed. nan
