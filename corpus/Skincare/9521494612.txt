Great product. With some hyaluronic acid serums, you have to use quite a bit to feel hydrated, but this one is great and doesnâ€™t take so much of the product to spread across the face, so great formulation! I use this as a treatment right after I tone my skin, and follow up with either a chemical spf (daytime) after or heavier moisturizer (night time) Great Serum!
