my bf is in his late 20s, has oily skin but not much acne. he started noticing heavy crows feet and was self conscious about how much older he was looking. I bought this for him and within a week the grooves of his wrinkles lessened. after a month of using he looked five years younger. he continues to use it 3 x weekly to avoid irritation and dryness. I just got him a second bottle after 3 months of modest use. letâ€™s just say this is a staple for him my boyfriend loves this
