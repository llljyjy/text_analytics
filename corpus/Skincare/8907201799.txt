It’s exactly what I was looking for, which is somthing to put between layers or on top of my makeup in the winter when my skin gets DRY. It does this nicely, I use it to blend in my foundation sometime too. Lovely, especially for the price, but if you’re looking for something actually luminous, I’d go for the innisfree dewy glow mist. Moisture!
