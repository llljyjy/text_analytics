I have combo dry skin, and when it’s hot-humid-sticky weather, I get tiny zit like bumps around my T-zone.  Needless to say, this toner is used for this weather.My skincare routine is catered to the seasons, so it changes as needed. I don’t wash my face with soap twice a day, I do it once a day so I don’t strip away too much of my natural oils. I feel like this toner could have a higher performance potential on healthy “skin barriers”. I didn’t get this to “shrink” my pores, rather I got this to protect my pores from clogging invasions from a multitude of foreign threats.  I like to apply this toner after light exfoliation to avoid dead skin cells from teaming up together and clumping. I do get a light tingling sensation when applied, and I do notice some shine control where my problem pores are. It helped reduce the look of enlarged pores. I like to spread the product and lightly pat the product into my skin where I need a bit more help. I like that it has vitamin C and niacinamide, so it’s a pretty good summer toner to apply for improved spf benefits from sun protection.I personally wouldn’t use this toner on dryer weather like winter. My go-to is Laneige or Fresh for that. This product works for me, and good luck for people still looking for a product that can work for them. Great seasonal toner for humid weather
