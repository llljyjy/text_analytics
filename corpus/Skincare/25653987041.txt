I didnâ€™t know what to think when I saw I had to make my own moisturizer.  But it was really simple to mix up.  Turned an interesting green color that had no real scent.  It feels weird smoothing on your skin, almost grainy but that sensation passes as you rub it on.  It absorbs quickly, with a long lasts hydrated feeling.  Leaves the skin soft and supple. The fine lines around my eyes look softer.  I had no sensitivity or redness.  I really liked it nan
