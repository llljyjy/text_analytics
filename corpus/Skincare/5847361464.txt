I was pleased with this product. I was sent some testers and I loved how it blended well on my skin. It felt smooth and didn’t leave the skin oily. So smooth and blended under foundation, and overall I am happy with this product. Recommend if you’re looking for something light to wear under your makeup or for everyday wear. Smooth and light.
