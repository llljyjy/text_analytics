Exactly what I hoped it would be before trying. Very light weight! Beautiful glass bottle! Very lux(as it should be lol) The nozzle sprays SO fine I can barely feel it hitting my face, like barely! I actually have to glance in the mirror to see if any is coming out lol I do like that it’s not blasting my face, but I’m using prob more product than necessary. BUT it leaves such a nice subtle glow no matter how much you use! It does hydrate some too. I have normal/dry skin and need quite a bit of hydration. My face tends to feel tight and dry towards the afternoon. This helped lessen the feeling of tight/dry skin and gave me a healthy glow. It does not leave a greasy residue at all and can be used at anytime of the day. It refreshes my makeup too. It is fragranced, but I don’t think it’s that strong, I’m not sensitive to scents though. The scent doesn’t linger and I can’t smell it after it dries down. I really like it! Light + glowy ✨
