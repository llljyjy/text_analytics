I personally don’t tan. However, after seeing some people of color on tiktok show that self tanner made their skin more vibrant, I was willing to try. I’m mixed, so the thought of tanning never crossed my mind. I used this product and it really didn’t do much for me. It is moisturizing, but that was it for me. I tried this on someone who has fairer skin, and it worked nicely on them. Overall, the smell is nice, but it didn’t do much for me! it’s okay
