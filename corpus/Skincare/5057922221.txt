I was a little hesitant about this product since I normally use a gel moisturizer in the hot and humid months, but I was pleasantly surprised! I recently was out in the sun all weekend and noticed many new freckles/sun damage on my face. After using this cream for about two weeks I noticed a significant decrease in color and amount of freckles. This product kept my skin moisturized without making it greasy and I really enjoy it! It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way and I can see this product lasting quite a while. Wonderful for combo skin!
