I am a huge clean beauty fan, especially when it comes to skincare. And this cream contains so many amazing clean, natural, botanical ingredients! My skin just drinks up this luxurious cream. The application feels so decadent, it feels so decadent applying it in my nighttime routine. The fatty acids smooth my lines and leave my cheeks supple and bouncy. Canâ€™t ask for more than that!If you have a preference for fragrance-free products, bear in mind that this cream is heavily fragranced. If you like fragranced creams, you will love this cream! It would be great if there was a fragrance-free version for sensitive people, but that is the only thing I would change. A decadent part of my night skincare routine
