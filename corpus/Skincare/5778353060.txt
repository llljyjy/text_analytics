i have sensitive and combination skin. the canadian winter weather has made my face extremely dry and after using this for a few weeks, my skin is nowhere near as dry as it used to be! it foams up really nicely and doesnâ€™t have a perfumey scent which is amazing! a little truly goes a long way with this product. i will forever continue purchasing this all time favourite
