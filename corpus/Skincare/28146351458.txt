I received a sample of this as a birthday gift with purchase. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin but I have been able to keep my skin clear with my skin care routine. I didn’t hesitate to try this rice wash because I’ve heard only good things about Tatcha but after only 2 uses I started to break out. The wash has a good smell and mildly exfoliating texture. It cleanses well without leaving a residue or causing dryness but I wouldn’t recommend this wash for people who have sensitive or acne prone skin. Don't use if you have sensitive or acne prone skin
