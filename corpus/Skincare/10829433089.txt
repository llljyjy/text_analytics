First time for me to use a whitening product  and I’m so glad to have been given the opportunity to try and test it.  This is purported to be the only dentist invented, clinically proven teeth whitening device. The instruction is pretty straightforward . It’s easy and painless to use but requires to do 3 consecutive 8 - minute sessions for 5 days. While this may appear  cumbersome but in  reality it’s not since the device can be used hands-free so you can keep multi-tasking while you whiten and a built in treatment countdown timer. I love the vegan, safe and sensitivity-free whitening gel used with the device which contains 6% hydrogen peroxide; safe to use on crowns, bridges, and veneers. Its also recyclable and made in USA. Im still in the middle of  my 5 day regimen and so far so good.  This is a good quality product and the price does reflect it. Good Quality Product
