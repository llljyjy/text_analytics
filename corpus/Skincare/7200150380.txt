This sunscreen is truly invisible, and honestly I enjoy the scent as well, it’s not strong at all and smells better than sunscreen, the packaging was amazing, and quality of product is important to me as well and appearance and it checks the boxes, it’s not thick, but it’s not extremely watery, MAKE SURE TO SHAKE!!! When squeezing out don’t apply too much pressure it comes out so easily (the photo attached is me with the sunscreen on, no white cast) I love the nice glow! And the smaller bottle is perfect travel size, this truly is what it says it is, I definitely think it’s worth the money especially for this bundle ! POC FRIENDLY!
