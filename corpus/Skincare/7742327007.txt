Okay so when this comes out of the bottle I looked at it and was thinking wow thatâ€™s def not my colour. BUT using a brush to blend this into moisturized skin gives a nice glow and slightly tanned look. You can use just this and leave the house or do a more in depth look with some blush, highlight, etc. Would totally buy again. Blend, Blend, Blend.
