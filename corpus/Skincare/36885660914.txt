i have been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks and i still have mixed thoughts.PROs- lathers very well, my face feels clean and very moisturized after my shower, doesnt dry out my skin.CONS- The smell is awful and the open acne on my face burns! I’m not sure if I would repurchase it’s a good cleanser but not worth the money in my opinion. Moisturizing Cleanser
