I received a sample of this moisturizer for free from Influenster provided I test and review the product. This moisturizer is very light and absorbs fairly quickly into the skin, which I like. There is no heavy scent either and it paired well with my foundation (mufe) there will no pilling at all. I liked that my skin was hydrated throughout the day. Great overall moisturizer
