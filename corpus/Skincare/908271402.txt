Oh wow, I love how hydrating this recovery balm is!! I tried to make note of a scent, but there is none, or itâ€™s so mild I cannot smell it, which is great.  It did not make my skin breakout which is another great plus.  I thought it would go on thick and greasy, but it is quickly absorbed into the skin.  I used a little less on my face because a little goes a long way.  I have found myself using it on dry areas on my arms and legs and it leaves them so hydrated.  My skin stays hydrated for hours.  I love using it at night before bed and waking up with such fresh and moisturized skin.  My dry skin is loving this! Hydrating, moisturizing, for face and body!
