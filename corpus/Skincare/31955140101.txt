I received this in a bundle of samples I purchased and I was rather unimpressed. This is a gel moisturizer, so I found this product to sit on the skin rather than soak in. It would be better to use before bed and not during the day under your makeup. If you wear foundation, I would pass on this moisturizer. Meh
