Truly one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever tried. It is very rich and you need the smallest amount to have a super plumped and bouncy skin. I’ve been trying it for about a month now using it at night time and it truly is rich. This one is perfect for the winter days when your skin gets really dry. My skin has been loving it. Skin feels even, plumped and very hydrating. #freeproduct it has a very mild scent that I don’t mind at all. It almost smells like roses but when I say mild I mean it’s not noticeable once applied.
