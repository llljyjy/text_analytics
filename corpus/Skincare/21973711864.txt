I received this product and I tried it as it claimed to be oil free SPF lotion and light along with hydration benefits. I was amazed with the description and it’s hard to find oil free SPF and trust me it actually is working and proving all the claims and works as wonderful SPF with light and natural coverage. If you don’t want tint in your SPF this is the best one. I wear it as my everyday SPF lotion two benefits with one and saves me money as I don’t need to spend on lotion separately. It’s good quality and quantity as compared to other brands and you got options to choose like from tint to no tint. I would definitely buy it again and would recommend as it is must buy. Only thing I did not liked is that it you need to blend it well and it takes little longer but it’s worth it. I always keep it with me while going to work, beach and other fun places.
