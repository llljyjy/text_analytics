I started using this a few weeks ago as I’m in my mid 40s and started noticing dark circles and bags under my eyes. Within a few weeks I started to see improvement under my eyes. I knew longer have the bags and dark circles are improving. The texture of this is not sticky at all and you only need a little bit each night. It might seem expensive for a little jar but you don’t have to use a lot to see improvements. Saw improvements in a few weeks
