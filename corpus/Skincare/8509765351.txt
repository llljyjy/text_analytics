I’ve been using this product for a few weeks and I’m loving it so far. I have sensitive skin so I started using this twice a week and have increased to every other night. It has helped smooth out the texture I had on my forehead and chin and makes my skin feel smooth and plump. It has relatively no scent which I love and it absorbs quickly leaving no greasy residue behind. It layers under my moisturizer beautifully. Got rid of my textured t-zone
