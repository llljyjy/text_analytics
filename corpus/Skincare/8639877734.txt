I used this daily for 5+ days. It soaks in really well but it soaks in especially well when you really take the time to rub it in or you use a light tool, jade roller, etc to really get it in there! As soon as it has fully set in, you can FEEL the difference. Not greasy, just soft, smooth, and what I imagine healthy skin would feel like. I like to put it on before my moisturizer and primer in the mornings. Feels like exactly what my skin needed
