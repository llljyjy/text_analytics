Still on the fence about this product. I have used it for a little over 2 weeks not seeing any difference with age spots. Going to try it for a couple months if no change may try a different product. Josie Maran products didn’t work on age spots either. I am a licensed esthetician and have tried so many products none of them do what they say they do. We shall see if this product gets better results over the next 2 weeks. The dropper is a problem. I don’t like the design! I was told this line of products is very good by more then one person. on the fence
