A sample packet came with a recent Sephora online order purchased by myself, so I tried it out and oh boy, it is orange, stinky and made my face very greasy. I think it was the medium shade. Iâ€™m used to how fake tan smells but this was pumped up to an almost burnt rubber smell. Mostly I was shocked at how orange and greasy I looked so definitely not a full size buy for me. nan
