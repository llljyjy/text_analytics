This product has been a life saver for the winter. I apply it right after toning and I feel like it really helps keep my skin hydrated throughout the day and evening. If you have dry skin, this is a great product to use. I’m not sure how it would do on oily skin, but I can say that this product doesn’t feel like it’s sitting on top and not being absorbed. There is no smell to it and it has a nice texture. Winter Staple
