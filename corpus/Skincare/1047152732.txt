I really liked the texture and consistency of this serum! I’ve been wanting to start using an eye cream but didn’t feel like I was ready for something too heavy and this was perfect! I love the applicator and how it cools and depicts. My only complaint is the squeeze tube. I wish it was a colicky pen or something that controlled the amount of product dispensed. nan
