This product is great, because I love charcoal face masks but they usually irritate my skin. This was super easy to apply, it doesn’t take much per application, and it doesn’t bother my skin. I just applied a little bit of hydrating serum afterwards, and my skin feels more balanced than it ever has. I struggle with lily skin, so I’ve struggled finding the balance between taking too much oil out and drying my skin versus putting too much moisture in so my face feels greasy and icky. This is literally insane how quickly I got results and how easy it was to use. Great for balancing oily skin!!!
