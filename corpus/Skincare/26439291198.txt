Thank you Influenster for this complimentary product for my honest opinion! First off the package is high end looking and sealed tight with plastic so itâ€™s protected.. I opened it and it was very easy to get product onto my finger tips to apply to my face , it felt silky in my face and glides across my skin effortlessly, absorbs nice and really helped with my T-zone right away. I could tell through out the day how it kept my oily  zones moistureized and not adding to the oils in my face.. This is a ten out of ten for me a absolute must have!! Augustinus Badger light cream
