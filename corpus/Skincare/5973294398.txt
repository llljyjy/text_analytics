Five stars isn’t enough.  I had never heard of it. Although, it looks like a lot of the other reviewers had!  I thought it would just be a cream that cut down the redness before I put my foundation on.  I felt like one of those instagram ads where the person is applying the makeup and gasping (which I always thought were dumb.  Until now.). I have struggled with redness for YEEEEAAAARS.  And, even after I apply make up (I usually use MakeUp Forever or Dermablend) you can still kinda see the red through.  I am BLOWN away by this.  I never do reviews.  I literally had to make up a username just to post this one.  If you suffer from redness, you gotta give it a try.  I mean, I know not everything works for everyone.  And, I’m probably just super lucky that the shade I picked matches my skin perfectly.  But, man oh man,  I want to go buy a case and hoard it like a crazy person. YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!
