I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Every time I use this serum it makes me feel like I’m holding luxury in my hands. It’s just perfect. The gel like texture makes the serum absorb quickly into the skin, leaving your face feeling smooth and plump. It has a satin, slightly glowy finish, leaving a protective film on your skin. Not in a bad way - I suppose this is the moisture retention technology at play. Ever since I started using this serum, my skin has started looking healthier and more radiant. If you’re looking for hydration, radiance and a side of anti-aging effects, this serum is perfect for you! Power in every drop!
