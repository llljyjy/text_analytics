The nude skin 3 step is a really nice set to have when travelling or to try out the skincare line from nudeskin. The sizes are pretty small for the price but the products themselves are quite good! I love the make up melt as it is really good at removing my makeup and the daily moisturizer is the right consistency for a hydrated feel. The micro peel is also nice to use once a week! A great skincare kit
