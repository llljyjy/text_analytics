Did this product heal everything wrong with my skin? No. Did it add a majorly beneficial step to my routine? Heck yes! I travel for work a lot so that plus masks and dry winter air are a recipe for rough skin. This serum has really helped restore my skin when it’s parched and works great in conjunction with my retinol especially. As a licensed esthetician, I’m really picky, and didn’t really expect much from this product, but it’s amazing!!! nan
