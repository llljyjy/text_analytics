Hello ! I was sent this eye cream to test out from Influenster. You guys this eye cream is really nice . Which is not a surprise since Jlos skin look the way it does . There’s not much of scent and it goes on so smoothly without leaving a greasy residue . I have pretty oily skin and this product didn’t add to that issue for me . It soaks in fairly quickly and you are left with very smooth under eyes . This is something I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out . Holy grail eye cream
