Dr. Zenobia Peptide+Ceramide is a wonderful thick cream. Itâ€™s fast absorbing , non greasy and no pilling.                  I really liked the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer. It made my skin feel plump , hydrated and soothe the dryness of winter skin. No strong scent very rich and creamy.  Leaves the skin  ( especially fine lines ) feeling  plumper and firmer. It wears wonderful under makeup. Great for am and pm skin routine. nan
