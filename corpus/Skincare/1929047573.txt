This is really over priced, I got the trail size set with my points that came this cream, plus the la mer renewal oil. The cream on its own is not sufficient for a moisturizer it is a weird, thicker texture that does not spread well, even on wet skin. You absolutely need to use it with the oil. You can have the same or better results with a simple moisturizer on its own or with an oil like argon oil. I would not buy this product. Not a fan
