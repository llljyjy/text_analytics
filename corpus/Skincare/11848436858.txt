This entire line of acne products worked magic for me in 2020 when my mask-ne was in full swing. I tried so many other brands of acne clearing products & NOTHING worked. Just when I was about to give up, I tried Kate Somerville and I was shocked at how quickly my skin cleared. I used this lotion in conjunction with the Eradikate cleanser & spot treatment and my skin cleared within 3 weeks. The ONLY reason Iâ€™m giving this lotion 4 stars rather than 5 is because I did notice that throughout the day, it would move on my face & somehow get into my eyes which caused serious burning. yes yes yes
