I LOVE Kosas and have never had a bad experience with any of their products so I was excited to try this even though I did see some reviews mentioning the taste. I thought maybe mine would be different but nope. It legit tastes like you’re eating perfume and the texture is also very thin which didn’t feel hydrating at all! Will be returning Tastes like you’re eating perfume
