Such a great cleanser! After using this product for about a week, I can definitely notice a major difference in my skin. It feels so plump and moisturized after each wash and I love the tingly “cold” sensation it leaves behind! I’ve also noticed improvements in my acne and overall texture, which is a huge plus! This is the perfect cleanser for those winter months, especially if you need a good dose of moisture to get your skin through the day. Highly recommend! Perfect dose of daily moisture!
