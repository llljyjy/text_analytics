I love love love this cleanser. I love the smell and the texture, it is not that liquid, it’s a little bit dense, which I love because I just need a small amount to clean all my face and neck. The smell is very sweet and I love it and it is a big bottle. Also, I love the color of the soap, it’s a kind of orange and peach color. Thank RiRi. The cleanser removes all my makeup and even if I am not wearing makeup, it leaves my skin completely clean and removes all the oil. New Fave Cleanser
