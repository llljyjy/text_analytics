The water-free formula allows for little degradation of the vitamin C. The pH is low which allows for greater penetration. Everything about this product is perfection other than the fact that its 30% vitamin C which is WAY too high based on published data. This would be a fantastic product if it was less irritating and had a more reasonable percentage of vitamin C. Made my face red and flakey. If this product had 15-20% vitamin C youâ€™d have a lifelong customer. PLEASE MAKE THIS IN A 15% VERSION
