Okay, I am a new believer in the Cicapair line. The serum plus the cream literally saved my skin barrier after a recent unfortunate - and self-inflicted - benzoyl peroxide burn. My face did a complete 180 from eye-watering sting and dryness one day to on the mend with NO sensitivity the next. Lesson learned about overdoing actives, but I will absolutely reach for this bottle next time my barrier is feeling the slightest bit compromised to soothe & speed up the repair.
