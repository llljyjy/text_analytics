I RECEI RECEIEVED THIS PRODUCT COMPLIMENTARY IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION. AFTER USING OVER 2 WEEKS,MY HONEST OPINION IS AS FOLLOWS:I was really excited when I received this product because I have been researching it and wanted to try it but did not want to spend $100 without knowing I would love it. The technology of the multi-cream mixing while you pump is awesome.  I do believe if all the ingredients would just be mixed at once they would not work so well so this technology is excellent  I used this product every day for about 16 days so far in my facial routine (after the serum). I mix it with a tiny bit of retinol 5% prescription and use them together instead of moisturizing after Ret-a. I have noticed within about a week smoother forehead lines(they are not THAT deep anyway but I seen improvement). I also noticed that I wake up with a more even skin tone and  my marionette lines have softened quite a bit.  I will be adding this product to my daily routine for sure.  This has become a new member of my “staple club“! A new member of staple club!♡
