It is fractionally over 11% vit c, and I use it as a long term maintenance product because the formula noticeably increases my skin health in general and helps prevent and reduce the hormonal cycle-related flare-ups that I tend to get. It will not disappear dark spots quickly but will brighten the whole face gradually over time. My skin is smooth and bouncy having incorporated this product into an established routine. I use 4-5 times a week in the morning. For reference, I am a late 20’s, black woman whose scars like to hang around for close to 6 months. I’ve got combination skin in pretty good condition aside from the flare-ups previously mentioned. I’ve taken off a star due to a combination of speed of action and price point. This vitamin c is not one that will quickly deal with dark spots, marks, or blemishes. There are definitely cheaper options that will work more quickly, if that is what you are after. However, this serum in combination with a spot treatment when needed is a phenom to remove blemishes and maintain happy skin over time. Long-term commitment
