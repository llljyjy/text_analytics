I don’t even know where to start. I love this moisturizer so much. It has even my skin tone, calm my redness, and doesn’t cause me to breakout. i also find my skin is firmer feeling and soooo soft. I have very sensitive normal/dry acne prone skin. The air whip moisturizer was too light for me and the adaptogen was okay but I would get a pimple here and there. I have been using this new moisturizer twice daily for almost two weeks and my skin hasn’t looked this good in forever. I haven’t had one breakout since using this which is amazing. My whole route is YTTP I love all their products but this is now my fav! Buy it you won’t be disappointed. my fav moisturizer
