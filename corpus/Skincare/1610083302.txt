If you’re looking for a lightweight yet luxurious eye serum you should give this a try. It smells slightly sweet and floral. I like that it has two textures like a serum and cream in one. My eye area stayed very hydrated and gave a nice glow. My dark circles are pretty deep and dark; I found that it lessened but didn’t get rid of them. It’s gentle enough to use twice a day, I did not get irritated while using it. I like that it has natural ingredients, like turmeric and horse chestnut that help with puffiness. It is on the expensive side but I didn’t need much on each application. Lightweight yet luxurious
