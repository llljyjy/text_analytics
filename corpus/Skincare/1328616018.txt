This has such a bizarre silvery/glittery tone that I have a hard time imagining it would look good on anyone. It does have a cooling effect but I’m not trying to put a weird disco ball glitter cream under my eyes. I got this in a subscription box and used it once and was immediately like, absolutely not, no. I don’t even feel good about giving it to anyone. it’s a no from me, dawg
