This eye cream is very hydrating. I have been using it in the morning and at night. My eyes look more awake after applying it. My dark circles are not gone but I think it’s because I haven’t used it for a long time. I like that it is unscented and doesn’t irritate my eyes. The price of this eye cream is pretty affordable. A little goes a long way so you don’t have to use a lot of product. Hydrating!!
