These used to be the best, when made with coconut water, but the new formulation is garbage. I literally had to scrub this off of my face. It wouldnâ€™t even rinse off Nasty, sticky and the opposite of cleansing. Go back to the original formulation Sephora. Change was a mistake- no coconut water anymore
