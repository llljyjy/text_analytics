I am completely in love with this product! I have used another brand that didn’t do nearly as well as this did. The makeup issue when used with the eye cream seems to be where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from, but as someone who does t wear makeup, this product works amazingly and in my opinion is truly a magic fix for under eye bags, 11’s and smile lines. It’s largely undetected on my face and lasts all day. Recommend 100% Miracle fix and a must have!
