My name is Gabby and I’m a Cosmetologist from New York. I received the Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum. I first started using this spray on serum at the beginning or end of my skincare routine. I noticed it was an easy and faster way to hydrate my skin without having to use much work with my fingers. I think you’re given a generous amount of product. Using the with an application of makeup was very effective because some skincare products don’t mix well with foundation or powder. They tend to separate and make your skin look clumpy instead of smooth canvas. But I don’t think this is a necessity for a night routine. For me I feel my skin need more moisture than just a spray at night. Overall, I would recommend this spray for during the day purposes and give it 4 out of 5 stars. So far so good :)
