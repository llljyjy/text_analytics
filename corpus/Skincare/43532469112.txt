I’m going to start this review by saying I am newer to skin care. I got the sample size and the Rice Wash as a birthday gift. I have loved this moisturizer so far. Especially with the cold weather I am in. It leaves my face soft and is not sticky or oily. I, however, noticed that while this works well by itself, I can not use it with other products as it starts pilling. Including after the Rice wash cleanser. So I use this as a morning moisturizer and the cleanser at night with my Hyaluronic acid serum. I did purchase the Gratitude size on Tatcha’s website. I have yet to use that as I still have my sample so I am curious to see if there is a difference in formula between both sizes like people are saying. As of now though I am very pleased with the results I am getting! Nice Product
