I wanted to love this product because I’ve used Sunday Riley products in the past and loved them, but unfortunately this one was no good for my skin. I broke out pretty bad in my t zone with whiteheads within days of use. Maybe it was a skin purge? Maybe that’s normal? Maybe my skin just doesn’t tolerate vitamin c? But this one definitely made my skin breakout and also noticeably irritated. I try a lot of new products on my face generally with no issues. So I would advise anyone with any bit of sensitive or acne prone skin to skip on this one. Save Your Money
