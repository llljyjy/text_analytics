My skin is normal-dry combination as well as acne prone so I need a face wash that won’t strip my skin or break me out. My first thoughts were I loved the packaging since it was aesthetic and pumps out just the right amount of product you need per application. The face wash glided well over my skin and was able to remove all the daily sweat and skin build up I had. My skin didn’t feel tight or dry after and my skin looks brighter after using it for a week. Definitely a great product if you’re looking for an amazing face wash! Amazing for daily use!
