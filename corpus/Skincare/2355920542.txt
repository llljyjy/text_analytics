Overall, I very much liked this sunscreen - it’s easy to apply, wears great in the heat of Florida, doesn’t mess with the makeup being applied over it. I liked the texture of it - it’s creamy and doesn’t run off. It gives a slight glow to the skin. I didn’t notice my skin being any more hydrated, but it didn’t feel dry while wearing it either. The smell of it is pleasant but still has a bit of sunscreen-y smell, it doesn’t bother me too much, but I wish it wasn’t there. Great Sunscreen
