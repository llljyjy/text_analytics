This is actually a really nice eye cream! I have to say, I was skeptical about this. I don’t think products need to cost $$$ to be good, but I will say I really like the hydrating texture of this. It’s still lightweight, but definitely gave my eyes great moisture that lasted throughout the day. I am curious to see how much longer term results go, but I would recommend this as a good eye cream (if it’s within your budget). That said, I also think there are plenty of good eye creams out there for a lot less. Actually a good eye cream!
