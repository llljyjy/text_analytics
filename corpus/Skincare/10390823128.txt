I received Fenty Skin: Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence with Hyaluronic Acid + Tamarind about 2 weeks ago. I actually like the toner, it has a nice scent(leafy, tea plant) I havenâ€™t fully figured out what it smells like. I find the toner to be moisturizing and has a glow to it. I also like the twisting-cap method, it saves a lot of the toner from getting waisted Moisturizing glow
