Love this stuff. I put it on right after I get out of the shower every night. I have oily, acne prone skin. Mostly little bumps, congestion and closed comedones. This dries up my pimples what seems like overnight. I use it alone in the evening and my face definitely feels a little tight and dry but so worth it. love it
