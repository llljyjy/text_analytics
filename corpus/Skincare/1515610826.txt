This is my first review for any product, I just don’t do them. But I felt like I had to leave one for this because I would literally have a near panic attack if they ever stopped making it. It’s hands down the best neck cream I’ve ever used and I’ve tried several high end brands since I entered my 40s. It feels luxurious and soothing when applied. It’s especially helpful right now post chin lipo 2 weeks ago.I like to use a facial spray (like Evian or Caudalie very lightly just prior to use to seal in the moisture of this cream twice daily). It’s incredibly moisturizing and has a very light and clean fragrance (I’m very sensitive to fragrance normally and a lot of neck creams smell way too strong unfortunately). The scent doesn’t stick around because it’s so light which is also nice for others that are sensitive too. It’s definitely a holy grail product for me and I started to notice great improvement in the softness and some firmness after several days of consistent use AM & PM (I’ve been using it for over a year now though and will never go without it). I also love applying to my chest, it’s made great changes there as well. Can’t say enough about how much youth, elasticity (and even clarity on my chest) has improved. However, don’t expect a miracle for firmness. The peptides in the product definitely help but it won’t give you a neck lift or make it feel tight. Best neck cream EVER!!
