The kiehls ultra facial advanced barrier cream is so effective. I absolutely love it. I suffer with extremely dry skin and it has been the only cream that restored my skin. It’s a super lightweight cream and it’s so easy to massage in your skin. It’s leaves it feeling so hydrated and rejuvenated. Affordable and outstanding quality. I use it immediately after I apply my toner and serum. It has helped with dark spots and just overall good skin health. Recommended to all my friends and family. I received this item complimentary free for my honest review. The best facial cream ever
