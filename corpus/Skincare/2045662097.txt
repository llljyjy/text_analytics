Similar to a few reviewers I, too, wanted to like this but it didn’t do much for me. After using it religiously for a couple of months (every day). I can say my very dry, rosacea, skin didn’t like it. It almost feels like it’s so thick it doesn’t penetrate the skin efficiently... it feels like it just sits there. I also broke out a bit. Overall underwhelming as a product. For the price I expected my world to be rocked, haha. I am 28 years old and this feels like a beginner’s/younger hydrating mask vs. an older needs-more-medical-grade-stuff person... Not a fit for me... boo :(
