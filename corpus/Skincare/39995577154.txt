I was a bit skeptical about this product being an oil. I always find products with oils leave my skin feeling more oily, but this was not the case with Clarins Double Serum. I was able to use each sample for 2 applications. It smelled nice, absorbed well, and left my skin feeling soft. Free sample from Butterly
