I have been totally missing out on Sephora Collection products! I have tried Farmacy, Naturium, Versed, Cerave, Derma-E cleansing balms & they all either have fragrance or citrus (?????) and it burns the shiznit out of my eyes!! Not this cleansing balm! I love how thick it is and it leaves your skin squeaky clean. I bought 3 of these during the Sephora 30% off sale so I got it for $9! Canâ€™t beat that. SAY WHAT!
