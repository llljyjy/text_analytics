I have extremely dry, sensitive skin & this made me peel for days.  It was terrible. They say AHA is better for those with dry skin, but I’ve seen mixed reviews on that one as well, including breakouts which I am prone to... I’ve been using another product for years with no issues, Skin Medica.  The cream somehow feels moisturizing & actually works. I’ll be sticking with that. Not for dry skin
