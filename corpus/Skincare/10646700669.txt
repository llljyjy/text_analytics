I got a sample size & brought it on my tropical vacay as a  sunscreen for my face. I love this, it is so hydrating and dewy. Perfection. I will buy the full size, and look forward to the tinted formula, as the sample was not tinted. Not sure why, as I donâ€™t see an untinted version available. I want the tinted version as I do not wear foundation. Yummy delicious on my face
