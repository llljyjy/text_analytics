This face cream is delightful! I was able to try a sample, and I felt this cream had a great texture, moisturized well, and had a nice light scent. I did only use this cream during the day, and I liked how smooth my foundation looked after using it. Overall, I would recommend this cream to others as a result of my experience trying this product and would strongly consider replacing my current face cream with this one. great hydration!
