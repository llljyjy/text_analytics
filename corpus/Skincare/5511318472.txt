This is the best deal for mineral sunscreens considering the size! Leaves a lightly dewy finish. I’ve been mixing it with the IT cosmetics cc cream to sheer that out and it mixes beautifully together. Maybe there’s a bit of a white cast, but mixing it solves that problem and you get twice as much product as most others. I’ve been using it for 4 years on a retinol regimen and never had my face get burnt. price per ounce can’t be beat
