Just got a mini sample from bazaar. Picked it and had no idea what it was or the price. After trying it this morning I looked it up because my skin looked better in one hour than in months of all my Sunday Riley products. It’s 300..  of course. Anyways this stuff is amazing seriously.. it is AMAZING my skin looks plump hydrated and just.. expensive I can’t describe it it’s magic. Saving up for it. wow
