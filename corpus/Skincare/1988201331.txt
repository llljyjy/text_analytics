This product has pros and cons. I have been wearing a self tanner for probably like 15 years and have used so many different ones. This one has a learning curve. The colour is great - very similar to how I (eventually) tan naturally. A real golden tan. I find it has great staying power too. BUT. The first time I used it it went all over my floor, which made it very slippery, plus the bottoms of my feet were dark orange, from stepping on it. So now I lay a towel down before I use it. It kind of sprays everywhere too, so be mindful of that. good colour but be careful!
