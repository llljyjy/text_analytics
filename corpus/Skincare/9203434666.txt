I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. It is a good product, and a good staple for some, but there are so many better cleansing balms on the market with better ingredients and a cheaper price point. I enjoyed using this product, it does a very good job at taking all your makeup off, but the charcoal aspect is a gimmick; the charcoal does nothing for your skin so it’s the same as the original take the day off. In my opinion, it’s just ok. overpriced
