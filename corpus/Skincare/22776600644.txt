A fair warning, it might make you break out for a bit before your skin starts to clear, it’s because the serum is kicking all your congestion into the outer layer of your skin! That’s what happened to me. also, this is more like an oily serum than a normal drying serum, so I only use it at night, and I think that might be useful for some to know that! But it goes on nicely and I really feel like it helps my skin more than any other acne products I’ve tried. Everyone’s skin is different though:) love!!
