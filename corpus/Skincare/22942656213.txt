I hate when product is greasy or sticky on my skin so this one has really light watery texture, it absorbs so well and even hydrates your skin almost like a toner, also I can see that in the morning after applying my skin is more smooth, I also feel it is being more even after weeks of using it. I use it once at night and follow with my moisturizer, want to try 10% lactic acid love the light texture
