I use this at night & in my morning skincare routine and it makes my skin look so glowy which is such a good base for before I do makeup! itâ€™s so so hydrating and after a little bit of using it you definitely start to see,a difference in skin concerns like acne, redness, a damaged skin barrier, etc. (ik it may not for everyone but it definitely did for me) and only reason I gave 4 stars was because I feel like it has somewhat of a glue like smell im probably crazy lol but I swear nan
