I actually love this night cream! It’s so lightweight and soaks right in to my skin—it doesn’t sit on top or cause my skin to be oily at all. I haven’t noticed a big change in my dark circles but maybe that takes more time. I’d purchase this solely for how amazing it makes my skin feel. It’s the perfect moisturizer. I love it
