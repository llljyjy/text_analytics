I got this sample size from Influenster to try it out and see how I like it. I’m super picky about my sunscreen. Just turned 27 so I’m really fighting the sun damage here. My favorite at the moment is beauty of Josen because its cheap, so thin and watery and blends like a dream. This comes pretty darn close. I got a sample size and that is perf for vacation. Im in love with the aqua bomb and cream so this feels like that but with spf?! whats not to love. Love
