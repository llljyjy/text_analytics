I was super excited  when my Korres Poreless Skin Cream - Santorial Grape arrived in the mail on Monday!I received this amazing cream free from Influenster and Korres, in exchange for my honest review. I have normal skin textures, with minor aging and I tried this product a few times.It is hydrating and smooth. I feel the word “poreless” is a little misleading, as I have had other products tighten my pores, I didn’t notice changes with this particular product to the look of my poresI do like that there is no stickiness and I felt an overall hydrated feeling to my face and neck, that lasted hours.I don’t love the scent, it reminded me of playdoh, but overall I give this product 4* for hydrating and the ease of use and texture. I would recommend this product for those with minor dryness, who are looking for a smooth product that lasts. #ThatGreekGlow #complimentary @Influenster @Korres Soothing and Hydrating
