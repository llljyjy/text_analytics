I just want to start by saying I recieved this item complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have to say I had never heard of this brand or product prior to trying it from influenster. Overall I have to say the product works well at making the appearance of your pores appear diminished. It does a great job at smoothing out your skin! I only need to use a small amount on my nose and my chin to see huge results. I will say the price point is a bit much for me for such a small amount of product -- but it does work & seems it will last a long time! It also smells great and has great, clean ingredients which is huge for us who suffer from sensitive blemish prone skin. Overall 4/5 stars from me. Great product for pores!!
