This product was delivered a week ago. I opened up and the QR code for the instructional video does not work and still doesn’t work a week later. I’ve written the company and tried to reach out to Sephora and still haven’t gotten a working QR code. This product costs $75 for basically a rubber ball and some very small serum samples, the video is the value in the product and without it the product is useless. It seems looking at the question section on this page that this QR code has been non functional for over a month. Facegym really needs to figure out the technical issues or this is a big time product fail. Hoping “someone” will get back to me on an instructional video, if not then I guess I will have to return. QR code for instructions not working!
