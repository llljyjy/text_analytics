I love the scent of this Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion, it’s amazingly refreshing and pleasant, but strong, so it might be too much for some people.The texture is very liquidy and so it absorbs in my skin quickly.I use it every day, am and pm, my skin feels clean and moisturized, and bouncy. Although I have redness around my nose and it doesn’t seem to help much. Which I’m confused because that’s what it’s advertised for. Perhaps if I had serious redness or discoloration I could have seen a significant change Love how it feels on my skin
