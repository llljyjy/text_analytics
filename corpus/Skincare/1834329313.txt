When I first got this I thought it was so weird. Weird smell, weird texture, weird shiny face after, wasn’t sure if it actually did anything. I wanted to get rid of it… slathered it on day and night for months! And then it finished and I was sad!I miss the smell! Like a smoothie on a hot summer dayI miss the texture: there’s no other serum that feels like thisI miss my dewy glow! It was never shiny what was I thinking?!My skin is soft, supple , the most moisturized it’s ever felt… it got me through a rough winter … a difficult pregnancy .. and now a sweaty and very humid summer! I love this serum and I cannot recommend it more ❤️ Summer staple ☀️
