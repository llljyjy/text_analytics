This night cream was gifted by The Outset. It is a game changer for me. Itâ€™s thick in consistency and fragrance free. It leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and refreshed in the morning. I usually suffer from dry sensitive skin and this night cream has actually saved me. I wake up in the morning with softer skin and my red patches on my cheeks have seem to not break out as much after using this night cream. I definitely recommend even if you have sensitive skin nan
