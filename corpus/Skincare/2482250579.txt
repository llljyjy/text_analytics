I received this mask complimentary from Tatcha. I’ve used it twice so far and really enjoyed it. I find this clay mask interesting because it doesn’t dry on application like other masks. Instead, you massage the mask onto the skin which will give the skin some light exfoliation. The color should also turn from gray to a slight pink. when I wash off the mask, I feel my skin looking and feeling more smooth, as well as my pores looking less obvious. nan
