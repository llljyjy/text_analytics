i’m a sucker for anything matcha-related so i already knew i’d love this (: been looking for a cream mask for those nights where you need a little extra self-care and this one works perfect! not a life-changing formula by any means but it brightened up my skin and made my self-care night even better. highly recommend for those with normal skin who don’t have many issues but want to brighten up their complexion and alleviate redness, without breaking the bank. another great sephora collection item! subtle results, awesome mask
