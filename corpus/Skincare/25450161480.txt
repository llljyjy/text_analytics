I recieved korres santorini grape poreless skin cream from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. After having my 3rd child 10 weeks premature my skin changed alot, espically enlarged pores, under the skin bumps and redness. After using korres Santorini grape poreless skin cream my skin looks and feels alot smoother. My dry skin is gone with a very even skintone. My skin feels fresh and soft. My pores are GONE! I suffer from enlarged pores on my nose the most and I feel it gets very noticable, when applying makeup they seem to stick out more. After using korres my makeup looks and feels smoother on my face. My husband and other friends/family members have noticed. I really like the texture espically being a gel based cream, it did not leave my skin oily, which i tend to have oily skin in my t zones. Definitely adding korres Santorini grape poreless skin cream to my everyday skincare routine! Works great, no more enlarged pores
