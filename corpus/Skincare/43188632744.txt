I was excited to be gifted by Fresh. this cream as I am looking to start anti aging prevention. I overall really enjoy it the only thing I will say is you can definitely smell the tea in it. I wasn’t expecting it and if you’re sensitive to fragrance you may want to try something else. Otherwise I do like it a lot! Great moisturizer!
