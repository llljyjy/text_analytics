Ugh, it’s so hard to read through all the positive reviews from people who received this product for free, who of course are going to write a positive review because they didn’t spend their actual money. I DID spend my own money on this, and this is by FAR THE WORST Isle of Paradise product I’ve used so far. I love IOP products, and this ain’t it. The spray nozzle sprays EVERYWHERE except your skin. It’s not a nice mist, it sprays in a circle that misses your entire leg. Hitting all over the floor, and now you have an oily floor. Don’t step in that, because 1. it’s slippery, and 2. your feet are going to be brown! Secondly, you have to constantly shake this to ensure the oils are mixed to be activated. So every few seconds you’re shaking, and spraying, shaking and spraying. Then comes the issue with the bottle doesn’t work if you’re spraying upside down. Which if you’re a normal person trying to apply, you’re likely bending over and applying to your legs, lower abdomen, etc. And therefore the bottle doesn’t spray. Whatsoever.Then comes how sticky & tacky this feels. It doesn’t sink into the skin nicely. At all. It stays sticky & tacky feeling. The smell is the normal Isle of Paradise smell. But VERY quickly fades to a fake tanner scent... way quicker than normal. I gave it two stars, because the tan developed and looked nice after the fight with it. But I would not recommend this product, and will not be buying this product again. A review from someone who actually purchased this!
