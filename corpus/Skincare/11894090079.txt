This is becoming a product I reach for every night [gifted by EADEM]. The ingredients used are beyond stellar (squalane and niacinamide are two of my favorites) and work so well with my skin. I have a hard time finding thick, overnight moisturizers that donâ€™t make my acne worse and this one works wonders to hydrate/soothe without being too heavy. nan
