I have very VERY dry skin. This product is perfect! It doesn’t react with any other products on my skin and doesn’t leave a white cast. I also have very sensitive skin and it doesn’t break me out at all. I was skeptical because some reviews said it’s super oily and looking shiny is my biggest pet peeve, it leaves a very light sheen on my skin but I definitely don’t look oily. nan
