I am very impressed with this product. This is what I use for foundation and it’s incredible. I have very dry, fair skin with red cheeks and this product tones down my redness. It doesn’t dry out my skin like other foundations or make the dry patches on my face evident. It’s amazing how easily it blends and a little goes a very long way. So happy I found this product! Game changer for me. Fair, dry skin with rosy cheeks
