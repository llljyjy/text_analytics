I received this complimentary from Tula and influenster for testing purposes. I’ve been using it for two weeks no both am and pm. I have really dry skin with some discolouration on my cheeks. I’ve found that my skin is brighter and more even. The scent is quite nice and the product isn’t too thick. One pump is enough to cover my face. I’m looking forward to trying other products from the Tula line! Lovely
