I’ve gone through countless bottles of the SOS mist, and was psyched to see a more concentrated version. I found the texture so lovely and definitely feel and see those same soothing anti-redness benefits. This is the perfect addition to my SOS routine and I can’t wait to keep using it and see the results. The oneeeeee thing I’d change is the dispenser -- it squirts a little which if not ready could result in wasted product. Otherwise, such a great serum! Such a soothing serum
