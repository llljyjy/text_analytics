I’ve been using this for just two weeks and already notice a bit of brightening, which is what I was mainly hoping to get from this product! It goes on smoothly and I found it to be quickly absorbed, I really like the consistency. After leaving on for 5 minutes I follow with a gentle moisturizer. I don’t experience any stinging sensation with this like I have with some acids I’ve used, yay! I would say that’s what is so great about this product, it feels very mellow and so far hasn’t caused any drying for me. This serum does have a faint odor which goes away quickly after absorbing and I personally don’t find it bothersome. I’m hoping with continued use I see even more brightening and evenness of my skin texture! Gentle but packs a punch!
