This cream is an amazing texture, very gel-like and smooth. Easy to spread on the skin. It’s is strongly fragranced, which I took a star off for. I almost don’t want to because the fragrance smells so good, like lemon bars! Yet, I know that could be irritating to sensitive skin types. Otherwise, I haven’t seen any effects to my skins appearance throughout using this but I have felt more moisturized. nan
