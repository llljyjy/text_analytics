The second you put it on it feels like it’s taking effect but in a non-sticky way. It feels like it’s firming but it’s soft and goes on like butter. It feels like it’s tightening your skin and moisturizing in a lasting way.A lot of moisturizers you put on and it feels instantly absorbed. It’s hard to explain but this feejj kk a instantly absorbed but with a lasting effect that feels like it is protecting your skin, continuing to hydrate and tightening.I’m a fan, haven’t tried any like this. Nothing Like It
