This cleanser was GREAT the first couple of days, but then I noticed that my skin was starting to breakout. At first I was sure that it was because my period was coming but as that came and went, my skin was getting worse. I skipped using it one night and the following morning I noticed my skin was looking way better. I’m not sure what ingredients caused my skin to breakout because I’ve never had a product break me out before. Make sure to test this before you use it!! made me breakout :(
