I have struggled with dark circles and bags under my eyes for years. Some people have other issues with their skin, but for me it’s the dark under eye circles. I can remember being a teen and people always asking me if I was tired. Nope! It’s just my look. Needless to say, I thought this was just my burden to live with. I have tried lots of different products over the years with little success. I was hesitant to try this but knew I didn’t have anything to lose. I started to see results after the first couple of uses. But most noticeable after week 1. The dark circles are not noticeable at all at this point. This is my new go to Product and if you struggle with under eye issues, you have got to give it a try! nan
