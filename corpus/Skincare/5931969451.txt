This cream was awesomeâ€¦.a little does go a long way. This builds so nicely on my skin leaving it visibly brighter & feeling so much softer. I had the smallest available size but it really worked well on myskin over the two weeks of using it. Will be purchasing more! This was complimentary from Sulwhasoo for me to try the sample & I will be ordering a larger size for myself. The small sample is very tiny so it may be a better value to order the size up Very hydrating
