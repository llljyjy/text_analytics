I’ve used both the old formula and the new. The new formulation is not as good, but most people are not aware that DE lost a lawsuit against Skinceuticals which is owned by L’Oréal. The old DE serum was too much like Skinceuticals formulation. So I’m assuming the old formula, which I rated 5 stars, won’t be back. With that said, it’s still works for my skin. Not quite as good, but it’s still a good product and does not irritate my sensitive, aging skin. It still works for me
