Received a sample to try, and WOW. Iâ€™m 56 with dry skin all over. I have used for a few days on my arms and legs and my skin is hydrated, supple,soft, and not sticky or greasy. Cream does not have a scent. And one thing i noticed it seems to leave a matte look on my legs. Not a deal breaker for me if my skin is hydrated Lovely!
