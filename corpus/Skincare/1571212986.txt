I received this Laneige Retinol Firming Cream Treatment from TopBox to try #trywithtopbox #freeproduct. I enjoyed using the cream and see a softening of the lines around my eyes, especially when I smile. It is also hydrating, so I did not experience any tightness, flaking, or redness that some retinol creams can cause. I definitely recommend trying this product, especially if to love the Laneige line of products. The only reason I took a star off is because of the price and product size. I feel like you can only really use this for a few targeted areas with such a small amount. Great for smoothing targeted areas
