Great product for oily skin. The lotion is awesome and makes your face feel matte without the dry feeling. It does a great job minimizing pores and almost feels as if you primed your face. Love it and the only down fall is the prize, it is a little steep for 1 oz of product. Otherwise the product is great. I received the product through Influenster for my review. Great for oily skin!
