I like using this moisturizer in the morning when my skin doesn’t need extra hydration. It’s a lightweight moisturizer so would be great for oily skin types. I use tret so most of the time I need a heavier moisturizer, but I did enjoy how soft this made my skin. I do not think it’s worth the price tag though. Basic moisturizer
