This is definitely a unique under eye product! I absolutely love the instant cooling sensation when applied, and that it’s designed to be easily portable so you could pop it in your purse and use it throughout the day. It has no scent that I could detect. It does have a shimmer or highlight to it that I found could be a bit much if over applied. I’ve only used it under makeup so far though so you can’t really see it. I didn’t find it as hydrating as I’d like for winter so I layered it with my usual eye cream. It might be nice on its own in the summer. nan
