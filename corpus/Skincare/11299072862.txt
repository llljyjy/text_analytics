Girl. If you don’t just get a balm, you’re literally throwing your money away. This is EXACTLY as it describes…milk. But not once did I feel like my face was clean or it took away any makeup. I can just pour the oat milk in my fridge on my face to get the same affect because it’s not about being a milky cleanser, just milk. Is this a joke?
