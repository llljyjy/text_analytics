I think I had bought into the hype of this product just because I did see many people on social media talking about it. However, with what initially I thought was a fine product after using this for a few weeks I noticed some things. I would wake up with dehydrated lips. If anything the more I was using this the more I noticed I would wake up with almost chapped lips. My only other gripe is the price and size. I haven’t brought myself to finish this lip mask and I probably won’t. I’ve returned to using Vaseline/aquaphor which is way cheaper and actually works… Overhyped, waking up to dry lips after usage…
