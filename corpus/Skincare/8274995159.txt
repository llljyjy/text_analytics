I am already a big fan of Estee Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair Serum, so I was very excited to receive this eye cream in exchange for an honest review. It has a silky gel consistency that is not at all greasy, very similar to the serum. It’s perfect for night time for deep overnight hydration. I wake up looking less tired and my under eye area looks plumper. Wrinkles also become less visible with continued use. Really wonderful product. Fantastic Moisturizer
