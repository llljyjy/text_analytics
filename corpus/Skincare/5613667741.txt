I am 30. I started with a lower strength retinol cream before moving onto this product. I have been using this product for about 6 months now in my night time routine. I started with twice a week and now use every other night. I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin’s texture! My pores are way less noticeable and my skin just looks so smooth and even now. I feel like it has helped even my skin tone out as well. Time will tell with how it affects any lines or wrinkles I have. Retinol takes time, so I am staying patient with any additional results. I am very happy I purchased this product and will be re purchasing. Effective
