I recieved this complimentary product from Influenster and Shiseido in return of my honest review. This has a lot of fragrance which can be sensitive to the skin. It does smell luxurious. I like how my skin feels after applying however I donâ€™t really notice a difference. I do think this is pricey compared to other products. Luxurious smell
