I’m in my early 30s and while I don’t have too many wrinkles, I have issues with acne spots as well as skin texture and tone. After using this serum twice so far, I woke up with noticeably dewier and smoother skin. It seems very great for my oily skin. I like that this serum is gentle enough that I could use it every night without irritation. The pump is also very easy to control and use.Overall I would recommend the serum. Great Retinol serum for acne spots and fine lines.
