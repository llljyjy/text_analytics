Good product. Did not dry out my face, like others have stated. However, the pump is hard to pump and liquid is thin so it has potential to make a mess if you aren’t careful. Since I read the reviews first, I did not have any problems or make a mess. I bought this because it was in sale but it didn’t do anything special for me, so I most likely will not be purchasing again. Maybe it is a great product for you. It is definitely worth a try. Decent product.
