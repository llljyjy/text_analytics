Cleansers aren’t a 1 size fits all, but I fell in love with this brand after trying their zinc serum & peeling masks (which, paired with my ’clean & clear gel cleanser,’ completely fixed my oil & texture problem!), so I was excited to give this a try too. However, I suppose this isn’t for people who, like me, are recommended to using “gel-like consistency“ for their dry skin [via their esthetician]. After immediate use of this product, my forehead still felt clogged and textured, and oil production was visible on my nose just seconds after. I woke up feeling especially congested, and chose to give this product a 2nd try - this time doubling the amount, and taking more time heating it up and massaging it in. *This was also on my ’ordinary AHA/BHA exfoliation mask morning’, so I was curious if that would make a positive difference. However, the results were the same, even with the mask that I swear by. I will be going back to my old drug store cleanser and just enjoying pairing it with the Ordinary serums and masks instead.**The BENEFIT however: was that on the small dermatitis patches I’d developed from wearing/reusing n95 masks 8 hours long every day, are now A LOT less flakier. I’m not sure if it’s thanks to this cleanser, or the +HA Ordinary moisturizer, but I will keep this regime only for the perioral area until it’s fully treated, and my drug store cleanser for the rest. Glad I got the minis! good for dermatitis, bad for dry compensating skin
