While I did receive this for free from Estee Lauder and Influenster to test in exchange for my review initially, I ended up purchasing a full sized one from Macy’s as well because I absolutely loved this moisturizer. I love how thick and creamy it is, but even more I love how great it absorbs into my skin so that I don’t have greasy looking skin afterwards. I use it morning and evening and I keep it refrigerated so my skin tightens up a bit immediately. After only a few days of using the sample sized I could see a difference in the smile lines around my cheeks so I knew I wanted to buy more. It’s a great formula and a perfect addition to my other Estee Lauder skincare products. I’ve never used anything from them that I don’t like, but this is definitely one of my favorites. Absorbs so well
