I was so excited to try this because i loved the idea of a serum/toner combo. As a toner, I do like it, but it didn’t give me the glowy, dewy feeling—it does dry out on your face. Therefore, I definitely wouldn’t use this to replace my serums (I like to use a hyaluronic blend serum after, before moisturizing).I do like the packaging. Not As Moisturizing as I Anticipated
