I my skin looks and feels very subtle. The luxurious feel, delicate rose scent and soothing qualities of this face moisturizer are definitely worth the price tag. I enjoy trying new skin care and this one was a big hit. I have sensitive skin, and this was non-irritating. My friends and family would certainly love this cream. The really nice thing about this product is a little goes a long way. Effective and non-irritating
