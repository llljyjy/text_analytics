I’m seriously impressed by how well this stuff worked! It was very easy to use because it’s in a tube, rather than a tub, so I didn’t have to worry about making a mess if I had to use more than I initially got which is my biggest issue with cleansing balms. I also love that it isn’t scented and doesn’t make my eyes cloudy, those are HUGE pluses for me. All in all, it was a very nice experience and I’m excited to try it again. Side by side comparison of the before and after in my pic!!! Great at removing makeup easily
