It’s smells so refreshing. It feels quite lightweight on the skin. It gave me little tingly feeling, I usually break out easily but I used it with my SPF and its feels great. The application is a little tough as it doesn’t suck in as much product (I had to use the pump 2-3 times). Altogether, it’s a good product! nan
