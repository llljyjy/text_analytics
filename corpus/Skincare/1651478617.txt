I liked this better that YTTPâ€™s deep moisturizer.  The bottle is better, the consistency is better, the price is not, and neither is the smell.  But most importantly I like the way this makes my skin feel. Put it on at night and a little bit more in the morning, under makeup. Good moisturizer, noticeable plumping effect
