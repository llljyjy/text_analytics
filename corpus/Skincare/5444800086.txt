This is the best night cream vs other luxury night creams I’ve used. Texture isn’t heavy, feels light on skin but is very moisturizing. Doesn’t have a heavy scent, When I wake up in the morning after application, my skin glows and feels super soft. My skin looks more even toned, supple and healthier! You can’t lose with Lancôme! Worth every penny!
