Lucky me!I was chosen to sample Clarins Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate thanks to @thisisbutterly, @chickadvisor and @clarinscanada!#gotitfreeThis amazing anti-aging serum claims to be useful for any skin type - and I believe it! It’s a non-greasy serum, and it’s very hydrating! I truly sensed that my skin felt firmer, more hydrated, and with less fine lines than before using it! This serum combines two different formulas to bring you a youthful glow! One of the key ingredients is turmeric, which is known for it’s excellent health benefits and anti-aging properties. Also, the scent is nice! It’s light, not overpowering, and a little fruity! It’s a lovely serum and I would use it everyday. Must have anti-aging serum
