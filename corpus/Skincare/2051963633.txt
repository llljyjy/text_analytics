I am 69 years old.  This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.   I have very sensitive, dry skin. It immediately makes my skin glow and feels moist.  I apply just enough to cover my face and neck which is about the size of a nickel.  Sometimes 2x a day sometimes once depending how my skin feels.  I have gotten into reading the labels to make sure the products I put on my face are clean and this fits the bill.  My daughter uses it too.  She lives in a very dry climate. Great for dry skin
