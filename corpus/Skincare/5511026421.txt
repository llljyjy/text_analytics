I’ve had a lot of luck with The Ordinary line, especially the Squalane Cleanser.  I have very sensitive and dehydrated skin that breaks out from irritation. After using this my skin feels fresh and soft, not tight or irritated. It’s non foaming, turns to an oil on the skin to remove pollutants and build up, then turns into a milk once you apply water. I’ve been using this this product for almost two years now and I haven’t found another cleansing product that I prefer over this one. Best use is to massage it into the skin for 1 minute as it converts into an oil, then apply a small amount of water until it turns into a milky consistency and massage for another 30 seconds to a minute, then rinse. If you’re the type that prefers the “squeaky clean“ feeling after wash your face, you may not enjoy this as much as it’s designed to maintain the moisture barrier on your skin, not strip away all oils from the surface.Would give this 4.5 out of 5 stars, only because it doesn’t completely remove mascara or eye liner. Otherwise this product is great and I would very much so recommend it for sensitive and dry/dehydrated skin types. Wonderful for sensitive, dehydrated skin types.
