I’ve been trying out all sorts of toners - biossance, farmacy, innisfree… I was surprised that I like this one the best so far. I have huge pores on my nose and it actually clears them out every night. I notice that my acne scars fade quicker than the other products too. My only complaint and reasoning for 4 stars is that when I use my glaze/serum from Rhode after toning, the glaze turns into a water consistency. I understand this is a chemical reaction between the two like a science experiment but it’s super weird. Thankfully the glaze stays on my face but it turns to pure liquid once it touches my face with the toner. I’m obsessed with the Rhode line so if I feel like the toner cancels the product out then I’ll have to use a different toner Using at nighttime
