I want to love it but it dries out my lips. I’ve put it on when my lips are fine and an hour later they’re flaky. It also causes cold sores. I’ve had 2 and both very first uses I got cold sores. I also have this issue with the sleeping mask. I never “double dip” so the risk of continuation from a previous sore is 0 yet I’ve noticed every time I use it I get a cold sore. And I rarely get them. Maybeeeee 1 a year max! And I’ve gotten 3 in 2 months. drying and cold sore fuel
