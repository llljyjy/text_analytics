I received this product to sample and to review. So far I haven’t noticed a huge difference, but I have dry skin and it’s been very hydrating. It doesn’t have a bad odor and isn’t tacky.It’s a great price point too. I just need to try it for a longer than 2 week maybe to see the difference Hydrating
