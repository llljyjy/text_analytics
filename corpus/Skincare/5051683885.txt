I love the way this balm smells. It’s a very light scent which is great for sensitive skin. It’s a thick cream but when put on it doesn’t feel heavy after settling it. It leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. I really enjoy it.  I received this product complimentary of influenster. smells divine
