This new spray from Kosas is everything I’ve been wanting in a mist! I love that this provides quick and convenient moisture, along with a dewy plumpness that my skin positively craves. While most mists that I’ve tried essentially feel like scented water on my skin, this one feels more substantial while still being light and quickly absorbed by my skin. The packaging is gorgeous, and had a nice weight to it. I use this immediately after cleansing, it’s a perfect rebalancing step for my skin & also helps my other products absorb in better. Within a few weeks of adding this into my skincare routine I was noticing less dry patches, and a more even and plumped look to my skins texture. This spray serum is definitely a keeper—I absolutely love this formula! nan
