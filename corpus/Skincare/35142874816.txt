This melting balm was very gentle and I was nervous to use it as new products usually break my skin out but I havenâ€™t had any issues with this product. It is pretty much scentless which I really like. You only need a small product to takeoff your make up which is really good usually I need to use the cleansing balm twice to get all my makeup off. I recommend this product to anybody who needs a gentle make up remover. Love it
