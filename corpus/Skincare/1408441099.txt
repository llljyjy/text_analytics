I love Fresh Sugar Lip Balms. The moisturizing feel, scent, even the taste when you lick your lips. I have a few but when they introduced new colours, I jumped at the chance to grab you.

I recommend the lip balm, but not this particular colour…. unless you’re looking for that 80’s neon lip. Papaya is Neon
