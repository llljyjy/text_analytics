I liked this product because I felt like it wasn’t too thick and because I felt like it was also super moisturizing. The only thing I was iffy about was that it claims to help minimize pores but I haven’t seen any difference. The texture was great and the smell wasn’t too bad. Overall did most of what it had to. nan
