I really love this new sunscreen from FAB; it doesn’t leave a white cast after applying, it doesn’t make my face feel greasy and it does its job! I’ve tried it both alone and under makeup since getting it and have to say I love it both ways; there is no pilling when layering this sunscreen with other skincare products or when using it under my makeup which is a huge plus for me.
