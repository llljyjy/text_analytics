This is a great moisturizer. Gentle on my skin, absorbs into my skin really nicely and smells nice. I like that the smell is gentle. I use it twice, in the morning and at night. My skin is looking plump and refreshed. I will continue to use it until it finishes to see the long term results. Happy with it so far. nan
