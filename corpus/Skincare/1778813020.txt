This mask has a very strange consistency. When you initially open it, it reminds me of a whipped foundation texture from circa 2006. However, it is really a cool product. The charcoal beads break when you massage the product into your skin, and it feels amazing. The formula itself seems innovative too, it isnâ€™t too drying despite being a clay mask. Highly recommend for a nice spa night at home! Weird Consistency, Great Mask!
