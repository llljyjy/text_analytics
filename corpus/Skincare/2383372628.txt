I have been using this eye cream for nearly a year and have not seen ANY difference in my eyes - I would NOT recommend it! I chose this specifically after much research bc it is specifically for dark circles and it did absolutely nothing for me! The only reason I kept using it EVERY SINGLE NIGHT is bc I wanted to give it a chance, and also bc I paid a pretty penny for it. So disappointed! I also really do not like the purple glow/tint of the cream itself - I felt like it accentuated my dark circles and even tho I applied at night I still would prefer not to accentuate my already dark circles that Iâ€™m trying to correct. Did NOTHING for my dark circles!!
