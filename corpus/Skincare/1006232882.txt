Perfect addition to any skincare routine. It’s not greasy, not thick. No film either. Leaves skin soft, fresh and hydrated. Brightens and absorbs quickly. I gently shake the bottle before applying. Best to use after cleansing and before applying any other thicker creams or foundation. The ingredients list is so good. I had NO irritations using this. It’s surprisingly gentle. You can tell the difference right away! Amazing - so lightweight!
