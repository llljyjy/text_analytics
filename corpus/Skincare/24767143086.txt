I received this product as a sample for free from Youth to the People. That being said this is a nice moisturizer. It is super thick and creamy but dries down nicely and doesn’t feel like a heavy layer on your skin. A little goes a long way. It is odor less so no strong scents. Overall, it is a really nice moisturizer but it is pricey and I’m not sure that I love it enough for the price tag. nan
