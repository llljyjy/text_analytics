My skin loved this immediately. Followed the instructions and did the quarter scoop mixed with The Ordinary’s Buffet serum (also tried mixed with vitamin C serum from another brand but learned that those two ingredients shouldn’t be mixed, it diminishes the efficacy of both the vitamin C + the niacinamide). Powder dissolves fully into the serum and my skin was brighter after the first couple days of using once a day. No redness or irritation for me, unlike some actives. And it seems to have faded some new-ish acne scars already. Just a nice overall brightness and more even tone to the skin. Really great intro for me into this ingredient! Good value and easy to use, going to keep this in rotation. A new must have for me
