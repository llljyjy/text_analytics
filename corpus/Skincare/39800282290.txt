Got this CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum as #freeproduct from Topbox. I’m happy I was chosen to try it. I might not have the maximum result because the sample is not good for a week, so I’ll review it as far as I have been using it. I’ve been using this together with CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream and Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream. Smell is mild like the face and eye cream which is good for face product since smells usually stays on your nose. Texture is ok, peas size goes long way. I do feel somehow my face feels brighter but needs more application to see big results. I guess its better to use it as a set than just this alone or using it with other cream and eye cream since they are made to complement each other so you’ll have the best results for some time.
