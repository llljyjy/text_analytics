I really enjoyed this Estee Lauder advanced multi protection moisturizer! My favorite part is the spf to give me extra sun protection during the day. Spf is a must!!!! The only negative for me is that I was sent a normal/combo one and my skin is very dry. I might need something more moisturizering in the winter. But I can see this being really good for the summer. It makes my skin soft and not greasy. It goes well with makeup so there’s no piling with is huge. My skin does well with Estee Lauder products and I love the ingredients and quality. I will be using this jar up and probably purchase the one for dry skin when I’m finished! I definitely recommend this moisturizer especially since warmer weather is around the corner and everyone needs extra spf. Great spf moisturizer
