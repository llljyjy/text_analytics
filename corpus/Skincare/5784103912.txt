I am 33 years old, normal acne prone skin, started skincare since I was 13-14 and love skin care as a self care ritual. I have tried high brands and budget friendly face products. This is one of my favorites, I do exfoliate my skin twice a week. Use glycolic and lactic acids as part of my chemical exfoliating routines. I started using clean products since 2018. This are some of the benefits I have experience using this moisturizer: *soft skin and bouncy to the touch.*better skin texture  *my skin stays hydrated all day. *surprisingly has helped minimize my pores (cleanse, exfoliate,toner, serum,moisturizer. usually drink about a gallon of water a day) best moisturizer for my skin type and life style
