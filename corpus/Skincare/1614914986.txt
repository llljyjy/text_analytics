I tried a few small sample packets of this serum. The packet contains about a nickel-sized amount of product. Influenster sent in exchange for my honest review.  It claims to treat Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Dryness, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity. The product spreads easily. I applied it under eye, my lids, and dragged it from the bridge of my nose to my forehead. It didn’t irritate my eyes and as it dried I began to feel my skin tightening. However, after a week, I didn’t notice any major long-term changes. The verdict is still out
