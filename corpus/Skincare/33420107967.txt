I received the Lancôme Renergie H.C.F. Serum from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. After using for about a month I can say that it is worth it. This product is not only a great product that combines 3 products in 1 but it is also exceptional in the fact that it is an awesome size compared to many other, especially luxury, products that are only 1oz or sometimes less. The product packaging is beautiful and really looks great on any vanity and the gorgeous floral scent is very relaxing. The serum goes on easily, with very little product needed, so a bottle lasts for a long while.  The feel on my skin is like a combination of serum and a moisturizer.My skin has had more dryness recently and this product has been amazing to combat dry flaky patches. I really like using it at night so I wake up with smooth soft skin in the morning. I would say that my favorite thing about it is that if you wanted you could use this one product to moisturize, plump, and tackle anti-aging like wrinkles and dark spots. Meaning that you could use less of other products when you are in a hurry or, even if you just want to simplify your routine.I highly recommend for all skin types. You cant go wrong with this one! You Can’t Go Wrong With This 3 in 1!
