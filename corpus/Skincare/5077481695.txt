This is my new favorite serum! I hadn’t tried a serum with Niacinamide prior to this one and was honestly hesitant because I’d always heard that this ingredient was best for oily skin. But this serum was so soothing and I noticed differences in my skin texture after just 2 days! The serum has the consistency of a face oil. It goes on light and absorbs instantly into my skin, so I’m not working it in for 5 minutes like I have to with some of my other serums. After 2 weeks, my skin is noticeably brighter and smoother. This is definitely staying in my routine! My first Niacinamide Serum!
