I have combination skin and live in Houston with high humidity. This moisturizer is the perfect blend of adding moisture without leaving my skin feeling greasy. It’s perfect after a serum and before makeup (I have noticed my makeup sitting so much better) and as part of my nighttime routine. One of very few moisturizers that haven’t caused my combination skin to breakout. This product has a very light and pleasant scent. Love it and will definitely be repurchasing! Perfect for combo skin
