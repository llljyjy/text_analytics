I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review! Let me say that as my 30’s are coming close to an end I am constantly hoarding new moisturizers and face creams that promise all the same things-smoothing skin, firming, line reducing etc… I waited until I gave this product at least 3 weeks of consistency using it in my routine and let me say I really enjoy it. Along with other products this brand has put out that I have tried I am equally as satisfied! This has a thik consistency but it is not greasy. This is cool and refreshing on my skin. This is a really great overall face cream. I can say that it has made my skin feel amazing, I didn’t get blemishes while using it, there isn’t a scent so it’s great for sensitive skin as well. I will be purchasing this when my container is empty and I definitely recommend trying this one yourself! Great firming moisturizer
