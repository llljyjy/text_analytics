This is a nice, high quality serum but the turmeric smell really turns me off. It’s a relatively mild scent - kind of spiced like curry and earthy - but I dislike it enough that I wouldn’t buy the serum. If you don’t mind the scent, I like the light texture and think it’s a good product. Good product but don’t like the turmeric scent
