I received this #freeproduct to try through #trywithtopbox. I’ve used it for a week now and my skin has gone from looking dry and dull to a lot more hydrated and radiant. The serum has more watery consistency versus oily and I don’t mind that at all. It has a nice light citrusy smell which feels very refreshing and I absolutely love it. I would probably have to use it longer to see the brightening aspect of it but overall, highly recommended!! Very light and smells great!
