This stuff is GOOD. I was hesitant because of the price, but I am so glad I decided to order. Itâ€™s not sticky, smells amazing (pina colada kinda?), and is super hydrating. This winter weather has been killing me and overnight, I swear my lips have done a total 180. I think this will last a long time, but I will definitely be repurchasing. WOW.
