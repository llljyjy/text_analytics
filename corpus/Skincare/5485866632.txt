My skin has been breaking out pretty badly after getting off birth control and this stuff is definitely helping. I feel like itâ€™s just the right amount to salicylic acid to clear my breakouts without making my face super dry. I bought this after reading the good reviews and am super glad I did, will definitely be purchasing again! definitely worth it
