This is the first Tula product that I’ve tried and I’m so impressed! Being a new mum, my skin definitely needs some extra love right now. This product goes on so smooth and smells great! I have normal combination skin (not too dry, not overly oily) and I find that a little goes a long way. One pump is more than enough to leave my skin feel hydrated. My skin doesn’t look or feel greasy afterwards. I’ve been using this product for two weeks now and am very happy. nan
