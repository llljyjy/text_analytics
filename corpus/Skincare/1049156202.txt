Okay so one single star. You might think I’m being harsh but hear me out. To start with, the packaging is so cheap looking. It’s drug store cheap. For a $60 eye cream I expect more umph than a twist top plastic dispenser.   Then we get to the consistency of the actual product. I’ve never in my 41 years of life seen an eye cream that looks, feels and smells like a body lotion. Usually eye creams are a lighter and more airy consistency than other face products because of the delicate skin under the eye. This also caused stinging and itching after applying like a sunscreen does. Dispite the stinging and itching I used this nightly and I can say I saw absolutely no difference in wrinkles, firmness or texture. Hard pass. Save your money. I received this full sized product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Hard pass.
