I have been wearing this at night for 3 weeks. I used to have a whole assortment of creams I applied before bed, but this product cut down my nightly routine to just 1 product. It feels nice on the skin. I like to put a thick layer, but if you apply less, this wpuld work for daytime too. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin, however this product did the work of 3+ other products. The only draw back is that it is heavy scented. It isn’t a bad smell at all (floral), just not something I personally want in my skincare products. nan
