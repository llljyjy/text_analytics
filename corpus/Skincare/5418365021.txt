I received a sample from Topbox #freeproduct.  The product texture was just right, not too runny but not too thick, I think not all Serums get the consistency right.  I wish the product sample was enough for a week to see I think more of the results that they mention.  I had 2 days using both day and night and my skin felt a little more plump.  Unfortunately my one comment, maybe it was the packaging it came in, but there was this odd scent to it and it would deter me from buying this product.  I wonder as the cream did not have the smell but the eye cream did as well and it was also in the same envelope type packaging.  I would buy this product only if I could confirm that odd scent was not in the full size item. nan
