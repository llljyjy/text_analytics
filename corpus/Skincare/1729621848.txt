HORRIBLE. I never ever ever write reviews, good or bad BECAUSE I feel I am a cosmetic industry snob coming from the Cosmo world for 13 years. WELL Tomorrow I am speaking at conference, one of my biggest career achievements. Everyone raves about theses masks so I thought why not. Well. Not only did it rip, not stick, but I got MAYBE 5 minutes of face wear out of this. Such a waste of money and so sad and disappointed. horrible - just find another.
