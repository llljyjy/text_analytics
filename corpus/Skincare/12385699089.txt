Product are nice and feel very ’clean’ and awesome. both the face and body balm are both balmy indeed, sort of reminds me of a cleaner more lightweight Vaseline with the body balm kinda being a cream texture but still greasy-ish.  I can’t really speak to the effect on eczema/dermatitis  yet as I’ve seen no improvements yet but my skin was more hydrated and less dry. The amount you get is really small but it’s good for travel or if you want to try out the products first. Try it out if ya want :)
