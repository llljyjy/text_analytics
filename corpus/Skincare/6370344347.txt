This is the first time I’ve ever used this night cream and I absolutely love it. I know this is something I’ll purchase over and over again. Let me start off my saying that some heavier creams do cause breakouts for me but not this one. This cream has a thicker consistency but it doesn’t feel heavy on your face. It has a slight smell that I love but doesn’t stay on very long. I wake up with hydrated glowing skin and it has been a game changer. I highly recommend this as a night cream! nan
