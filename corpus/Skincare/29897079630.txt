Because I only got a sample size I can only describe my thoughts of the products after a few uses.  The texture is nice and silky, feels light on my skin and I like that itâ€™s fragrance free.   It made my skin feel good without leaving residue and went on great under my makeup.  I like what it promises to do, time will tell. Very promising
