I loved trying out this product. It works really well for me and I love the simplicity of having 3 products in 1. I use it mainly for makeup removal and love the ultra soft fragrance that it has. Even waterproof makeup glides right off with it. Iâ€™ve used it several times as a mask as well and I like how easy it is to apply and also to remove. It makes my skin look and feel fresh and soft. nan
