Suffering from extremely sensitive skin, I risk it all trying a new product. Luckily, this moisturizer did wonders for me. I use it both day and night after my serums (thinnest to thickest). I call this the DE dupe but doesn’t make you breakout or leave the feeling of “film” left on the face. GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN & LAYERING
