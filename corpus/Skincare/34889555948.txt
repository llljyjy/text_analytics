This product is nice and creamy to apply and dries quickly. It works well with blackheads which is great because that is my one main problem especially on my nose. Along with the other products I’ve tried by Shiseido, it doesn’t have a strong scent which is good. I like when cleansers make my skin feel tight because that means they are doing a good job cleaning, which is the case with this product. Just apply your favorite moisturizer afterwards and that tightness will resolve. Great Cleanser
