I have been using this serum for about a month now. My first impression of this serum was great. The packaging is stunning and feels so luxurious. I love the idea of using cleaner products as well. This serum was beautiful on the skin. It layered nicely with my other products and definitely did what it claimed to do. My only issue is that I notice my pores look congested after a few days of using this. Unfortunately I have to knock a star off for that reason alone. I will continue to use it on occasion when I feel like my skin needs a boost but I will not purchase this product with my own money. Clogged pores
