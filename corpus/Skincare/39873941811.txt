This felt good to use on my skin.  It felt like my face soaked it right up every day when I used it.  I didn’t see a huge difference in my skin, but it did feel softer and healthier.  Visibly I felt my skin looked more nourished but didn’t notice any big change in the wrinkles I have forming.  7 days may not have been enough time! Nourishing
