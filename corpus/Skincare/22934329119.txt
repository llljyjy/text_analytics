Let me start by saying I try to be really fair and honest in these reviews so other people like me can get accurate information BEFORE purchasing. I’ve tried lots of hyaluronic acid serums, plumping serums etc and this one isn’t bad. For me it works well, hydrates, not oily, no real smell to it, and it does in fact plump the skin. However, I’ve been using it for a month (I give all the products I try 30 consecutive days) to see if there is benefit and the answer is yes. This will hydrate your skin and make it soft plump and so on. It is however a very small amount for the price and using it AM and PM as recommended it barely lasted me the full 30 days. I’m not fully sold on this because I feel there are other products that produce just as well results if not BETTER, for less money and more product. A good example is the jumbo plum plump from glow recipe. So for me it won’t be a repurchase because I feel there are others that do better Middle Shelf Product
