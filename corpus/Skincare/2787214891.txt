I used this for the first time last night and woke up with SILKY smooth skin. I’ve never had my skin feel so silky. I’m so used to balmy/sticky/heavy and thick creams that this was a nice change. It’s not heavy and it’s not light, perfectly in the middle. It glides on nicely and a little goes a long way. With this moisturizer, I feel a relief for my dehydrated skin. I combo this with a serum that has hyaluronic acid in it. I noticed that my skin didn’t produce much sebum at night or in the morning when I woke up so that means it really helped hydrate and lock in moisture! Very happy with this product buy it
