I’m not really one to leave reviews but if your thinking about trying something new don’t please “if it’s not broke don’t fix it” I’m glad I just bought this sample before buying all the stuff because I have normal to dry skin and this was terrible for my skin I’m not really one to ever get pimples but this BROKE ME OUT SO BAD. I was using  Cerave before this and it looks like I’m going back to it. Besides this product smelling good it just made me break out really wish I liked it considering I spent 50 $ on it my poor skin Fr worst thing I’ve done yet save your skin
