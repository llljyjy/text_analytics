After the first application, I felt the unimaginable smoothness of the skin!  Peel off.  Black dots become less visible.  The skin after such washing breathes!  The action resembles a light scrub, but does not injure the skin at all, but gently exfoliates, which is the most important thing for my skin.  Doesnâ€™t dry out at all, just makes it matte and fresh.  I really liked this tool! Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Great!
