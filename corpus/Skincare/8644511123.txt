I usually purchase the Ordinaryâ€™s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum but I decided to switch things up and try the Marine because I was told that it was even more hydrating. Unfortunately, this product was a no for me. The texture felt like a watered down version of the Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum. My skin did not adjust well and it started to break me out a little bit so I stopped using it completely. Not for me
