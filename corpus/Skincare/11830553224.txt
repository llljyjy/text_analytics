There are several reason why I cannot rate this product higher. First of all, the price. I usually buy the Kiehls eye cream for half the price and like it way better. Although the consistency of this eye cream is pretty light it sits on top of you under bags forever. If you somehow rub the area you will get it in your eyes. I have been using this cream and I havenâ€™t seen any significant results nan
