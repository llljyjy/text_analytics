This is my new holy grail. I use this 2-3x a week. I love this so much more than The Ordinary’s facial peel. It does give the skin a slight tingling sensation but it doesn’t last long. I prefer put a little bit in my hands and then pat it in my skin. This is helping clear my blackheads and my acne seems to be improving as well! I recommend for you to try the trial size because it does last. nan
