I love this sunscreen! It goes on as a super light mist, does not leave a white residue or an oily sheen. I’ve worn full face makeup on top of it in the summer and my face does not get oily or run- and I’m protected from harmful uv rays! I put the bottle in my cosmetics fridge to enjoy a refreshing, cooling start to my day and the new whote peach scent is just heavenly!! An essential part of my daily beauty ritual! A must-have in your beauty arsenal!
