I was so excited to get this in the mail after all of the positive reviews and videos on TikTok. The jar that I received was not creamy and smooth as it should be. It had separated and there was a layer of oil and some clumpy goop underneath. I sent it back the next day for a refund. Others are having the same issue that I hadâ€¦ wished I had seen their reviews before I purchased. Opened a jar of separated clumpy and oily mess
