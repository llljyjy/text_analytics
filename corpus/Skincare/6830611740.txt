Love this cream! It’s silky, almost serum like. Goes on light and absorbs quickly into your skin, it doesn’t feel heavy at all. Most moisturizers leave my skin feeling greasy but this was not the case at all! It also worked great under my BB cream. Started noticing a difference after about a week, skin was brighter and more even. I also really appreciated that it’s not heavily scented. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new skin cream! A little goes a long way!
