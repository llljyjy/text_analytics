Okay so I went into sephora one day looking for an eye cream. I have realllly bad eczema and the most sensitive skin ever. I asked one of the workers what would be the best for me and I just wanted something that would help the dry skin on my eyes. I am only 20 and on a budget so she recommended this to me and honestly i didn’t know if it would be good, but it really isz It healed all the dry skin on my eyes and didn’t cause any irritation or redness. I cant go a day without it now. I really recommend this. MUST HAVE especially for sensitive/eczema prone sk
