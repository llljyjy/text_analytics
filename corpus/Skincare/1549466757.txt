Perfect day cream and will keep on using it for another few years. This cream’s texture is like delicate butter; a light cream that sufficiently moisturizes my normal to dry skin during the day without a greasy heavy feeling. KIt can work for winter dry skin,but it may me a tad too light.Allows for layering with serums and other layers (i.e, sunblock). It doesn’t; run into my eyes as other moisturizers tend to in the hot climate I’m in, which means no awful eye irritation that upsets my sinuses. When I apply it, it cools my skin not in a menthol way, but my skin feels refreshed, it’s an enjoyable experience to apply this cream.It’s more than a moisturizer, this may be a very personal preference, but the scent reminds me of expensive spa products. I find sometimes, in the mad rush of getting ready in the morning, I’m instantly calmed when I apply this cream, it’s like aromatherapy, it relaxes me and I find myself taking a few deep breaths, inhaling slowly to enjoy the scent and it changes my mood.Hey some may disagree, but the French know their scents, and this is my 3rd bottle. Fine lines and wrinkles, I don’t think any cream on this planet can reverse time, so no noticeable results there but in all honesty I haven’t been monitoring for those types of results. Try this cream for its delicate French fragrance
