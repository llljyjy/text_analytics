Effective cleanser but definitely not for normal, dry, and combination skin and definitely not for daily use! My skin was so dry and peeling after using it! Very effective at cleansing, removed makeup well and was gentle around the eyes but I don’t think I can continue to use it and I wouldn’t recommend it. not for me…
