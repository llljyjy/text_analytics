I received a free sample of this product for my honest review I wanted to love it right away because one of my biggest issues is the pores and blackheads on my nose after exfoliating my face I put it on before bed the next morning my skin felt a bit softer so I thought alright well I only used it once but so far so good ..until I looked in the mirror...my pores on my nose we’re HUGE and FULL(gross!) now mind you I barely put any on my nose due to my concerns of clogging the pores and I’m just not the kind of person who thinks more of a products is better then less. I was so grossed out before using this my 0ores we’re well pores after horribly clogged and huge this is definitely not for someone who is looking to help your pores it’ll make them worst trust me. never again!
