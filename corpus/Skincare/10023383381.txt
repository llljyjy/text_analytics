I like the easy to apply consistency  and how quickly it goes on. It makes my eyes look less tired and gradually brightens the whole area.  It doesn’t have a strong smell and didn’t irritate my skin at all. Another plus is how long one bottle lasts. Plenty enough product to see visible results in a timely manner and in a longer term. Pretty good
