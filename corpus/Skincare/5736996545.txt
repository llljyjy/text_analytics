Love!! I have many lip balms but I continuously go back to this one. It stays in my bag! It feels so nice and it has some staying power ( with mask on face) and smells great! I love how it makes my lips feel. It is on the thicker side but not sticky. The packaging is perfect. It is pricey and itâ€™s nothing special BUT it works and it is exactly what I look for in a lip balm. It does give my lips a bit of shine but no color. You will enjoy this product. love and I keep using!
