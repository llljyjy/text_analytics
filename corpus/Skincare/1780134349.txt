I’ve been using these products for a little over a week now and I love the make up melt gently takes off make up. I use a waterproof eyeliner that I usually have to use a cleanser twice to get it off but I found I only need a tiny bit of this product to remove it. I’m not sure how much dead skin the micro peel is actually taking off as it seems like the solution balls up before it’s even applied to the face but my skin does feel smooth after using it. I also loved the moisturizer. I worked great under make up during the day. The moisturizer doesn’t feel heavy and it gives skin a nice finish that isn’t shiny. I would recommend these products for anyone with fry or combination skin. Not sure if I would purchase the micro peel on its own. nan
