I received a full sized jar of Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer as a free sample to try and then to give an honest review for. This product is rich & creamy. I only need to use a small amount to completely cover my face and neck. Since I’ve been using it I no longer have the dry spots in the middle of my forehead, the dry spots directly below both eyes, and a dry area between my eyebrows that also extends down the entire length of my nose. Those areas have always been a problem for me but now I have no problems with any of those areas. My face & neck skin feels as soft as a baby and has been improving in appearance each day of use. I use it in the morning and before bed on a freshly cleansed face. It is absolutely non-greasy. It absorbs immediately and dries right away. This moisturizer spreads & blends so easy. I will be purchasing this product because I am so happy with it. The only ’negative’ thing, for me, is that I don’t particularly care for the scent. It’s not a strong scent but it just isn’t to my liking. Everything else about this product is ’positive’ for me. Quick Absorbing & Creamy Rich
