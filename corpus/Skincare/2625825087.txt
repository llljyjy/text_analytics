I ordered the drunk elephant protini polypeptide after receiving a deluxe sample of it. I ordered the full size to take advantage of a sale, and I didn’t open it until a few months after ordering, because I was still finishing off the deluxe sample. Unfortunately the packaging did not work, and is unable to be pumped out of the package. It is still full and unable to be used. I exclusively use drunk elephant on my skin, and I have reordered drunk elephant’s other products many times, have never had this issue with any of their other serums. Sephora customer service was so unhelpful and refused to resolve the issue since it was outside of their 60 day return policy. I didn’t even open it until after 60 days since I was finishing the sample. Such a terrible experience and now I have a full bottle of $82 serum that is unusable. Defective item, horrible customer service
