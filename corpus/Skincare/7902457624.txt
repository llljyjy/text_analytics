I received a deluxe trial size of this in exchange for my review. It lasted me about a week of using it twice a day. I did notice by the third day my face did hold a glow. However,my face also felt quite oily after a couple days, and I had debated on stopping early. This cream would be great for drier skin types, but it made my combo skin feel  slick. Gives a glow
