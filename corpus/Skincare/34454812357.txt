Its beyond my comprehension that a treatment enriched with beneficial actives contains so much perfume. Yes it gives an immediate glow, but reactions too with increased use which write off all benefits. If your skin is sensitive, stay away from perfumed treatment all together. There are many fragrance free, gentle and pure treatment at all price point. I rather smell the not so pleasant active itself and have peace of mind. Sensitive skin be aware!!!!
