First things first, I received this product for free from Influenster and Shani Darden for my honest review. When I was sent this product I wondered, “Why use an anti-aging product when I’m not even 30 yet?” Well it turns out this was a product I didn’t know I needed. Prior to reading the box for this product I knew nothing about retinol which is the primary ingredient in this serum. Anti-aging products were simply well out of my realm of awareness. Retinol is known to reduce fine lines, firm and brighten skin as this product claims to do. I didn’t start with many fine lines though I laugh and smile a whole so I can’t speak for that but I can say that since incorporating this into my nightmare skincare routine, I have seen a noticeable difference in the bounce of my skin, smoothness overall and brightness. I don’t about retinol as a stand-alone but this product is the truth. It is a little high end ringing at $88 a bottle but what’s cheaper this or a facelift? Not to mention the infrequency you use this (1-2 times a week) makes the product stretch. I started testing this product 3 weeks ago (when I took my before photo) and I just recorded my after video right before posting this. Color me impressed. I will gladly spend my money on this product when it runs out. Toodles! Pleasant Surprise
