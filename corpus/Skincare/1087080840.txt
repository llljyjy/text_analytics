(I received this product as a free sample to provide a review.) I’ve been using the Lancôme Rénergie for the past 2.5 weeks.  First thought is the packaging looks nice.  After using it, I’m delighted to actually be able to see results!  The white cream is lightweight and easy to apply.  Once it’s on my skin, it’s absorbs well.  My area of concern is dark spots and I’ve noticed them get lighter as well.  On the ingredients, I’ve used Vitamin C previously so having Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Ferulic Acid was a first time.  I’m excited to continue using this product and seeing how my skin improves over more time. Worth a Try
