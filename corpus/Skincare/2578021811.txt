I was really excited to start using this product and see the best results like some people has posted here, but unfortunate this caused all mess on my skin.Used this product along with Essential-C Day Moisture Broad Spectrum SPF 30 PA+++.Week 1 & 2 did nothing to my skin but week 3 really broke out on my cheeks which is very unusual for me.Later when I went to return the product , a beauty advisor said this is not clean from Sephora and may be thats the reason it broke you out.Now dealing with the mess the product has left on my face.Take away please look for skin care products thats labeled clean from Sephora. Left mess on my skin
