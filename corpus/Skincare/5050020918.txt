I received this for free from Influenster. I am not normally a sunscreen fan as they have all seemed to be the same to me but I love this! It smells so good (not like a sunscreen) and didn’t break me out which is definitely unusual. Normally sunscreens become very greasy on my face but not this one. I also normally stick with SPF30 but I’ll be making an exception for this one. Surprise Love
