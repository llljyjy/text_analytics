I absolutely love this mineral sunscreen! Itâ€™s thin and spreads so easily,  stays on for hours and is a great primer under my makeup. The size is convenient and I love that you can hear the little ball inside mixing it up. Do shake well! This leaves no residue or white cast on your beautiful face. This also helps my freckles stay in check.  Great brand.  This is a winner. My New Favorite Sunscreen!
