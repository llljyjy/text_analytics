I received this product as part of a promotion and was happy to try it out. I have oily combination skin but just had an intense microneedling at the dermatologist and this did seem to help calm and hydrate my skin. I found it thick but it does absorb quickly and does soften skin. I used on face and neck for 1 week and I think it helped me. nan
