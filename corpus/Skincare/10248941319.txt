i wanted to love this so bad but it doesn’t work very well. I bought it expecting to use it for double cleansing but it doesn’t remove makeup very well. i use a liquid liner which is not a waterproof one. also it does not feel very good on my skin, most cleansing balms have some slip or are sort of greasy this one is not. overall would not buy again. nan
