I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I chose the YTTP cactus oasis serum. First and foremost, YTTP can do no wrong. I have oily combo skin but during the winter my skin gets extremely flaky and rough. This serum has helped smooth out my rough patches and instantly made my skin look super hydrated. Iâ€™ve used this product over a month now and noticed such a difference with my fine lines too! Love pairing this with my adaptogen deep cream. Transformed my skin!
