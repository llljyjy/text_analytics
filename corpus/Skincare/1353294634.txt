I was very excited to get this product and I’ve been using it regularly for a few weeks, but have not seen any dark spot lightening. I have sensitive skin and suffer with melasma. The instructions suggest 3 pumps for face, neck and chest. I apply after cleansing and top with a bit of moisturizer. The bottle is only 30 mL, so I assume I’ll go through this quickly. The least I expected was to wake up with baby soft skin, but even that hasn’t happened. I will not be repurchasing. Ineffective
