Sephora collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest review. I’ve never used a facial roller until I tried the Sephora collection blue adventure de-puffing facial roller. I was a bit skeptical when this first came out but after trying it out for a week, I can see my jawline and face a bit better. I definitely will keep using this in my morning and nighttime routine. The pricing is also very affordable compared to other rollers I’ve seen! Bye bye puffiness
