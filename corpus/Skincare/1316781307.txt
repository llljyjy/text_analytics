After using this for more then 3 weeks , I can confidently say this is my new go to eye cream. Itâ€™s lightweight but provides a great amount of moisture without being heavy. It sits beautifully under make up and also helped with my under eye bags/ puffiness. I love that its fragrance free and has great hydrating ingredients like niacinamide. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new Nd very effective anti aging eye cream. Will definitely purchase when I run out. New Favorite Eye Cream
