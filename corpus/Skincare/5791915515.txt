I genuinely really like this moisturizer. I would say it is the perfect happy medium. It’s not too light for my very dry skin and doesn’t feel greasy for daytime but it’s heavy enough to hydrate. I pair it with the kora noni eye oil and tatcha essence. Great combo for my skin! However I really don’t love the fragrance it’s so floral Perfect Medium Moisture
