I received this as a sample, and I love it.  If you have trouble with bags under my eyes and fine lines around your eyes, this is the product for you. This stuff works. As you put it on it has a little warming sensation then you pat the cream below your eyes wait a few minutes and you look better!  It is velvety soft when you put it on, it feels really good.FYI tip: do you know how you run out of something but you always know there’s a little left at the bottom so you crack up in the container and dig out the rest well that won’t happen with this container! Amazing eye cream!
