O M G. I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I went with this moisturizer because I heard amazing things about Glow Recipe and let me tell you - they weren’t wrong! Not only does the product feel soft and smell amazing, it’s also very light. It has become my daily routine the past few weeks and I might actually switch over to this permanently. It’s in such a cute container which sold me right away. I feel a little tingle after I put it on (must be the acid). love it!
