Great for the price. Only a few down falls the cleanser is great just doesn’t smell good. Now the exfoliater is very abrasive, I really don’t think that will be good for the skin but the cooling part of it is amazing and it makes me wanna find more products that have it! The lip balm is amazing. Good for the price!
