I have been a die hard fan of the laneige sleeping mask for years. My taste in lip balm is incredibly picky, and i end up hating more than i like. This lip balm lasts all day and is super moisturizing, and has the most beautiful gloss finish. it is very smooth, not sticky whatsoever. the littlest bit of this product goes a long way. this will be a new staple in my rotation!! Incredible!!
