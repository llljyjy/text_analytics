I received this complementary in exchange for my honest review.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin so I rarely mix up my skin care routine.  I have heard many positive things about Korres products so I was excited to try this.  I used it inolace of my night time moisturizer and loved it.  It did a fantastic job moisturizing my skin and I didnâ€™t have any issues with it. Moisture without grease
