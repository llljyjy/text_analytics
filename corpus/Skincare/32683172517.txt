Algin on ingredient list definition is- It is hydrophilic and forms a viscous gum when hydrated. Maybe this is what is balling up in the formula. Idk, but I have another chemical exfoliator do this but they were transparent about the fact that it “wasn’t actually your skin“. Not saying it’s bad at its job just wish PTR would be more transparent as well. Maybe?
