I’ve been using this product for the past week and have to say that I’m really loving the result I’m seeing! I have very dry skin and had a pretty intense red patch of irritated skin around my mouth, but after 4 days of using this serum, it’s almost completely cleared up. I have also been desperate for a good hyleronic acid product for hydration and i love that this is an ingredient. It it’s a bit thin/watery but that’s my only dislike. On a positive note, it layers nicely under other products and feels very light! Amazing for dry skin
