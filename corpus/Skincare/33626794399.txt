It has a sting when you first start using it but after a few times of using it the sting goes away. If your skin is more on the sensitive/ reactive side I would recommend using once every three days then working you way up to once everyday. I started using it once everyday when I first got it but my skin was getting dry and red. Toned it down to every few days and working my way up slowly and my skin was used to it. It helps with my skin texture and my acne, and for the price itâ€™s worth it. Good toner
