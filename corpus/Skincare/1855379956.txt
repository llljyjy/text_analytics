I’ve been using this cream in the morning & at night, in place of my normal moisturizer. I’m really impressed so far, as most cause my sensitive skin to break out. I haven’t had any new break outs and it’s been leaving my skin very smooth. Normally thick creams do not work for me in warm weather, but this hasn’t been an issue either. My skin has also had a bright, healthy glow to it! I can’t say whether it has helped my skin in other ways (aging, etc), as that would require several months of use. But so far, so good! (No filters in picture posted, but my 41 year old face looks so healthy! Lol) nan
