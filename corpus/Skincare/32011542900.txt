This product is so unique and different. I love how it is a dual phase serum in oil, because it gives you so much moisture without ever leaving you looking or feeling greasy. I’m not usually a fan of rose fragranced products but this is so light and beautifully fragranced, I love it. This is a product I will always have on hand from now on. I’m in love with this oil in serum it’s so FRESH!
