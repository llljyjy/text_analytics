I use to use Clinique moisturizers all the time when I was younger. It’s been a few years since I’ve used them and they’re just as good as I remember. I especially love the moisture surge for when I’ve had a long day in the sun and my skin is a little burnt or irritated. It’s soothing and hydrating. Nothing more that I would want. Overall, I recommend this to anyone with any kind of skin type. Great moisture when sunburnt
