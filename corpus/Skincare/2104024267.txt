I received this product from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. The packing on this serum is amazing! It has good weight to it and the pump works great. The product was thin, didn’t pill up on the skin, and left  my skin feeling hydrated. No greasy residue and it felt fresh. Right from the get-go I could tell this product had dimethicone in it. It left a slight blurred/smoothed look to my skin. I don’t like seeing this product in a serum because I don’t like feeling my skincare sit on my face. For this reason I do not use it at night.  This works for me when I use it as a day-serum to use under my makeup. It works really well as a pre-primer to add hydration and blur the skin a bit. I haven’t been able to tell any long term effects but I’ve been really liking it as a pre-makeup serum. I will continue to use for sure. Good Pre-Makeup Skincare
