I’ve gotten a bunch of samples of this stuff over the years and y’all, my wallet is truly sad to say that this is the best. The skin looks glowy all day long. All day my friends. I work at an airport so the wind and sun are competing against my face and when I go home at night the skin is still plump, still hydrated. Shed your tears and then hit the buy button because it is worth it. Yes, sadly, it is worth it
