Kiehl’s barrier cream really works. I have been using it for about two weeks every night. I’m amazed how hydrated my skin feels in the morning. After one use I noticed an improvement in the dry patch on my forehead. The cream is thick but rubs in nicely. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky or greasy. A little goes a long ways; I only use a few pea size amounts for my face. Great Cream
