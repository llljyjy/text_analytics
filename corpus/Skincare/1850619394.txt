Iâ€™ve tried using prescription tretinoin for years because of its anti-acne, and anti-aging benefits but have never been able to use it without pealing. This serum leaves skin beautifully soft and younger looking without any irritation. Its extremely effective while also being gentle on my sensitive skin Great alternative to tretinoin
