This product gives my skin some great moisture. I apply it both day and night - it’s thick but not too thick and absorbs easily so I find it works well for both times. The smell is a bit off putting - I would describe it as earthy? I haven’t noticed a difference in any fine lines as of yet. Great for adding moisture
