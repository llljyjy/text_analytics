I see a lot of negative reviews of this product, but I honestly I think it’s pretty amazing. I was taking a chance buying this, because my skin hasn’t agreed with other glow recipe products in the past (guessing because of the amount of fragrance in their other products), however I couldn’t resist trying a new sunscreen! I have been using it in the morning without any moisturizer at the moment, and haven’t seen any issue with dry skin. For reference I am combo (oily t zone, dry cheeks), can be acne prone, and have seen sensitivity with fragrant products or products that contain essential oils. This product does have a light watermelon scent, but it dissipates within 20 min or so. It’s working well with my Lys foundation currently, but idk what it would be like with a powder or matte foundation.. it might pill as other reviews have suggested. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have not noticed any sensitivity or increase in acne. And I have tried other chemical sunscreens that have caused my acne to flare up, so this is certainly one of a kind! If you have a bit of extra money to spend, and your skin kinda sounds like mine, I highly recommend trying this! Great product!
