I received the Estee Lauder micro essence lotion for free through influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I first applied the Estee Lauder micro essence it gave my skin a brightening glow but after about a week of using it, my skin started feeling dry and it no longer gave my skin that glow that it first did. I would recommend this to someone with somewhat sensitive skin because it is very suttle. No fragrance. Estee Lauder micro essence
