In the jar, it really looks like cookies and cream! It has a bouncy, spongey texture unlike anything Iâ€™ve expected. You massage it into your skin until the beads break and turn the mask grey. After 15 minutes, my skin looked brighter and my pores smaller. Super fun and effective. Great texture and results
