TULA Skincare, simply, is truly incredible. A Glow-Up product that is real game-changer in the world of beauty and cosmetics. Once in a generation a scientific breakthrough comes along that shakes things up and makes you take notice - that time is now, and Probiotics are the way. I found out that TULA was female founded, by the fabulous Dr Raj. After seeing the life-changing impact probiotics can have in a healthy natural diet, as well as in supplements, on her patientsâ€™ internal health. Not only were they feeling better, but their skin seemed to be glowing. And from there TULA was born. For me personally, I was blown away by how soft and glowing my skin is using the serum. 8-10 hours after use, you can still touch your face and noticeable mark the difference. My skin feels soft, hydrated and happy like never before, without being sticky, gummy or tacky when applied. Try TULA out for yourself and see the power of probiotics! Trust In TULA, And Glow!
