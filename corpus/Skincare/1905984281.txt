The product itself I like a lot, very lightweight but packed with beneficial ingredients.Because of how liquidy( almost watery) the product is, I don’t like the pump bottle. I usually would pump the product directly onto my face instead of onto my hand, because this waste the product. This isn’t possible with this bottle. The pump shoots the product out in a way that is difficult to be precise. You have to pump it into your hands first. Refreshing and lightweight
