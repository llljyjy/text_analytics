It has a lightweight consistency that hydrates my combination skin without feeling heavy or greasy. I love that this product is unscented and absorbs quickly! It also looks good under my makeup! My only issue with this moisturizer is that it comes in a jar— I’d prefer a pump bottle or tube! Overall, if this product is within your budget, I definitely recommend! Hydrating for my combo skin!
