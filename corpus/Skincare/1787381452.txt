I like this cream a lot, I have somewhat unpredictable skin when it comes to creams and what will make me break out but I had no issues with this. Been using it for over a week now and I feel like I wake up with my skin more hydrated in the morning and it keeps my skin feeling great all day as well. My only qualm is the scent to it, it seems very strong which Iâ€™m not a huge fan of when I putting cream on my face. Moisturizing but Very Scented
