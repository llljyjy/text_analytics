Tried this out for a solid 2 weeks and let just say I’m a bit sensitive to some of the ingredients. Might be the retinol. Just gotta layer and use every other day instead. I think the product overall is okay, I dont think it’s something I’ll use or think about reaching for first during my night time routine. It’s very similar to the other products where it is fragrant free, similar texture - cream and gel like, apply easily, and simple packaging. Not a must have
