I like how it went on and how quickly it absorbed into the skin, leaving a beautiful sheen. It also has a pleasant aroma. The best aspects of the container are that it is eco-friendly and that all the ingredients are clean. I was gifted by Tara Harper Skincare but will continue to use and purchase out of pocket itâ€™s that good! nan
