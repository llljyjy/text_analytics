I am unsure why, but it is making my dark spot AND the skin around my dark spot(everything that gets covered by the patch) darker!!I thought it was irritation at first, but it is now +3 days since my last dots were placed and i can see little dark circles everywhere they were. I see it worked for many people, so not sure why i am having this reaction to them. Made it darker
