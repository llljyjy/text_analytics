I wanted to hate this due to the price but it’s the best facial cream I have ever tried! The packaging is beautiful. Makes me feel spoiled! The cream itself is light going on and feels amazing once applied. I have combination skin and this totally helps to balance my skin throughout the day. I will have to continue to purchase once I go through this bottle but I think it’ll last a while because a little goes a long way! Worth every penny!
