I was really hoping this product would work for me as I had been searching for the right product for my acne scars. However, I cannot stand the smell of this product. It smells like burning plastic and it is so strong. I tried it for the first time, let it settle on my skin hoping the smell would go away but it just got worst the longer it was on my face and it made me nauseous. Took it off after a few minutes, never using this product again. Too bad its also past the 60 days return policy since I was trying out other skincare products. Waste of money Horrible Smell
