I like that it has a mist spray. Yes it does have a strong alcohol smell which is tolerable. It has a sticky residue for a bit until it settles. For me, it feels a little heavy on my face as if you are using a lotion type sunscreen on your face which is not what I was looking for. I am looking for something more on the lighter side as my pores clog easily. nan
