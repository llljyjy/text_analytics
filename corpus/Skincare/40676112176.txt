I have seen so many videos where people were raving over this and let me tell you, they were right. This set is perfect to try for yourself or gift. You get the Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment, Tiger Grass Cream & Tiger Grass Serum.  The Tiger Grass correcting treatment noticably reduced my redness and the serum and cream hydrated my poor dry skin. They have a light botanical fragrance but itâ€™s not heavy or overwhelming and dissipates quickly. The products worked well under my makeup with no pilling. They are light and absorb into the skin easily. I 10 out of 10 recommend trying this set. I saw noticeable difference in my skin and will be purchasing the full size products. Works Great!
