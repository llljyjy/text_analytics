I received the Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist as a #freeproduct to review from #trywithtopbox. The body is really nice but the scent i would give it a 5/10. The smell is more of a strong floral scent. The mist is very strong and refreshing in the mourning. The scent last pretty long till the afternoon and then would have to reapply. It does get firmer when applied to the skin but in a good way. Also, tried it at night and was good also.  It does give your skin a shiny look but not a greasy way. Overall its a good product and price point but if the scent was a little better i would have gave it a better rating. #Review Free Product
