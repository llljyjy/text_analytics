I did not notice any difference even though i did all 15 sessions (5 days, 3 each) and i took before and after pictures. The vials are very hard to squeeze, there is not enough product for 4 applications like they advertise, so i went through all the vials in the starter kit.  But most importantly, my teeth are the same shade. They werenâ€™t yellow to begin with but i was hoping for a brighter and whiter shade and got nothing other than sore lips. What an enormous waste of money :( disappointed
