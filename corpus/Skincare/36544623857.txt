Love, Love, Love  This is the best cleanser that I have ever used and Iâ€™m old.  It is pricey but a little goes a long way, so it is well worth the price.  I love the smell, light and airy.  It leaves my skin very soft, silky and hydrated to the max.  It lathered well and took all my makeup off including my eye makeup. Would highly recommend. The Best
