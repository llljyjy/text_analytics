I tried this serum and have to say that it made my skin even drier. I couldn’t understand how this could be with such a high price tag then I looked at ingredients and saw alcohol quite high up on the ingredients. I do not have sensitive skin at all.Honestly this did nothing positive for my skin. If anything negative results making it drier and I don’t like fragrance in my skin care products.I surely wouldn’t recommend this to anyone!! Very disappointed! Dr. Barbara Sturm Brightening Serum
