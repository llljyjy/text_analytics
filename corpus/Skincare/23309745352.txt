I received a sample of this today and tried it...Everyone is talking about how bad it smells... I’m pretty congested at the moment so I can’t smell anything so I’ll most likely write another review when I can actually smell again.However, when I applied it, it balled and pilled once it dried on my skin. I hate that!Not sure why it does this or why some people experience this. Are we using too much? I’ll try it again tomorrow and use less. Not sure about it...
