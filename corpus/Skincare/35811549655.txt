A little goes a long way when using this cream. Agreement self is thick and luxurious, without being too heavy. It is lightly scented and feels nice on your skin. It absorbs quickly. As I get older, I am finding that the fine lines and wrinkles are more apparent on my face. Using this cream under and around my eyes and around my mouth has made a difference. My skin is stronger and appears more hydrated. I really like the way that it feels. It does not take a lot of this cream to cover your face and neck. I will buy this again because it does last a long time. I was given a sample sized bottle to try and exchange for my honest review. A little goes a long way!
