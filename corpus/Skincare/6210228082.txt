I was so impressed with The Algenist Collagen Lip! It acts quickly, after letting the product absorb, the lines in my lips were smoothed out and I noticed my lips were slightly bigger. I really enjoyed the smell and taste, it’s similar to vanilla. The value for the amount of product you get is great- I’ve been using it product twice a day for about a month now and am only about a third of the way though the tube. I’m glad I started added collagen to my routine, even though I’m still in my 20s, it’s been making a big difference! nan
