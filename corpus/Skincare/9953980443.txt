This is a good eye cream! Honestly, I’ve never used them before- I have dry skin and just use my serums, moisturizers, and oils all over my face including the eye area since the products I have are pretty moisturizing. My main concern is preventing aging and I use sunscreen, but I’ve noticed worse dark circles and significant bags lately. I don’t have the money for filler and concealer doesn’t really have luck with depuffin creams or concealers. This did seem to dad my darkness and puffiness was at least a little better. My eye area was moisturized for a full day after!! May Convert me into an Eye Cream Girl
