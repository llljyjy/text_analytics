The serum is pretty runny for me, not too thick like other brands, but it can still keep my skin hydrated and absorb quickly. However, I have been only using it for a months so havenâ€™t seen any big changes on my skin yet. The price is a bit expensive so not sure if I want to buy this anytime soon... Not too bad
