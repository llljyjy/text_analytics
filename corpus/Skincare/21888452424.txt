I received Confidence In A Cream from IT Cosmetics in return for my honest review of their product. I have been using Confidence In a Cream by It Cosmetics for a little over a week now. I am a male in my mid 50’s that cares about my skin. Since I have been using this cream, my skin is so much softer looking and feeling. The cream itself is a whipped consistency that goes on thick. A little of this moisturizing cream goes a long way. It’s not a heavy feeling and it absorbs into my skin quickly. I like that it’s not greasy, and it dries quickly. It has a refreshing, clean scent. I like that it’s an anti-aging cream. It has a blend of hyaluronic acid, ceramides, collagen, peptides, and antioxidant vitamins that help reduce the signs of aging, and support healthier-looking skin. This Confidence In a Cream not only moisturizes, but it has evened out my skin tones and plumped up my skin, making my fine lines and pores look minimized. My skin looks to have a softer, younger, glow to it since I have started using it. I will continue using Confidence In A Cream by IT Cosmetics. I recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin’s appearance. Moisturizing
