Pilling and didn’t blend well. I bought unseen, play, glow stick and glow sunscreen, I threw this one away today finally . I wanted to love it but . I tried all I can to blend it just pilling after pilling . For reference I don’t have dry skin and I exfoliate regularly. Ugh I feel bad but I guess it’s time to declutter threw away today
