I followed the advice and stopped using anything besides a gentle cleanser, this and sunscreen in my routine. The first week or two I was breaking out with pimples, as the weeks went on my skin stabilized. It always felt dry and that I needed another layer to apply throughout the day. Sadly this isnâ€™t meant for my skin and I really wish it worked for me. nan
