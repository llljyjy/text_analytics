I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I have in my routine several Clinique products so I was excited to try this serum. It is a pretty runny consistency, looks milky. It absorbed easily into my skin and I was glad it had no smell. It left my face feeling moisturized and plump, not sticky as other hyaluronic acid products. I think the retinoid can really help in preventing fine wrinkles. A good overall product. nan
