Absolutely amazing. I have mixed heritage skin so the pores around my nose are slightly bigger. I applied this mask on Saturday morning and applied light make up Saturday night. My skin looked wonderful. I don’t use filters as I believe it’s a false advertisement of the truth is but light make up never was able to hide my pores so well. Wow! This will be a mask I use 2/3 times a week from now on. Picture attached and btw I’m 44 so it made my skin look phenomenal! Must addition
