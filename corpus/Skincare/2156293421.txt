At first I was not impressed at all. It was giving “every belief face cream” vibes. The consistency can be a little sticky after and as a person with extremely dry skin I didn’t think it was penetrating at all. But I decided I was going to be a trooper and finish my sample. And I must say, it’s hard not to notice a difference after a few days. My skin looked so good. Needless to say, I’ll be adding this staple to my skincare regimen. This made all the difference.
