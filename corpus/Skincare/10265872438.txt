I’ve been using the drunken elephant 1% retinol for about two years now. I wanted to see other brands and was recommended Sunday Riley by a sales associate in store. i’m onto my second refill just to fully test it out. I think i was move onto trying paula’s choice. The drunken elephant always left my pillow looking embarrassingly yellow every night. Sunday riley only left a very slight pale yellow stain which is great. I will say my skin looks and feels good but I wouldn’t go as far to say that it improved it. I never experienced any purging or major breakouts using this. I don’t know what the concentration of retinol is in this but i don’t think it’s potent as a 1% retinol. And since i’m looking for something stronger, I will be moving onto another brand. I would totally recommend this to someone with extremely sensitive skin or someone starting to use retinol. It’s very gentle and soothing. Good for gentle / new retinol users
