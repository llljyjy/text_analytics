I was living my life perfectly happy with my drunk elephant products (which I’ve already spent an arm and a leg on) when Sephora decided to gift me a sample of this...... I bout a bottle after the 1st use. It’s just that good. This is perfect for the morning. I typically only use retinol at night but it’s mild enough to use during the day and even pair it with your vitamin C serum. My face feels amazing after using this. My face looks more supple and brings a nice glow to my face. I definitely recommend this product. Damn you Sephora!
