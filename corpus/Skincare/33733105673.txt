I received the triple serum SPF 40 mineral sunscreen with vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide sample from pinchme.  The tone was a nice touch to my skin, and went smooth on my skin, but I felt after it was on it made my skin kind of oily and sticky so I didnâ€™t like the way that felt, but overall it looked nice. nan
