I received this product for free from Influenster and Gucci in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is beautiful! It’s a heavy, glass, frosted bottle and the mist comes out so fine. I’ve never felt anything like it. I use this product to give my skin a bit of glow if I’m not wearing foundation, or to set my foundation so it lasts longer and doesn’t look cakey. It has a light rosey scent that I love. highly recommend
