i got this about a month ago and purchased it with the BHA spot clearing gel and the moisturizer. i’ve never had breakouts this bad happen to me before, butbecause of school stress and constant work it was bound to happen. like i said, i got it about a month or so ago, so if it was supposed to do something, it would have by now, and it seems like it just keeps infecting my old pimples and acne spots from the amount of times they came back in the span of a month???? i’m always consistent with it and tried so hard to give it a chance, but it’s gotten past the pore purging part and i finally ran out of patience with it. it’s never ending and didn’t change anything about my skin and you can see that the before and after pictures are literally the same. if anything, just a waste of money. disappointing, not worth it
