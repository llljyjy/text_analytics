All around this product is pretty good. It’s a nice, creamy, moisturizer that truly feels like it’s locking into my skin without feeling heavy. That being said, I don’t notice a significant difference in my skin texture. My only real complaint is the texture of the moisturizer itself. It’s kind of hard to explain, but I’d most relate it to the water + borax “slime” we used to make as a kid - it’s kind of solid but leaves your fingers feeling damp. nan
