I love this sunscreen!! I did use it as a face primer few times and it worked great especially with the scorching sun in Vegas you need this! I love that it has hyaluronic acid as well! It doesnâ€™t stay oily and feels hydrating as well! This was my summer go to for the beach as well! Wonderful product! Wonderful product!
