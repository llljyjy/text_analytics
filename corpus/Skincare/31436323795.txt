I don’t think this is environmentally friendly. I cannot recycle the inside part, and the outside case uses a lot of plastics. The lid doesn’t close all the way, so it’s slightly open. I don’t think i will buy a refill. The cream is nice and moisturizing but it smells like silicone and the fragrance is trying to hide that smell. I like daytime SPF cream, but not this one. Sorry it didn't work
