I received this in vox box and have been using it for a few weeks. To start, I love the consistency. It’s a little thinner but that makes it easy to spread and present to my face without stretching my skin, and it absorbs quickly without a sticky feel. It does have a scent but it’s light and I actually really like it. I can see some changes in my skin texture, but I also think it’s too soon to see bigger changes. I am hopeful though, and it definitely hydrates/plumps/feels great instantly. Love!
