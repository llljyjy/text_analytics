I was hesitant about buying this because of some of the reviews I’ve seen about the sunscreen pilling or flaking. So far, I have been using this sunscreen for about a week and a half and I have NOT experienced any pilling or flaking. I feel that it all depends on the products underneath and the way you finesse it into the skin. I usually massage it with medium pressure and in a circular motion around the face and it applies just fine. It does give me a bit of a high glow/shine at first, but it simmers down after 30 min or so. I can handle that just fine. It has a bit of sunscreen smell but it’s also mixed with a bit of that watermelon smell, but both dissipate after a while. I don’t experience a white cast after I finesse it into the skin for about 30 seconds. I have olive, tan skin. I also have sensitive skin so I can be acne-prone. This doesn’t make me break out so I am VERY thankful for that because I WANT to use sunscreen, and this makes me want to use it which is great. It leaves a nice glow to the skin and I enjoy all the great ingredients in it. Niacinamide is a great ingredient for skin balancing, tone, and dark spots so as a leave on product, it is great. I also love that it has hyaluronic acid, aloe, and watermelon in it to help plump and soothe my skin. Overall, I think it’s a good sunscreen. Happy it’s also a high SPF (as oppose to the usual 30 SPF protection I find). I do see myself re-buying. No Issues Here. I Like It.
