Iâ€™ve been using this hyaluronic acid for just over 6 months, and it has done wonders for my skin. Initially, I had been using the hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary, but it pilled too much for my liking. I have rosacea, and this has never irritated my skin, and actually helped with my rosacea flare ups. Definitely recommend for everyone and even if you have sensitive skin! hydration holy grail!
