I received Dr. Zenobia’s Peptide + Ceramide repairing moisturizer thru PinchMe. I am in love. I have been using it as a night cream since I use SPF during the day. It has definitely improved the overall texture of skin and my face is so soft. I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not irritate it, actually feels soothed after applying. It does not make me breakout. I generally would not spend this much on a product but I will be buying this. It’s a fantastic night cream & I highly recommend anyone give it a try. This really has become essential after trying it!
