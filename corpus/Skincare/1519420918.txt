It contains 21 different plant extracts! I absolutely love the smell of this serum. It has a beautiful, soothing floral scent. I used it after cleansing my face. It has a slightly sticky texture but applies well. It hydrates and protects. The smell alone makes me feel like I’ve been to a spa! I look forward to using it again in the near future. #gotitfree Love the smell!
