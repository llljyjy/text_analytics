I love this serum. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and a lot of anti-aging products irritate my skin and make it red. The Plantscription anti-aging line is the  only line I can use, and my skin loves it. Some reviewers said it smelled too strong and it was sticky. Of course, we all have different reactions to products, but I didn’t mind the fragrance which I found to be mild, and it didn’t leave my skin sticky. You just have to give the serum a few minutes to sink into your skin before applying other products, is what I found, and with my drying aging skin, this serum moisturized it and made it feel soft and smooth. My new must have! nan
