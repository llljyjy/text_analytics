i decided to get this product after trying a sample and not having liked the inkey list’s oat cleansing balm. sometimes, with other melting balms, even after washing my face with a different cleanser, i feel oil on my skin. (as if it didn’t wash off properly, to preface i did use warm water like i was supposed to. i really like how this one feels on the skin. this one though, was lovely. i felt like it melted super fast and had a nice minty scent :3. another balm i enjoy is the clinique take the day off (except that one is odourless). i also really liked that when it comes in contact with water, you can tell it’s being washed off. i think it’s decent. i haven’t tried enough of these to say it’s AMAZING though, i’d like to think there’s better out there i guess lololol. i ramble but
