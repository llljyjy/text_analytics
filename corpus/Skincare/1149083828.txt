I’ve used plenty of eye creams from drugstore to brand names and this is the only one that left a burning feeling under my eyes. I actually kept using it thinking it’ll go away but the burning continued and led to noticeable lines under my eyes. I ceased usage and switched to old eye creams and two weeks later the lines are gone. Worst skincare product I’ve ever used. Causes burning
