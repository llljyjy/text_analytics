I got this as a gift & I get the hype now! It was a bit confusing to start but once I get it, it’s pretty easy from then on. I have to measure my skin first before cleansing with this, so it can take about 1-2 mins for set up with bluetooth & measuring skin levels. I have combo skin so I use the advanced measurements. It’s great! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. All my bumps gradually disappear almost overnight. I’m not sure if I can or should use this everyday, so I alternate. nan
