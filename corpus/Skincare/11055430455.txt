It is the best of both worlds the retinol cream use to dry my skin if I accidently used to much and the Marula oil used to break me out. So this is the perfect meet in the middle! My skin agrees and loves it no break outs and incredibly smooth and hydrated. I do mix this with the Hydra B and as always it is a wonderful mix. Love this!
