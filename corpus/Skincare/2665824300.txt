I like this product! I bought it with the expectation that it would be like a regular self tanner but it’s not. It’s definitely easier to use then a typical self tanner - I think the application process of mixing it with you moisturizer makes it go on seamlessly! It didn’t make my hands, elbows or feet orange. And it is suuuper easy to scrub off if you do get an accidental hard line or crease. However it doesn’t last very long in my opinion.. I would say like 2-3 days tops before I have to apply again. I was also under the impression that it would dry with my moisturizer but it does leave my skin feeling a little tacky for most of the day. All in all I would absolutely buy this again. I’ll likely just use it for trips and vacations when I want to maintain my glow. nan
