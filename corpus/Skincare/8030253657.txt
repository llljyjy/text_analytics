Very buttery soft, goes on like a thicker moisturizer and helps to not have that crepey dryness under your eyes. It does help to smooth wrinkles. Not sure about long time use if it will rid wrinkles entirely. But what product actually can do that beside botox. I don’t notice a scent which is nice. Doesn’t irritate the delicate under eye skin. Makes makeup look smoother and more moisturized. Always love Clinique, used to get it from my aunts every Xmas. I recieved a jar from influenster. Smooth gentle eye cream
