I was sent this product for free in return for an honest review. Although it was sent to me for free, I already purchase this product with my own money so it was a bonus to get one for free!  I love this product. I’ve been looking for a really good moisturizer for my combination skin. I’m super dry in the winter and oily in the summer and it works for all seasons. I’m not sure if it is meant for ache but I’ve noticed that i have less acne when using it. It is expensive in my opinion but i do love it and will continue to use it. Great for combination skin and has prevented acne
