I really love this product. I’ve picked it up a couple times now and always recommend it to friends. It’s my go to when I’m stressed and you can see it reflected in my skin. It really helps me address breakouts when they come up! I like the texture of the product and like that this doesn’t irritate my skin at all which I found face masks can do for me. My skin feels clean but not dry or stripped after using. Would recommend! nan
