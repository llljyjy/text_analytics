I have melasma so I need to use sunscreen every day and it was always difficult for me to find sunscreen because I don’t like the sunscreen feeling on my skin… when I received this sunscreen on the same day I had a party to go in the afternoon and then I put it on and over it I put my foundation and OMG if I could only choose one sunscreen to use under my makeup it would be this one!  it prepares my skin to receive the foundation perfectly and doesn’t ruin my makeup and it makes my foundation look even more beautiful!  I recommend it 100% and I will buy the full size, for me it is worth every penny! my favorite to wear under foundation
