I have combination skin, and when my skin is on the oily side or breaking out this is the perfect light moisturizer. It doesn’t feel heavy or like its clogging my pores at all, and it works perfectly on top of a serum. If you have very dry skin, this probably isn’t for you because it is very light, but works amazingly for oily, normal, or combination! Also nice, not too overpowering smell, and absorbs very well. When my skin is dryer, I stick to the Banana Soufflé moisturizer, also by Glow Recipe! nan
