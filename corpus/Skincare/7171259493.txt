This Kiehl’s  Fast Release Retinol Serum is unique. I have to mix the retinol powder myself in to the serum and The instruction to do it is super easy to understand. Unlike other retinol products that I have used, this is the first retinol serum that don’t give me that burn feeling when using it. I only need to push down a small size and it covers my whole face and neck. No greasy or sticky feeling. It’s very lightweight. You can’t tell that you just apply the serum since it absorbs right away. It doesn’t have any scent. After a week using this, I do see some improvement on my forehead lines. This is the best retinol serum I have used so far. Love this serum
