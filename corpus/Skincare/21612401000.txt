I buy the acne products for my daughter, which has helped her tremendously (she uses the cleanser, pads, and gel) Then, I needed my own cleanser and figured I may as well give this cleanser a try. And I am in love with this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t dry out my skin. I stopped using my current cleanser and even recommended this to my friend, and my mother who is a die hard Lancôme fan. Best Cleanser Ever!!!
