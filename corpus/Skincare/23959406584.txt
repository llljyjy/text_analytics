I have “normal” skin. Not dry. Not oily. I’m 28 with a lot of sun damage and premature wrinkles. I normally prefer oil formulas and love the IT confidence in a gel formula , but I received the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Formula from BZZAgent for review. I’m happy that I did as it’s not usually a product I would have reached for. The formula is now supercharged. It has well known and loved ingredients, like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, squalene & more! The formula goes on thick then it melts into the skin with the warmth of my fingertips. It leaves my skin dewy, gooey & plump. Perfect for under makeup for a fresh glow. Perfect for no makeup days to for a dewy complexion. This formula is so soft and I didn’t experience any negativities. No burning. No roughness. Just moisturized, baby soft skin! I love how on the box it reminds the customer to apply the cream down the neck and décolletage. It also can be used anywhere on the body that needs extra moisture. It’s a very solid formula. Even though my skin is “normal” , I would feel safe recommending this product to anyone because it is formulated with the help of plastic surgeons & dermatologists. The ingredients are familiar and there is no scent! I am very impressed with the product! so buttery & dewy !
