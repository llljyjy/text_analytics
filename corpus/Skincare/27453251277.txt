Iâ€™ve always wanted to try Shiseido so was excited for this sunscreen. The texture is very liquidy and has a pearly sheen before being rubbed into a mattifying finish. I think that this sunscreen would be perfect for someone with oily skin who is looking for a more silky matte look. I personally prefer a more glowy finish as my skin can look dull/dry. The biggest plus for me is that it is ocean friendly. Overall, I think that this is a great product but just not for me. Great if looking for a matte finish!
