The one thing that I love about this product is how effortless it is to apply, you don’t even need a mirror. The one thing I don’t like about it is that it leaves a greasy look which I don’t mind but it it’s not my favorite look. I personally will not repurchase,but I do recommend this product if you have dry skin effortless
