I got this product bc of all the great reviews and also bc it said it’s a hydrating product, I have dry, oily(more so on the dry side) and sensitive skin. And I do not get the hype!? I felt like this cleanser was very stripping my face felt extremely dry and stripped after using it. Finally my red inflamed dry areas on my face were calming down but after I used this, my skin got red and inflamed again (around my mouth and under my nose is always VERY dry and red). It smelt fine but even the smell felt stripping like a strong soap smell. Just makes the skin feel SUPER clean but in a stripping way. I would say maybe… if you have oily skin go for it. Do not recommend this to anyone with dry skin Not for dry sensitive skin
