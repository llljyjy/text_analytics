I’m not sure what all the bad reviews are for. I use these on my face and in the (down there) areas to get in the little cracks and crevices that my razor didn’t fully smooth over or can’t rully reach, and they do a GREAT job. I have thick Mediterranean body hair, and it leaves nothing behind. Great For Touch-Ups
