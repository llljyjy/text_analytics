I tried the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with multi-peptide complex for several weeks and fell in love with it. First itâ€™s a soft smell, nothing over powering, and it absorbs quickly allowing me to finish my morning routine with no delay. It also glides on so nice, and makeup can go over it no problem. MyUnder eyes are Brighter and smoother.Definitely will be buying more when i run out! smooth and effective
