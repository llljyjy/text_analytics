Wanted to love it, but I can’t. First the pros: it’s pretty lightweight and hasn’t clogged my skin at all. To its credit, I’ve never gotten a sunburn on days I wore it. The smell is pleasant. But as others have mentioned, it’s peppermint oil so that has some serious drawbacks. Like if you accidentally get it into your eyes or even just around your eyes, it burns a lot. It also pills like crazy. And the price? Forget it. You can get way better Korean sunscreens for half as much that don’t burn your eyes, pill, or have white cast Good if you have nothing else
