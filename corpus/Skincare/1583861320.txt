A staple in my skincare routine. I use every morning after cleansing, before my Paulaâ€™s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. I make sure to wear spf 50+ everyday but especially after this chemical exfoliation.This is an AHA chemical exfoliating toner and spf should be used after using and the days following. I do not use in pm skincare routine because I use retinol.Once a week I skip this and use an AHA mask. I use Drunk Elephant Baby Facial.This toner can be harsh and I do not recommend for sensitive skin. Instead, try a lactic acid product.This toner chemically exfoliates the top layer of the skin, revealing brighter and younger looking skin. Hope that helps!xoxo @skincarebymichelle @skincarebymichelle
