I received this product via Influenster to review and I was excited, because I have never tried a treatment sunscreen serum before. I have dry/sensitive skin with pigmentation and fine lines, and I was hoping this product that had vitamin c and niacinamide would help to rectify my skin issues. However, the shade was too dark/red for me so it was difficult to wear outside. Nevertheless I tested the product inside, and on the first application the product pill/flaked. I tested the product again for a couple more days with nothing on my face or with a moisturizer, and I encountered pilling/flaking again. At this point I had been using the product for 2 weeks. On my third week I shook the product for an extended period of time and used petroleum jelly as a base. Surprisingly I had no pilling or flaking. I donâ€™t know if it was because I shook the product for a long time or the petroleum stopped the pilling. Regardless for the cost of $64 I find the product to be too finicky. Additionally, it does not dry down and transfers with even the slightest touch. Also, I did not see a difference in the area I tested it on. The discoloration is still there and fine lines are still prominent. I do however appreciate that it did not irritate or dry my skin out any further. nan
