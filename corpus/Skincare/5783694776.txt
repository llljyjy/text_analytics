I had high expectations with this cleansing balm and it did not disappoint. It’s smooth, did a great job of breaking down my thick makeup along with my spf and didn’t leave a greasy film. I found it did a great job as a first clean in the double cleansing process. I got a little product in my eye and there was slight stinging but other than that this is a win for me. nan
