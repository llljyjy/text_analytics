I received this product from Influenster to try out and give my honest review. I will start off by saying I have sensitive, acne prone skin and I have visible pores that before I starting using this had little bumps around my chin area. I started using this cream and 1) it didn’t irritate or burn like other facial creams I have tried, and 2) after finishing up the sample I realized those little bumps around my chin area were gone. I wouldn’t say this cream gives you a poreless look because my pores were still very visible. But overall this product is great and I’ll definitely be purchasing this product and adding it to my skincare routine permanently. Love
