I really enjoy this vegan mask. I am been blessed with good skin, few issues, throughout my life. At 43, I am starting to have some skin discolouration and some congestion on my nose. I have been using this mask and love it. There are so many wonderful ingredients! The combination of clays feels so luxurious, cooling on the face, thick and creamy. I apply a thick layer so I donâ€™t get the really cracked/tight feeling at the end. But I do love the effect of the niacinimide and BHA. This has helped tackle my congestion and begin evening out skin tone. Soothing, effective, thick and creamy mud
