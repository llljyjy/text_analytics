Like a skin discoloration filter! I use this serum as my second to last step in my routine in the AM. It really evens out skin tone if you’re a bit red. I do think it’s really only good if you’re either fair or light in skin tone. After it sets in after like 5 minutes I use a tinted sunscreen on top and with both if them it really comes to be like a light coverage foundation. Yet since they’re both skincare products there are no real like foundation-y side effects! Love it Evens skin tone
