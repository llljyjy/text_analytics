I really loved this eye treatment! It’s gentle enough for everyday use yet very effective. I started to notice increased hydration and firmness in my under eye skin after one week of use. A little bit goes a very long way, half a pump is enough for both of my under eyes, so it’s a really good value. A must have for anyone who is out in the sun this summer! Really works!
