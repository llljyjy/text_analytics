I’ve been using it for about a week. I got it as a sample but I just saw the price. It’s nothing spectacular to be worth the price. It does smell earthy and it wears very well under makeup. However, it doesn’t make a huge difference on my skin. I have dark sports and this haven’t helped it. It’s also not Super hydrating Mediocre and pricey
