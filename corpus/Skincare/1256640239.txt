I received this item for free to test/review from Influenster and Dior. I’ve been using this cleanser for almost a month and I love it. I don’t have to use a lot (About a pea size!), and it does a great job of removing my makeup. It’s very gentle on my combination/acne prone skin. It removes the oil, but still moisturizes my dry spots. :) Awesome cleanser!
