A good price but takes a while to remove waterproof eye make up. And I don’t feel like it takes foundation off completely like Farmacy Green Clean. I like the Green Clean because I like to double cleanse even without makeup. I don’t want my cleanser to have to work extra to take off make up as well. Also notice that Green Clean makes my skin feel smooth and truly clean better then this does. I recommend as a budget option but it’s not a dupe by any means nan
