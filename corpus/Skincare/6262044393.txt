Thrown off, but in the best way! You have this package, expecting a certain sweet smell, that your half excited about, half nervous for because if it doesn’t smell good, your stuck smelling it for X amount of time, or worried your skin will break out because of perfumes.Boy was I surprised to find that it had no scent! Which is perfect because my skin loves or hates perfumes. There is no in-between.The texture is so nice, Exfoliating but not harsh, like a whipped mousse almost. it definitely helps clean pores and Softens the skin. It seems to help when it comes to blemishes. There’s a visible notice within 2 weeks of using. I would recommend and will be keeping this mask in my beauty routine! Thrown off, but in the best way!
