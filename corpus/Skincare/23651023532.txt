Waooohh! Waoohh! Honestly, I had never noticed as good results with a serum before. This thing made my skin look flawless even when I was recovering from acne. Helped my scars so much and literally disappeared pores. My soin still looks like skin, but it is so brilliant and glowy without any product on it. It is strong so I alternate it between nights with other products that would also help me minimize acne. I feel the price point is good and on par with what the products does for your skin. Im waiting for another sale to get stock up. Best I have tried!
