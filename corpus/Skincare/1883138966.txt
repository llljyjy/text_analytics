After using a sample of the cream, I had to have it! This cream is super moisturizing and soothing, much better than the Silk Cream for a lot less money. Not greasy or heavy, just right for my winter-parched skin in the evening. Doesnâ€™t pill on top of serums. My skin looks and feels so much better in the morning. I have wanted to try the lip mask, and this set was a super buy. Super products, great value!
