I wanted to love this product! But yuck. While it does disappear into the skin, it is quite watery. Application from the small nozzle is really messy. Some of the purple coloring has worn off the bottle, and Iâ€™m only 1/2 way through...it looks bad, but mostly this makes me wonder what the heck is in this product that etches the container! Trying Goop Glow next as I got it for my daughter and she loves it. Move on!
