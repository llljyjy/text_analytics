Ok this was my first time using glow recipe and I have to say- I am IMPRESSED. I had heard mixed reviews of gimmicky and worth the try- and I have to say it is worth it. My pores already look dramatically different from just a few weeks worth of use! Very easy to apply and add into your routine! Your Pores Will THANK You
