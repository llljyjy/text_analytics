Dry skin age 36 mom of 3 here. Just had my 3rd child and my skin is rough. Canâ€™t use retinol which is my go to for getting rid of flakes and brightening skin. I used Vitamin C during pregnancy and it did nothing. I saw this on an influencers account at 3am and am SO GLAD I did. My skin actually is starting to glow again and overall has a light glow to it (which is almost impossible when youre heavily sleep deprived). I use this 2x daily and really soak a cotton ball with it. It gets rid of 90% of my flakes and I can tell my serums and moisturizer are working better because I need less of both. Worth the $! No smell, no irritation. nan
