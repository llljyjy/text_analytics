I tried the Clinique wrinkle correcting serum for a few days during my morning and evening routine. The texture of the serum is very thin, and non-viscous. There is no noticeable scent. I felt my skin immediately absorb the serum and it felt fresh with no stickiness. I am unable to comment on the long term benefits but for first impressions, I enjoyed using this serum. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
