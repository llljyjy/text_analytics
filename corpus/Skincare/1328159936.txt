First and foremost, do not use this product if you need quiet mornings. The shaker can get quite loud. Regardless…Application is smooth, and the white cast is minimal. The finish is powdery and smooth, with pore blurring. It works great both alone and under makeup. I didn’t find that it pilled, or dragged off makeup in any way. I did wear this mostly alone, as I received it just as I caught covid. Even without a full face, my skin looked good…and the slight tint kept me from looking as sick as I could have. A Decent Product
