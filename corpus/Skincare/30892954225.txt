Didn’t work for my skin. I’m 23y/o ; combination skin but typically non problematic. Woke up with small bumps on my forehead and around my mouth area. I’m thinking it was the fat water or maybe even the moisturizer? But who knows. I typically use khiel’s or tatcha. Will be going back to these two and taking this completely out of my routine. wanted to love it but don’t.
