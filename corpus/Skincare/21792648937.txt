Cute concept. Cookies N Clean <3 looks exactly like cookies and cream, down to the encapsulated charcoal that looks just like Oreo cookie crumbs. The base of the mask is whipped and light. Too bad it’s not fragranced, smells like absolutely nothing, which isn’t bad for people with skin sensitivities. It still manages to make me crave ice cream. But, the application experience was less than stellar. The charcoal bits do not pop easily enough, at times I was pressing into my skin and roughly massaging to get them to pop, almost like I was playing a game of whack-a-mole. Pretty stressful I guess that’s on me for being a perfectionist though. At end, you end with a mix of light gray and black on your face depending on the level of dedication. Not relaxing. The first time I used it, it dried in less than 5 minutes due to the amount of massaging it takes. Next go around, I wet my face thoroughly and applied the mask, I still couldn’t get it to last 10 minutes. My face dried and grew tight in 7 minutes top. Good thing it comes off easily though! And the tightness is gone. My face was smooth and matte after, almost like I applied finishing powder. Not sure how, but it seemed to minimize my pores and given my skin a blurring effect. I like it! The encapsulated charcoal seems to act as a physical exfoliant. I can’t really speak to the effects of the salicylic in removing dead skin or minimizing acne with two uses though. For those of you who have the budget for this and love mud masks, I do recommend this. This is great for those of you who have oily skin but it didn’t hurt my combination skin. Who doesn’t like cookies and cream!?
