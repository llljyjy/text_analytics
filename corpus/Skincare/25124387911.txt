I love this product! The texture is thick but not heavy and it rubs in well. I’ve been using this morning and night after my cleanser and it immediately makes my skin feel hydrated, glowy, and healthy. I let it absorb for a few minutes and then use a moisturizer and a daily sunscreen (but honestly some days I skip the moisturizer - the mask is that hydrating!) I work long hours in a hospital and it looks like I don’t get lots of sleep, but this mask makes my skin looks fresh and bright and rejuvenated! The packaging is so cute! If you’re looking for a “that girl“ glow, this is your product! nan
