I was gifted this product right as San Diego entered into a particularly dry spell. I patted a small amount of water on my face before applying the serum then finished off with the YTTP superfood moisturizer my skin really drank it in!  I have very oily skin and do not notice much of a difference on a normal day so I donâ€™t think it will become a part of my every day routine but it is nice for a little extra moisture when the air is extra dry. nan
