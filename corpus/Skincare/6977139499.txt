This is my first ever item that I have received from Influenster! When trying the sunscreen it felt liquidy not thick at all, when applying it I was able to feel very little minerals in it. It’s nothing obvious, but it’s something I noticed. When I wore it, it did give a small white cast to it & made me look a bit more pale. But it does it’s job! Ive worn it for a couple of days out & it doesn’t make me feel oily or make me look shiny. I used it as a primer with my aunt, (her skin is combination) & her make up held up pretty good & it didn’t make her feel oily nor made her look shiny! We were at a party for 6 hours, where we are from the heat goes up to 120• ! The day she wore it was 100. Only thing was that she is a bit darker than I am so it left her a small white cast when applying it. Once with the make up added on top , of course you can’t see it. nan
