This treatment has been perfect for my acne prone skin. I was a bit hesitant at first because the texture of the product is like an oil, but it turns out that extra hydration is part of what my skin needed. It helps me to clear annoying pimples overnight and helps to reduce some of the redness I experience. Itâ€™s super easy to use since the applicator dropper is built in! I plan to keep this in my toolkit of acne fighting products when I experience breakouts or feel one coming on. nan
