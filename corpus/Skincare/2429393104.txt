I used a sample size jar so I can’t account for long term use but from the 6 nights used this cream I saw promising results.  It’s very moisturizing and the cream made my skin feel very hydrated . I really liked the way my skin looked in the morning,  very rested and refreshed. Skin felt supple. I’d get the full size. Hydration on point.
