I received this yesterday, and the only reason i’m keeping it at 4 stars and not 5 (yet) is because I haven’t seen the long term results. But so far, I have definitley liked what I have seen, I put it on last night and when I woke up in the morning, I was shocked at how glowy and dewy my skin looked, it felt so good and is an easy application, a little goes a long way! It does have a slight fragrance, but it’s not too bad, and I have sensitive skin that’s recovering from accutane so if that says anything about the product then I don’t know what will! The online downside is the cost! Wish it was like half the price but I guess for quality ingredients comes a high cost! Really great!
