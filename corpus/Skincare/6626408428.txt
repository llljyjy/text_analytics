It’s very moisturizing, almost too much for my combo skin. Takes a while for it to absorb. However, it does not cause any irritation and is easily paired with vitamin c serums. My experience with The Ordinary is that their serums take time to show results so I haven’t noticed any difference within the last 3 weeks. I do wish it was more potent for faster results (this is coming from someone with sensitive skin too). All in all, it’s a good product because there is no purging, burning or redness. But wish it had more punch in each use. 3 stars because it’s too moisturizing & takes a long time for results. 4 stars because it holds the same experience as other Ordinary serums (no irritation) Tooooo gentle and slow
