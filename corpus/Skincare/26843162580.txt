My initial reaction to opening the tube and squeezing was “this is gross”. Partially due to settling of the product but also because it made me look like I’d slathered Vaseline all over my face. I definitely felt the difference in hydration right away ( I use it as a mask) but I don’t think I’ll continue using this once it’s gone. nan
