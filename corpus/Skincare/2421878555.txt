The It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream moisturizer is silky, lightweight, doesnâ€™t enhance the oiliness of my skin and wears well under all of my favorite foundations. This moisturizer boasts anti aging ingredients such as niacinamide, squalane, and peptide-lipid complex. The container is fully opaque to prevent possible breakdown of active ingredients due to light exposure. This formula is free of sulfates, parabens and mineral oil, however, it does contain fragrance as well as Limonene which can be an irritant to sensative skin. I have used this cream for almost a month and I do notice subtle differences in the appearance of my skin. I will continue to use this product in hopes to see even more improvements over time. I like it!
