The original formula for ORIGINS Clear Improvement Active charcoal mask was stellar hands down... that’s why it’s the #1 face mask in America. Before using the product wash your face (I use It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cleanser Cleansing Serum) & use a warm towel over face to open pores, layer on to your liking. I layered on lightly, a little goes a long way with this product. With the newer formula I tend to layer on more of it & remove it at around 5 minutes (Older formula I could leave on longer without irritating my skin). I use it once every week. Leaves my skin feeling clean, soft & healthier looking! This product still works... it gets the job done. Original formula worked perfectly (Please bring back original formula) on my skin! I still recommend this mask. Orig. formula was stellar... still does its job!
