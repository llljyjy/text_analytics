I received this from the brand influenster for free so I will be giving a honest and raw review. Sadly I love this product and it really is worth the price tag. This is the best eye cream I’ve ever seen and used. I drag this product on my laugh lines too because of the wrinkle smoothening affect it gives. My eyes crease looks so much softer and younger which I love. My big insecurity were my laugh lines I felt like any time I wore makeup it just made it look worse and this products helped so much is actually softening the look of them. I need you feel how insanely soft this feels and she’s thick you only need like a very little amount. I would recommend implementing this in night time skincare routine because playing with it too much causes it to peel also I don’t use too much product to avoid this but not a dealbreaker because it’s actually working. I will purchase once this runs out. Hopefully it doesn’t sell out by then Run don’t walk girl
