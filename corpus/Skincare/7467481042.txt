I’m a dry gal. And so even with all the moisturizers, serums, and oils I slather on my face AM and PM, I still need a mid-day refresh to keep my skin looking dewy and my makeup looking seamless. Enter this cream skin mist - my skin INSTANTLY feels better and it doesn’t disturb my makeup.  It’s light and hydrating without being too oily or shiny. Will be repurchasing until I die or they discontinue. Refresh success
