I received this product from #topbox in exchange for my honest review. I used this product every night in place of a moisturizer after my skin routine. I have dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin and this produce did wonders! I only applied a very thin layer, but in the morning I instantly noticed that my skin felt incredibly smoother, more bouncy, and hydrated. This mask also had a brightening effect and decreased appearance of dullness. The product is incredibly light and breathable, which is ideal for a night time routine. Overall, I highly recommend this product to those who are looking to add something light, but effective, to their skincare routine. I will definitely purchase this product again #trywithtopbox Very hydrating!
