It definitely makes my skin look clearer and Iâ€™ll repurchase after this container is empty, but as others have said, the packaging is awful. The first time I opened it, the top busted open. Not only is it messy, but I also worry that the product will dry out because there is no way to seal it. So all in all, the product itself is great! But the packaging is terrible. Great Product, Horrible Packaging
