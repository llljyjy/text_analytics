This product smells exactly the same as Jergens daily moisturizer. It is for sure darker though, I will give it that but very orange. I had super high hopes for this but it left my hands crazy orange even though I washed them after. Normally I can scrub it off but this stuff isn’t budging. Honestly takes like 12 hours to fully develop as well. I put it on yesterday afternoon, wore it all day, turned orange and now I’m even more orange the next day lol. I think it can definitely be great for more olive tones or maybe touching up a mousse tan. But I definitely think it’s overprice Jergens.. which is way less patchy Expensive Jergens
