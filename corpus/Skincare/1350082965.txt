I usually do not buy skincare products with celebrity names on them  but after reading some reviews I thought, why not? I am almost 50 and I have tried many different serums. Spent so much money on promises of having great skin. I have to say I am very happy with this product and the results. I have been using it for about two weeks. I wake up with brighter, hydrated, and pore seems visibility less. It doesn’t cause breakouts like some products I’ve tried. This one is honestly the best one for me so far and I am happy with how my skin is looking. Clear, bright and even toned.  Love the texture of the serum as well. It’s not stick and doesn’t smell, and the volume you get for the price is great. Tired of buying and wasting my money on expensive serums that come in tiny bottle and doesn’t last long, and doesn’t benefit my skin at all. Pleasantly Surprised!
