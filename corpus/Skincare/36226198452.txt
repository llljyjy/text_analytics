Complimentary from Dermalogica Samplingl. I have sensitive skin and this stuff does not irritate my skin. Compared to other brands I’ve used, this one truly does what it claims to do!! I actually really love the smell, its a very clean scent. The texture is amazing! I count to 60 seconds while gently scrubbing in circular motions and it produces a lovely lather. When I rinse my face, my skin feels textureless, like glass! When I dry my face my skin is glowing, literally. I’ll definitely be purchasing the full size as soon as I run out of this one. Love it
