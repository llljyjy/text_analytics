I’ve had this for about a week and I think it is a great spot treating product. It’s great for those pimples that I don’t think would necessarily be helped by a hydrocolloid patch. I also really like it for spots that are healing but still need some love. It doesn’t feel irritating at all and I think that it has really helped mitigate some pimples that could have grown worse. Great Product
