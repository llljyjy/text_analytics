OK so I really did not want to like this product because of how expensive it is and I hate to say it but this product is really worth the price. It lives up to the hype and more. I saw a noticeable difference immediately and plan to continue using and re-purchase again in the future. I have never been this impressed By a skincare product before in my life and I have tried a lot. Itâ€™s not going to change your life but it does a whole lot for something that is just a topical product. I am a fan. yes, it actually lives up to all the hype
