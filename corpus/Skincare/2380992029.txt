I received this product from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review. First of all, Vitamin C, Niacinamide and sunscreen are in my current morning routine. Having all those ingredients in one bottle is great! Speed up my morning skincare routine. I am not a huge fan of mineral sunscreen because it dries out my skin. However, this Ilia tinted serum doesnâ€™t dry out my skin.It is oil based, so it is more moisturizing. Application is a little tricky though, you need to shake the bottle really well and pat it onto face lightly. Overall I really like the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum for my dry skin. Great Serum for Dry Skin
