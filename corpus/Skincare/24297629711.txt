I got this in the birthday gift set, it was probably my favourite product out of the three due to it having the least overpowering scent. Having given it a fair chance and using it on and off for a year, I just don’t think it’s anything special. Despite all the hype and crazy assortment of natural extracts, I genuinely don’t think it is any better than the tiny tubs of Aquaphor ointment, which is unscented, safe for babies, and comes at a fraction of the cost of this. I found the texture to be nearly identical and I feel like the Aquaphor gives longer lasting benefits from the glycerine and pantheon (Vitamin B5). That being said, if you’re purchasing it for cute packaging, the scents and just general luxury experience, all power to you; it’s by no means a bad product. But if you’re strapped for cash and looking for functionality, I think you’d be better off with the Aquaphor. Not bad but not great either
