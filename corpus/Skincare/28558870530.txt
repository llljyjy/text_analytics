Not right for me. I have dry, sensitive skin. Although the cream is on the denser side itâ€™s not particularly moisturizing, found myself needing to re-moisturize especially during these winter months. I also had sensitivity to it, a stinging sensation and redness. Previously I used Inkey list peptide cream and I believe I will go back to that. Not only is it a better price but very effective for dry sensitive skin. sensitivity and not moisturizing enough
