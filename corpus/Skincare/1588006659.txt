I am currently traveling and my go to precleanse- by Dermalogica opened up in flight and emptied out. Saw a Sephora nearby and they carry Dermalogica so thought I could just grab it. Unfortunately this location did not carry the brand but the employee suggested this precleanse. Smells very nice, but didn’t feel nearly as nice on my skin as Dermalogica does, but it won’t spill that is for sure. I just feel like I have residue on my skin after using. I will most likely be returning this Meh- nothing special
