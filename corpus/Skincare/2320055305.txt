This is my go to for breakouts and spot treatment! I also use daily in areas where I am prone to breakout. I have larger pores on my cheeks and I have suffered with backne for some time. I get an occasional blind pimple that is deeper and won’t pop. These usually take a long time to deflate and I am left treating a new hyperpigmented blemish after. This serum absorbs quickly and attacks from within, reducing the healing time to a few days rather than several weeks. It also forces pimples closer to the surface to pop with minimal prodding from me.  I am always on the hunt for a product that works better that what I’m currently using but this has been so effective for this skin concern that I no longer need to search. I have oily skin and the the texture is oil like rather than water like but again it absorbs fast enough that I have not had any stained clothing after I apply to my shoulders and back.  I have learned that my skin responds very well to salicylic acid but particularly this formulation. For that reason it has earned a permanent place in my skincare routine! My new favorite!
