Kiehl’s created a great retinol product!  The texture is perfect and it melts into my skin. It is not greasy, and didn’t make my skin feel tight. After 2-3 weeks use, I noticed a clearer complexion and clarity in my skin, planning on using this long term! Upon buying, you have to mix the powder retinol with the liquid but don’t be scared away by that. It’s super easy and and it’s fresh, have not had any issues with the bottle due to mixing prior to using. nan
