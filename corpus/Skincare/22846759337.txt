I have lots of redness and this generally provides a nice natural finish. I don’t prefer it under makeup it gets a little candy, but I like it alone. My first purchase was great, then I bought it again and it’s very watery. I have stirred it and it immediately separates. I’m not sure if they changed the formula, but I find myself not using it and may not refill if I run out. Formula change?
