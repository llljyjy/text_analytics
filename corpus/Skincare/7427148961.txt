My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using Tata Harper’s hydratant tint profond water-lock moisturizer! The packaging is absolutely stunning. I love that the cap and pump are reusable. It goes on really nicely and absorbs into your skin without any greasy or oily residue. It feels so luxurious and works amazingly! I’m blown away! So luxurious!
