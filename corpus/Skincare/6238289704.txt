Not bad. Not good, either. It’s just meh. A little heavy and greasy feeling, but at the same time you don’t really feel moisturized, just coated.I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s a heavy moisturizer that doesn’t sink into the skin well. At least on me. I prefer IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. Meh
