Actually so good! It has a nice, rich texture that is great for my dry skin but isn’t sticky in humidity. I also like that it doubles as a serum for me. My skin looks smoother and more even when I use this and it’s so incredibly soft. The scent is a little strong at first, smells cucumber-y, however it does not have synthetic fragrance in it which I love. Def try if you have dry skin in need of a pick me up! Softening and brightening!
