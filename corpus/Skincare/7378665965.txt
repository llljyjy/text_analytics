I’m  very appreciative for being able to try this Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream from #tryitwithtopbox. First of all, I love the metal tip because it gives that cool feeling under my eye area and it leaves it hydrated. It has been about three weeks that I have been using this eye cream every day and night and I can definitely say I have noticed it has helped with my eyes been less puffy. Also, I have been able to see my eyes a little brighter. I really like Caudalie products and i’m not disappointed with this eye cream. I would probably purchase this again but I wish it was more affordable. Nice eye cream!
