This product does what’s it’s supposed to do, moisturizer lips. The packaging is cute and so is the scent and flavour but there’s no “WOW” factor that makes it special to other lip balms. The product doesn’t justify this price and I bet you could get better lip balms for fraction of the price. good like others
