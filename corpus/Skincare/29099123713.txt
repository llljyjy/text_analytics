I received this through a free sample program and I absolutely love it. I have severely dry skin and with that comes very sensitive and dry/chapped lips constantly. This is very gentle and has a very light scent like cupcakes not overpowering at all. It lasts on the lips for so long so no need to keep reapplying which I absolutely love. I can have sensitivities to some lip care, which can make it itch or even welt, this didnâ€™t do that at all, it is extremely gentle! This is a must in my lip care routine now, buy it! Love love love!!
