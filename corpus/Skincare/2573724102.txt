Love this moisturizer! I use it every morning (and sometimes at night too). I love that it’s matte so it’s the perfect base for the day - with or without makeup. It feels so nice on my skin. I haven’t broken out or had any issues since I started using it. The smell isn’t my favorite but it’s not strong and goes away quickly. nan
