I received this product complementary from influencer I have been using it for about two weeks and I noticed that I have less dry skin on my face as I usually do in the winter time. The only thing I noticed was a little bit of dry skin on my upper eyelids. It has a slight sunscreen smell but it goes away after a little bit of time. The packaging is nice and I like the stick that they use to apply it Thumbs up from me
