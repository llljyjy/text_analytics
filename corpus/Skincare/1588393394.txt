I wanted to love this cleanser, but it is not enough to remove all the makeup (I barely wear any) I think it it would be a good cleanser for the initial remover but again, I wish it would foam more, etc.i do like its scent, but the bottle is heavy (be careful not to drop it) I use another cleanser after this. nan
