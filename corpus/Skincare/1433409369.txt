Things I liked:- Good coverage- High SPF- Oil-free (good for sensitive and oily / combination skin)Things I did not like:In all other companies, BB / CC cream in the “Light“ color has suited me. Here I bought “Light“ and it was darker than “Medium“ normally is. So then I bought “Fair“ (which is the lightest color they have) and the product is still too dark. I have fairly light skin, but not so light that I have been outside the whole color scheme before. It’s certainly not alabaster or anything. In addition, it is very thick and not so easy to apply. I first started applying it with a brush, which was recommended by the company. It did not go so well-- streaky and difficult to blend out. Then I tried to use my fingers to put small dots of the product all over my face and use BeautyBlender to blend. That was a little bit better, but still takes a longer amount of time than other BB/CC creams I’ve used in the past. Great SPF/Coverage, but "light" runs dark.
