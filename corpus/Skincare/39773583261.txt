After trying hundreds of different SPF’s for my face, I FINALLY found one that doesn’t break me out! This doesn’t leave a white cast on my beautifully melanated skin, blurs pores, and doesn’t have that typical sunscreen smell (thank goodness). It has a lovely light feminine fresh scent. Thank goodness I got this free sample, otherwise I probably would have never found out about this goodness! Definitely making a purchase! I finally found the one!
