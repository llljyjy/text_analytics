I’m not used to using any sort of eye cream.  I used a q-tip to apply it.  I also had my mom try it and she just used her fingers and dabbed the cream on.  She suggested I do the same.  I guess there is a proper way of applying it.  I felt a tingly sensation every time I applied it.  Mom felt more of a burning sensation.  It didn’t really bother us because it didn’t last.  The cream stayed on.  Was long lasting. Tingles at first, but it goes away.
