I had my teenage brother try this mask due to my extremely sensitive skin. I loved the gentle exfoliation the mask had. The texture wasnâ€™t grainy at all. His face also felt very smooth after rinsing off the mask. It seems like a nice mask for a self care day! I would love to try it when my skin is back to normal. nan
