I got the mini size, not regular size. It’s only been a few days of using the Murad Rapid Dark Spot Correcting Serum in the evening but I’ve already seen a huge difference. Most of my dark spots were slowly lightening up with some Pixi toners but there was one stubborn dark spot that wasn’t really fading. With this serum, that dark spot immediately started fading and is barely noticeable now (after about three days of serum use). The other less stubborn dark spots lightened up much quicker as well. Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. A little bit of this serum goes a long way so if you’ve got just a few dark spots, the mini should work just fine. Saw a difference with a few days of use - MINI
