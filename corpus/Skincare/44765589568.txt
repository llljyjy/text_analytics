I’m a male in my late 30’s and have senstive and sometimes dry skin.  I’ve tried many different facial moisturizer brands throughout the years (even really expensive brands) and this was the best one ever!  The cream is thick at first but it gets quickly absorbed into the skin and the skin stays moisturized! It doesn’t feel oily and sticky on the skin at all.  I’ve used it morning and night after washing my face.  My skin looks and feels better.  I’ve not had any breakouts since using this product and no dry spots.  It honestly is fantastic!  And I will recommend this to everyone and will purchase for myself years to come. The BEST!
