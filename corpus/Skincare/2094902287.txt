This leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. It sinks in well and works well under makeup. It has not irritated my skin so far. It smells like Flinstones vitamins and I prefer unscented skincare. Overall I would recommend this to those who are looking for an every day moisturizer who donâ€™t mind the fruity scent. Good moisturizer
