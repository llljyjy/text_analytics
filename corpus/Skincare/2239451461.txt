I received this product for free from Topbox #freeproduct #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  I have been using this serum along with the Water Bank Cream Moisturizer for over a week now.  Similar to the moisturizer, the serum is easily absorbed and gives my skin a glowy, well-hydrated complexion.  I have very sensitive and dry skin, and the products are working well so far which is a huge plus. Great combo with the moisturizer
