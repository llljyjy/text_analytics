I received this Free from Topbox Circle, First of all I would like to say the design of this serum is very unique with the twist to pump function which i haven’t seen before and gives it a luxury feeling and it makes it easy to store too with a nice Blue colour. The WaterBank Serum it pumps the right amount of serum everytime I have been using it twice a day for about 2 and a half weeks now and it’s light and hydrating my skin absorbs the product almost right way and it also worked well with my sensitive skin it has a really nice light relaxing scent and totally worth buying #Trywithtopboxcircle #freeproduct Love it, nice design and very effective
