I wanted to love this product, but I’m not sure it’s actually doing much. The packaging is gorgeous and feels high-end. The cream itself has a nice consistency and glow to it. But I haven’t seen any change in the puffiness of my eyes. I even did a test on one eye and can not tell which one I put it on. This product is fun to use, but don’t expect any instant results. Wanted to love it…
