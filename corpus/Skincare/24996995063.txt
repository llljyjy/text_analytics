Despite being on sale, this item was still pricey given its size and quality. The first night I used it, it was so creamy and thick that I couldn’t even properly distribute it to my orbital bone. The following morning, I attempted to apply it with my fingers so that it would absorb, but OMG, the consistency of this cream is so sticky that it pulls back your skin! Not just your skin, but also your EYELIDS! You feel irritable and VERY SHINY, as if you’ve just applied vaseline. Green Toothpaste! Stay Away!!!
