I have oily skin and I am always looking for a product to help with that where I can wear it under my makeup. I love the clean smell of this product, how soft if makes my skin feel afterwards, and how clean I feel. It’s doesn’t exactly help with my oily skin so that is why I gave it 4 stars. The sample I received was too small for me to tell if it made a huge impact on my skin but from what I could see initially was that it was moisturizing and make my skin feel great. I was gifted a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Great for normal to dry skin!
