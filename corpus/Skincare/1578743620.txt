I really like this oil. The scent is nice, it soaks into the skin quickly, and as far as I can tell it gave me a nice glow (I’m not great at being able to notice the “results“ of various products). However I mostly want to warn folks not to buy the larger size bottle unless you have multiple people using the product. I used this oil generously almost every day and stored it in a dark cupboard, but it obviously oxidized and started to smell really funky before I could finish the whole bottle. Great, but careful with the larger size
