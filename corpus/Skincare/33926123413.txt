Confidence in a Cream has renewed my skin in 14 days. The cream is very thick and I was a little hesitant to use it on my oily skin however, I took a chance. I used a little dab on my face morning and at night and my face feels so soft and silky. It  has left my skin plump and hydrated throughout the day. It has brightened my face and visibly reduced my fine lines. I will definitely keep this cream in my rotation. My skin is so radiant
