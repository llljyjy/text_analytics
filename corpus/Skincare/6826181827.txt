I expected an immediate glow from this product, similar to the Glow Recipe Niaciamide drops but that’s definitely not the case. Perhaps this brightens over time, but the results are not immediate. I also don’t like the scent, and think it’s quite costly for a serum, there are others that give instant and long term results. This is my review, despite getting this product complimentary from Tula / Influenster Not an outstanding product
