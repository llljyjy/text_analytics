I tried a sample of this - my face has been nice and clear but dry considering itâ€™s winter and I use retinol 2-3x week. Figured this brand is reputable and id try this for my thirsty skin. It felt great going on, really nice texture. But woke up the next day with 3 super deep clogged pores/ pimples :( if you have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, definitely avoid this. Great texture, awful pimples
