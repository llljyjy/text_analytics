I highly recommend this product! I’ve been adding it to my facial cleanser and it foams up and gently scrubs your face. You can also add just to water and use it that way. My face def felt cleaner and brighter! I liked that it didn’t dry my skin out, like most exfoliators do. I would recommend for all skin types! Great product!
