I use this on my body too. I put it on after the shower, then cocoa butter then Vaseline. I have SEVERELY dry skin and this combo works a dream on my skin. On my face I use this, a moisturizer and Vaseline. My face usually burns in the winter if I use any other serum or just a moisturizer on bare skin. So this or Vaseline seams to be the only thing that doesnâ€™t cause severe burns. Great for severely dry skin
