I received this product free to try from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. After using this Innisfree Green Tea Hylaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer for a few weeks, I can definitely say it’s a good moisturizer for dry skin, which I have. I prefer unscented products but this does have a scent; however, it is fairly mild and smells more spa-like than perfumey. It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any sticky residue. I have other moisturizers that seem to look better and last longer under makeup, and that has been my only real qualm. My foundation doesn’t look as good when I use this. I think I need something even more hydrating and long-lasting for my dry skin personally, but this is still good for people with regular dry skin or even combo skin. I love that the jar is made from 60% recycled plastic and the lid with 30% recycled plastic. It is nice to see a company making an environmental effort with their packaging! Overall, I did enjoy this product and it does hydrate the skin, but I think I still need something stronger with a thicker consistency. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great for dry skin sufferers and winter skin
