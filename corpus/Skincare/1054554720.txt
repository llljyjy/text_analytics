Horrible container. Before you open it, lightly tap it on the counter so the product isn’t sitting in the top portion ready to blow like a volcano. After opening, lightly squeeze until product comes out (and in my case, ends up on the floor). I went ahead decanted mine. I keep a few beautiful jars from luxe brands just for that. The product is thin and runny so if you’re looking for a lightweight moisturizer you found it. It’s okay, I can’t tell a difference from any other drugstore brand. It isn’t right for me so I’ll be trying something else. Please Change Your Container!
