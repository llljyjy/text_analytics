This stuff works amazing, especially if you can’t help but squeeze zits. Here’s my method for success: 1. Exfoliate really well with a physical exfoliant (I like the zo exfoliating polish). Hopefully this will open up your zit for you by taking off the top part. 2. Pop the zit very gently. 3. Place one of these patches on top of the spot overnight. It will draw out allll the stuff inside of the zit and when you wake up in the morning you should have a flat red spot that you can cover with concealer. Now I’m just looking for a great product to heal the red spot ASAP. nan
