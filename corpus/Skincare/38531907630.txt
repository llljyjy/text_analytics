I’ve been using this product after an employee recommended it as a spot treatment for acne and acne marks. When I first tried it I will admit that I felt a sort of tingling sensation that made me turn away from it for some time but after a really bad breakout (second image) I was left with some pretty bad marks and I was honestly desperate to fix them so I decided to give it another try and thank god I did. The tingling feeling went away after three weeks and about after 6 months of using this x4 a week I think I got some pretty good results. I’m currently not using this product anymore since I’m switching over to retinol but this is definitely a must have for anyone suffering with post acne marks or redness. Great product, however patience is key!!!
