First time self-Tanner user, or Tanner period. I have very fair skin and was nervous about streaking and looking like I fell in orange paint. But, to my amazement, this stuff was GORGEOUS! Skin has turned out beautiful each time, with no streaking. I use a mitt to apply it and it lasts about 3-4 days but I exfoliate, so it would probably last longer if I didnâ€™t. Hello Tan!
