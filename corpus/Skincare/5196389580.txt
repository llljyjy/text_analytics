I had high hopes for this. When applied the first day it develops nicely and gives a beautiful glow. Then the next day itâ€™s break out central. Like small red actual pimples. I was so upset. I even tried it again weeks late thinking maybe it will work- nope. Got a couple pimples again the very next day. I saw other reviewers had the same issue. Good luck if you wanna give it a go and hopefully it works for others. Not for me. breakouts
