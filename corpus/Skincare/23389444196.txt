The first time I tried this product I received as a sample and I loved it so much, I have very dry skin, like super dry skin that I have tried many creams and my skins absorbs it and still feels dry. I did buy the new formula one and did notice a light difference but overall I highly recommend this moisturizer if you have extremely dry skin. I have tried other types of moisturizers and some of them make my face feel oily and sticky, but this cream does not it feels so hydrating and my face feels so soft and it is not crazy expensive like other brands, it may not be cheap either but I found it to be worth it as a little goes a long way. I like to pair it with sunscreen in the mornings and my face feels so moisturized all day long. Yes I know they most likely changed the formula and the new moisturizer is not a good as the formula before but I still recommend. Best moisturizer I have bought.
