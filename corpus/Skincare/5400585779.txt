Actually smells like honey to me... Which I find to be a pleasant smell. I think if you like the smell of beeswax candles, you wouldn’t mind the smell of this product.That said, AHA is an acid so yes, it does sting, ESPECIALLY if you’re not using a moisturizer/oil underneath this. Also, the honey in it does make the product feel sticky going on. These things don’t bother me because putting this on at night definitely leaves you with a natural glow in the morning. Acne scars / hyperpigmentation is noticeably better the morning after as well. Also, this is one of those rare products that’s good for acne scars / hyperpigmentation AND acne. Pimples are smaller after use. A lot of the time I find what’s good for acne isn’t as good for the scarring / hyperpigmentation and what’s good for scarring / hyperpigmentation irritates acne! This isn’t the case with the Honeymoon Glow.That said, I think the frequency of its use will depend on your skin type. I rotate it between 3 other products to give my skin a break too. I actually like the smell...
