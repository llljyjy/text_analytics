I’m a cleanser junkie because I’m acne prone, even though I’m 40. I usually gravitate toward cleansing oils and cleansing balms or mildly foaming acid cleansers. So I though I should step out of my comfort zone. I used this as my second cleanse so I can’t attest to how well it removes makeup. But it was creamy, comforting, had nice slip, smelled incredible and rinsed easily while leaving my skin soft and nourished. A really lovely experience. surprise hit
