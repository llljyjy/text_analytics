This eye serum works very well on my skin!  I cannot use eye creams usually since they clog my pores around my eyes.  However, I want to do something about the fine lines and puffiness!  This serum moisturizes the delicate skin around my eyes without causing any problems with clogged pores.  It has reduced the puffiness I get under my eyes as well.  The applicator is great and feels refreshing.  However, the product does come out really quickly and I tend to get too much unless I first apply it to my finger, then use the applicator. Moisturizing without being greasy!
