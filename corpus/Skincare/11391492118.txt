This stuff was horrible! I tried this on and instantly my skin looked all over bronzed in a bad not my shade kind of way. It left a weird bronze red tint over my face and it was definitely giving my face and neck 2 different color vibes even after I tried taking it down to my neck! On top of that the “shimmer“ just made me look shiny and oily. When I tried blending in some blend-able cream blush this stuff started to pill up and is leaving me all kinds of frustrated. This stuff is crap and a total waste of money. So glad I got the small one. I’m running back to get my old eltamd tinted sunscreen because this is going straight in the trash!!!! Hard pass
