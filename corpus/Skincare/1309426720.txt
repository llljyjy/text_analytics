I received this product from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I tried this both with and without makeup and I preferred without due to the consistency. It’s a very thin formula, but I felt like I had some shine come through during the day. I wanted to like this, but I don’t think it’s worth the price. Very Thin Consistency
