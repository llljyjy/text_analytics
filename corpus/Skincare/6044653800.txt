I don’t really write reviews unless I feel very strong about a product and this product was a big disappointment. I was hesitant to buy it because the price was too much, but after reading reviews on different websites I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, this product did not live up to the reviews. There have been no positive changes to the under eye area. It didn’t minimize and lines or help with the dots around the eyes. All it did for the eye was create dryness and burning sensation. The skin under my eyes got so dry to the point were I can no longer wear makeup in that area because it gets flaky. Definitely do not buy! Don't Buy Unless You Want Dry Under Eyes.
