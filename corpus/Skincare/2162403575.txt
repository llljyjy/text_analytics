Love this soap so much. It has a very light coco smell that lingers after you shower. The lather from this soap is copious and lush. It cleans like an antibacterial soap with none of the harshness. This is a hard brick of soap so you donâ€™t have to worry about it disintegrating in the shower. I have moderate eczema and this was gentle enough for me. Will buy again. Great for my sensitive skin
