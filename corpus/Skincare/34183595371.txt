So I have to start with the smell. It does smell strong and it is kind of intimidating once you open the product. But I have been testing it for few weeks now and it does work great. It doesn’t leave any greasy or oily spot on the skin and my face definitely looks healthier. I would recommend if you can get over the smell and you’re not sensitive to that. But I’d sure make this product less perfumy. Great product overall.
