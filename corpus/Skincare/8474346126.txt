I have combination skin I really like how moisturizing this product is. However, I can understand to some how it has a greasy feel. It did take me a bit to get used to the texture of it because I was thinking by it would evaporate into my skin but it sits on top with that smooth layer. I do like my results and how my skin feels when I wake up in the morning though! A little goes a long way!
