I received this product for free in return for an honest review. I love the packaging. It is very sleek and pretty. The curved bottom makes it awkward to store but it is still beautiful. I appreciate nice packaging. It looks and feels luxe and makes me feel like Iâ€™m pampering myself!That said. This product is very nice. I tried it on my combo skin and also let my teenage son use it. It soaked in instantly and left our skin moisturized yet not greasy. It had a nice texture and no smell. It seemed to keep our oily areas nice and matte through the day. I would definitely recommend it to people with oily or breakout prone skin. Miracle product for breakout prone skin.
