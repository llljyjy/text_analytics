I was so thrilled to get the opportunity to try this product!  I have normal skin and I have used it day and night religiously.  It is rich and a little goes a long way.  It is formulated with antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, vitamins, and oils that are intensely nourishing, moisturizing, and soothing.  My skins feels and looks amazing and I have noticed an improvement in texture and firmness.   Overall, this is a lovely product and it lived up to the hype for me. Love this cream!
