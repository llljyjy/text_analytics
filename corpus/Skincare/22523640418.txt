I have very blemish prone skin that is somehow both extremely oily and dry. I was using a $45 salicylic acid serum daily but was getting dry patches in the areas I was applying it more heavily. I was worried that this serum would make me break out but I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. This serum is literally perfect for my skin. It is really oily but after applying it I slather my face in a water based moisturizer and that oily feeling disappears in about 10 minutes. I am not sure if I will be able to use it in the summer but it is perfect for my extra dry winter skin. Perfect for dry winter skin
