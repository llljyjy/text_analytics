I have tried many other essences after trying this one, which was the first time I ever used one. None of them compare. They sit on my skin, don’t really absorb. Even tho this is more costly, I cannot live without it or find anything as good. I use after cleansing and just slightly Pat dry my face so that my face isn’t totally dry and press it into my face. It does have a water like consistency, but it make my face feel hydrated and plump. I have some good essences, but still can’t find anything better. My holy grail.
