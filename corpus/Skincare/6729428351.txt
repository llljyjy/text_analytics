I received this product to try from TopBox. I have to say, this brightening treatment essence is very effective, and this became clear for me within one day of using it. The product is cool and refreshing as I apply it to my face, and it has a clean, pleasant smell. It smells natural and not artificial.The next day, I noticed that my skin felt softer and more hydrated. After a few more days of using this product, both day and night, I noticed that my skin became brighter and more luminous - it looked radiant! I am so pleased with the results and will continue to use this product.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to give their skin a boost, or anyone who has a dull complexion looking to brighten it! Amazing product that results in radiant skin
