I received the Fenty watch ya tone 5% Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum with Vitamin C a little over a week ago. When I got it in the mail I immediately wanted to try it! My first impression is the packaging is very luxurious and feels much more premium than other Niacinamide products I’ve tried in the past. I also enjoyed the pump applicator so I knew I was dispensing the right amount of the product. Upon first usage I noticed the product was fragrance free which I appreciated as someone with more sensitive skin. The products feels like a gel lotion hybrid and glides onto the skin beautifully. After using the product for a week I have to say I really enjoyed it and saw a fresh brightness to my skin that even other people noticed since starting it. I’ve had 3 people ask me what was new in my skin care routine because my skin had a fresh glow to it. I’ve recommended this to everyone because for the price it works and doesn’t irritate my skin like other Niacinamide products. Additionally I want to now try more of the Fenty skin line. Fresh Glow In A Bottle !
