The first time I bought this lip balm was about a year or so ago. I thought I finally found my perfect lip balm and would keep buying it from then on. The original one felt very smooth and lightweight, it just melted on my lips, and the moisture effect lasted long. This time around, as my balm was running out I ordered another one and it was a completely different experience! While the scent remained the same, the formula must have changed greatly. It now feels heavy on my lips, as if I coated them with a candle wax. More than that after about 10 mins since application it starts feeling dry and needs reapplying. This was nothing close to the original formula experience! It now feels like a cheap $3 chapstick I could buy at my grocery store. I compared the leftover in my old balm to this new balm and confirmed that it felt completely different. Then I came here and read other reviews of people saying the formula has changed. Very disappointed. Will look for another lip balm now. New formula, feels cheap, not going to buy again
