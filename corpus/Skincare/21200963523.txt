This has been my go to vitamin until they got rid of the large Truth serum! I would spend 500-800 every 2 -3 months on OLE but once they stopped making the large bottle of truth serum & the invorgating night serum forget it. I have PCOS so my skin is very oily and acne prone and this did help alot but I am not paying double I would have to order 2 small bottles each. OLE USE TO BE GOOD
