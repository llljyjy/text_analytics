Very poor packaging. It may not cost a lot but you’ll have great difficulty getting the last half of the product out of the tube without breaking something (ie. nails, fingers). That’s the packaging. The product isn’t much better as you have to use a lot of it to remove skincare and makeup from your face and neck. Waste of money. Waste of Money
