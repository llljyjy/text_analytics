I always ask for one of these for Christmas and the container lasts me approximately one year until the next holiday season. I use it most nights with the occasional skipped night here and there, but I almost always have leftovers before the start of my new container. I’ve gone through several of these lip balms (an original, Vanilla, Choco Mint, and currently working on a peppermint). The containers are awesome for travel once empty. I’ve decanted makeup removing balm and a moisturizer into them for my travel bag and also carry my ibuprofen and migraine meds in one for my purse. It’s an odd bonus but the containers carry so much product in a compact container that doesn’t take up too much space. Highly recommend! Love for lips and pills
