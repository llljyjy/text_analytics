I love this BB cream it is the first one I found that I like I said it is a light tent but it’s heavier than other BB creams I’ve used and I like full coverage. This is made with SPF in it it moisturizes and works as concealer I put it all over my face as a moisturizer and then added my own foundation over it for more overtime my skin felt more hydrated it also work great as concealer and I’m so happy it has SPF in it I use my SPF with it because there’s not enough in it if you’re normal SPF routine I highly recommend Amazing multipurpose beauty product
