I thought this would be a regular toner that leaves my skin feeling dry and ready to soak up a thick moisturizer. This is the complete opposite! My skin felt so healthy and hydrated after one application. I suffer from acne, but if I had clear skin this would be great to wear under a simple tinted spf/moisturizer. I would highly recommend! nan
