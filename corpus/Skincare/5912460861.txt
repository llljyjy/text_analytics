I received a deluxe-sized sample of this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. This moisturizer is light and carries the classic Estee Lauder scent. It applies wells and does provide some radiance to the skin immediately after applying. As far the tightening abilities, the deluxe size sample does not provide enough product to give a proper review. Based off of other EL I enjoy and use, I think this can be beneficial to others. Light and bright moisturizer
