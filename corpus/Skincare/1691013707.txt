I received a this small sample complimentary from Influenster to test and review. It was a very tiny sample therefore I am unable to give a full review. It has a gel like consistency which my skin absorbed. I have combination of oily/dry skin.It left my skin feeling soft but I am not sure it would be hydrating enough in the summer heat . I would need to test it more. Complimentary sample
