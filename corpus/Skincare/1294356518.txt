I have tried so many different vitamin c serums over the years, and this is by far the best. My skin looked brighter and clearer after a week of using this, and I can tell it is thanks to this product because I have been using various c serums daily for years. This is the first that I’ve seen such a noticeable difference with. It’s not sticky or greasy and melts into my skin making it easy to layer a moisturizer on over it. It does smell like turmeric, which I personally like. I hate strongly perfumed skin care, and this is just a tiny bit spicy/earthy and then it disappears within a couple of minutes. Amazing!
