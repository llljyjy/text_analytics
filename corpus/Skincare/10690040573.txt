I was really excited to try this product from Kosas as it hydrates, soothes, and plumps the skin. Features I am looking for in my skincare products as I have combination to dry, aging skin and as I am in my 40â€™s my skin is getting drier and needs more moisture. This spray on serum is the perfect solution for keeping my skin hydrated and looking healthy.I understand why they call this the life changing mist! I love how it hydrates, balances, and plumps my skin and how it prepares my skin for my skincare products. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous with the pink and orange colors. The serum comes out in such a beautiful fine mist. I love how this spray serum provides my skin with vegan collagen, peptides, and probiotics in such a unique way. I use it on my clean skin in the morning and at night before applying my moisturizer and/or makeup. It sinks right into my combination to dry skin, and it instantly hydrates and nourishes my skin. The fine mist touches my face on all the right places and dries within a minute. It has a nice a light floral scent. I love that it is water based. It nourishes my skin from the outside and the inside and makes my skin look plump with a healthy glow. It is not a setting spray for your makeup, but I love using it throughout the day to spray over my makeup to refresh my and hydrate my skin and get that beautiful glow. This is the perfect spray on serum that I have added to my daily skincare routine! Beautiful glow, plumps skin
