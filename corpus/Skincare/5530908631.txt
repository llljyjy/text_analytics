I have been using this product for about 2 years and it is awesome!  I know everyone complains about the grittiness but if you mix with a drop or 2 of the ordinary resveratrol + ferulic and emulsify between your fingers it basically gets rid of the grittiness!  Also this emulsion is a close dupe for a very pricey ( I wonâ€™t name the brand) vit C serum that is > $160.00 for a tiny bottle with a dropper so it is less stable!!!!! A Great Dupe
