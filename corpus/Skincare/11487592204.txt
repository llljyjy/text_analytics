I was so impressed by this product! First the coolness of the cream is as advertised. Its so refreshing and I particularly love using this product during my mornings as it helps wakes me up. It removes dirt, oil and my makeup surprisingly well and my skin felt so soft and clean after use. I also like the texture and consistency of this cream which doesnt feel chalky or abrasive but gentle and hydrating. The smell is also so fragrant and almost aromatherapeutic! Unique and effective!
