Most of y’all can see where this is going based on the other reviews, uneven spray, separated makeup, left my face, hair, and shirt looking oily. And if that wasn’t enough, if I would’ve read the ingredients(active and inactive), I wouldn’t have purchased from the very beginning. A spray that has sunscreen has no business having alcohol as a main ingredient, and having minty oils in it as well. No wonder I kept smelling alcohol and mint. I don’t understand why the brand messed up this product, it was very well loved before the reformulation. nan
