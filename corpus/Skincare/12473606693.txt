I used the Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream every night for two weeks and I really enjoy it! It’s a thick consistency but when you apply it melts into your skin. It’s very hydrated and in the morning the skin is very soft and beautiful! I’m very happy I got to try it! I will definitely incorporate this cream to my skincare night routine!!! nan
