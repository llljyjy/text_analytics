Great basic moisturizer. I have sensitive, combo skin. In summer I only use a pea sized amount, but it is easily layered, so I use a bit more in the winter.  This along with the serum really reduced redness and the appearance of my acne scars. If there was a larger bottle I would definitely purchase! Good for Sensitive Combo
