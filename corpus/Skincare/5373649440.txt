I received a sample of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. The sample was pretty small, so I was only to use for about 5 consecutive days, not long enough to notice long-term results. Within the first day, I developed a few breakouts on my chin, but cleared the next day. I used this morning and night after cleansing in lieu of my regular moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and feels like it requires quite a bit to cover my entire face and neck because of this. It had a light fragrance and left my skin rose petal soft with a matte finish. My complexion didn’t look amazingly better after 5 days use, but it didn’t look worse, so that’s a plus. For me, I feel it could be a bit more hydrating, as my skin runs more dry. I don’t see myself rushing out for a jar of this, but if you’re looking for a lightweight matte moisturizer, then go for it. As I mentioned, I wasn’t able to attest to any long term benefits to my skin. Not the best for dry skin
