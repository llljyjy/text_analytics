I’ve used many different kinds of facial cleansers, but this one stands out as one of the best ones so far. After using this cleanser my skin felt really refreshed, and I really wasn’t expecting that. I used it to remove most of my makeup and it really worked after the 1st application. The scent is really nice. It doesn’t wear off right away. There is no irritation to my skin or eyes. I will be using this every day in my skin care routine. And I recommend it to all because it is effective for me personally. Quality Facial Exception To The Rules
