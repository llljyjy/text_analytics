I love Saint James’ chic packaging. Overall, I have really enjoyed using this product as I’ve had a bad experience trying to rush into using a retinol previously. I think this product is very gentle and soothing while still packing a punch and getting the benefits of using a retinol. In the 3 weeks that I have incorporated this product into my nighttime skincare routine I do feel like this has lighten my hyperpigmentation and help plump fine lines around my eyes. Definitely recommend. Gentle yet powerful on fine lines
