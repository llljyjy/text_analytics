I bought this product because I was looking for. PHA and was in love with the beautiful green bottle. I give it 2 stars because it’s a waste of product due to having it in pump form opposed to dropper. The solution is the consistency of water, so when I pump it on my fingers, it runs right off/through the fingers. It’s so thin that I can’t rub it together to pat on my face. Another reason I find the pump as a bad idea is that when I pump it directly on my face, it comes out with powerful force and streams down my face quickly. When I “catch it” mid run, it applies to my skin in the line it ran down (can’t spread it bc it’s thin/watery).As far as it working as it’s supposed to, I think it does. I feel a slight sting as with any other acidic product, but I will not repurchase unless they make it with a dropper. Useless Pump
