the toner itself is delightful. i love everything from the rose collection from fresh. this toner works great on my dry//combination skin and leaves me feeling so refreshed.as for the petals ~ yes they are terrible. this will sound crazy but if you really shake the bottle while pouring it into your hands, it keeps the petals away from the spout LOL. i also think the cap is terrible ~ something leaked onto it and the paint is constantly peeling and ends up everywhere. would love to see a better product design! great toner, have to work around the packaging.
