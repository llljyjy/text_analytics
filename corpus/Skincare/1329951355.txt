Commenting on a trial size included in a bundle: this is the very first product I’ve seen make a significant difference to my undereye circles. I have genetic, allergy-aggravated brown pigmentation and prominent blue veins that are effectively impossible to cover. This product obviously doesn’t change the veins, but it lightens the pigmentation enough that I no longer feel as though I’d really want to try to cover up the dimensionality that’s left. It also doesn’t irritate or congest my fair, acne-prone, relatively sensitive skin at all. Excellent product. This works
