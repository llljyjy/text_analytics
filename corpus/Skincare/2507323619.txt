When it comes to skin care quality doesn’t always have to be super expensive. Sephora collection makeup is one of my go-to for brushes/cosmetics and I’m so glad I decided to try out this serum in their skin care line. Over the past few weeks it has def help my acne marks diminish. I’m excited to try other products on this line! 10/10 she’s a keeper!
