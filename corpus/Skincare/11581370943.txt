I was not expecting to love this product and especially during a time where my breakouts became frequent. The creamy texture and leaving my skin feeling great! It’s super gentle, I use it daily during breakouts, it’s a great product and I love it! I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin loves it! Amazing cleanser!
