I’m going to start off with saying I usually HATE face masks. They don’t typically work and they typically do more damage than good to my face. HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised when trying this product. Again, I was hesitant, but it didn’t burn my face and it made my face feel so soft afterwards. I love this as a nice boost to my routine. I don’t use it everyday but it’s a staple in my collection forsure. Best face mask around
