I really love these lip sleeping masks and was excited when the mango flavor came out!! It does smell nice and sweet, but it’s a bit subtle which could be good if you don’t like your skincare products to be too fragranced. Normally I don’t like too much fragrance either unless it’s my lip products which I’m fine with. But this scent didn’t hit the spot for me for whatever reason. I still miss the neutrogena mango lip balm from when I used it back in 2002 lol. It’s been hard to find anything to compare it to. For laneige, will stick with the original flavor, berry which I do love. nice
