I actually really love alpyn beauty because my skin always feels really soft afterwards. It sort of reminds me of the drunk elephant whipped moisturizer, but this is a cleanser. I felt like it really took my make up off, even my Mascara. This is so refreshing, and now an every day staple in my routine. nan
