Wow, for the longest time I have been using powder exfoliators, and this is so much better for my skin! I started using it for 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, and then 15 minutes. The more I use it and the longer I leave it on there is a definite glow and softness in my skin! This has changed my outlook on exfoliating. Amazing!
