So I love how light this product is . I kept thinking “did I apply enough?” Because it goes on so light weight . I did have to pump the bottle like 3-4 times to get the amount I need to dispense . I also love it didn’t leave my face feeling sticky because I often times find when I use products similar to this I have that issue. Overall I really have enjoyed the product so far . I would definitely recommend for my dry skin (like myself) girlies ! Great Facial Care !
