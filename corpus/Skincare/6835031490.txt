I am thrilled to report that this treatment is so nice! The consistency is smooth and not sticky! It dries down and absorbs very well. My skin usually gets pink/reddish after using retinol but this treatment did not make it as red as I am used to. I am inpressed with the small amount needed per treatment, meaning that this will last me a long time! Definitely worth it, I love Paulaâ€™s choice products! They never irritate my skin, they do not test on animals, and all of the products are lab tested and proven! Great retinol treatment!
