Unfortunately like many other reviewers, I have used this product a few times and every time that I try to use it in the evening I wake up the next morning with an extreme puffy face. By midday the swelling goes down and my eye area turns red and itchy. This is the only product Iâ€™ve changed in my routine so I will not be continuing use. Not Brightening Just Puffy
