This sunscreen makes my skin look SO nice and it feels so lightweight on! I know some are having piling issues but I read a tip from someone else to apply when your face is damp and that’s the only way I’ve been applying it since purchased. I go through my normal skincare routine, let it set for a few minutes, then spray rosewater and pat on the sunscreen :) I know it can seem like too much effort for a high end product but no white cast, no breakouts and the way my complexion feels and looks is so worth it!
