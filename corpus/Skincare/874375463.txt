I have combo/oily skin, and acne prone. I received a complementary sample to try and it was fantastic. My skin felt hydrated throughout the day. Very supple and soft. I liked that I didn’t have any issues with layering sunscreen and makeup ontop. Since the sample was only a few days worth, I didn’t see improvement with skin tone but thought that for a daily moisturizer, this was great. Smooth and soft
