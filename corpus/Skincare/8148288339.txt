Very hydrating and didn’t leave a white cast on my skin. It was easily to apply and absorbs quickly, great for an everyday type of sunscreen!  Did burn my eyes almost every time even when I was extremely careful not to put anywhere near my eyes. Has strong smell but didn’t make a difference under my makeup so that’s all I cared about Great
