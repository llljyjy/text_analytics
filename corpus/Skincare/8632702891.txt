This was my daily moisturizer for about 6 months and it was perfect. Not too drying, kept my skin balanced, soaked in easily. This new formulation has caused the WORST acne I have ever experienced. I don’t have acne-prone skin at all, yet my cheeks and forehead have been covered in angry red breakouts for the last few days and I couldn’t figure out why. I suspected it was the moisturizer and sure enough there are dozens of recent reviews ranting about the new ingredients. So sad that I can’t use this anymore. Sensitive skin beware! Don’t trust the new formula
