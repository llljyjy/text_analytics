I was gifted this It Cosmetics Confidence in Cream by @bzzagent & @itcosmetics  In exchange for my honest opinion.This moisturizer claims to minimize pores, reduce fine lines & wrinkle, brighten skin,smooth skin out, plumps the skin and give you an even tone all around. I love that this moisturizing cream is full of ceramides,glycerin, antioxidants, collagen, peptides, hyaluronic acid , vitamin E and shea butter ! It does have a slight scent but nothing too strong. I can feel itâ€™s hydration all day long and it worked well with my sensitive skin. I definitely recommend. A little goes a long way !
