I had high hopes for this product- as it would cut two products out of my routine but I am not impressed.  Here’s why:  you get very little product for the price.  The dispenser is not well designed at all.  It’s slightly gritty at first, but dries fine, almost matte.  I feel like I had to use a lot of product to get adequate sun protection.  If you feel like the skin tint is oily or too dewy this might be better for you. Note, this is very sheer. They need to redesign the dispenser and lower the price and it might be worth it. Where’s the rest?
