I really like this lip balm, especially the curved applicator tip. It goes on thick and stays put. I didn’t notice any sort of chemical taste and my tube was filled. I find this to be a better alternative to the Supergoop lip balm that inevitably beads up over time. I’m out in the sun a lot and love that this has spf 30. Get this!
