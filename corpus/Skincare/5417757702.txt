I received the Clarins Double Serum sample for 7 days free from butterly. I really like this product. I’ve always wanted to try something with turmeric in it. It went on smooth, had a nice scent and didn’t make me break out. However, I didn’t find that my skin looked any younger (probably because it was only 7 days) and I don’t see any difference in my pores. Unfortunately for the price point I probably would not continue to use this product. Nice But Not The Price
