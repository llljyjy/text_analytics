I received this product from Influenser and Estée Lauder for my honest review. I really liked how my skin felt after using this product. I have some dry/combination skin. I do think it’s hydrating. I usually don’t use toner as part of my skincare routine. I didn’t love the application process or the scent too well. I do think my skin looked and felt better after using it. I Like It
