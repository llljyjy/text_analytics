I literally never leave reviews but this moisturizer is a game changer!!! After even just the first time using it I could tell it would be my new fav. It glides onto the skin so smoothly and leaves it feeling so soft. It is kinda of a heavy cream but I have combination and acne prone skin and it doesn’t leave me feeling oily at all! Also maybe I’m crazy but I feel like it’s helping with discoloration/scarring already and I’ve only used it for a week! Either way, it’s amazing. 100% worth the money in my opinion! nan
