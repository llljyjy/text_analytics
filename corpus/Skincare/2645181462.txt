Sigh…this razor is horrible. Yes, I watched the videos, read the directions, everything. This razor is horrible. It works ok when shaving can be done in one straight direction such as on my legs but there is just no way to get a close shave in the underarm and bikini area. It’s also very easy to cut yourself with this razor when trying to go in opposite directions or angles to get a good shave since hair doesn’t grow in one straight direction across the entire body (ouch to my bikini line). The blade also collects hair underneath of it and then pushes up in a weird way which makes it impossible to use until you open it up and rinse the hair out. And you have to take the blade out and let it air dry otherwise it gets a weird discoloration on it after just the first use. I felt so much stubble after using this razor and there’s just no way to really get rid of it other than to use a typical multi blade razor. I brought this because I wanted to get away from the nickel in the cheaper multi blade razors to avoid razor bumps but just having to go over the same area so many times and trying to go in different directions (while hoping not to cut yourself if the blade turns in the wrong direction) is what causes razor bumps and unfortunately I predict that will happen using this. So Disappointed
