So I got this as part of the birthday gift from Sephora and I’m not sure if it’s this or the moisturizer that broke me out though I do feel it is this. I do like it I feel there are better cleansers out there (la roche posay) So I’d save this for maybe once a week definitely NOT a daily thing. Also, I would use at night as maybe part of a double cleanse to help rid yourself of the day’s gunk/funk/junk. The Jury is Out on this....for now
