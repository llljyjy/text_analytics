I received this product complimentary as part of an Influenster campaign.  I suffer from dry and dull looking skin in the winter months so was excited to try this product.   As promised this product is fragrance free as in no aroma at all.  I say this because many fragrance free products have a weird plastic smell but this product has NO aroma at all which is great.  I love the consistency of the product as it is very silky and so is easy to apply evenly.   My face soaked it up and it left my skin with a nice fresh sheen.   The product is not greasy at all and is a great everyday add to your skin regime.   I highly recommend this product. Great Product Just As Advertised
