Iâ€™ve been using this product for over a week now and love how my skin looks and feels. The cleanser is gentle, smells nice, and I can definitely tell a difference in my skin texture. I recommend pairing the cleanser with a hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizer. Great price! Great product! I recommend. Gentle Cleanser! Does the Job!
