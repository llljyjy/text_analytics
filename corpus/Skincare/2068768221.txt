I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange of my honest opinion of this product! To start off, this product smells SO good! It’s a very light rose scent, super refreshing. I used this product as a setting spray for my makeup as well as a mid day refresher for my skin. It worked wonderfully for keeping my foundation looking glowy all day. I loved it most as a mid day refresher for my skin though, it adds just the nicest subtle glow to my skin. And the best part is that I have sensitive skin and It didn’t break me out! Also, as a plus, the bottle is gorgeous! Its a glads bottle with a beautiful gold lid. Looks so chic displayed on my vanity! Definitely recommend the product. Adds a subtle glow!
