Lovely fruity smell if that’s something you like. I love it. The texturizing serum really smoothens the skin. I love how my face feels after applying this. Also very light and refreshing coz of the water gel formula. I’ve been using it for a few days and love it so far. But I can’t wait to see how it works in a few weeks. nan
