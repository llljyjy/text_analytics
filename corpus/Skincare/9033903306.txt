My under eyes felt somewhat hydrated after using this product, but it was an okay eye cream. I didn’t notice a difference in brightening my under eyes. I realized I would get some milia forming but with my nightly retinol they went away. Wouldn’t purchase again but I don’t regret trying this product. nan
