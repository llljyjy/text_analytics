I have combination skin and this smoothing sunscreen worked well with my skin. This sunscreen has a golden tint to it which helps skin look healthy and gives a nice glow. It was lightweight which I liked and my foundation and other makeup went on top with no issues.  I love that it doesnâ€™t smell like sunscreen , it also left zero white cast. My skin felt smooth and plump all day. My first day wearing it , it was 100+ degrees and my skin wasnt oily.  This will be an essential in my skincare routine Healthy protected skin
