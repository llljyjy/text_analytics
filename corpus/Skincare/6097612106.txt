Okay so the smell issue everyone in the reviews is talking about.. dramatic lol. It’s something thats just very herbal&natural yes but completely disappeared in minuets. THIS IS A ONE PUMP KIND IF SERUM!!! You can 100% over do it and cause pilling. I use a pump in my Farmacy face cream morning and night. I would wait a bit before applying makeup overtop. Finally the packaging is heavy and good quality. Over all I’d recommend this and will be repurchasing. very nice addition to my skincare
