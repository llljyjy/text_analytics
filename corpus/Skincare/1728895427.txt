I liked this formula it felt luxe and thick on my skin.  I loved the smell and felt that it instantly made my skin feel moisture enriched.  I am not a big moisturizer in the morning person but I did try this in the morning and it initially felt good but once I started moving around doing chores and got sweaty it got sticky on my face.  I probably would only use this at night as itâ€™s too thick for me for daytime use. Luxe moisturizer
