Its not really worth the price or hype in my opinion. I love the lip sleeping mask but this just feels like any other lip balm. It barely smells like anything to me and after a few hours my lips are drier than they were before I put this on. The shine is nice when you first apply it and its not too sticky so two stars for that. The only reason why this wasn’t returned was because I’d rubbed it directly on my mouth instead of swatching a bit first. Will use it until its gone but would not repurchase. mehh..
