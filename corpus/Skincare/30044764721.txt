This foaming cleanser is an experience. The packaging is nice and sturdy. When rubbing it on my face I could definitely feel it is a foaming cleanser. It didn’t leave my face dry but it needed some moisture afterward. The smell reminds me of a luxury body powder my mom used to use, in a good way. I wish it was a pump but that’s just personal preference. nan
