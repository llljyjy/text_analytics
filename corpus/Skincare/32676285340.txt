The Mandelic Acid Treatment from The INKEY List wasn’t harsh on my skin at all and was moisturizing. It’s also for PM use only and recommended as a spot treatment for scars and discoloration. The mandelic acid ingredient was new to me, so it was interesting to try; it’s also combined with retinol and glycerin. I recommend it. nan
