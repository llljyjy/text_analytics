love it! i found the best way to use it is to wash your face with cleanser then apply this serum WHILE IT IS STILL WET that is the most important step of you apply it to dry skin it does not work and in my experience broke me out. after you apply this to WET skin use a moisturizer and boom! glowing skin! MAKE SURE YOUR SKIN IS WET WHEN APPLYING THIS!!
