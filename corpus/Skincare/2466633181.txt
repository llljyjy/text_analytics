First time using a self tanner that works. Ive tried isle of paradise but I think because they are products tht i cant see where I applied the product, I always ended up looking like a reject oompa loopa full of giant streaks and missed areas. im blend into snow kinda white and I cant be in the sun so this works well without being orange. get the mitt tht goes with it and exfoliator like ocean salt from lush, i moisture right before and let the moisturizer sink in about 5 mins works!
