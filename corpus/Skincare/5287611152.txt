I was fortunate enough to receive this moisturizer/mask free from BzzAgent to test out for the last month. I absolutely love this moisturizer and it became an everyday product in my routine quickly. My skin is super sensitive and I have rosacea so I need to be extra diligent when it comes to ingredients on my skin. Thankfully I haven’t had any issues with this moisturizer and it’s actually helped calm down my redness and puffiness first thing in the morning. I’m loving the sleek packaging and less plastic. The smell of the product is very pleasing but I understand it’s not for everyone. The formula is thick but applies smooth and doesn’t leave any residue on your skin. I will definitely repurchase this product once I finish it up. nan
