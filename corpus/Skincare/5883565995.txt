I love this moisturizer. It doesn’t break me out, hydrates my skin, and is no fuss. What I dislike about it is how fast I go through it. The refill lasted 6 weeks (on rotation). I knocked off one star because it just doesn’t last. It’s unfortunate that the 90ml doesn’t have refills. Great but goes too fast
