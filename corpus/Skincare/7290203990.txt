I’m currently in love with this product. I’ve been using it for a week and it’s the BEST makeup remover I’ve ever tried. It really dissolves my makeup like no other product and its formula is so refreshing. Also, if you leave it for 5 minutes is like a hydrating mask. I could say that this is my favorite product in my skin-care routine. A must-have in my routine!
