I received a full size sample for free to try in exchange for an unbiased review.  I tried KIEHL’S Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum for 2 weeks to date.  Within the 2 weeks, I did see a difference (see collage pic... Don’t mind the rough brows, ha ha).  At first I was intimidated by the two-part system, but once I read the directions it was pretty self-explanatory and easy to do. When I first applied the serum, I felt a tingling and tightening like sensation in the areas of application. With each future application I felt the same tingling and tightening. I would also go ahead and shake the serum each night before I used it, even though it was not required per the instructions. I am very happy with the results so far, and plan to continue to use the serum for a full month. Please note that the label does state that while using the product, you should limit exposure to the Sun and also wear sunblock. If you are a person that will spend a lot of time outside, you may want to try this in the fall or winter when you may have limited Sun exposure. As far has how the serum reacted to my skin, I did not have any irritation, my face absorbed the product and it did not leave any feeling of residue, and it also did not make my face feel any more oily or dry than it usually does. I would recommend anyone with fine lines to try this product. As compared to other products this did seem to work in a faster amount of time, and this product appears to have a higher retinol concentration than others. 2 weeks saw improvement!
