i loved the toner it felt so nice and soaked in my skin well! the hyaluronic acid serum was.. not very hydrating and i feel like it doesent go well with the hyaluronic night cream in the kit.. i loved the night creams old formulation but the new one is not it! the eye cream was decent i wouldnt buy it again though.. i will be rebuying the toner! not very hydrating..
