A few reasons for this rating: - Not typical of a gel moisturizer as it is sticky and cloying. A bit more of a cream with a “gel“ appearance.- Average at best in terms of moisturizing but it leaves skin oily feeling.- Subjective, but the scent is not pleasant at all.Overall: very disappointing moisturizer that has little to no redeeming qualities. Not a gel texture
