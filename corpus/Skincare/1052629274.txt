Prior to the new formulation, I loved this product so much. It could not be found for a year. So I waited patiently and ordered it as soon as it reappeared. I’m so disappointed at the new formula. It sits on top of your face and smears your makeup. It’s awful. I really wish they’d go back to the old formula - not sure why it was changed to begin with. This formula is greasy and does not set makeup well at all. nan
