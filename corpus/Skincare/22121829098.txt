I LOVE this new sunscreen! I have dry to combination skin in the T zone, and this works wonders with my skincare routine. I don’t wear makeup and it is slightly sticky at application, so keep that in mind if you try it out. It goes on smooth and works really well, still haven’t had any sunburn from it. And the price is great compared to other brands since it’s 3.4oz instead of the usual 1.7oz. Definitely a shelf keeper for me! Holy Grail of mineral sunscreens!
