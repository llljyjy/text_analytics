I am really impressed with this cream. I have used it everyday for a week before bed and have noticed my skin is more supple, smooth and hydrated. It has a whipped cream consistency, it is rich yet absorbs into skin like a dream - a little bit goes a long way. I noticed that expression/fine lines have diminished and my skin has an overall healthy glow. It has a very light botanical scent that I find to be soothing. Highly recommend. soft silky skin
