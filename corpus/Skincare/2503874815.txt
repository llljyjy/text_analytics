After using this product for the last few weeks, I can’t say I’ve seen any drastic improvements to my fine lines. However, I probably am looking at them more intensely for this trial. This product was an easy add to my daily routines and enjoyable to use. Applying the product took some adjustment. At first I would squeeze too much product but now that’s only an issue in the morning if I’m still a bit sleepy.  Applicator tip seems a bit too big but I like the metal surface. It’s refreshing. Good add to daily routine.
