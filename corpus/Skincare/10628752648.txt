I have a acne prone skin tone and this moisturiser is best for me because it has salicylic acid in it. It really helps with the blemishes. I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and I definitely saw difference in my skin texture and blemishes. It feels amazing and I have a oily skin but If you have a dry skin this will not suit you because itâ€™s dry down matte. Amazing for normal to oily skin type!
