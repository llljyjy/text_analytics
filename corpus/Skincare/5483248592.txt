I was gifted by Innisfree this cherry blossom moisturizer. I wasn’t sure if this was going to give me the hydration I need since it’s a light weight gel, but it’s amazing! Leaves my skin soft and deeply hydrated. I wear both morning and night. Hasn’t caused any breakouts for my acne prone skin, and applies under makeup super nicely. It does a mild floral scent but it isn’t over powering and goes away fast. Couldn’t recommend more! Perfect lightweight hydration moisturizer
