I received this sample as my birthday gift. I am very picky about my moisturizer. I am 37 and for the past few years have been investing more in my skincare routine. I’ve been attracted to serums and lighter creams (my go-to was Philosophy anti-wrinkle miracle worker). I was apprehensive about this product because it is thicker and I tend to have oily skin, especially in my T zone. I have been using this nearly every day since early Feb (still lots left in my trial jar) and my skin has never looked and felt better. It is positively glowing! I have not had any breakouts like thick I have in the past with thick lotions, and didn’t have any skin issues during my monthly cycle which can sometimes result in a small breakout. I tend to have rosy cheeks and don’t like going out without at least foundation on to even out my skin tone. After using this for over a month, I don’t even need foundation! This is the only change I have made in my skincare routine. It is dewy and leaves a “glow“. It does leave a shine, but it doesn’t feel greasy to me. AT 37 my skin has never been better
