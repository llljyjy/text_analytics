I’ve used a few different self tanners but was always too nervous to try them on my face. After doing some research I decided to give these a try specifically for tanning my face. I love them. They’re so easy to use and it doesn’t require any extra steps in my limited busy-mom routine. I typically use 2 drops on my face before bed, making sure to thoroughly rub in the product and push it past my hairline, and massage onto my neck as well. It gives a great natural tan and has not bothered my oily/combination skin once during the last few months. I use them on my body as well and the drops are super forgiving unlike instant tanners. I typically use 4 drops on my arms and 6 on my legs. If I need that instant tan, I’ll use a foam and then follow up after the shower with these drops and it extends my tan a few extra days, and makes it look more natural as it fades. This small bottle has lasted me 3 months and that is using them on a weekly (& sometimes more than that) basis. Definitely recommend! Almost perfect & so easy
