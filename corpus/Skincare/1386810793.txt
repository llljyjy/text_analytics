This SPF feels good on the skin. I generally seek more of a tinted moisturizer feel as my last step, and this product feels more like makeup primer. It does blur the pores and evens out redness. It feels luxurious, doesnâ€™t irritate, leaves no white cast, and smells good! Another great product from Saint Jane. Solid sunscreen
