I have normal to dry skin. Very clear, not prone to acne. All in all Iâ€™m happy with my skin. I loved this at first because it feels incredible and lightweight. But I went to my dermatologist who advised me to STOP using whatever new product I was using (which was this) as it was causing milia. So never again with this for me. nan
