This is a thick serum like consistency. I have never had an SPF like this before and I love it. It works well for acne prone skin. I didn’t break me out or give me a white case. It’s very moisturizing without feeling greasy or heavy. It worked well underneath my makeup and didn’t cause any pilling like other sunscreens. It gave me a glow, moisturized and protected my skin. Moisturized and protected my skin
