Like ALL of the reviews, the packaging is horrid.  The bottle peels, and the paint chips stick to your fingers and you’ll have purple paint chips stuck to your face.  It’s impossible to avoid this because you have to the squeeze the bottle to get product and the paint gets all over your fingers.  Will not be buying again CHEAP PACKAGING
