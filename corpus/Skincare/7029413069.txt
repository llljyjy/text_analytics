I am going to start positive, I love the packaging and how the cleanser comes out of the bottle, nice and controlled. I have dry, sensitive skin especially in the winter in Chicago.. it left my face feel dry still even though it is supposed to help my dry skin. I would not advise to use this everyday because it is an exfoliator. I definitely felt like it exfoliated my face because it left it super smooth, but dry. The scent smells really good as well! Overall 4/5 because it left my face still dry but its great at exfoliating and smells good. Exfoliated but left my face dry
