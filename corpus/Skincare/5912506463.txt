I’ve been using this product for 2+ weeks now and digging the results. I admit I was a bit hesitant at first -- growing up with sensitive skin and eczema, I’ve always disliked the feeling of heavier creams and steered away of scented things. This was a pleasant surprise. It does not have a greasy/oily feel or residue and a little goes a long way. The scent is a pleasant, light citrus and is mild/dissipates quickly. I also admit I’m not as regular with AM use because I’d like an SPF, so I’m glad there is an SPF50 CC+ cream also from It Cosmetics that is recommended to use in conjunction with this product that I’m excited to try out. I dig the consistency and it’s absorbency into my skin, how soft it leaves my skin and that it includes a boosted amount of science supported ingredients for anti-aging. All of which I need because I ain’t getting any younger and I recently relocated to where Angry Sun from Mario 3 is (Phoenix) so any damaging effects is accelerated and 10xs more intense. Digging this!
