I loved trying Skinfix Eczema+ Dermatitis Face Balm and is such a great product! It’s a concentrated balm that helps to smooth facial Dermatitis, eczema, and dry skin patches; leaving my skin feeling so smooth and protected. It really helped with the itchy, less flaky dry skin, and instantly absorbed beautifully into my skin. I also love that it is ophthalmologist tested, and recommended by dermatologists. I use it at night, and wake up with less redness, irritation & no pain, and a little bit sure goes a long way so the tube will last a good while. I highly recommend this super hydrating face balm, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and feeling better. It feels so nice on my skin. It works great alone, or perfect to use as a serum for the last step of your skin care routine. I love that this product is free from any parabens, phthalates, preservatives and silicones, along with being cruelty free. It is formulated with 2 active pharmaceutical ingredients: Colloidal Oatmeal 5%, which temporarily protects and helps relieve minor skin irritation and itching. It also uses sweet Almond Oil 7% that helps nourish dry skin and relieve itching. It is proven to safely treat flare-ups for quick, soothing relief, and the lightweight, sheer balm is safe around eyes, on lids, and can be used under makeup! It has a light scent of sweet almond oil, and beeswax, which I love, and love how thick & moisturizing it is, yet does not leave my skin looking or feeling greasy. I like the blue packaging that’s made from 100% recycled paper with vegetable inks. I love this product and would highly recommend Skinfix products to others with dry, combo, and normal skin. I also found it more effective than many other eczema products I have tried and will get more when this runs out! Great Face Balm!
