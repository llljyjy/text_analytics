To be honest, I hadn’t heard of this brand before…and clearly I was missing out. This product is incredible. It goes on smooth under my makeup and feels great on my skin. No weird reactions. Quite the opposite. My skin looks and feels great. I can’t quite tell how much brighter it is…I feel like I have to use a bit longer to see that kind of impact but aside from that benefit it just feels great and my skin is definitely improved because of it. Not oily or drying. Just the right formula. The quality of the product and packaging also makes you feel like you’re using something worthwhile. It’s also a cruelty-free product which is really what I’m going for these days…there really is no reason to use animal product on our face. And this brand gets that. I highly recommend. nan
