I thought I liked this company and products until I read this one. There is no such thing as vegan collagen. Also in ANY TOPICAL PRODUCT using this collagen scam....collagen peptides are too big to be absorbed in the skin. They have to be ingested which there are great powders out there! No liquids..they also lie and have other ingredients. If anyone claims topical and or vegan collagen exists ask for their scientific research and sources. There is not one on the market. I loved farmacy but it makes me wonder what other products they have that are just crap and we think they work. It's a scam, misinformation
