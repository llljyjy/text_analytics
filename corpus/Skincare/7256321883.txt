My first impression of this is that it is very heavily fragrance. It’s almost too much and I didn’t think I would like it. However after my first use I had to admit to being impressed. It removed all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner, without issues. It left my skin feeling clean and soft without feeling stripped of all moisture. I really like this. I appreciate that I don’t feel the need to double cleanse in order to remove my makeup, but the heavy fragrance is a bit of a downside for me. nan
