I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I have been using it since I received it. This is a product that contains blue hyaluronic acid that really helps my skin to stay moisturized. The packaging is also very thoughtful and pretty. The pump dispenses the right amount of serum for each application. I have been using their Water Bank line for many years and it works really well with my skin. This is no exception and I am very pleased with the results. Wonderful Serum
