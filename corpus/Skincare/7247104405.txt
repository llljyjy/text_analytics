I never review products but this one I had to comment on. If you have dry skin please skip this. I had to reapply this gel so many times during the day because I would notice my skin becoming extremely dry. After I put on this gel, I notice a glow in my skin and notice that my skin feels moisturized that’s why I gave it 2 stars… but that only lasts about 5 min. For the price of this product, I expected way more than this. I will be going back to the original formula which suited me better. This was a COMPLETE miss for me. Not worth it
