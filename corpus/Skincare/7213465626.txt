I definitely like this product but time will continue to tell how great it is at diminishing my dark spots. I have used this serum every morning and night for the past week and have seen a bit of brightening, but as I said, it will take time! So far it has not irritated my skin or caused any breakouts which is always a concern for me trying a new product. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family as I have already began to see a difference, and I’m sure I’ll see more! Already see a difference!
