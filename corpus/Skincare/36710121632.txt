I received this #freeproduct from Topbox #tryitwithtopbox for my honest reviews. I have been using this once a week for a few weeks now and I love the way my skin feels after this mask routine. It isn’t too harsh and overdrying as compared to other clay masks that I’ve used before. I feel the pores shrinking and the oils getting detoxed from my skin. nan
