Amazing product. My skin absolutely LOVES laneige products and this incorporates so well into my already established routine. I was just recently married and my skin went downhill after all that makeup and dancing through the night. Dry, flaky, and the dullest of dull. After cleansing (and air drying my face) I use ONLY 1 pump of this to cover my entire face. It absorbs well and quickly (anything more than 1 pump would be a total waste in my opinion)! This plays so nicely with my other skin care (laneige + dermalogica) and smells amazing too! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
