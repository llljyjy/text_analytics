Here I am buying this for a third time!  It is a bargain for bakuchiol.  My skin is super sensitive, combo, acne prone, and loves this stuff.  It helps with brightening and fine lines.  I ran out and didn’t reorder.  A month later I was regretting that decision and repurchasing.  I highly recommend, even though I also use tretinoin, that’s so strong I can’t use it every night.  I use this on off nights.  Yes the smell is a little unpleasant but I’m grateful there’s no fragrance added.  The scent goes away very quickly.  Yes the packaging isn’t good, but I transfer it to an empty inkey list q10 serum bottle and that’s perfect for not wasting a drop. 3rd repurchase and highly recommend!!!
