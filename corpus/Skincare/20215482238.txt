I have always struggled finding a moisturizer that works for my combination skin, and sometimes they were too oily or too stripping for my skin. This moisturizer is the best I have ever tried. It is so lightweight, dries down fast and leaves your skin feeling just the perfect amount of hydration. A little goes a long way. nan
