I’ve used multiple luxury brand moisturizers and while the AB is extremely moisturizing and has a lovely satin finish, it truly is not worth the price when there are better creams on the market. If used as directed, one would have to buy 8.6 bottles/year, at a whopping $2450 a year, just for moisturizer without any major actives such as retinol. Personally, I think that money could be better spent on serums that contain actives and paired with a midrange moisturizer for a more cost-effective skin care routine. I will say that I’ve never felt anything quite like AB’s the Rich cream… it is dense and light all at once. 3 stars because it’s not life-changing for 280/bottle, would get more stars at a better price point. nan
