I received this “Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Corrrecting Serum” from CLINIQUE as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for free in exchange for my honest review.I used the product 2 times, because the sample I received was small.I really liked the serum, firstly it doesn’t smell anything, and for me that’s a plus. Second, the serum absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave the skin shiny or oily and it left my skin feeling firm. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see its long-term effect. Absorbed quickly
