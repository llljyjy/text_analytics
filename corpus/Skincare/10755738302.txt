This doesn’t remove regular mascara as seamlessly as other cleansing balms and oils I’ve tried. Crumbly bits stay on your eyes and it takes a lot of rubbing which can cause lash fallout or skin irritation. It washes off okay, but you definitely need to double cleanse to feel “clean“. I think if you can spare a few extra dollars, the physicians formula cleansing balm is much much better. This is also personal preference but I really wish this wasn’t in a tub – a squeeze tube is so much more hygienic and easy to portion control Not bad, but not great.
