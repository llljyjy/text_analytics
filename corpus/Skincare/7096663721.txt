SO hydrating without feeling oily or greasy. It sinks in immediately and genuinely feels so amazing when applying. A little goes a long way, but I still like to use about a teaspoon amount for intense hydration. I apply heavier before bed, and a little in the morning when I wake up. My skin has never looked better! Best Moisturizer Iâ€™ve Tried!
