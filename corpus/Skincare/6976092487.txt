This BB cream is so good. I have been wearing it for work everyday and it is super lightweight but also adds the perfect amount of coverage to smooth out the skin. I’ve been getting compliments that my skin looks very soft and glowy. I also love that is has SPF, that’s a huge plus for me. I use this in combination with a concealer for my under eyes and it’s been a great combo. I didn’t realize the shade range was so minimal though, so that’s a negative. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Love!
