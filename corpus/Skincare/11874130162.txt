I was eager to try this moisturizer because I am a fan of the adaptogen cream as well as the superfood whipped moisturizer. However, I wouldnâ€™t say this product is anything special. I have been using it nightly to lock in my serums but it does not absorb well. It just makes my skin feel tacky. Even though my skin looks glowy and shiny it does not feel as great as I thought it would. I will say as someone with acne-prone sensitive skin I have not had any reactions to it so far. Also despite this being a free sample I do not think it is worth $60+ at all. nothing special
