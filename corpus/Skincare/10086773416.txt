Love the look of the packaging and really wanted to like the product but the smell is a bit stuffy and it made my skin breakout.  The product is thick and feels hydrating though.Not sure if I am just allergic to the product because it stings as well and I donâ€™t have sensitive skin. I would not put this on the under-eye area AT ALL. Not for me
