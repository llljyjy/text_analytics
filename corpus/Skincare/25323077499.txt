Lancôme Renergie H.C.F Triple Serum is a beautifully packaged gift to your face. It takes a couple of pumps of the triple-faceted serum for full coverage of my face. It goes on smoothly and absorbs easily. The trio feels weightless and breathable, without irritation or sticky residue. The fragrance is a light floral, reminiscent of luxury perfume. I’m typically sensitive to fragrance, but this was pleasant, and did not bother my allergies. I appreciate that it resolves numerous skin concerns within one product, streamlining my beauty regimen. Benefits include volumizing, reducing wrinkles, and brightening dark spots. While more profound results will take consistent, long-term use; I do notice fewer dark spots and less pronounced wrinkles. So what is H.C.F.? It’s Hyaluronic acid to smooth skin, Vitamin C+ and Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) to reverse the signs of aging, and Ferulic Acid to defend skin from damage. I would purchase and recommend this product, as it is effective and of the utmost quality. Beauty Multi-Tasker
