I actually love this product! It helps a lot with hyperpigmentation. You definitely won’t notice a difference instantly besides that you’re glowing. But I do see my spots are fading faster then usual. The pictures are 12 days apart and I’ve been using it every other night Atleast when I can remember. I enjoy the scent of the product too. Helps with hyperpigmentation!
