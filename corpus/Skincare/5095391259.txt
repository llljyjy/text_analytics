Great place to start and achieve results with a gentle retinol! Iâ€™ve tried others in the past and always had extreme redness/breakouts and sensitivity. I actually see results after even 1 use! I started slow, using only once a week but now I use every 2-3 days. I have old indentations from acne scars and they are actually lessening after using this product. Great For Retinol Beginners!
