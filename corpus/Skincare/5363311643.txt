My aging eye area benefitted from the use of this product in that after using it for two weeks, I could see that my skin was plump and the appearance of fine lines (I have crows feet) were reduced because of the added hydration.  I didn’t experience any burning or sensitivity when using around the entire orbital area, and it doesn’t interfere with makeup application if I choose to wear makeup.  Concealer actually wears better over it because my skin is more hydrated.Now, the catch.  I like this product, but for the price point, I strongly feel you can find something to yield similar results at a lower price point.  You do get a lot of product and I can tell it will last a long time, but I didn’t notice anything so out of the ordinary in terms of longer term effects that I would be willing to invest the money on it.  In general, I think it is a very nice eye cream, but you can save money and get similar results.  The packaging is top notch, though.  Very heavy and luxe. Good, Not Great
