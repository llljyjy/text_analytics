i have moderate but often cystic acne. i have a fair skin tone so my acne appears very red. listen to me carefully, MIX 50/50 with MOISTURIZER. i use the cetaphil oil-free facial moisturizer and i will pat it all over my face. you can slightly build it up in areas that are more red by patting a little more on. don’t use too much and don’t forget to add moisturizer (it says this in the instructions) or it can get a little dry and flakey! when used correctly it does exactly what it’s suppose to do and i love it! i can use it in place of foundation on outdoor days :-) nan
