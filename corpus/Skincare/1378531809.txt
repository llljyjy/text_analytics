I have been using this sunscreen for a few weeks and I love how I can wear it under my makeup and there is no white cast. The product is light and so smooth that I sometimes forget I have it on. However, I do wish it has a higher spf, like spf 50, and a reef safe formula so I can wear it on my next trip to the islands. nan
