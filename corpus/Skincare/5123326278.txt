As part of a free sample program, I was able to try this lip mask. In comparison to other ones I really liked this one because of its application. For other lip masks, Iâ€™ve had to buy a applicator making the process hard to apply. This lip mask is very hydrating however, sticky. Though it is worth a try especially for the winter time! Must Try!
