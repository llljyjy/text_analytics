Gifted by the outset. This is the first time i have ever tried something from this brand. I am very impressed. Night cream is so goof. It is thick and hydrating. It literally nourishes your skin beautifully.  It absorbs fast and no greasy feel left behind. This cream is the perfect night cream for dull skin that needs extra love. After application, my skin is soft, nourished and adequately moisturized.  I wake up with a perfectly soft skin that is ready to tackle on the day. Will repurchase. Perfection in a jar
