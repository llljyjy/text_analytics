I picked this for my birthday gift last month. The 10ML lasted a month. I used it twice a day. I love it! I will definitely be buying the bigger size when i can. I have dry skin year round and this product feels so light but also very moisturizing. The only “con” is the price point. It is VERY expensive especially in this economy lol but in the end I think it’s worth it. :) nan
