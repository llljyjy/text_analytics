I tried this sunscreen for a couple of days and it was awesome!!! I love how it looks so glowy underneath my serum foundation and it just made my skin look radiant plus I know that my skin was protected by the SPF 40 which is amazing to me b cause I struggle to add spf to my makeupRoutine and this product makes it sooooooo easy!!! So I’ve been using it every day since I’m so happy with the product!!! I’ll definitely repurchase the it in the future it’s worth the money for sure since it made it so much easy for me to add SPF to my usual makeup routine and I feel like my pale skin is protected from the sun all day. Also I thought it would be hard to have my foundation rest on top of this product because normally spfs are greasy but I didn’t find that happenint with the two foundations I’ve been using it with so I’m really happy so far with the product!!! Perfect SPF
