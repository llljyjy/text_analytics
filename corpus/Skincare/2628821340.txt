I was gifted this moisturizer and love it. I donâ€™t need much and my skin feels so soft. I was surprised when I used the first time and my face felt a little mat after it absorbed in my skin.  But my make up goes on so much better with this product and my skin looks hydrated! And a little goes a long way. Love it!
