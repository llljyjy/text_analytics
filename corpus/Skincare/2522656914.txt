I received this cleanser complimentary from the Influenster app. I have normal to dry skin (leaning on the dry side). Although this is an exfoliating jelly, I didn’t find that it was too abrasive or drying for my skin although I wouldn’t substitute it for my daily cleanser or anything. It left my skin feeling overall smooth and refreshed. I did have some difficulty washing all the little exfoliating particles off. Get the scoop on Goop!
