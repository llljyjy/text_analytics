Extremely disappointed with this product. Not only was it a quarter size amount for $15 but the biggest disappointment was that it WAS NOT a cream. Be aware of this before buying. The texture is best described as similar to silly puddy. I even tried stirring it and the product just came out of the container in one solid lump. Total waste of money. And I had already disposed of the box so I was unable to return it and get my money back. Don't waste your money!
