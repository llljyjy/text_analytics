I was unimpressed with this product at first and actually found it a bit drying. BUT once I started layering it on top of my regular oil/moisturizer at night, it became a game changer! It leaves my skin plump, smooth, and hydrated, and doesn’t cause breakouts or irritation! Highly recommend! Amazing, just don’t skip your usual moisturizer!
