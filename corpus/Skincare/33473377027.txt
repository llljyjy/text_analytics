I typically shy away from retinol products, not wanting to spend money on something my skin might not tolerate. So when I had the opportunity from @BzzAgent and @Kiehls to try a free sample of the new Kiehls Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to give retinol a try! It was a little intimidating having to mix up the product to combine the serum with the activating powder, but it wasn’t a big deal at all. Kiehls says “To ensure maximum efficacy, its innovative packaging isolates a high concentration of pure Retinol powder so it can be freshly mixed into the serum upon first use“. I was surprised to learn you only need to use a small pea-size amount. I’ve used this product for 2 weeks now and haven’t experienced any redness, peeling, or hypersensitivity. I notice a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. The deeper wrinkles in my forehead haven’t changed yet. #skincare #Kiehlsretinol #Nightserum #FreeSample #Bzzagent nan
