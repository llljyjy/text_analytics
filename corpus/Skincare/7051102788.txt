Okay, PTR. Take my money! And thank you Influenster for the intro. I was a fan of the Peptide pads, but this was another step up! Love the tingling of the glycolic doing its thing. Iâ€™ve been using these pads for about a month now and love what it is doing for my skin. The pads are soaked and surprisingly do not fall apart as you apply to face, neck, back of hands, which I love. I can see and feel that my skin is brighter, smooth and exfoliated, without the flaking and drying of my skin that glycolic and retinol can result in. The percentage of glycolic and retinol is magical for an over the counter product. I can see its improved the smoothness of my skin, especially around crowsfeet, forehead and cheeks. The amount of products on each pad goes such a long way, that I use it on my face, decolatage, and back of hands. I follow up with its matching serum almost nightly now. I love this product and very happy with my results. PTR glycolic magic!
