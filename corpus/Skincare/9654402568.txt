I’m wearing sunscreen daily, and so far this Urban Environment fresh moisture sunscreen is ok for a daily basis. After applying it looks a bit shiny on me (I’ve got combi skin) but most sunscreens do the same. doesn’t leave white cast but still feels on the skin. As for me it’s pretty usual product, maybe I will repurchase it for the cold weather, as it makes my skin moisture. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. Daily ok
