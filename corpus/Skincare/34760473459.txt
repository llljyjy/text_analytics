#giftedbysupergoop I loved how hydrating the cream was instantly. I used it this morning and right away it felt like it melted right on to my skin. It doesn’t leave a white or glowy finish but it does leave a hydrated feel to it. I will continue to use it and see if i notice  any long term benefits compared to other spf products. But I’m in love with it!! nan
