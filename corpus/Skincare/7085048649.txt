I really loved this moisturizer.  The container and box is in my favorite color! Opening it up,  the moisturizer is balmy. I like something a bit less balmy, but the scent was nice and it went on my skin just great. Makes my skin feel light and soft. I am not sure long term impact, but after a hot shower and cold winter, my skin needs to be moisturize! It gives what is needed. nan
