I was between cleansers when I got this product. I tend to use my cleansers with my Clarisonic brush to get optimal results . With this product I felt like my skin got an amazing deep clean that removed the dead skin cells the dry patches and calmed my rosacea . Which is wear because after a cleans my skin usually gets irritated and red . But with this one it’s the opposite. It felt calm clean and refreshed . I liked the light scent of it and loved that a little dot got so much work done . It worth the price and it’s going to be a staple in my routine . My skin feels radiant and refreshed after every cleanse . a little goes a long way !
