Not excited about this cleanser and don’t understand the great reviews. This balm doesn’t remove makeup and leaves a greasy film.  I have to use eye makeup remover and a Asian cleansing balm to remove makeup and then a regular gentle cleanser afterwards to take care of the greasiness.   I have sensitive skin that is normal during the summer and dry during the winter. Have to double cleanse after using this product
