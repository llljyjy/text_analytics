This face oil is an absolute dream! I have combination acne prone skin, and this oil has been a god send. The consistency is lovely and not too thick. It also seems to help take away any redness I have after using it. I love using this oil at night as a final step, or adding a few drops to my moisturizer in the morning. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Definitely will be purchasing again! Such a lovely product!
