very good for dry sensitive skin. like that it’s backed by science, highly recommended by influences and dermatologists alike. will say might be too heavy for some during the summer time, but if that’s the case use only as night cream. I can get a way with day and night and my skin is looking fresh, Dewey and plump! will say I had to exchange because the vacuum pump thing was defective on my original purchase, but it’s helpful to use the correct  amount for face and neck without overdoing it. very very nice for dry skin
