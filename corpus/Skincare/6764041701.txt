I was very excited when I saw that they reformulated this product to be oil free and have a more neutral undertone because the oiliness and warm tone were my only complaints. Unfortunately, now the issue with this product is the pilling. Even if you wait 15 mins after applying your moisturizer (which nobody has time for), and you swipe it on gently rather than in a quick circular motion, this product still pills as you’re applying it. It’s a shame because the subtle color helps a lot to even out my skin tone, especially my dark circles, but the pilling is super annoying. I thought maybe the unseen sunscreen would be better so I tried that next, but it pills even worse!!! Blurs pores & evens skin tone BUT pills a lot :(
