This Glo Brilliant White Smile whitening device does a very good job at whitening my teeth in as little as 5 applications, 10 applications really made the most difference.  It is very easy to apply the gel and make sure to apply the lip balm included because it does make the device easier to use and not make your mouth hurt while using it.  The warming sensation is enjoyable and is a unique feature compared to other options. The device is easy to hold and is compact enough. It takes less than 30 minutes a day to complete each session.  I wish it charged faster or a wall outlet charger was included because the USB charger takes a good 5 hours to fully charge the device. Overall this is a great whitening option.  I received this product for free from PinchMe for my honest opinion and all opinions written are my own. Works well, needs to be charged
