Everybody should have a vitamin c serum in their skincare routine! I am thrilled that Farmacy Beauty gifted me their new 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum. The L-Ascorbic Acid helps reduce hyperpigmentation and dark spots. Ingredients also include 1% alpha-arbutin and ferulic acid to help even skin tone and tangerine peel to help hydrate the skin. The serum comes out clear and has a very slight (typical ascorbic acid) scent to it. I like the feel of it and canâ€™t wait to use this long term to see the results! Can't wait to use it long term!
