I am OBSESSED. SPF is a critical part of my daily AM skincare routine. This is my new holy grail. My skin is soooo glowy after application & I rarely wear foundation after applying it, but if I do it blends beautifully with it. I have naturally very dry skin & this product helps keep my skin hydrated throughout the day as well. Super smooth, lightweight, & smells so good (faintly smells like watermelon) - couldnâ€™t recommend this product enough! SPF+ glowy watermelon goodness!
