I received this from influencer in a vox box and was excited to try it. I have combination skin that is also sensitive and sometimes my skin suffers from dullness and dark spots. I didnâ€™t think that the serum felt sticky and I applied it before my moisturizer at night. The one immediate drawback I had with the product was that it smelled in my opinion awful! My skin did start to look brighter but after a couple weeks I noticed some redness and stopped using it. So it may work well for the right person but not for me. nan
