Got this as part of a sample and I thought that out of all the items I got, even other products I purchased to correct hyperpigmentation from acne scarring, this seemed to work the best.For me, it felt best while using this to moisturize a lot, as I felt that it does feel a bit drying and like others have said, sticky. This is the first VitC serum I’ve used, so I imagine this is just how they work. It felt kind of tight on my skin as it dried/absorbed, but it didn’t give me any problems. It instructs you to only put it on right away in the morning. In my experience I found that a little goes a long way, so in my opinion you don’t need to slather this on your face.The tiny sample size lasted me 3 applications, but I was also spot treating on my cheeks where I have pretty severe hyperpigmentation from months of maskne. Only reason it’s not 5 stars is because I haven’t used it long enough to know for sure if there is long term improvement but I am considering purchasing a larger bottle to test this! Sample size was nice!
