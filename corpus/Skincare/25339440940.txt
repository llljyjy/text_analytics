This is a really good long lasting lip oil. It last for quite some time however this does not play well with lip gloss. Any lip gloss I’ve tried to put on top of this (lawless forget the filler, Patrick Ta, Buxom) gives me white mouth in the corners. However, with the Dior lip oil, that doesn’t happen. So for me, it’s better on its own. nan
