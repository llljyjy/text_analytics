I struggle with acne around my chin and after using this for 2 weeks , it has definitely helped minimize the break outs and diminished the look of my acne scars , they are still there but definitely less noticeable then before . Would definitely recommend for someone with combination skin like me . Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience nan
