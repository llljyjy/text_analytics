I received this product as a promotion from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I use this product for two weeks and I do feel like my face it’s a bit smoother. One of the things I like about this product is that it doesn’t leave a thick layer on your skin. It’s a rich and creamy coming out of the pot but not too thick where it would make my face sweat. I will be able to layer a nice face powder on top of this if needed. nan
