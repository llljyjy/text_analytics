“I received these products for free from Influenster, Belif, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.”    I was very surprised after using this whole sample, it was a BIG surprise in a little size product. I was not expecting it to really be a favorite or for me to really like it because unfortunately, I’ve not had very much luck with Sephora products in the past and the size of the sample was particularly small so I didn’t think I would have enough for it to really do anything for me to see anything, but BOY was I wrong! My skin is actually loving it. It is nice and glowing, and I have very sensitive skin and it did not affect my skin in a bad way. It did not make my face more red like other serums do, and it didn’t really burn or sting as bad as other serums do on my face. The texture is very watery, but do not let that for you it sticks to your face. It is a little tacky at first, but that goes away and your skin will be left feeling nice and soft. I will definitely be purchasing the full size! A BIG surprise in a little sample
