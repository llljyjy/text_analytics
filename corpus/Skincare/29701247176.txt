I have mixed reviews about this sunscreen I don’t think it’s bad but I don’t think it’s amazing either, The sunscreen comes out pretty fast out so be careful with that, I’ve been using it for about 3 days now, And I noticed it’s a pretty soft and easy consistency to work with and blend in, however let’s talk about that now, The tint is definitely to orange for Mexican girls and perhaps I’d say say for any medium and darker complexion girls/men, I put this on and my skin is brown but definitely on the lighter side I have a bit of a olive undertone and this just did not workout, it’s makes me look visibly darker than my tone and leaves a bit of a orangey tint even when blended out super super good, I guess you can say it just looks like I’ve tanned my skin when I put it on it looks like that but if I don’t put it on my neck I look 2 different shades, I wouldn’t say this tint is “universal” I’d say it’s better for tanner white people honestly, and also this is a tinted sunscreen so please remember it isn’t makeup so please understand it isn’t going to cover anything, however I do notice if it matches your skin tone it’ll even it out and cover up redness however I did notice it blurs pores which I thought was really nice, however this sunscreen is also very small for the price $36 for something that’s not gonna last a long amount of time, I’d recommended the drunk elephant not tinted sunscreen instead for everyone, because i used it in the store and it leaves skin looking soft and a bit glowy and has almost no tint at all, but overall this sunscreen also smells pretty good I can’t say what it smells like but it does not smell nasty like other mineral sunscreens, but also know this sunscreen does not have fragrance so it’s a natural smell, And last thing it is a little heavy and you do feel it not to the point it’ll bother you. 100% HONEST REVIEW
