I’ve been using the Youth Enriched Orchid cream from Innisfree over the winter, and wanted to try this as a lighter option. I was a bit skeptical when I opened the jar, as it really is just a clear jelly. But it actually gives the perfect amount of hydration for me when used with a serum, and will be great for the warmer months. It does leave a nice, dewy glow on the face as well. I took a star off because it leaves a bit of a sticky finish. It’s not the worst stickiness I’ve experienced from a moisturizer, but it’s not 100% comfortable either. nan
