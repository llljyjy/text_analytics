Over the past few years, I’ve really started focusing on my skin care routine, and Estée Lauder products are some of my favorite products. With combination skin, sometimes a moisturizer will make my skin feel greasy. This one did not. It goes on smooth and feels rich, but absorbs well. I am a fan. nan
