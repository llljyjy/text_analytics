LOVEEEE!!! It has taken me FOREVER to find an affordable product that actually works. At first it wasn’t really helping after a week or two of using it. But I didn’t want to give up on this product. I am here about 3-4 weeks into using this, and it has gotten rid of most of my acne. I find squeezing into clean hands +applying is easier and less bacterial than putting it on any other way. (my skin is very acne prone and i have lots of small bumps and sometimes big pimples. I also have dry skin.) i still breakout sometimes, but this product does its job!! nan
