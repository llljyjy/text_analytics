I love this Hydrating face cream. I have sensitive and combination skin and I have had no issues using it. I have used it for 7 days and it gives me a nice glow. I apply it in the morning after washing my face and allow it to sit 5 mins before I apply my makeup. Leaves a nice glow that uplifts me for my day My skin loves it
