I do like this tanning oil. I got the shade light and I’m pretty fair, but I think I should’ve gotten the medium shade because the light mostly gives me a glow and a very slight tan. It helps to even out any splotches I have on my legs for when I wear shorts and dresses (just a little confidence boost). It has a faint tanning (biscuits) smell that gets stronger the longer it sits on my skin. I also find it to leave a weird dry but oily residue, even when applying it minimally, and I use a tanning mit. I make sure to exfoliate and shave before, and it has minimal streaking; I did end up with a weird line on my wrists because I made the mistake of washing my hands after I first applied it. It’s going to streak if you aren’t careful/prep your skin. It applies clear so you won’t know if it’s streaky until it’s too late, so I highly suggest using a tanning mit and follow the directions (long, sweeping motions and really rub it in). I find the colour lasts about a week on me before it starts to fade, so I apply it once a week. The product should last a long time as a little goes a long way. Packaging leaves something to be desired because it rolls around when you’re using it due to the cap being on the bottom. It's not perfect, but it does work.
