This was a nice moisturizer—I used it on both my face and my hands.  I received this product for free for testing purposes during the winter time in the Midwest US which was perfect.  I used it on my hands first and it absorbed quickly and my hands immediately got softer and less itchy.  It also helped moisturize my dry cuticles.  I used it a few times at night on my face and it was not irritating, absorbed quickly and was not greasy.  I also tried it in the morning under my makeup and it worked well—no piling and no shine.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was that it is pricey for moisturizer.  I’d be willing to pay this price if there was sunscreen in it (for a day moisturizer) and if it were a bit more hydrating as a (night moisturizer). Fast absorbing moisturizer
