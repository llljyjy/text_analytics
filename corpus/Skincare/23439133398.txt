This is it- this is go-to depuffing mask. I pair with eye masking patches and occasionally a chinstrap, but this mask does the heavy lifting. If you can leave it on for an hour or more, do it. If I’m puffy and have 30 mins to get ready I’m wearing this for 20 or as long as possible lol. Try it out, follow it up with some gua sha or a facial roller to help with extra fluid, and give yourself the snatched jaw line you deserve. Holy Grail De-Puffing Mask
