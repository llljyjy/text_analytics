I received a sample of this product for review purposes.Background - I have sensitive, oily skin that’s prone to dehydration.The packaging for the moisturizer is pretty. It absorbs into the skin well and doesn’t seem to disturb makeup. The product feels waxy and to me smells like an older style lotion with a floral undertone. In a week and a half of use, I did not notice any skin reactions. nan
