Pretty happy with the product- I was having some major skin flaking and dryness that I just couldnâ€™t get rid of, and after about a week of using this product it was completely eliminated. Very thick and soothing, I would recommend it. My only complaint is the amount of product that you receive for the high price point. I will have finished it after less than two months of consistent use. soothing for very dry skin
