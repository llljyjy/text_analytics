For the price, it’s ok for a nighttime eye cream I guess, but I felt it didn’t make much difference and didn’t moisturizer the eye area much. It does pill a lot, so I don’t even try to wear this under makeup/concealer anymore because the eye area will look so patchy and crumbly. I definitely wouldn’t re-purchase this and definitely don’t recommend. Only okay
