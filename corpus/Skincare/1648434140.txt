Although Clinique is a well known and trusted brand by so many, this product is not worth using! It has a number of ingredients in it that are actual HARMFUL to our skin. One of which is petroleum. That’s right- PETROLEUM!!! Petroleum belongs to the family of mineral oils. these oils cause problematic residues, such as MOAHS. MOAHS can act as genotoxic carcinogens, which promote the development of cancer and have been known to damage DNA. PLEASE, please read ingredient labels and understand their side effects prior to lathering beauty products all over your skin! Many extremely harmful ingredients are not banned in the US, but should be like the UK. …not much cancer in the UK, btw! Dangerous ingredients!
