After using this product a few times I had a horrible allergic reaction. My face swelled up so much I could barely open my left eye. After a couple days the swelling went down but my face was red and itchy for a week. I’ve never had this kind of reaction to any product I’ve used before, so definitely proceed with caution even if you’re not aware of any allergies. Do a patch test before putting on your face…
