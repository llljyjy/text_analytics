I received this product as part of a free sample program.... needless to say the product is overall good! The packaging is very sturdy - great for traveling which I do a lot. The product itself applies very thick - which I like too, but some may not prefer. The product doesnâ€™t taste terrible either! Do I notice a difference in how moisturized my lips feel the morning after using it? No - not really. I would use this more for a nice feel / clear application on my lips! nan
