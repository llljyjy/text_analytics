I’ve been using the old formula for over 10 years. Returned this new formula on the first wear with it still on my face. Sticky, shiny, hair is sticking to my face - I can *feel* it on my face. My matte foundation looks cakey & detectable over this. My most seamless undereye concealer creased & failed to blend upon application to begin with. All I want to do is go home & wash this off my face. So sad because now I have to go look for another new HG zinc sunscreen - because this ain’t it. All these rave reviews? They got it for free!
