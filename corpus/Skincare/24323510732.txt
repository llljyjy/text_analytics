This serum is amazing! I received this as a sample to try out and give my honest opinion on. It is fragrance free, so it does not irritate my skin and actually hydrates it. I used it morning and night for 2 weeks and I am noticing a difference in my skin. The texture has improved, and I love how it feels on my skin. This is a GREAT product, and I will continue to use it daily! Love it!
