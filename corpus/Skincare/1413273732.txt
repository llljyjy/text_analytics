If you don’t want baby looking skin then this product isn’t for you! I’ve tried all the Biossance products and the retinol is my favorite to-date. I apply a pea size to my face & neck, waking up with the softest, freshest looking skin. It targets my fine lines so well and erases my forehead wrinkles. I tend to have dry skin so I make sure to layer on the moisturizer so I don’t have any dry spots. Seriously recommend! Baby Face Retinol
