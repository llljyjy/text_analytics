I have been using this moisturizer day and night for a full week now and have really been impressed with the results. I have always had very dry skin and tend to stick to heavy creams and oils to try to keep moisturized. I was concerned that a gel may not be enough for me. Although this is a gel moisturizer, it is a heavy and lasting one and so it was just as effective as a cream would be for me. It is easy to go with a lighter application for daytime under make up, and leaves me feeling moisturized all day. Although cute, I did find the packaging to be overly bulky and also found it difficult getting the lid back on after use due to my hands still being slippery. I will still definitely be repurchasing this product and will likely try the cream as well! Very moisturizing!
