i was super excited to try drunk elephant and this is my first product but i’m not too impressed w it. 1st of all it does kinda leave a greasy film which isn’t too big of a deal to me because when i use it i’m double cleansing with it anyways but it kind of worries me since i’m acne prone. 2nd it is kinda hard to take off waterproof mascara with it you definitely have to rub a bit and it still doesn’t take it all off. in the images below u can see how much mascara was left which i used micellar water to remove after using this product. i’m emulsifying with water too. definitely don’t see the point in paying 30 something dollars for a product when an $8 makeup remover is cleaning up the leftovers. also the first ingredient Ethylhexyl Palmitate is known as comedogenic and apparently is rated a 4 on the comedogenic scale, 5 being the highest. so i don’t think i will be repurchasing since i’m not very satisfied with the product and i don’t feel like it’s worth the price. if i begin to breakout i will also have to return. not too impressed
