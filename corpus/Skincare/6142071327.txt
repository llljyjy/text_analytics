I really wanted to like this moisturizer but it just didn’t work well for my skin type. I have dry sensitive skin and I found this product to be very drying. It left my face flaky and red when I woke up the next morning. I think this would be a lovely clean option for someone with normal or oily skin though! Just bummed it didn’t work for me! Not for dry skin
