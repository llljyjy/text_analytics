The product went well onto my skin. I personally have dry skin and it oiled up my skin, not overly oiled, but just perfect in the sense that it added the oil I should have but don’t. I have a few pimples and they looked slightly less red using the product, it didn’t rid them completely but lessened them a bit. I highly recommend for people with dry skin, or acne.
