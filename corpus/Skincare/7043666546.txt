It’s amazing. Super moisturizing. Makes my skin so glowy on a no makeup day. Glides on smoothly. I honestly can’t say enough great things. It may be too much for others with super oily skin in the summer like me, but I honestly don’t mind it. I just really love the way it feels on my skin. It hasn’t broken me out so far. My new favorite SPF
