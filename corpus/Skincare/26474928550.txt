Heads-up, this is a lengthy review. I am on my second jar of this stuff, and I LOVE IT! I’ve used other forms of topical Vitamin C serums which oxidized over time, even if kept in the fridge. I love that the powder form is stable and eliminates this problem, plus I don’t have to run down to my refrigerator every time I want to use it. I have found the best way to apply it is to mix it with a few drops of distilled water in the palm of my hand, and the powder dissolves almost instantly and completely, so there is no grainy feel when I apply it to my face. This method works the best for me, as I prefer my vitamin C serum to be non occlusive (meaning it’s non-moisturizing and doesn’t form a protective barrier on the skin), as it’s the first product I apply to my face after toner and exfoliating serum (Lactic Acid 5% - also from The Ordinary), before other moisturizing serums and lotions. Yes it stings at first, and even after using it for well over six months, it still stings mildly.  But that tells me it’s working. My skin is noticeably brighter and more evenly textured. I read other reviews on here that people are mixing it with their body moisturizer. This is BRILLIANT, and will have to give it a try! I love The Ordinary for its amazing price point and the ability to totally customize my skincare products. If you are a newbie and are unsure of what products you need, and which to avoid using together, you can go on the Deciem website and open a chat with an on-line consultant who can recommend a customized skin-care routine to address your specific issues. THE best unadulterated pure L-Ascorbic Acid!
