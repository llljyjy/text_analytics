I absolutely love this product. With winter, my skin has been drying easily. After one use of this product overnight my skin was so soft. It dries quickly and doesnâ€™t leave greasy residue. I feel like it is pricey but worth it. It does smooth out fine lines as well. My skin feels more supple and plump. Great product
