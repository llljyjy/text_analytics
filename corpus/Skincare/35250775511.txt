I initially had some sensitivity to it applying it morning and evening, so used in the evening for a week or so now I donit twice daily. I like that it doesn’t have a greasy feeling or scent to it, I have not really noticed a big change in appearance but it does leave a refreshing feeling I’m sure with continued use I can notice more also my eye area feels smooth like hydrated. Smooth!
