These taste delicious and its extremely hard not to eat them like candy! They taste like an orange dreamsicle. Ive been taking them for 7 days so far and my skin feels less dry and hydrated even without using topical moisturizers. And I say that as I have also been in the sun 24/7 recently which usually dries my skin out. Excited to see my skin results as I continue to use these. Taste amazing!
