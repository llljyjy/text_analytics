this is THE best toner I have ever used — I had ridiculously flaky, dry and dehydrated skin. My skin was dull and in need of major TLC. Read some reviews on Reddit and I had to try this. I instantly fell in love. Literally noticed a difference overnight. I can usually where it alone if my skin is okay but on the days when it’s extra dry, I’ll pair it with Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream (the purple one) and my skin is GLOWING. The trick is to apply it on damp skin, as you should with all moisturizing skincare anyways, but it really seals it in that way. Also, a little goes a long way — I rarely need to put it on a second time in the same turn. I use it about 2 times a day. LOVE this
