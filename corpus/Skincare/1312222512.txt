This feels lux going on even without the container (which looks great on my beauty shelf). Soaks right into a smooth supple finish and unless most, I barely noticed the rose smell and definitely didn’t smell it once it was on. I like this tons more than La Mer’s soft cream as far as a face crea mwithout spf goes. nan
