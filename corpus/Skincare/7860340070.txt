Creamy and moisturizing; wears well under makeup. This is the best moisturizer I’ve found in this price-range, keeps me hydrated all day long. My skin looks so much healthier and firmer since I’ve switched over to this line (cleanser, vitamin C serum, adaptogen rich moisture cream). Very happy! Excellent Cream
