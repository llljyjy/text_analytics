This stuff really is amazing. It is thick, creamy, hydrating… a little really goes a long way. The applicator is metal so it’s cooling and feels so good. I love to also use the cream along the outer corner of my nose and along the top of my lips where I get smile lines and some wrinkling. I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin since I began using. A must have!!
