This is my second time purchasing the Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream. I am not easily impressed when it comes to eye creams because I have sensitive skin and really dull/ dark under-eye circles, but I can safely say this eye cream is one of my all time favs! I’ve used it every morning for 3.5 months so far and I feel like it really helped make my under-eye area look so much more radiant and healthy. I don’t know if it specifically lightened my dark circles, but my whole under eye area just looks so much more refreshed and youthful. Highly recommend if you are struggling with dull looking under-eyes. Repurchased
