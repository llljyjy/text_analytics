I’ve been using this consistently in the AM and PM after washing my face as the directions say to do for a month now and my skin has never been so clear. I saw a big difference in just 4 days. I went from having swollen inflamed breakouts to small scabby spots to now very little to no blemishes at all. As some people mentioned it will bring all breakouts to the surface then clear; for me this took about a week but I never at any point felt like the condition of my face wasn’t improving. TRUST THE PROCESS AND STICK WITH IT YOU WONT BE SORRY. I have been on spironolactone for years and in the past month using this regimen I’ve been able to stop taking it all together and remain clear. I wish I would’ve found this extremely affordable solution sooner! BUY IT
