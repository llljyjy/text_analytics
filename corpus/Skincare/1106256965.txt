I am an avid fan of Tatcha products. I started with the heavy duty primer and although it covered I felt a little like I was wearing a mask. This featherweight product is amazing! It keeps my skin protected and is not drying. Easy to apply and I even wear it around my eyes and eyelids. Perfect for my aging skin
