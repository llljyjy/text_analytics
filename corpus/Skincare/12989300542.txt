If I could give zero stars I would. I’m so disappointed in this product. First off it’s greasy, it pills more than any sunscreen I have ever used and I really don’t think the spf is accurate. I have been sunburned twice on my face while using this. It’s so angering to spend so much time and effort into my skincare routine and be so diligent about applying spf every day just to have this product ruin it all. I’m not giving this product another chance. Back to Sephora it goes. Do Not Purchase This Unless You Want To Get Burned
