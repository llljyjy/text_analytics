Wow, this poreless skin cream was super moisturizing and definitely blurred my pores. It was not greasy and it went on smoothly with a very light scent. I didnâ€™t break out from this product which was also a plus. I received this complementary from infuenster in exchange for my honest review. Great addition to my nighttime routine
