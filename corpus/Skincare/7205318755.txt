A MUST HAVE IN MY SKINCARE, this is my second purchase of this product. I get hyperpigmentation SO easily and this is clearing it up so nicely and pretty fast and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped at all. So it’s soft throughout the day and a lot more clear. I double cleanse with the biossance face wash and dermalogica mixed together to make a paste and then scrub gently and then I rinse and go in with this and it’s the PERFECT combination. All three are gentle enough to remove oil buildup but to not make me feel tight. I see such a big improvement in my skin so on the sale I just bought all three again! I need all three to do my skincare routine for sure. DEFINITELY buy this for hyperpigmentation!
