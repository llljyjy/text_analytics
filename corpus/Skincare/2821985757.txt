I have used this cleanser occasionally (not consistently) over a few years and I like it, with one significant cavaet: I absolutely *cannot* use a face moisturizer after washing with this one. Regardless of what kind of moisturizer I’ve used, the result is the same - my face gets warm and flushed like a vinegar-induced Rosaceae. I do still like this stuff but generally won’t use it in winter if I’d normally be using moisturizer. can't use with moisturizer
