I’m always on the lookout for a face cream that can hydrate my skin without being oily. This face cream is lightweight feels like whip. It definitely hydrates my skin. I have been using it as part of my night time routine and daytime. A little bit goes a long way. The only thing I’m not a fan of is the scent it has it’s supposed to be scent free but there’s definitely an unpleasant scent. It does go away after a while once you’ve applied onto your skin. It has helped to reduce my redness around my cheeks which I’m happy about. Nice Face Cream
