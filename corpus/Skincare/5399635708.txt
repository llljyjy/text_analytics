This stuff literally works, I was hesitant because nothing has worked at fading my acne scars and blemishes over my body (I have really sensitive skin) and I put this cream on overnight, woke up the next morning and a few old scars on my face were practically gone! Buy this! Just be cautious, there is a strong sulfur smell but it honestly doesnâ€™t bother me. Miracle in a cream!!
