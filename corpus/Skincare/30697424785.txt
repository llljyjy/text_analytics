Super innovative! I used to be a pharmacy technician and it reminds me a lot of another product we dispensed where you had to break a capsule into a lotion just prior to giving it to the patient. Very gentle but also very effective. I have a lot of acne scars along my jaw line and those have started to fade in the very short time I’ve been using this. As soon as I run out, I’ll be buying more! nan
