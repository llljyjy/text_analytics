I really didn’t see an improvement as it stated I would in 72 hours. I applied as directed on my face and also my hands. I did like they way my skin felt after I applied the product but it didn’t last long. For the price, I would not recommend this product if you are truly looking to see a difference. For me, I didn’t not see it. Cica recover and repair not as expected
