Iâ€™ve always found eye serums and creams to be a Vick gimmicky and a way for companies to upcharge you for basic moisturizing product, but I will say this formula feels nice. Further, the packaging is lux and the applicator feels so nice on the under eye. It makes applying much easier than using fingertips. nan
