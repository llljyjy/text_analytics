I’ve been using this serum for about three weeks now and I only have good things to say. My skin gets very dry in the cold weather and this is exactly what it needed. After each use my skin looks more hydrated, plump and glowy. I’ve noticed that since adding this into my skincare routine my skin no longer gets dry flaky patches. I love that this serum has a thicker texture but doesn’t leave your skin feeling sticky. Dermalogica is my most trusted skincare brand and had delivered another amazing and effective product! #GiftedbyDermalogica nan
