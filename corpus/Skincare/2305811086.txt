I really like this product. It goes on extremely smooth and cools the skin under and around my eyes. It helps in order to apply concealer as I feel like it moisturizes around my eyes before I apply other products. The only reason for four stars is that my dark circles are still quite noticeable and I wouldâ€™ve liked a bit more coverage. Overall, it is a good product!! nan
