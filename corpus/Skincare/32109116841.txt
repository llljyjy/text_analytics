Infects sample size of this product complimentary from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my review. This moisturizer goes on smoothly and absorbs well. It’s not heavily scented, which is good because it’s on your face. I wish I had a bigger sample to get to see how it will be for long term results. However, it is a lovely moisturizer and I would recommend and purchase myself. A lovely moisturizer
