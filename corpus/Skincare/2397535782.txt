Summer is here and I was excited to try the Isle of Paradise self tanning oil mist. I’ve used their tanning drops and mouse in Light as well and have liked the application and results. I’ve been self tanning for over 10 years now and I’m well aware of the do’s and don’ts. I started by shaking the bottle and spraying it on my legs. Wow, it sprays out a lot of product, more than their self tanning water. Not only does it spray out a lot but because of the oil consistency it starts running super fast so have a mitt close by and ready to blend. Keep in mind the floor too. I found because so much of the oil misted out a lot of it got on my bathroom floor. Not noticing wear it had fallen because the oil is clear I got so much of it on the bottom of my feet just by moving around trying to get it on. It was messy. I ended up just spraying it on to my self tanning mitt and then blending it out for an easier application. The formula is nice on the skin and absorbs fast making it easy to layer. The Light shade worked well on my light to light/medium skin tone. It was not too intense or orangey. Would I recommend it yes and no. The formula is nice and may be great for someone with dry skin (although I would recommend the Isle Of Paradise butter instead) The application is just super messy! It doesn’t make sense to have this formula in a spray bottle. Don’t even bother spraying it onto your skin and spray it on to a mitt instead (but if you’re doing that just go for the mouse version instead.) Messy!
