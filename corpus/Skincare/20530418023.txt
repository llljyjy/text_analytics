This Daily dose hydra-ceramide boost spf was gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my honest review. I must say that I really like the texture during the colder months. The oil feels luxurious and adds just the right amount of moisture to my skin. Doesn’t hurt that it also has spf in it! I doubt I’ll use this during the summer but we shall see how it holds up in the spring. Perfect for winter
