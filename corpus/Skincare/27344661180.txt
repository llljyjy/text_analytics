I’m not sure why but when I received this (bought online at full price) I was excited to try it. I was surprisingly very disappointed, it smelled rancid. I have many fenty products and this is the first one that was gross. It smelled disgusting and I get same results from my Inisfree serum that smells great. I used it once, regretted it and am returning it. I can only give it a star and that’s more than it deserves for me. I’ve noticed the newer fenty products have been lacking in quality control. I also bought the clay face mask and was equally disappointed. I’m glad other people use this and it worked great for them-just not great for me. nan
