I read the reviews before purchasing, i read that it worked wonders for some people and didn’t work for others but it didn’t cause more problems, it just stayed the same. I took my chances with this product and hoped for the best, i used it for a week and a half and it broke me out even more. It’s been a month and a half since i stopped using this product and i still haven’t been able to get rid of the acne it has caused. I 0/10 do not recommend for people who have sensitive skin. also, this product smells horrible. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING!!!
