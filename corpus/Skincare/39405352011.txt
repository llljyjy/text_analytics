I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks now.  I was hesitant to try this cream since it looked really thick, my face is oily to begin with but decided to try it out.  I have to say this cream is outstanding! It did not make me break out plus my face is not as oily.  I have noticed that my black circles under my eyes are getting lighter.  This cream is excellent to wear under makeup.  This makes my makeup last a bit longer in the day.  I would definitely recommend this product. A tad too creamy
