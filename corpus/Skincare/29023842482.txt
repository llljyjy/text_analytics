The most suitable sunscreen Iâ€™ve ever used allowing me to apply a FULL FACE of makeup on top of it without any trace. Virtually no white tell-tale sign of sunscreen. My only word of caution is this... After applying to your face, allow it to dry until its dry to the touch (few minutes). Avoid EXCESSIVELY tugging at your skin post application, as this can cause the product to ball up/leave a white cast (something I found out the hard way trying to apply my tacky thick Make Up For Ever mattifying primer on top). A regular primer and liquid foundation/makeup will not cause this. Thank you, Shiseido! The best facial sunscreen in the entire beauty mar
