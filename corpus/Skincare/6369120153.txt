I loved This sunscreen, let’s start there. we went on vacation to Egypt and this was going to be my ultimate test as sweat and direct intense sun would be the test of all tests. I placed it over my vit c serum and moisturizer and applied as directed before leaving our hotels. We took it with us to reapply regularly. For the first couple days the formula kept together but then it separated into a clear liquid and what I am supposing is the golden part. I shook vigorously and it homologated together a bit. But back at the hotel under ac it came back together. This separating was a bummer because no amount of shaking (with normal strength not a machine) would not bring it back together under the heat which when we really needed it. This being said, it still did its job! Protected and nourished my skin while under that intense climate. I would like really like a water proof version for water sports as this washed away when at the beach and snorkeling but kept when sweating. As for people commenting about piling, the chemicals are reacting… what ever is being used underneath or on top is causing the split of the formula. The shine is amazing on this, for those who don’t want to glow/have glass skin… a matte would be better. love this sunscreen but it separates in heat
