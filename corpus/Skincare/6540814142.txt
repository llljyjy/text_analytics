I love this product! I use it for my face and my body and it gives me such a natural tanning color. Makes it so easy to apply mixing it with your moisturizer and I love that it does not transfer to your bed sheets and you can immediately get dressed after applying it. It does have the self tanner smell after you apply it but I think itâ€™s not too bad compared to other self tanners. nan
