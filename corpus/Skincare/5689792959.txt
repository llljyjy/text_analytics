Honestly, this product is not worth the price tag in my opinion. I tested this serum for about 3 weeks straight to get a real review. It did not noticeably lighten my dark spots, and it definitely caused some breakouts. I stopped using this product, and the breakouts went away. Personally, at. $98 price point, I expect VERY carefully chosen ingredients to guarantee no breakouts. It was soothing to apply, not sticky, and 2 pumps covered my entire face. Just not worth it. Very subpar for the price tag
