I have aways been a fan of Clinique products and am I longtime user. I waited a few weeks before reviewing so I could see if there were any visible differences. The cream is thick and a little goes a long way. It is a little greasy but if putting on at night that doesnâ€™t really matter. I have not seen any dramatic differences but I do feel that my makeup looks smoother around the eyes so there is some moisturizing components of it. I do have have a lot of lines around my eyes, but my eye are does look more hydrated. Eye area smoother
