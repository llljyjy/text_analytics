Ok, so yes there potentially may be some pilling HOWEVER, I really only experience pilling when I donâ€™t work it into my skin in sections. This spf layers fine with my other skincare products (for reference: my GR toner, essence, caudalie serum, and my moisturizer). I gently work on one side of my face first and then the next, being cautious not to rub it in too harshly. This alone will even out your skin tone and not leave a white cast AND it will also work really nicely under makeup. Giving you a really pretty natural glow and minimize the appearance of your pores (i use this as my makeup primer). It is pricey so I suggest getting a sample first and doing a wear test/makeup test. Remember to work it in sections and being gentle with it to avoid pilling! thank u Tatcha
