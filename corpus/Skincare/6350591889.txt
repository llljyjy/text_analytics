I didn’t think I’d like this cleanser but I was wrong! The smallest, pea-sized amount gives you a full lather so this bottle should last forever. The water lily scent is strong but my skin hasn’t had a reaction to it, however definitely avoid the eye area. My skin feels clean without being overly stripped after using this. Not sure if its worth repurchasing yet but I’ll definitely finish the bottle I have. Took me by surprise
