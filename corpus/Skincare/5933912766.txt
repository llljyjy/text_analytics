I originally bought this product while it was on sale and I fell in love. I was just looking for a day time moisturizer and it has easily become my go to! I use it as a day time moisturizer/primer and it is amazing. It gives a subtle glow and it doesnâ€™t leave the skin feeling greasy afterwards. It absorbs and really mixes well with my makeup routine. Will continue buying! love this product!!
