Self-care is extremely important to me and I decided to try this product because I have heard that Reginal is very good for your skin especially at my age. I like that it’s  light and not sticky at all. I also liked how the instructions were with illustration and that made it easy for me to prepare the product and then apply it. I also like that the instructions were written in small sentences so it was easier for me to understand. I apply it twice a week for now because my face is not used to it and that was on the instructions. I like that my skin its side feels soft and I already see a healthier skin and I know it will remain like that I have that feeling with this product. I like that there’s no scent. nan
