This is such a strange product in that I typically don’t like oils but I LOVE this one. It makes my skin glow, but it doesn’t make me greasy. I do find that it helps me look less oily in the mornings. I will say, I only use this as night due to how glowy it makes my skin look and how slippy my skin feels. nan
