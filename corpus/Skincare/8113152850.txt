This was a major step in my skincare routine in finding what works for me. Once I tried a sample, I noticed it left my skin very clean, no need to clean it twice and nothing came off when doing toner. I also loved that it left me feeling squeaky clean a lil dry but not I canâ€™t crack a smile dry. The fact that its also a glass bottle helps me come to terms with sustainable skincare, and I like to use the empty bottle to keep dry flowers or give them to my sibling to tumble them. Squeaky Clean
