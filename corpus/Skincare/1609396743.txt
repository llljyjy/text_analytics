This product has new packaging from the old version which had a pump container. I prefer the new squeeze tube packaging.I have been using this moisturizer for a few months now. I have acne and it has helped clear my acne and prevent new acne from forming. It is one of the only moisturizers that does NOT make me break out! Great Moisturizer for Acne-prone skin
