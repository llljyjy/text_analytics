Omg I just reviewed the wrong thing....oooopppsssss welp here’s the gel to foam cleaner review! HahahaThis cleanser is awesome non stripping and at first it seemed like...eh. but then i learned a trick;lather it up in my fingers a little more before I apply it on my face and it seems to do more! I like how gentle and effective it is and although it’s not scented it still works great! nan
