Didn’t feel like it does much, and I think it might be too drying. I struggle with dark spots, and I used to use Pixi Beauty’s Glow Tonic with 5% glycolic acid and that made my skin so clear. I thought great another product that’s less than half the price with more of the active ingredient. Well I think it only did half its job and dried my skin out... I think you get what you pay for
