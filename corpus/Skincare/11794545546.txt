I have really oily skin and I just finished finished my old moisturizer and was looking for something new when I stumbled upon this product , it is a good moisturizer and also has a great lightweight water gel like consistency and did not leave my skin feeling greasy at all and actually gave my skin a nice glow my problem however is how small it is I finished this in about two months which is fast for me personally Iâ€™m hoping they make it in a bigger size great but small
