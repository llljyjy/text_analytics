As an esthetician I really love a good makeup brand that focuses on skincare and skin loving ingredients when developing their products. Kosas does a wonderful job at incorporating some amazing actives into their products so you get the instant gratification from the makeup side but the long term benefit of a skin care product. I really loved the plump and juicy buttery lip treatment. This product is like a cross between a balm and a gloss texture wise.  I like to use it at night before bed to wake up with super lush lips and I will even use this during the day if Iâ€™m not using another lip product or if my lips are in need of some tlc. A little bit goes a long way with this product! nan
