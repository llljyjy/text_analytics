I LOVE this product, I was definitely really impressed by the consistency of the cream and its light viscosity. I am used to heavier and denser creams, but I really like how light this Night Cream was, super easy to absorb into my skin and hydrating to the max. Very little scent, but still pleasant. Would definitely buy again once I run out! Super hydrating and light cream!
