I bought these to throw into my hospital bag before giving birth to my daughter recently. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily. Of course, it isn’t a perfect solution to not fully cleansing but my skin did well with them and they didn’t cause added redness. The scent is refreshing and I will definitely keep purchasing for those times I have to wait for a full wash but really need a quick cleanse. These are great!
