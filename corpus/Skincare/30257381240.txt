An inexpensive supplement to your face care routine. Overall I really liked this product. Super silky and applies nicely. Takes a little bit of time to absorb, leaving your face slightly tacky until then. I donâ€™t have any wrinkles to speak of, but my face does feel tighter. Especially around my eyes and lip area. I will definitely add this to my daily routine. Super Moisturizer
