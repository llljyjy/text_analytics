Iâ€™m not sure what I expected but I was underwhelmed. When I first opened it, oil came out. Then I tried to mix it up & it was so hard to get out of the container. When I finally got it out I felt like I had to use a handful to get it on my face? It also left an oily feel on my face. Overall will not repurchase. nan
