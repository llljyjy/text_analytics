I REALLY love the way this feels on my skin. And the glow? It’s real! I don’t have sensitive skin, but I do have dry, uneven skin tone, and discoloration due to sun damage. I got this in a Boxycharm and fell head over heels for this! I repurchased when I ran out because my skin started changing for the better. Well, I ran out again about 2 months ago and wanted to wait for the spring sale so I could buy two. My skin has missed this so much! Just got my package and I’m so excited to have it back in my life! I hope Glow Recipe never stops making this and leaves the formula as it is. Game changer for my 43 year old skin! If there is a negative, it would be that there isn’t a bigger bottle. Just ordered two more!
