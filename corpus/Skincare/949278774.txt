I got a sample of this and I was excited to try a new mineral sunscreen with spf 50. I’m glad it was just a free sample and I didn’t buy the product, because it pilled immediately and started rolling off my skin as I attempted to blend. I had nothing on my skin but a water-based vitamin c serum so I can’t imagine how badly this would pill on top of something that was silicone based! It’s shocking how poor quality this is, especially for the price. I love Hourglass’ VEIL mineral primer, and although it’s only spf 15, I will continue to use that as I have found no other mineral sunscreen with as wonderful a texture & application. PILLS horribly! :-( VERY poor quality!
