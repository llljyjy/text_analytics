I have very large pores and since i use self tanner they’re usually pretty visibly clogged. This product eliminated a good majority of them and for the really bad ones, this product brought the dirt closer to the surface so that it could be removed. Overall, i like the product. This product is especially useful since it says use 3-5 times a week. I am recently getting over being sick and have not been able to smell in about two weeks… i can smell this product.. it is reminiscent of a perm.. but in no way did it burn my face or even tingle. A nice product. 4 stars is fair since it didn’t completely wow me, but it was effective and worth the money. worth the money
