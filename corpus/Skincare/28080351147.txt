I was a bit worried this would be super rough on the skin but it’s the opposite! This is such a gentle exfoliant, it feels quite milky and smooth as I rub in into my skin. I didn’t see any redness calmed after the first use but I think with continued use I will see those benefits. My skin was left looking smooth and wasn’t stripped or dry! With it being a powder it isn’t messy or inconvenient and I don’t feel like it’s going to “go bad” like a liquid or cream can. Gifted by Sephora Gentle and easy to use
