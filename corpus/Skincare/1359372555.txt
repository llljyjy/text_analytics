I recommend this product for dry skin only. Definitely not meant to be layered with anything (makeup or other face products) due to the pilling. The only good thing about it is that it’s nice alone (moisturizer and serum in one), it doesn’t have a scent, and its moisturizing (I personally enjoy other products more and layering up for targeted needs so I wouldn’t purchase this) I’ll be trying body butter, that may be more practical. nan
