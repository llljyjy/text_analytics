Been using this product for a couple of days  and realized that it’s been causing very dry and red patches on my skin. I know that it was this product that was causing this because I stopped using it and the patches eventually went away. I figured I’d give it another shot after awhile but got the dry patches again, so I know for sure it was this. Plus didn’t really see any results that were advertised for this product when I would use this. Dry Patches
