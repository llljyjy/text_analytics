If you buy this thinking that it’s the same as the Salicylic acid serum from the ordinary, BE CAREFUL, it’s definitely NOT the same.  I was waiting anxiously for the revised version of their salicylic acid to return to shelves and I got this, thinking it was the same as the original (which I LOVED and was HG for me).  Three weeks later I’m still dealing with clogged pores and this product was the only new item that I introduced in my routine.  I think it was just entirely too oily for me and pitched it. Not the same as the original…
