I was really excited to receive Dr. Zenovia Skincare’s Clear Complexion Acne Solutions System for free to try because hormonal acne is really the only acne I deal with any more. Unfortunately this is very drying which isn’t great in the winter time. It also caused discoloration on my towels. Over all it reminded me a lot of Proactiv which I never found to be successful. I don’t see myself purchasing this but it might work for you! Just okay...
