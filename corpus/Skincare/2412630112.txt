I’ve been using this lip balm for years after a lot of trial and error with other brands. Fresh has recently changed the formula for this balm and it’s much, much drier than it used to be. It’s similar to the cheap $2 waxy chapstick that seemingly sucks the moisture out of your lips. They also removed the SPF, which is a bummer. Much worse than previous formula
