This is the first time I’ve tried an Estee Lauder moisturizer.  The consistency is nice and it moisturizes my dry skin quite well. However, I had to dock 2 stars because of the fragrance and issues with the SPF.First, I really don’t like the smell.  It’s very overpowering and it stays for hours. It’s kind of a musty floral scent.Second, the SPF makes my eyes sting.  I wouldn’t mind if there were enough SPF to actually do anyhing, but SPF 15 isn’t enough to truly protect your skin. All dermatologists say you need a minimum of 30.  So I still need to use a second sunscreen with this product.  Since that’s the case, I’d rather they remove the sunscreen and then it would be easier to wear around the eye area.I did receive this free of charge, and I would not buy this in the future. nan
