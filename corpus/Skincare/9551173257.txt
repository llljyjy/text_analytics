Well I’ll start it off by saying I did receive this item for free from Butterly in exchange for an honest review.I received enough samples for 7 days to try. I did really enjoy the product, but it did lacked in an important area for me. It went on very silky and didn’t leave an oily feeling on my face at all which was awesome. My skin did feel moisturized and like it had a glow to it. Unfortunately though, I didn’t notice a difference with the fine lines on my face which is huge to me being in my mid 30’s and starting to notice them a lot more. Also at the price point it is, I would not purchase it. If it had made a difference with my fine lines I think it could have been a good item to purchase but for me I needed to see more difference in my fine lines. @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Don’t mind it but don’t love it
