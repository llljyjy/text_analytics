I’ve been trying this eye cream for a while and I like it. It is a very rich and gel like cream that makes my under eye very hydrated and smooth. Works perfect under my makeup and my concealer looks great on top of it. I’ve noticed that I don’t get dry under my eyes anymore, I used to struggle with occasional flaky under eyes bit this is helping me a lot. Rich and creamy, good results
