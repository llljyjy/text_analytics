I’m already a big fan of Laneige as well as hyaluronic acid for my skin and this #freeproduct has me raving. It has a luxurious thicker consistency than I’m used to with HA so I feel like it bonds well with my skin and fully absorbs. I’ve used it both morning and night but I prefer a night time application as I notice the blurring of fine lines the most after sleeping with the cream. It has a VERY slight pleasant scent that is enjoyable and doesn’t irritate at all. What I love most is the coolness of the cream when applying. Tip: follow up with a jade roller for ultimate zen. #trywithtopbox La-La-LOVE Laneige!
