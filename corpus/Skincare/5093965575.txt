I wanted to love this! However the description of the product does not make it clear that their is physical exfoliators in this. After receiving the product I checked out glow recipes site to find it is blueberry seed powder. It’s 2022, stop physically exfoliating and damaging your skin barrier. This would be a GREAT product if it wasn’t for this unnecessary ingredient. Hope someday they formulate this without the physical exfoliator, however I am returning this. They should at least advertise the physical exfoliator beware this is a physical exfoliator
