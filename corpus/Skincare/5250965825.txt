Not a bad product but didnâ€™t work for my skin unfortunately. I have combination - normal skin with some dry patches. Felt very soft and moisturizing putting it on but turns out its too occlusive and heavy for my skin. I started noticing tiny bumps after about a week of use. It might work better for someone with drier skin! Sidenote regarding the reviews complaining its not filled fully; mine also had an air bubble on the side but when I tapped the jar on the counter to level it out, it had maybe a centimeter max of extra space on top. That seems reasonable to be able to still screw the lid on and comparable to other creams that come in a jar. Didn't work for my combination - normal skin
