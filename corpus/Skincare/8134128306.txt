I have sensitive skin. At first I kept it on for about 15 minutes which was a mistake. This is now my 3rd time applying it and I only leave it on for 5 minutes & I see a difference now. My pores are a lot smaller, my skin feels amazing, & it doesn’t cause me anymore redness if I only keep it on for 5 min. it does it’s job!
