I got this from Sephora as a mini in a set for my birthday. Itâ€™s a very heavy cream and actually shows a lot on the skin, like white. It turns to semi-solid pieces if you touch your skin at all. I could not recommend it. I tried it over my usual serums, over the vinoperfect serum, and on a clean face. Same problem all three times. I could not recommend this at all. Pass
