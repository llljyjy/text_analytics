I was sent this product free as a sampling promotion and I tried hard to give it a chance. It is super light/cloudy as described but it seemed to make my face have red spots and create blemishes. Maybe it’s the scent? I wasn’t in love with that either. Typically I use  No7 products and in this case I will stick with them. It was okay
