When I received this product free for testing purposes, I was very excited, as I like Drunk Elephant. They’re overpriced IMO, but their products are vegan, clean, and fragrance free which I like. I’ve tested this eye cream for 4 nights and each and every time, a little while after I put it on, I’d notice a burning sensation in my eyes... mainly when I started yawning (as it got closer to when I went to bed). The first one or two times I almost didn’t believe it was causing this. But after 4 times, there is no other conclusion I could come to! I like the texture of this eye cream and the packaging (purple is my favorite color). But that’s the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars. I can’t IMAGINE paying $60 for this overpriced eye cream. I have several eye creams I’m currently testing/using and not ONE of them causes my eyes to burn... ONLY this one. So sadly, I cannot recommend this product. The one thing I’ll say for them, is that they don’t even CLAIM that this eye cream will really DO anything BEYOND hydrating your under eye area, which ANY eye cream can do basically! They don’t make claims about dark circles, etc. So in a way they are HONEST about this product, yet... why pay $60 for it then? The packaging? The brand name? It just makes no sense! I hate to throw away this beautiful, expensive product, but I’m REALLY sick of the burning sensation it causes as soon as it migrates into my eye even in the slightest! For this kind of $$$, I truly expect better! An overpriced eye cream that burns!
