I received this Alegnist Genius toner gifted by Algenist. After applying it I really didn’t see the benefits of this product. It is to be used in the morning after cleansing your  face and provide daily exfoliation and smooth against post breakout marks, unfortunately mine are still visible. This is a skin smoothing, pore clarifying 2% BHA treatment toner which also helps to make unclog congested skin and removing oily buildup to leave supple, healthy looking skin. It is ideal for anyone experiencing hormonal skin concerns, I guess I just don’t have any. nan
