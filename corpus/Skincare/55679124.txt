I’m a huge Dermalogica fan! I was excited to receive this complimentary from Dermalogica because I’ve liked all of their eye treatments. This one has caffeine, so I did see an immediate improvement in firmness. So if puffy eyes are your problem, I recommend this one. The peptides are a huge plus for general anti-aging as well. However, for me, when the skin is tightened, my dark circles can become more prominent (I’ve noticed this with any eye gel or cream that has caffeine). So my personal favorite will continue to be their Total Eye Care (which is light and has a tint and SPF 15). I’m giving this 5 stars, because I think it does what it says it will do. It’s just not right for me. Perfect for puffy eyes
