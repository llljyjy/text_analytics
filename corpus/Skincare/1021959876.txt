I love Emerald so thought I’d give Orchid and Phoenix a try and found them both to be just okay.  There are SO many great facial oils on the market; if this one sounds like it’s up your alley, give it a try.  I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin, and while this didn’t make me react at all, I didn’t feel like it brought anything to the table for me either.  I much prefer Herbivore Emerald, YTTP Superberry Dream Oil, Dermalogica Phyto Replenish Oil or BioElements Dewluxe. It's just okay
