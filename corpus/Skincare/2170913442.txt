I really wanted to love this product but I don’t think it works well for my oily skin. After applying the mask, it leaves my skin feeling very oily. I try not to apply too much of it. I love the YTTP brand-they are committed to being cruelty free and I appreciate the glass containers. Definitely a big fan of this brand. I like that I was able to purchase the smaller size for this mask. I’m still using the rest of it in moderation, the only negative thing for me is the increased oiliness, which just doesn’t work for me but otherwise the mask seems to work well. Also, it smells good. nan
