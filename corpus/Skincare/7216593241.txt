I received a sample of this and that’s all it took for me to say this is a hard PASS. Initially, feels good on the skin. Within minutes, I have a rash that won’t go away for at least 24hrs. I naively tried this product twice and got the same result both times. How’s it supposed to tighten my neck if I can’t wear it for longer than 1 minute before having to wash it off? Don’t buy it
