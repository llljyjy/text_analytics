I have searched and searched and searched for a good cleanser, from clinique to sheamoisture, from bar cleansers to creams. This is the only one that leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh without drying it out. The fragrance is airy, sophisticated,and very natural (smells slightly herbal) and leaves my skin feeling glowy and soft. It comes off super easily and is hardly a two minute addition to my morning and night. I only need a pea sized amount for my whole face so although it is expensive upfront, it is worth it in the long run. It has also helped with my acne since it is not stripping for my skin. I will be repurchasing! Refreshing, natural, best face wash ever used!
