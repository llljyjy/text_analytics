Maybe it’s just my skin, but this isn’t moisturizing at all. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone even in the winter, and my eyelids and cheeks have been dry as heck even when I cake this on. I even use another moisturizer alongside it that has sunscreen in it. Save your money and go for a korean moisturizer instead. I wish I did. Not worth the money
