Sunscreen has become one of my favorite parts of skincare, and I was really excited when I heard Glow Recipe was coming out with this! Sadly I was quite disappointed...I have combo skin and found this was a bit too oily for me. By the end of the day my skin was SO shiny... It also pills so that and the shininess makes it hard to reapply as you’re supposed to. I would not recommend this product, as you can probably find something better for a better price. I’ll go back to my trusty Missha sun milk until there’s something else new to try! Wanted to love it
