I have been using this product for a few days now and so far I love it! My skins usually and has been dry this time of year (typically it’s more combination skin) and it’s a great moisturizer and leaves my skin with a nice glow. It has a rose scent to be expected. The moisturizer also absorbs into the skin nice and quickly! nan
