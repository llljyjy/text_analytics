I’ve been waiting for this product for so long (it wasn’t available in Canada). Unfortunately, I’m disappointed, I REALLY wanted to love this. It leaves a white cast on my skin (I have light skin, with yellow olive undertones) also, it’s feels drying (even though I used a moisturizer before)  The only thing I love is the scent, it smells so goodWill be returning white cast, drying
