Best retinol product ever! I love using these textured pads because it feels like you’re really getting all the benefits of the product. I used this in conjunction with the PTR serum and if I had to pick one this would be it. It’s gentle enough that even with dry sensitive winter skin I could use this every other day with no issues. I definitely noticed my fine lines seemed to blur and my skin texture was more even. love these!
