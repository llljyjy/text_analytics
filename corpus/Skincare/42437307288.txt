I really am loving this instant glow serum. I tried it out with my current skin care routine in the morning and at night before applying my makeup and it worked really well, my skin looked very supple and glowy. I have sensitive combination skin, more on the oily side and I was surprised that my skin didnâ€™t have a reaction to it. It has an easy to use applicator and the packing came very nice. I Will definitely be adding it to my regular skincare routine. In love with my glow!
