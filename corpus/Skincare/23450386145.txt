Iâ€™m on my 30s so I really really like this magic eye rescue cream.. you can feel and see that is really working when you use it is a thick cream and definitely will hydrate your skin without irritating. Is part of my night routine and help with my dark circles when I have bad nights. I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review A must- have in my routine
