Love the “non-clean” version of the grapefruit wipes, but they were out the last time I needed to restock. They still had the clean ones, so I bought those instead. How different could they be? VERY DIFFERENT!These wipes are horrible. The regular wipe has a soft, almost cloth feel and is almost dripping with the cleaning solution. The clean wipe is like a paper version of a potato sack material and feels almost dry. My face doesn’t feel clean after using like the regular wipes. I never used the exfoliating side of the regular wipes, but my daughter says the clean version doesn’t exfoliate at all. What’s the point of making a product “clean” if it’s ineffective? That isn’t clean, that’s a waste.Don’t waste your money. Go get the regular version of the wipes! nan
