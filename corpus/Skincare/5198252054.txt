After weeks of using this eye cream, I am pleased with it. It is very hydrating and leaves my skin nice and soft which allows my concealer nice and smooth as well. It also has helped eliminate make up creasing which is great. There is no scent that I notice but i feel like the packaging could be more friendlyâ€¦ its just so clunky and big especially to travel with. The immediate result I noticed was hydration and really the only result. But I still highly recommend just for the nice makeup barrier actions of it. Loved adding this morning and night!
