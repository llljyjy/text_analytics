Okay...I’ve pretty much tried everything and I have to say that in the two weeks that I have been using IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream, I have noticed several benefits! First, it leaves my face soft, smooth and never greasy (it absorbs really well). I’m in my 50’s and I can honestly say that my pores are smaller and the fine lines around my mouth/eyes and lines on my forehead are significantly less noticeable! One other thing is that I use it on my neck, and when smoothing it onto both neck/face, I use upward strokes (gravity pulls down, so I go upward). Even my neck looks amazing!!!I definitely plan to buy more of this product once I run out, it’s that good and would highly recommend to both friends and family! Confidence Is An Understatement!!!
