No… just no. Got this as a sample, tried it twice before i had to throw it out. I broke out after the first use, but gave it the benefit of the doubt cause i needed to clean my makeup tools. Well i cleaned them and tried again and more acne appeared, so guessing this was the culprit! Also the smell… if any of you have ever had a UTI and you’ve taken those nasty, bitter cranberry pills, then the smell is exactly how that tastes, i was actually gagging. The smell itself isn’t actually that strong but having that association just made it 10x worse. Definitely won’t be getting a full size. Gagging
