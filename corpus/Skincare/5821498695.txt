These taste really good but unfortunately I can’t continue to take them. Since using these I’ve noticed my skin is dry and flaky and my face feels raw. This has NEVER been an issue. I have dry combo skin but never had flaky skin every single day. I will say I see a slight glow on my face & body, but my side effects definitely outweigh that. My neck has been so itchy that it’s literally turning a darker shade in the spots that I can’t stop scratching. It’s the worst and the only thing that’s changed is this! I’ll continue to take the pre and probiotics but this? Hard pass! I can’t wait until it’s out of my system! flaky, raw skin
