I didn’t expect to like this product at all. It performs nicely enough. It hydrated my skin and the texture is nice for nighttime. When I woke up, my skin didn’t feel tight or dry. It didn’t break me out. However, the fragrance is so strong. I don’t like fragrance in my skincare at all, but this one was particularly offensive. It’s so strongly scented. It’s also exorbitantly priced. I have plenty of fragrance free moisturizers I love that come in at less than half the cost of this product. I can’t speak to long-term results as the sample I received was much too small to use for an extended period of time. I wouldn’t have used a full size anyway due to the fragrance. Too heavily fragranced
