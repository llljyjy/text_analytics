I received a small sample of this product for review. I have been enjoying this products. I am in my later 30s with dry skin and a few wrinkles, the most prominent being a frown line parallel to my nose between my eye area. I have been using this product for a few days both morning and night. I feel the product is a bit thicker than a general moisturizer, yet not heavy. It does sit on top of the skin for a minute then seems to sink in. After it has been sitting on the skin the skin feels soft to the touch but does have it very minimally slight stickiness similar to wearing a lightweight primer without foundation. I did notice this morning that my frown line seemed slightly less prominent than usual. I didnâ€™t realize that this product was good for lines, and I feel like it is doing the most work on my face on my troubles spots. This product is nearly unscented, I have noticed a very faint clean scent, and it does not seem to cause irritation. My sample is very small, and I am considering buying the full size, as this is a product that seems to do what it says it will. Would love to try it out for a longer period of time. nan
