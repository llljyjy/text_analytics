WOW! This stuff really works. I have some pimples and redness as well as dark spots around my face and also have very sensitive skin. With the first few uses I could already see lightening color and fading pimples. Also, I can confirm that at least for me I can use this as often as 2 times a day with sensitive skin and it does not irritate me at all. The only downside is the side-to-price ratio; it is pretty small. Really Really Works
