Kiehl’s ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream worked well on my dry skin. It’s thick so a small amount goes a long way. You may need to find the right amount for your skincare needs. I loved that it absorbed well and didn’t leave my face tacky or sticky. It also didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I use the product twice daily morning and evening. It worked well with my existing skincare products. I didn’t have any adverse reactions or interactions. Overall the product has given my skin added hydration and didn’t cause breakouts. My face feels more hydrated and smoother. Added hydration
