I have been using this for a few weeks now on and off, I must say I enjoy using it, I have dry skin and this is one of the products that doesn’t dry my skin out (which can be hard to find) when I add it to my skin care routine. It is also very soothing to my skin when applied which I really like. But I believe one may only be able to see a noticeable change in terms of fading hyperpigmentation if used for at least a few months. And of course you get your buck’s worth. Decent Product! :)
