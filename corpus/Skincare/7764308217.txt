This made me look like a zombie. I’m pale already but this took it to a whole new level. And my wasn’t just pale it was a sickly pale like I was days from death. It highlight all my blue veins, and dry patches. It also peeled on my face. It didn’t manage to protect my skin from the sun on the beach but it wasn’t worth it. only buy this at Halloween
