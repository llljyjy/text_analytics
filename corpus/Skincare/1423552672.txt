We’ve all struggled with greasy, non-evenly spreading typical sunscreen, but this product is different. I received this product complimentary for testing from influenster and fell in love. It spreads evenly, is light weight, and the scent is more skincare vs sunscreen. It hasn’t made my sensitive skin break out which happens every time I wear typical sunscreens. This product checks all of the boxes for me. Not your typical sunscreen
