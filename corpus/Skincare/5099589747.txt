I am very pleased with the performance of this retinol serum. Absorbs quickly without a tacky residue. I use at night and  wear SPF during the day so the results I achieved will not be diminished. My skin looks visibly brighter and more supple. I had the adverse reaction and it was quite gentle on my skin Hydrating & Smooths
