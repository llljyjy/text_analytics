I have combination skin and this cleanser worked well as a makeup removing balm and typical cleanser. It foams so you can only use a little when washing your face. I think for the price point and how big the bottle is, itâ€™s actually a good value. Gifted by InnBeauty in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
