I really love this Fenty Skin Fat Water. It is very hydrating for my super dry skin. The toner has a very nice milky consistency. I just use my fingers to apply a few drops of product to my face before rubbing it all in. Itâ€™s not like other toners that dry out your skin. Instead it is very calming. I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry or sensitive skin. It can work for anyone with large pores too as I have noticed a difference in my pore size. My pores on my cheeks are very noticeable usually but with using this for a week, they are barely even there. It is made with clean ingredients and there is not a strong over bearing scent that makes me feel sick when using it. I absolutely love this product and will buy more when I run out. Love Love Love
