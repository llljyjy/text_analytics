So smooth. Smells so good. Covers all the bases with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, ceramides, kelp, and more!! Absorbs pretty quickly. Works under makeup during the day or as the serum in my nightly skincare routine. I wanted to mention also that the glass bottle packaging is really nice. Would make an excellent gift too. smells good, applies soft on skin, absorbs quickly
