Very gentle cleanser that also adds moisture. I love the cooling sensation when it’s applied and the microbeads that gently exfoliate. It’s a good everyday cleanser, but doesn’t remove eye makeup well. So I like using this in the mornings, or evenings after a makeup removing cleanser. Gentle cleanser that feels nice on the skin
