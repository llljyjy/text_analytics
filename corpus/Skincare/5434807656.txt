I can actually feel it work right after applying but don’t expect major results. My skin will get this sort of tension almost like it’s stuck, but not in a bad or painful way. It will take a tiny bit more effort to fully raise my eyebrows or crinkle my eyes right after. That makes me think the peptides are doing their job! But as someone who has had Botox before, it does not compare at all. This will lessen facial movement a tiiiny bit and maybe prevent/reduce a tiiiny bit over time but I didn’t notice anything...well noticeable as far as looks go. Perhaps it’s preventing some lines for me. But it’s easy to apply, long lasting, no scent, goes fine under other skin care and makeup etc. I probably won’t repurchase but I did enjoy the product. No major changes but n terrible. Felt it work some
