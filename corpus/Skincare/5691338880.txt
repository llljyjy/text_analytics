Love this product.  My skin was dry, dull and uneven from lack of sleep and cold weather. I was impressed to see improvement after just one use. It’s light weight, absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily. I have really sensitive skin and have had nothing but good things to say for this serum, other than the cost.  The small bottle doesn’t last long for the price when using 1-2 pumps daily.  If it wasn’t for the cost,  I’d add it to my permanent routine. Amazing product
