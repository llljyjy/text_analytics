A decent moisturizer for regular skin.  I have combo skin and live in a busy large city, my skin is somewhat dry but pretty problematic. This didn’t cause any breakouts but it also wasn’t above average. It’s a good quality clean feeling light weight oil free option. I would recommend it for regular skin I would use it again but as far as purchasing it, there are other options that i prefer. That being said, i don’t have any negative comments. Thanks clinique and influenster for sending me the sample to review ! Influenster Review...
