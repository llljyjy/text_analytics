Ok I want to give this serum a fair shot and this review might be pre mature because I’ve been using this for a bout a month in rotation with my retinol serum. What I can’t stand about this product is the smell…. I dread opening the tube because it always spills out so much right away. The smell on my face is so pungent and unpleasant. I’m trying to power through the awful scent and hoping for some miracle results. So far I can see a slow improvement. Just not sure if there is a better smelling product out there with the same results. nan
