Very confused why this product is so highly reviewed. I have tried many under eye creams, and this is maybe the worst one yet? The simple need for this to be absorbed into the skin, doesnâ€™t even happen for me? It just sits on my skin, white, and heavy. Does really nothing for me. So bad I needed to write a review.
