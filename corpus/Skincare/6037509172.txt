The product appears to be good doesn’t peel white like other sunscreens, but don’t think I’ll be buying again. The packaging is cute which is what made me choose it over other brands, but man does it suck I don’t even want to reach for it anymore every time I hold it my hands end up so flaky from the bottle’s coating I have to hold the bottle w a baby wipe now so it doesn’t end up all over my face. nan
