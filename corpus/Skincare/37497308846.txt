I have been using this product now for about a week and a half. I love the smell compare to other vitamin c serums and it hasnâ€™t broke my skin out. I use it right after I wash. My face feels fresh and clean. Also, I have notice my scars have decreased as well. Definitely recommend. Added to morning routine
