This was the most average mud exfoliating mask I’ve ever used.  It isn’t a bad mask, but at 70 dollars I expected a bit better.  Applies and rinsed off after about 4 minutes.  Did absorb extra oil which was nice.  Did a bit of surface level exfoliation which was nice.  The scent is light which is nice. Average mask, High Price Tag
