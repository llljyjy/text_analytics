I bought this on a chance after reading about using BHA to help with Keratosis Pilaris (aka chicken skin). The bumps and redness were so bad i was too embarrassed to wear anything but long sleeves to hide it. I used this twice a day and after 2 days of using it my skin has never looked or felt better! Iâ€™ve used so many products and seen multiple dermatologists and this was truely the first thing that ever helped me. I still have some redness and bumping, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I went from a 10 to a 4! Only down side is by the 4th day of using it twice a day my skin started to peel slightly so I reduced it to once a day and moisturizing a bit more and its been fine since. Absolutely in love with this product! Highly recommend for KP
