I have only used this a week, but the results are phenomenal. Iâ€™m 36, female, and have few wrinkles to begin with. But I have a problem area in between my brows and smile lines. The winter makes them even more pronounced. I have dry skin and get patches of eczema in the winter too. This cream has made a drastic noticable effect on those lines and my overall skin appearance. It plumped them up to be practically unnoticeable. I just tried a small sample, but I will be buying a full size of this product. Made frown lines and smile lines less noticeable
