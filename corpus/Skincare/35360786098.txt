I’ve been using this every other night, sometimes back to back nights, for nearly two months now. I’d say it’s improved my skin marginally. After using, it feels a bit tacky even under my moisturizer. The packaging is a little wonky and it arrived with the box soaked in some of the product. I thought it was just from being shaken around during shipping but then of course some product also drips out when I’m putting it on a cotton pad. Just beware of that. nan
