Caudalie eye cream is now my new favorite. It does not have a scent to it. I like that it targets fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet and dark circles. I used it around my lips too. It has a silky feel to it. This is the  only product I have seen that has 8 benefits. I have already recommended it to my friends and family members. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Eye Cream!
