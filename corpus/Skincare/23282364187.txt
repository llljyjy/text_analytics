The product packaging is lovely. Nice heavy glass jar and good seal on lid. As for the product cream it is a little too thick and sticky. You need quite a bit each application as it does not spread well and the smell is not appealing. Est√©e Lauder always has quality items it just that this product was not for me. nan
