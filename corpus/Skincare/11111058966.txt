Whitecast be gone! A sunscreen that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and is light enough for every day use and can be worn under/over makeup. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because the brand claims to be reef-safe, but the first two ingredients are Octinoxate and Octocrylene, which are known to harm marine life (source: NOAA). nan
