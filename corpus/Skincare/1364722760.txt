I was SO excited to try this when I got a sample in the Sun Safety Sephora release this summer.  I wonâ€™t be buying the full size- it pilled no matter what I did.  Even when applied to a completely clean face!  I also felt like it left way more white cast on my skin than I usually notice because I have pretty light skin. So disappointed- pills no matter what I do
