I was gifted this product by the brand to try out, and honestly was SO excited because I had been using products like this for a long time already!! One thing Iâ€™ve noticed about this in comparison ti other brands is how thick it is, it really sticks onto the face and encapsulates the problem area very well. My sister in particular has very painful acne, and she has been using this to absorb the pus/liquid out of her skin with minimal pain, which has worked well for her, but the application can be kinda painful due to the thickness. Although I was gifted this, I actually have been buying this product for years and am pleased with it! Pretty good staple, thick, can be painful though
