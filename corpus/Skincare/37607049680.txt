I was able to try out this product from influenster for my honest review. I incorporated it into my daily skin care routine for 2 weeks. The texture is not greasy or super runny and I found that to be a plus. I did notice my skin being less dry as well and n those two weeks. The only thing I must say is that there is a light scent to it that can sometimes be overwhelming to those that have sensitive eyes or allergies (even when not applying near the eyes). Over all not a bad product ! Would recommend to others. nan
