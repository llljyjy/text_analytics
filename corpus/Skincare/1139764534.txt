I’ve used this consistently all around around my eyes, focusing on my eyelids and above, for a solid four years. I’ve seen a real reduction in the crepiness of my eyelids. It did take a couple weeks for my skin to adjust but I no longer have any sensitivity. Overall, I’ve been really happy with it. Until the recent change from glass to plastic packaging. Not only did the container change, it’s now a much larger bottle that contains the exact same amount of product. Why?? The plastic bottle isn’t even coded so I have no idea if it’s even recyclable.  For the change to plastic alone I doubt I’ll ever purchase this again. For that I’m taking away the stars. nan
