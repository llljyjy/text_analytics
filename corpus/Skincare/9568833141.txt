I received this cream free from Estée Lauder and influenster free for my honest opinion. Estée Lauder is one of my favorite time tested brands and this cream delivers just like all their other products that I have tried. It is a lightweight beautiful texture that instantly seeped into my skin and didn’t leave any sticky residue like a lot of other creams do. My skin instantly looked refreshed and dewy after just one use. I didn’t notice a firming effect as it says the cream does but I am hoping with prolonged use that that will eventually happen.  The only downside to this cream is the $89 price tag. I really loved this sample but don’t know if I can justify spending $89 on it. If you don’t mind that price tag then I would highly recommend this cream. Fantastic Face Cream
