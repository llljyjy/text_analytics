So good, this was so surprisingly thin and lightweight based on the cream. Description I expected something much thicker but this was very light and almost liquid. It smoothed on very nice and absorbed well. Very moisturize without leaving a film or greasy layer like a thicker cream. I am very acne prone and had no issues with this breaking me out. I will definitely buy a replacement when this runs out it is expensive but worth it and goes a long way! A must have
