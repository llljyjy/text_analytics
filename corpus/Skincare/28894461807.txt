I received this product free from pinch me for my honest review. I used the ilia C beyond triple serum SPF 40 and i must say it blended well with my complexion but it was  tricky to apply . you really  have to follow the directions for it to spread well.Honestly I won’t be  repurchasing when this runs out. it’s not worth in my opinion. nan
