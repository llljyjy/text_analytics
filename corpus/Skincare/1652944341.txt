I had a small surgery on my eye and my surgeon recommended using this on the scar to help. It was amazing. It really did help and you can’t even see where the cut was made. I now use it on areas that are from acne scars and they’ve improved dramatically. It was expensive but so worth it! Perfect for scars and healing
