This product nourishes my under eye area, however is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation using this product. My dark circles are still present unfortunately, but I have not been using for very long. I love the cool-feeling metal applicator. A little goes a long way so I feel like it will last a long time. Iâ€™ll have a better feel of the product after using for a month or so. So far, so good! Nourishing under eye serum
