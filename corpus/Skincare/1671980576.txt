I received this product complimentary from the brand. The product has an ok scent and slightly thick consistency, but goes on my skin very lightly. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy and it blends well. I was surprised that it did not irritate my skin in any way and it was a very gentle product. I used it for a week and I did not notice any changes good or bad to my skin, but sense it was so gentle I will continue to use up this tube and maybe I will see an improvement in my skin as I continue to use this product at night. No change
