Tried the Dr. Zenovia Skincare set for a about a month, and it was great. It cleanses the skin well, reduces any acne, and moisturizes the skin. I noticed that I didnâ€™t breakout while using this set periodically which surprise me. My face looks more healthier and more hydrated. It does not cause much dryness or irritation. nan
