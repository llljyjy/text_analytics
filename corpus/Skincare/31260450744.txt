Have been trying this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth for around 2 weeks and so far so good. This product is great for oily or combination skin as it goes on very lightly and does not tend to be thick like most of their products. If you are just starting to use retinoid, I recommend using another thick cream underneath. So far no irritation for me but have yet to see much change since my skin is still getting use to this dosage. It does do a good job keep the skin from overly oily nan
