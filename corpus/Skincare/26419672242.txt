I was lucky enough to have been given a sample of the Clinique Smart Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream and I have to say, I really love this eye cream. It’s creamy and full of lipids without being greasy and heavy. It’s nourishing without being greasy and sitting on the skin for waiting to be absorbed. The hydration is really good. My tired eyes said thank you and my makeup routine seems to be a bit easier now that there is no puffiness yet also there us a slight fine line reduction. It may be too soon to tell, but I think this eye cream may be helping a lot more than hoped! I may just keep using it for good. Try it, your hope may be in a little jar that says Clinique.
