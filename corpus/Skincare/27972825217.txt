If you are like me. I only use 100% Mineral Sunscreen, No Silicons. Non-comeodegenic. This feels like an expensive lotion but somehow goes on thinner. I do see a cast on my face but that is normal with mineral. My skin is acne-prone and dry and difficult ... and this has worked so far. This might be for you ...
