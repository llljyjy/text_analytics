I canâ€™t comment on the effectiveness of this product, because my skin was just too sensitive to use it. I bought it because it boasts being a very low, tolerable percentage of Niacinamide and started using it only in the evenings. But by the 3rd day, my skin was feeling very dry and uncomfortable, and I was starting to break out. Might have been the active ingredients, or perhaps the fragrance... just want to throw this out there for anyone who may also have hypersensitive skin. nan
