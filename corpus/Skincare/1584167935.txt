Muradâ€™s eye patches are much longer in size than average eye patches. These patches have a lot of liquid both on them and in the packaging. I did not experience any skin irritation while wearing the patches which I was worried about since it has retinol ingredients. My eyes felt very hydrated and the added dose of skin care ingredients over time will help my under eye area. Extra Juicy Eye Patches!
