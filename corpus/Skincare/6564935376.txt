This creme is quite luxurious!! I was gifted a sample sized jar courtesy of Influenster & Estee Lauder--this has been such a treat to use! I tap a pea sized amount around my face and have noticed the moisturizing effects very fast! The creme is thick without being gummy, hydrating without being overly greasy, it smells heavenly like a luxurious creme should smell AND it absorbs nicely into the skin giving me such a glorious glow. I dare to even say that I love this stuff! An excellent beauty creme that lives up to such a brand name. Luxury in a jar
