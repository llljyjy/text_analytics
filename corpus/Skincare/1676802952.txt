This watery oil serum looks and feels amazing! It’s not the luxurious packaging that made me say it, it truly is a really great product! First and foremost, I will say it’s a bit heavily fragrant (almost perfume-like), the scent doesn’t linger too long, it actually goes away as soon as it’s applied to the skin. But if you’re sensitive to scent or simply not a huge fan of strong fragrances - think twice or grab a sample and test it out yourself. Otherwise, this watery oil has a really nice lightweight water consistency, almost like a watery serum, there’s practically no oil texture to it. It also has microbeads that melt as soon as it warms up between the palms of the hands before applying. It absorbs right into the skin, leaving the skin feeling hydrated, smooth and plumped. I apply this watery oil right before my serums and moisturizer and it provides that radiant glow. Overall, the Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil is a wonderful facial product. It’s definitely not a must buy but if you want to splurge on a skincare item and have no issues with it being heavily fragrant, this is one to try! nan
