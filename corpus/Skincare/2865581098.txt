Coming back for my third one of these so figured I’d write a review. I’ve tried tons of moisturizers over the years seeking something that hydrates but doesn’t break me out or cause redness, as I have sensitive combo skin that’s prone to dry patches, cystic acne and red bumps with many common skincare ingredients. This works and is such a great value. I travel a lot for work and I appreciate that it’s small enough for carry-on luggage. Great product
