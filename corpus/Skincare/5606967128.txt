Really great and moisturizing. I have very crusty/chapped lips and this will keep them soft all day without having to use a chapstick throughout the day. I used this product while skiing as well as a day time treatment and it worked amazing. Didn’t have to use chapstick once. Only con I have is that it doesn’t seem to have long term effects, basically you have to use it everyday to see the results but if you skip one day then you have crusty lips again. I would repurchase when this runs out but in the winter works well but results don’t last more than a day
