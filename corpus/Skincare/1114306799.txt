Great product, awkward packaging. I got a free sample of the Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum from BzzAgent and used it nightly for 3 weeks. I was familiar with  (and love) the Kiel’s brand as a whole. so was excited to try this. I had great results, and saw diminished deep and small wrinkles on my forehead over the 3 weeks. However, the way this product is put together is really strange and I felt I wasted a lot of the retinol that I was supposed to add to the serum. This is the only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars. I wish I could share more than 2 photos so I could show this. Visible Results! Great product, weird packaging.
