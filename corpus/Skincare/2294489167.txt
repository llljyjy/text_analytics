The product packaging is simply luxurious. Thebottle is glass and feels weighted like a perfumebottle. While applying this product youâ€™lldefinitely feel fancy and luxurious. However, myproblem with this product is the ingredients. Ibelieve that Shiseido had a great vision whilecreating this product and it could have been agreat product if they simply had not included afew ingredients. This product was notformulated for people who have dry or sensitiveskin. If you look at the ingredients, alcohol islisted as the second ingredient after water.When you apply this product, the serum isinitially smooth and hydrating. However, afterwearing it for 20 minutes your skin will feeldehydrated because of the alcohol so overtimethis product will not really leave your skinhydrated. The skin tightening effect that thisproduct claims might even be due to the dryingeffects of alcohol. The product has a beautifulfragrance but the issue is that it has addedfragrance at all. If you look at the ingredientslist, fragrance is actually higher on the list thanany of the good ingredients that you want foryour skin. This product will not work for peoplewho have extremely dry or sensitive skin suchas myself. Overall, I feel that this could havebeen a great product and I hope that Shiseidoconsiders re-formulating the serum to notinclude alcohol or fragrance. Wish I loved it
