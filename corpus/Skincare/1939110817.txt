Keeping in mind retinol dries up the skin, this product has dried up my skin more than others. I’ve had to stip using it for a while. The consistency is ok and absorbs rather quickly so I think I may not be using it effectively and wasting a bit of product. The bottle is big and is a nuisance since I travel a lot. Overall does its job but will try Pharmacy retinol next time to compare. If you’ve never used retinol or have used a lower percentage, take it slow and use once or twice a week at the beginning. Can be very irritating Just ok
