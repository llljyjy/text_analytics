I test every new product by only putting it on half my face. Put it on at night, woke up the next morning with 6 pimples. I never break out, it’s been so long! Now I have 2 really stubborn pimples that just won’t go away, ugh!! I’ve been using the Paula’s choice azealic which works great but is way too expensive. Maybe it works for others but If you’re break out prone at all- avoid!!! Sometimes I’ll get one or 2 pimples from a new product but this was extreme!! INSTANTLY made me break out!!
