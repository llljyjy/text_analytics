I am a fan of Clinique products and this product gives me another reason to be loyal to this brand. I have combination skin and this moisturizer makes my skin feel supple and so not greasy. Love that it is not loaded with a strong smell. Instead it is full of clean ingredients which make my skin happy for a good amount of time. Holy mother of moisturizers
