I got this in a Sephora Favorites bundle so I could try out a bunch of different moisturizers. I left it to try last because it was the least appealing to me. At the same time I got the tatcha birthday gift.Literally none of the moisturizers in the pack OR the tatcha dewy skin cream did anything for me except for this one. my skin has been extremely flakey and dry. This cream has actually moisturized my skin where all the others failed. Then I come on here to find out itâ€™s refillable ?!?! SOLD Only effective moisturizer for my skin
