I have annoying skin. Super dry and dehydrated in the winter. I am 35 and for no lie over the past five years have been going through several different moisturizers (yes, using it long enough to know the results aren’t for my skin type). My skin needs enough moisture so that it doesn’t physically look dry and feel tight and not too much that my makeup is melting off my face as the day goes on. This stuff is AMAZING for me. I use two pumps in the winter and one in the summer and it’s just the right amount. I have been using it for about a year now and will not stray! Haven't stopped using it since day one!
