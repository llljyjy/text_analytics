I have to say I’m really liking this product line. I’ve been using the product for just over a month now. The product goes on easily and does not leave any heavy residue behind. I’m sharing before and after photos for your own review and decision making. The closer picture is the after using for a month. I personally can’t say whether I really see a difference.  I can say that whether it’s working or not or if it’s been long enough using to notice,  I do love the products.  Applying them makes me feel pampered and want to try additional products, specifically their eye cream. I will say this product has no scent so I’d assume it’s safe for those with sensitive sense of smell. I also let my daughter try it one night. She has sensitive skin and has absolutely no reaction to the products. I definitely recommend the products if you want to feel pampered, or at least one of their spas where you can actually get pampered with the products. But these products are quite expensive so keep that in mind. Another plus is their customer service. I reached out to them because I wanted to know their policy for handling situations where the pipette breaks inside the product bottle as both the bottle and the pipette are made of glass. I definitely did not expect the response I got but they were awesome and if you ever have an issue I recommend contacting them. Feeling Pampered
