I’m 43  have very sensitive skin and a damaged skin barrier after a microneedling session at a medispa that left me with a skin infection, and then being diagnosed with an overactive thyroid node. To help recover and combat the otherworldly dryness, I now use Skinmedica’s HA5 and layer this on tope of it at night. I no longer have to keep layering things throughout the day to keep my skin from looking crepey. My skin looks nicer again when I wake up in the morning. I’m very impressed. I’ve tried so many products over the past 9 months and nothing has compared to this combination. It balm isn’t heavy, or overly oily. It’s a jelly that melts on your fingers as you massage it into your skin. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and absorbes very quickly.  I am SO grateful I found this. My skin texture is noticeably better. Big fan. Incredible for 40+ Dry, Crepey or Damaged Skin
