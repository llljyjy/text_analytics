I couldn’t believe the price on this product. It’s very concentrated and a little goes a long way. It has a pretty strong rose scent if that’s not something you’re a fan of. My face feels supple and moisturized after using it. I have had a recent breakout and not sure if this is the cause. I’ll definitely finish the jar but can’t see myself repurchasing it. nan
