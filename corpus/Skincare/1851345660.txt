The perfect SPF BB Cream! It comes in a nice pump container. The texture is creamy with a light pleasant scent. It blends very evenly and provides nice coverage for being a BB cream. I love how it left my face with a nice dewy glow and did not leave a sticky or tacky feeling on my skin. The SPF 40 is a true bonus for how great this product is! The perfect SPF BB Cream
