There’s just something special about La Mer skincare, and this new serum is nothing short of anti-aging amazingness.Highly recommend for this looking to naturally slow down the aging process.  I cleanse my skin thoroughly, pat dry, and then pat on the La Mer Treatment Lotion.  The texture is very smooth, non-greasy and very hydrating.  Perfect for all skin types.Although this Treatment Lotion comes with a heavy price tag, it’s totally worth the price in my opinion.  I saw results in less than two weeks with consistent use twice daily after cleansing my skin. Anti-aging Savior
