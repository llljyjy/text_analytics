#freeproduct First off, I want to state that I love this brand, Caudalie. I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest opinion. This cashmere day moisturizer is part of their resveratrol - lift collection which features a patented formula containing hyaluronic acid, resveratrol, and vegan collagen alternative, claiming to visibly firm skin. It is true to its name and feels like cashmere on the skin. The texture is so smooth and soft. This moisturizer is also very gentle, suitable for sensitive skin, no burning or stinging. I don’t find the scent terribly pleasant, especially when combined with the cream, it lingers for an hour after application. It is a light-weight cream, so it is easy to spread onto the face, but at the same time, I do not think this will be hydrating enough for those with dry skin. I have combination skin and this is hydrates skin just enough for the day time, but not enough for night time. This moisturizer leaves a slight sheen on the skin, and does get oily at the end of the day. And like the serum, it leaves skin soft and moisturized. However, I do not notice this diminishing my smile lines. Also wish it came in a pump packaging instead of jar packaging so don’t have to dip fingers in. Would recommend this moisturizer if you’re in the market for a silky smooth, light-weight moisturizer with anti-aging ingredients, but I wasn’t wowed by it, especially for this price, so will not be repurchasing.
