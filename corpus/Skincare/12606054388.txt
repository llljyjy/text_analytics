When I first got this product I was a bit skeptical because itâ€™s not a lotion but rather an oil the same consistency as a toner. I was scared that it would make my face feel greasy or grimy. Instead, I feel like my skin is healthier, more supple, and way more hydrated! Also, a little product goes a looong way which means I will not have to buy a refill anytime soon. nan
