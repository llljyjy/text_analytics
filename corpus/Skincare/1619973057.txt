I was skeptical of this product bc I’m 40 something with natural red hair and the finicky, fussy, sensitive skin that goes with that! I’m pretty set in my ways once I find a product that works. I decided to give it a try and braced myself for the fall out- but to my surprise my skin felt clean but not stripped! The next morning it wasn’t as dried out as usual, felt like the moisture barrier was intact and even slightly improved! A little goes a long way but it foams up nicely and removes makeup while feeling like it also leaves skin dewy. The smell is a bit strong and perfumery for my taste but it wears off soon enough. nan
