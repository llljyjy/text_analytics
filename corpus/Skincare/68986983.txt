I received this for free from Influenster for an honest review. I have purchased this before on my own, and I would buy it again. It’s thick but it’s light because it’s whipped, if that makes any sense. It’s very moisturizing but gentle. There is no scent. I have combination skin that gets pretty dry. This can be worn under makeup as it helps with dry patches. I think it would be ok for sensitive skin as well. nan
