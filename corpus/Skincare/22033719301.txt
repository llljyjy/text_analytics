I have received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. I have been applying Wake Up Honey eye cream at night so it would absorb the product. I apply on my under eye and eyelid a bit and it is very hydrating. I have been using it for a week and it has brightened a bit my under eye area. The texture is a bit thick so you only need very little cream. nan
