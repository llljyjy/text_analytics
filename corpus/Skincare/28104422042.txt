When I first started using this product I didn’t like the texture too much as it was a bit thick for me. After using it every day I got use to it and I didn’t mind it so much after all as it’s easy to spread. I like how moisture my skin feels when I apply it and how bright it gets. I didn’t notice a huge difference on my wrinkles though but I have only used it for 2 weeks so maybe I need to persevere more nan
