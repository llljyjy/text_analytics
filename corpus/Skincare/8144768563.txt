In received this complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This eye cream is fine. I really did not notice any significant changes in my eye area since using it. Didn’t do anything for dark circles or fine lines. It did keep my eye area hydrated, but that’s what every eye cream does, and you can find them at a much lower price. This stuff stings my eyes in the way that sunscreen does, which is not good for an eye cream. Overall I found this product to be lackluster. It’s fine.
