I have used this serum 4 times now so I canâ€™t speak to long term benefits. However, I did notice several immediate benefits. I had previously been using a high-end retinol serum, so I was surprised to see any immediate effects. My skin was brighter and smoother. I also noticed less skin congestion. It is a very light weight serum and absorbs quickly. There is a slight orange cast but it does away quickly. I have very sensitive skin and this serum did not irritate it whatsoever! I cannot wait to see what kind of long-term effects this has! Finally My Holy Grail!
