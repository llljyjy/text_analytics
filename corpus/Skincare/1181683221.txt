I’m a low-maintenance gal and don’t wear a lot of make up daily. I was looking for something with some SPF that would do for an every day basis for video calls. A friend recommended this and I’ve been using it for a week now. I really like it. You don’t need a whole lot to really even out your skin tone and create a glowy overall look. It does take a minute or two to set/dry on my face. I’m definitely going to continue using it. Nice, even, glowy look
