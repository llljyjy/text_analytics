My skin type is combination dehydrated, my concern is fine lines and dryness, I like this cream because it is very moisturizing, the texture is light and with a very little amount it is more than enough, after after using it my skin feels well hydrated but at first I didnâ€™t notice any difference in my fine lines but with time of using it I have noticed a decrease in fine lines, highly recommended . very moisturizing
