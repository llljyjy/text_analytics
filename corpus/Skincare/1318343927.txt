While I liked it as a first step because it smells great, feels so creamy, and does cleanse, I would not buy this again. Iâ€™ve had a sample from one of the sets and it separated after a while. I also feel like I need to double cleanse with something else every time I use this. It does work well with my very dry skin. First photo (white top) is my before. Second photo (black top) is after immediate use. good for some, not for me
