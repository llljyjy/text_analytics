I have combination skin, I’m oily in my t-zone and dry everywhere else on my face. This is hands down one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever tried. A little bit goes a long way, which is why I think the price is worth it because it lasts such a long time. It feels very hydrating on the skin and the scent is not strong. Will definitely be re-purchasing over and over. Must have!
