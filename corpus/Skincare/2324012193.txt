Since using this product I have not gotten a single case of cystic acne on my chin. I’ve gotten minor and very small pin sized spots here and there, but I attributed it to purging. It’s better than my tretinoin ok? That’s a big deal. I’ll still use tret for wrinkle use but I’ll never stop using this toner to keep acne at bay. I used to suffer from cystic acne on my chin, and they were painful/large spots. Hiding them with makeup was so difficult. If you’ve been sitting on this purchase GET IT ASAP. The only regret I have is waiting so long to purchase it. Definitely will be trying other Paula’s choice products Worthy of the hype
