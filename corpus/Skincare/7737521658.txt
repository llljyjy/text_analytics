I love it! My skin loves it. My skin is normal to dry, I’m 49, and I have a moisturizer my skin loves. It doesn’t have hyaluronic acid, but my skin has always responded well to that ingredient, too, so I wanted to try this. In the past I’ve used Olay’s serum as well as various masks. This is like Olay but maybe a little thicker. I apply a few drops to my forehead, cheeks, and temples and then immediately apply my moisturizer. Basically I’m adding the hyaluronic acid to the moisturizer and massaging it in. And my skin loves it. It’s soft, smoother, in general more moisturized. Wouldn’t go without it!
