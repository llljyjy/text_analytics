I got this product as a sample size since I wanted to try out other serums (so far I have only used the inkey one, doesn’t really have any problems) to see if something out there works better. I already use some products from Farmacy so I gave this one a try. It works, and I can tell that there is a noticable plumping effect and my skin definitely looks hydrating from using it. I used it right after cleansing my face, when it was still slightly damp to soak in everything. The reason why I gave it 3 stars and I also would not purchase again, is just because of the smell. I don’t know why it smells so bad compared to other Farmacy products like the honeymoon glow serum, but I just cannot stand the smell. If you are able to get over the smell, I would recommend, otherwise don’t get it. Works but smells really bad
