I got this free from #influenster in exchange for my honest review I was so excited when I got this. It was first off a much larger bottle than I was expecting. It has a light floral aroma- reminds me of when my peony’s arrived in bloom.  A little goes a long way. It lathers up really nicely and washes off really clean. I didn’t feel any residue after using just my hands and water to wash it off. My skin is felt feeling so clean and soft. Overall wonderful product that I would not have tried myself. I only give 4 stars since I got a little close to my eyes and the smell - though wonderful- was a little strong when it was close to my eyes and my eyes watered a bit A splurge
