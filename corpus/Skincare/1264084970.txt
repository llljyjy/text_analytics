I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.The pros of this cleanser are that it lathers up well and does a decent job removing makeup and oil. the packaging is sleek and you get a decent amount, and don’t need a lot. one major con for me is that it is heavily perfumed, almost to the point that it gives me a headache. my skin is sensitive, and so the formula (maybe this was partly due to fragrance too) made my skin burn/feel itchy, and the morning after using I have dry patches around my mouth (even after using my heavy duty moisturizer). I’ve only used it a couple of times so far, will continue to try it for a week and see if my skin reactivity improves. Ok cleanser, but not good for sensitive skin
