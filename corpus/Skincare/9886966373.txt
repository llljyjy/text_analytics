Started using this 7 months ago and it has changed my skin for the better. My acne scars have faded so much and it cured my dry skin in the winter months! I haven’t experienced any pilling when wearing it under makeup. The only downside to this product is the price, but I’d rather put my money to a sustainable company like this one anyways. 1 - 1.5 pumps is plenty to cover the face and helps the bottle last longer. If you have the extra money to splurge on this product, it’s absolutely worth it! Amazing product, worth the extra $$!
