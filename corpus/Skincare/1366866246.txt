I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks now, and so far have been loving it! It doesn’t irritate my skin or make me peel at all like other retinol products have done, which I love. It had almost no scent, which is preferable for me. I also think that for the price it has a decent amount im the bottle and love the clean ingredients. I’m only giving it 4 stars, because I can’t tell yet whether or not it’s making a difference with my fine lines, but time will tell. I’d definitely suggest giving it a try! So far so good
