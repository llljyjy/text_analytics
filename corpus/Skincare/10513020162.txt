After using this product on my acne I immediately noticed a difference. For me, my acne typically takes about 1-2 weeks to fully heal, most of the time itâ€™s two weeks. After using this on a pimple for a week I immediately noticed a difference after day 1. It significantly reduced the size, redness and appearance overall. Will definitely continue to use this. nan
