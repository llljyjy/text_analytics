This product is easily one of my favorite parts of my skin care routine. It feels so luxurious to use. I personally donâ€™t find the smell overpowering, it has hints of coconut that I think smells nice and the mist so feels so good on skin. My personal reason for using this is because it blocks out harmful blue light that comes from our phone and computer screens. Not to mention this spray leaves my skin looking so incredibly dewy and can also serve as a setting spray. I just finished my first bottle and it lasted me months. I will immediately be re-purchasing! Staple in my skin care routine!
