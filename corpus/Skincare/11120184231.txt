I received the Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb Sunscreen SPF 50 for free from Influenster and Belif to review with my honest opinion. The moisturizer feels nice on the skin and I really like the texture of it. It does have a sunscreen scent to it but it doesn’t bother me because I’m used to sunscreen having a scent like that. It doesn’t feel sticky on the skin. It provides lots of protection for when you go outside with the sun. The packaging is nice and it is easy to get the product out of the bottle. I feel like it’s a nice high quality moisturizer to get at the store plus it has that added SPF 50. Nice Moisturizer with SPF 50!
