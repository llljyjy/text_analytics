I received a sample of this serum as a #freeproduct to review from Topbox and Clinique. I mainly used this serum as part of my nighttime routine as this line contains retinol and I didn’t want my skin to be sensitive to the sun if I used it during the day. I still wear sunscreen the next day and while I’m applying retinol-containing products, just in case. The serum absorbs quite well and I appreciate that it isn’t as scented as some other formulas. My skin felt more supple and hydrated after a few uses, but I didn’t have enough from the sample to see some of the longer term benefits. The consistency is a bit thicker than the creams in Clinique’s wrinkle correcting line, but is still easy to apply. Hydrating and nourishing serum!
