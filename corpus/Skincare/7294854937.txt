As I have started to get into my late thirties I have definitely started focusing more on my skin regiment! One of the steps in my routine is to exfoliate and I have to say that this particular product is one of my absolute favorites!! I like that you can mix as little or as much as you like at any given time and I love the way my skin feels afterward! I know that in general any scrub will potentially make your skin feel softer, but this one is just so luxurious. I never break out afterwards or experience any redness. I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my review, but went on to purchase my own bottle! It’s expensive but worth the price, in my opinion. I’m 37 and have been using this for about 2 months approximately 2 a week. Pictures without makeup and with! My favorite exfoliater!
