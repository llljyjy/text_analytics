Topbox sent me a sample of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum to test for my honest review. I used this serum in the evening after my shower and after using the wrinkle correcting cream to remoisturize my face. I love that this serum has a nice light scent like most Clinique products, went on smooth, and didn’t make me look glossy. #freeproduct Lovely serum
