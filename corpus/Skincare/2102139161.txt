I’ve been using this new product for a few years and it is a reliable brightening serum. I used it before bed, and in the morning my skin would be even and smooth. It faded acne spots, but wasnt amazing at treating existing acne. I’d consider this a great alternative to retinol products, which give me similar (but admittedly better) results. good alternative to retinol
