I  was eager & excited to try this line; I read great reviews and while I was researching for a new moisturizer, I saw this appear on many “best of” lists. And the price point? It’s pretty incredible. I’ve been using it for a week now and I love it. I bought the hyaluronic acid as well and my texture is smoother, my face is not dry & flaky. It doesn’t just feel moisturized, it feels hydrated. I’m 45 and have been lucky so far as I have minimal wrinkles & fine lines and really want to keep it that way. Up until now, my skin care routine has been cleanse & moisturize. I have extremely sensitive skin and every time I try something new—even an eye cream—I have some sort of breakout or allergic reaction. I’m also super lazy and don’t want layer product upon product onto my face night & day. My only complaint is when I purchased this, the Sephora employee tried very hard to talk me out of it and into more expensive products. It was way over the top. Came across like a used car salesman. I did not appreciate it. 45 & very sensitive
