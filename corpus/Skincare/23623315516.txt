I have tried many self tanning products, and this is in my top favs. Upon initial application, I thought it wasn’t working because the tan didn’t show immediately. However after a couple hours my tan developed so nicely and looked very real. This is long lasting, moisturizing and applies without streaking. 100 percent recommend! New fav self tanning spray!
