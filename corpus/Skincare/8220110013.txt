Tata Harper Restorative Anti-Aging Eye Cream texture has a pleasantly light, creamy and silky texture that works well into my under-eye area without being too heavy or greasy. I like that it quickly absorbs, and I enjoy the soft, sweet and natural scent. My under-eyes feel more nourished and slightly more glowy, but I’ll definitely keep using it on a regular basis to see what benefits come in the long term. While I really love how it feels and works so far, I don’t know if I could throw down $130 for an eye cream. I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Light & Nourishing!
