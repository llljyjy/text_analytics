The Midnight Recovery Face Oil is the best product I own and I own a lot of them. I apply this oil to my face, neck and décolleté every night and sometimes in the morning too.  It keeps my skin hydrated, plumped and fresh looking.  It’s absolutely a product that I cannot live without. I’d rub this all over my body every day if it came in a larger size bottle. This is the perfect oil.. not too oily and definitely non irritating.  Love it! nan
