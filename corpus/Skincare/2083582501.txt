This is my first time trying a retinol product and I loved the results. This serum felt light on the skin and left my skin very smooth and glowy. I have sensitive skin and tend to break our with certain products but this product felt great on my skin and no breakouts from the product. Iâ€™ve incorporated this into part of my nightly routine. Definitely recommend it! Great product!
