I LOVE this stuff! It smells good and fresh. It feels so good on the skin. I use it before moisturizer as part of my skin care. And I use it to set my makeup and then throughout the day to freshen things up on my face. I really, really love it. The ONLY issue. I dropped it one time. And while the glass didn’t break, and it still sprays, it doesn’t spray as a mist anymore. It sprays In a hard stream. And I’m SO sad. And the bottle is made to where you can’t open it to pour the stuff into another bottle too. So now I can’t use it to set makeup or freshen it up throughout the day. I can only spray into my hands and then pat it onto my clean face. That makes me really sad actually. The sprayer shouldn’t break with one minor small short distance drop! Sprayer Broke buy lovely, otherwise!
