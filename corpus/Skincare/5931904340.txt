I love the product but I HATE the refill packaging! The original container dispenses just fine, but once I put the refill pack in, it stopped dispensing. I have to take it apart to get any product, which ends up making me get more product than I need and I waste a lot of it. This is frustrating considering how much this costs. I was excited when the refill pack came out because I hated the idea of wasting so much plastic with the original packaging, but the refill pack solution is awful. Refill pack design is awful
