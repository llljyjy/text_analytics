This product is definitely a game changer. For it to be retinol, it goes on surprisingly smoothly, and feels more luxe than medicinal. I could definitely tell a change in my skin after a few weeks, more smooth overall, more bright, with fewer dark spots. It feels like a spa treatment at home. Definitely recommend Amazing Results!
