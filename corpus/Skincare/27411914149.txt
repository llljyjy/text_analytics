okay, so the smell is terrible, like truly awful, plus after 2 weeks of use my skin had way more pigmentation however after 1 month of continued use my freckles are gone. like completely gone, please also remember you have to use with sun screen in order for it to work. Itâ€™s totally worth it went from a mini to a full size because of how well it worked for my skin. give it time
