I’ve been using this for about a week now and I love it! I was on Accutane for a year and when I came off the medication I started breaking out again (nowhere near to the point it was before but still). I was getting tiny little bumps on my temples, patches of acne on both cheeks, and my forehead started breaking out again. But this… this has calmed everything down so quick I still have the acne but it doesn’t hurt, it isn’t red, and it doesn’t itch. Please buy it savior
