Finally, a Supergoop product that’s affordable. It is sticky to the touch once on your face and it doesn’t really absorb (better for protecting against the sun imo). BUT I don’t mind the stickiness because it smells great, leaves zero residue, doesn’t burn my eyes, gives a great glow, and smells amazing.I do have normal skin though, so I wouldn’t recommend for anyone with oily skin. Love it
