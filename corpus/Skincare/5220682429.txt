This serum is luxury! It is a smooth, comfortable, effective serum to help resurface your face. It chemically gets rid of texture and any hyperpigmentation. It is gentle yet effective - you must stay consistent with it! Apply it underneath a moisturizer daily and make sure you wear SPF during the day. I would definitely recommend this serum - it is easy to use, effective, and gives solid results! Thank you Influenster for giving me the opportunity to try it! Luxurious and effective!
