I had high hopes for this product but couldn’t even give it enough time to see if it was effective. The watery consistency made it difficult to apply and I just couldn’t get past the hot dog water smell. I thought the smell would be masked by my moisturizer so I tried it under three different moisturizers that all generally smell pretty wonderful but none of them helped. I felt a mild burning sensation once or twice when I applied it, but it wasn’t too bad. I assume that was the ascorbic acid (as opposed to the gentle SAP serum I’ve been using). Had to return this one. Sensory issues with this one
