Pretty standard chemical sunscreen: no white cast, fluid texture, slight greasy residue (which I don’t mind since I have dry skin). Has a strong flower and sunscreen smell but doesn’t stay on the face too long.It personally irritated my eyes with the tiniest amount of sweat or if I stupidly rubbed my eyes which is why I favor the mineral sunscreen option (although this one is double the amount for the same price!)Overall, it’s an okay sunscreen, might not be the best for oily types or those with eye sensitivity. It’s okay
