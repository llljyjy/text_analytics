Tried the retinol eye mask. It leaves with a cooling sensation and makes your under eye area feel hydrated . I used it in the morning after shower for about 30 mins which I believe was enough , it got rid of my puffiness and left the area smooth. I love murad and all their products ! Hydrating and rejuvenating
