I was very impressed with the “IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce Anti-Aging Moisturizer“. The moisturizer went on smooth and and spread nicely. It is very light and also absorbed quickly. A huge plus for me is that I did not notice an unpleasant fragrance sometimes found in other moisturizers. The only drawback for me is the moisturize does not appear to contain sunscreen and I will need to apply an additional product if I intend to be outdoors for a long period of time but other than that, I highly recommend this moisturize and will definitely be purchasing again when needed.
