I absolutely love this product! I use it in the morning instead of at night. At night I use my retinol. It might not be ideal to use in the AM for one who is out and about all day but I currently am home most of the day so it’s fine for me. I’ve noticed such a difference in my complexion since using this. My skin is brighter and more even tones and the over all texture has improved. I’ve been using it about a month. Would absolutely recommend! A must have!
