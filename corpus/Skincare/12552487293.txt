I received this product as a free sample and was neutral on my thoughts for this product/brand. I am 46 and should have started a skin care routine way before the signs of aging kicked in. With that said, my biggest concerns are fine lines, pores, and dullness to my complexion. I started using retinols and my skin care routine about two years ago, so I have tried my fair share of products. I used this product for a full two weeks before forming any opinion. First off, it was easy to mix up. After about 3 days I woke up and actually noticed a difference. My skepticism kicked in and I thought maybe it was wishful thinking. However, on about day 5/6 I really noticed a difference that was undeniable. My skin was brighter, smoother, and my pores weâ€™re MUCH smaller. It takes a lot to impress me with a product and I have to say this one is definitely one that I will continue to use in my skin care regimen. You can not beat the quality and it is definitely priced fairly. I experienced no redness or irritation. Wonderful Product! A must have!
