Life changing - I have clinically dry skin, like to the point of having prescription steroid lotion, and nothing could ever keep my face from flaking no matter how hard I tried. On top of that, my skin is insanely sensitive, so most things I tried either burned or made me have a reaction. Until this. I was ready to give up and just accept dryness 24/7 until I tried the sunshine oil. Now that I use it, my face isn’t dry until I wash it. It’s amazing, I genuinely cried when I first used it. No reaction, no burning, just smooth happy skin. 10/10 please don’t discontinue this product I’m begging u Milk & Sephora Genuine Life-Saver
