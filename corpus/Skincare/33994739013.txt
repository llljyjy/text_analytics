I received a free sample of Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme from Influenster, in exchange for my honest opinion about the product. I’m already a long-time fan of Estee Lauder products & this product didn’t disappoint me! I really enjoyed using it! It’s lightweight & isn’t greasy at all, which I love! It also has a light, pleasant scent, which is nice. I love how it makes my skin look & feel! I would definitely recommend this product! Another great product!!!
