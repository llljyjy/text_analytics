I received this product free from Topbox in exchange for my honest review.  First off, I love how the bottle works to dispense the product, as it makes it easy to use.  I really enjoyed this product as it was nice and light on my skin without a lot of scent.  It kept my skin incredibly moisturized throughout the day, especially followed up with the lotion.  I would definitely recommend it to others. nan
