It’s been a long time since I’ve used Clinique products, but okayyyy, I see you! I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. It’s lightweight with a gel texture - reminds me of the Murad water gel, which is a fave. I have dry/combo skin, and I felt it moisturized really well. No flakes in sight! It’s a little more than I like to spend, but I’ll definitely add it to the list of stuff that works! nan
