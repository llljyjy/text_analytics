This is a great exfoliating mask when used correctly. Do not use it on your face if you have cuts, scrapes or acne cause it will sting terribly. It makes skin super soft and supple. Definitely follow up with a moisturizer or else your skin will become bone dry. It is truly one of those masks that have the ability to give you that instant glow and brightness. I use it before events all the time and it makes your skin look amazing. Works wonders when used correctly
