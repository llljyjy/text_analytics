This beauty balm is beautiful! Perfect sheer coverage spf and builds to a beautiful medium coverage makeup. Gives a “your skin but better” effect. My only complaint about this product is the shade range, I received a light/medium and as someone who is a light neutral it was a bit dark for me. Otherwise love! Beautiful radiant finish!
