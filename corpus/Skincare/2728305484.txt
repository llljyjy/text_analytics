I love a lot of Biossance products but I was honestly pretty disappointed in this cream. It wasn’t bad exactly (it didn’t make me break out or get rashy) but it didn’t help my skin in any way either. For the price, I’d hoped it would do more, but I’ve done better with drug store night creams that are a quarter of the price. It also smells like rotting flowers, so there’s that. I wanted to love it...
