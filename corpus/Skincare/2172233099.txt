I received the Augustinus Bader The Light Cream to try and give my opinion on. The first thing I notice is how light it is and how well it absorbs, which is perfect for daytime use. My skin never got excessively oily or greasy during the day from it. I love that even though it is light, it still moisturizes well. It pretty much is unscented. Overall, I love this cream and would recommend it. Nice and Light
