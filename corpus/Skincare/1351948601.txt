I received this free product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. All I can say is wow! I’m 40 years old and I have a 15 month old, sleep, rest and self care are out of the window lol! I also always have dry under eyes because I use Retin-A. This has been the first eye product that I’ve tried that actually sinks into my skin making it look instantly refreshed. I like the metal applicator, it feels like a mini eye mask while applying it. At first I was worried that it wouldn’t play well with my Retin-a routine but I was wrong. It hydrates and instantly refreshes like a dream. I was also worried about the fragrance…I like the way it smells but I have sensitive skin and worried that the fragrance might irritate my eyes but it doesn’t. Bye bye puffy dry eyes!
