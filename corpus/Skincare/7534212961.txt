I have a extremely dry skin and I have tried many products to restore the hydration, only few are the ones that I like and work on my skin. I do use anti aging products, this is one of my new favs now. I definitely did experience immediate hydration, smoother and brighter skin. Texture of the product felt like a dream on my skin. My skin is definitely getting used to it and loves it. I believe I have found it, would absolutely recommend this product to all my friends and family and anyone reading this. Your skin will thank you!!! The best serum!
