This has helped my skin change SO much. I struggle with redness, breakouts, and texture, and have gone through a lot of moisturizers and serums. I got this hoping for the best and am so happy with the results! It absorbs into my oily skin and hydrates my skin, and after a few weeks my skin is soft and glowing. It works well with my other skincare and makeup. I use it with the Ordinary ascorbic acid and my skin is glowing, smoother, and a little less red. I just wish there was more product! If youâ€™re on the fence, try it! my new HG moisturizer!!
