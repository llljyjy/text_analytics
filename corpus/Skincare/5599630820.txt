IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm is my new favorite product.  It feels so luxurious and leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and moisturized like no other product I’ve tried.  I’ve actually tried a similar product from another company and was not impressed.  IT Cosmetics has succeeded in making a product that does what it says it will do and more.  Upon opening the jar you will see a balm that quickly “melts“ into your skin as you massage it on your face.  It feels so good gliding on.  It takes off all makeup so smoothly and leaves your skin clean and soft beyond belief.  It has a very light rose smell from the rosehip oil, which I really like.  You can barely smell it but it is a light beautiful smell without being at all overpowering.  So light, some people may not even notice it.  I wiped mine off with both a tissue for the eye makeup areas and with a warm wash cloth for my face when just using it to clean my face in the evenings.  I used it to wash my face when I was wearing makeup and even when I was not because it left my face feeling so nice afterwards.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase. Say HELLOOOOO to IT Bye Bye
