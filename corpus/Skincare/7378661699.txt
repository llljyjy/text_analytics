All the Fenty products I’ve tried have been great, so I figured this one would be the same. Packaging is cute but I find the formula to be very sticky, to the point where it makes it difficult to rub my lips together. I hoped that it would maybe absorb better and loose it’s ’stickiness’ but it feels like it just sits on my lips. Moisturizing aside, I’m not in love with this product, will return and not buy again. The Marketing Got Me..
