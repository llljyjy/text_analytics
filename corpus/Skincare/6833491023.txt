I was so excited to receive this eye cream because I’d just run out of my inexpensive kind and had been wondering if I should try a more expensive cream. Honestly, after trying it over the past few weeks I’m still very neutral about my opinion. There is nothing wrong with this product. The moisture is there so under my eyes felt smooth and hydrated. I can’t speak on its benefits to crow’s feet, however it does have a slight brightening effect which did help even the look under my eyes. This also wore well under makeup. If you’re a big eye cream user this may be your jam, I think I’ll have a better opinion once I’ve used the whole jar. nan
