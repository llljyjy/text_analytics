I like the concept of this shave gel, however I would not recommend it for a dry shave, as advertised. The gel clogs up the blade with a few simple strokes and needs to be clean often. Not only that but I did suffer a mild allergic reaction from using it to dry shave. I did test it out in the shower as well and worked fine though! Nothing too amazing. If you have sensitive skin make sure to check the ingredients! donâ€™t recommend for dry shave
