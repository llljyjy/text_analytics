I have oily skin with a few dry patches and there hasnâ€™t been any sunscreen that I could use without being left with my skin feeling heavy and greasy until I tried this one. Yes, it is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way AND, it does not leave a white cast if you apply it properly. I will definitely continue buying it. Best sunscreen EVER.
