This is by far the best moisturizing cream I’ve ever used. I’m 51 and I usually use jojoba oil and add vitamin c. But now I use this and add a vitamin c serum, it’s incredible. It lasts 24 hours, no joke. It’s amazing. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t make me break out. I highly recommend this. Summer and winter. The BEST moisturizer ever
