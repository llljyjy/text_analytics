This is the third item from Biossance that I have used and out of the three, two are my fave. This is one of them! I wasn’t sure how my skin would react to it as it’s sensitive, so at first I just applied it to my neck, nose and on dark spots I currently have. I noticed my skin was brighter on my neck and on the spots. My nose was super dry because of the weather and it’s super soft right now, that my foundation looks much nicer on it. A few days later I finally decided to put it all over my face and thankfully no bad reaction, it definitely gives a brighter glow to your skin and super soft to the touch. I like the texture of it, it’s very lightweight, reminds me of yogurt. The packing is great, the box isn’t hard to open and the jar looks nice, it feels expensive. One thing I noticed is that it has a particular scent, I’m not super fond of the scent, but it’s not like it is super awful either. If you don’t mind the scent it is definitely worth trying. I will definitely be adding this to my skincare routine and can’t wait to see more results. Better than I thought !
