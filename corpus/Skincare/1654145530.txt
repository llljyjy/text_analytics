This retinal is easy to add into a new routine or an existing one. I am in my late 30’s but still struggling with breakouts, texture and now fine lines and dark spots. This has been a wonderful addition to my aha’s and has never caused any dryness or irritation. My skin looks smooth and bright after just one time, and I use it a few times a week. I’m not super sensitive but on the past retinols have irritated the sides of my nose and causes them to flake and I haven’t experienced any flaking, tightness, or redness! east going, great for new and seasoned skin
