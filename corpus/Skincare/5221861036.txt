This cleansing balm doesn’t remove makeup well, does not emulsify nicely to rinse away completely, and is somehow gritty. It also separates so that I have to squish it around well in the tube or else just oil comes out. The Inkey List makes my holy grail products but this one isn’t it The only good thing is the price point
