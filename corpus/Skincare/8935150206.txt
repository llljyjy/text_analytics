I love the way this stuff smells, first and foremost. It reminds me a little of Trix cereal, which I love. Then to feel it, its so creamy and a tiny bit goes a long way. I have to say I’d love to lather my entire body in it, but not at the price. It felt so good going on my face and my face soaked it in, but it wasn’t like thinner moisturizers where it disappeared right away. You could feel your skins thirst being quenched. I live on florida where its so hot you have to get a great moisturizer. One not too light or too heavy with all the sweating. This one 100% hits every mark for me. It felt clean, instead of like a second layer of foundation.  I was hoping to see more results and even used on some rough elbow patches, but the results weren’t as dramatic as I hoped for.  I even gave it a longer time before I reviewed for that reason. It is however an amazing moisturizer that definitely doesn’t feel wet or thick on my skin. It feels fresh and dewy and my makeup slid right over it without caking up.  Plus, there’s sooooo much in that container you def get your moneys worth. But beware: you will be tempted to slather it all over after you feel this stuff. VERY impressed and will tell all my besties! Creamy and silky
