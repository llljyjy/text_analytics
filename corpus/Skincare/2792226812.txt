This product seems like fragrant water in a plastic bottle but baby, when I tell you this is the ELIXIR, I’m not kidding. I’ve used this for a few weeks now and my skin is so much smoother, brighter and my pores, which are the biggest on my nose and on my cheeks underneath my eye area, are smaller now. Tip from me: After showering, shake some into your hands and apply this to your face, neck, and decollete while it’s damp/wet with your hands, pat in and let it all air dry together. Thank me later!
