Unfortunately, this product did not work out for me personally and I had to return it. In addition to not delivering the amount of hydration I was looking for, it  also aggravated rather than soothed my skin and caused some breakouts (which would improve if I skipped this product in my routine, then immediately act back up as soon as I used it again). Clearly, this works for some people, but I ended up returning after 2 weeks. a no for me
