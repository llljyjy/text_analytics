I did receive this product free from Influenster for my honest review. This product hasn’t been my most favorite to date to use. I’m not a huge fan of the scent and the tingling that occurs when using it is kind of intense for me. I do have sensitive skin though. I have oily skin with large pores. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin texture while using this but I have noticed that my coloration is starting to even out. I don’t have dark spots per day but I do have areas of redness which have calmed down. Not my most favorite but it works!
