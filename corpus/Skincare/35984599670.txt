I’ve been using Bye Bye Makeup for about 10 days now, almost daily. When I first opened the container, I was afraid it was going to feel greasy. It looks sort of like old school cold cream, like my mom used to use. It’s not greasy at all though. It goes on smoothly and feels so nice. I used a warm, wet cloth to remove it. The makeup comes right off, and my skin is left feeling incredibly soft and clean. I only dislike one thing about this product, and that’s the scent. I’m fairly sensitive to odors and I avoid perfumes for the most part. Bye Bye Makeup has a strong perfume scent that I’m not a fan of at all. I would prefer either an unscented version, or something lightly scented with a more natural smell, such as essential oils. Excellent product
