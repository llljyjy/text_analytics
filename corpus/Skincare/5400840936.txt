I received the travel size of this eye gel complimentary of Influenster. When I first used this eye gel, I was actually quite impressed as I noticed my dark circles were noticeably faded the morning after applying this for the first time. I used it for about over week until I had to stop due to eye surgery. Right before I started using it again, some darkness had returned, so I thought this would help continue to fade them. However, using it the second time around didn’t have the same effect. So I’m wondering if maybe it was just better sleep that helped reduced my dark circles as opposed to this eye gel, or maybe both. As for the texture, it’s a very pleasant experience to apply to the under eye. While I can’t say it helped with dark circles, it definitely moisturized the under eye and made the skin look plush and hydrated. I think I’d be willing to try this eye gel again, although I’d only buy it if there was a good discount. While the texture and application is pleasant, I’ll probably just stick to my current eye product. Amazing hydrating texture
