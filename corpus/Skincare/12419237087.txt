This is why it’s important to do your research. This product is one of the BIGGEST money makers for Tower 28, because it’s literally salt water with a disinfectant. You could make this at home. And because it only has 3 ingredients, there’s no way to know the ratio of each ingredient or even make an educated guess on how many parts water vs salt vs disinfectant.So why does it work for some people & not others?The individuals that love this product and who it works so well for, are most likely struggling with a type of microbial acne, or their microbiome on the skin on their face is unbalanced, which is what can cause redness & acne, so the salt water helps balance the PH level of the skin while the disinfectant destroys surface bacteria depending on how much bacteria, amount sprayed, ect. For everyone else, this product isn’t going to do too much other than feel good sprayed on your face on a hot day. That is why I am giving this 3 stars. I love Tower 28 products and their minimum ingredient, clean take on beauty…but I also feel like there’s a lot of BS claims on this one, that simple science answers, and if people were educated on their microbiome and PH levels, they wouldn’t need this product, or if they did they could make it at home. (Unless you just want to purchase it and support the economy, than Go You!) Hope this helps anyone looking to purchase.
