I am pleasantly surprised by the results of this cream. The feel is luxurious but also incredibly lightweight. The product absorbs quickly and leaves my skin hydrated for the whole day. I am seeing a bit of brightness in my areas of hyperpigmentation after 30 days so I am excited to see the results after long term use. A great choice for the upcoming spring and summer months. Soft and supple all day
