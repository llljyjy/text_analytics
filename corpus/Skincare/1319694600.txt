This is a nice moisturizer but too expensive for.what it is. I’d.compare it to Tarte’s Bada Bomb which is a bit more moisturizing for me and a much nice price. I noticed a lot of people complaining about the packaging. That packaging is the best - it preserves all of the antioxidants and otjer sensitive ingredients! Nice, but too expensive!
