As you can see from my old lady hands (where did those come from?) I need skin care with a little more than average. I love the texture of this sunscreen. Itâ€™s thick but not greasy and soaks in well. The scent is a mix of floral and normal sunscreen and I really like it. With the SPF 42 and the hyalaluronic acid, I feel like my skin is protected and treated well. Good coverage and protection
