Yeah this works. Just like Paula’s choice does. Just like glossier solution does. I like that this didn’t worsen sensitivity in my skin. I use differin retinol as well at night and used this every other day. I think it does smoothen the bumps but I have to use for a few months probably to evaluate the hyperpigmentation reduction. It’s a little pricy but it’s good I think. Use sparingly if ur using another anti acne product so as to not inflame the skin. I attached a before and after. 3 days apart. The before is my hair up. The after is with my hair down. The rising red bump disappeared looks like so that’s good. The texture is like lotion toner and that kinda threw me off it kind of absorbed into the cotton pad more than my skin and this is already expensive so that kinda threw me off so 4 star instead of 5. Like that it is un scented. And not too strong. Helps with redness. She works
