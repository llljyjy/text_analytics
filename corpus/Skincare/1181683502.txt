Absolute great!! This balm really takes the makeup off without drying or leaving raccoon eyes!! It is a bit thick at first, but you rub it between your fingers, then rub all over your face and then rinse. I used face wash after as well to make sure it was all off! Itâ€™s amazing!! Such a good staple!!
