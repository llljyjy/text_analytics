This product compares to other products iâ€™ve tried by being way heavier therefore using less than others.Some benefits of owning this product are that its a very heavy moisturizer so a little goes a long way.I would buy this product 100%!I would you recommend this product to my friends and family, especially if they have dry and/or mature skin. Great moisturizer
