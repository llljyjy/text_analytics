Got this as a part of a free sample program, but oh boy convinced me back to using bar soaps again. First of all, the shape...genius...honestly DID NOT slip out of my hand at ANY.TIME. No more spending half of your shower time chasing soap risking any kind of injuries. Two, I’m really not a big fan of any coconut scent as it usually makes me a bit nauseous but for some reasons I didn’t mind this one at all, the smell was very subtle once the bar was wet, which I really enjoyed. Third, first bar soap I used that didn’t leave that skin-dry-tugging feeling, huge plus! Definitely would recommend to others! Round is the way to go!
