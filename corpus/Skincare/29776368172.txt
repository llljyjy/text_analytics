I was super excited when I received Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum from Influenster for free for testing purposes, so that I could test this product myself, in order to give my completely honest and truthful review of this product. #incentivized #Influenster The Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum bottle is actually divided into three totally different chambers, which I was able to see once I opened it. The nozzle actually has three separate openings so that each one of the active ingredients can be maintained separately. Developing a bottle, as such, allows for each ingredient to remain stable up until the point of being ready to be mixed and applied to your face! Very satisfied
