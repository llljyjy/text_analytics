It left a white residue - if you wiped it away as indicated with a cotton ball any firmness went right away with it. If you put anything moisturizing on top it would  also remove any effects of the product. And any concealer on top would cake on top of the white residue and make everything look crusty and awful. I wish i had returned this within the 60 days - it is a lot to spend to have it be such a poor product Disappointing
