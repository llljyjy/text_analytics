I have been using this mask for a week at night, after slugging (wet face and put moisturizer on top) and let me tell you, this stuff’s amazing! In just one week, it has brightened my face so much. I wish I would’ve taken before pictures! I have discoloration around my mouth and eyes, and I have rosacea, so my cheeks are usually very red. So far, this mask has really cleared up all this discoloration, and my skin tone looks more even. The slugging has also helped with texture, but I think I need something stronger for this I think. For now (wintertime) my skin just needs moisture and to even my skin tone since with how dry it gets in the winter, I look dull and sickly. I have very dry skin that flakes in the winter, and my skin loves the Drunk Elephant line, so this is an amazing addition to my skincare routine. Evens Skin Tone
