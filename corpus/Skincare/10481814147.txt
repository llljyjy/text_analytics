This is the worst setting spray ever! Maybe it has potential as a sunscreen, but I barely can wear it as it’s not matte as it advertised and it’s not fixing your makeup, it’s melting your makeup. I bought it to refresh my sunscreen during the day on top of my makeup, but I can use it only without makeup. So what the point? On bare face I can just re-apply my normal sunscreen, for that I don’t need ‘fancy’ spray. Plus it smells horrible. Going back to Milani setting spray with SPF. nan
