I really like this eye cream overall. It’s a great value for the size of the product, I feel like the tub will easily last me half the year and it’s not expensive at all which is great. It’s a fairly lightweight eye cream so my eye area doesn’t feel sticky or anything after using it. The biggest downside is that it has a bit of a smell that’s not the most pleasant. It does fade after some time though. I haven’t been able to see much brightening under my eyes but it does a good job hydrating so I’m not disappointed. nan
