I have sensitive, combo (oily-leaning), dehydrated skin. I get hormonal breakouts and if I dare fall asleep without washing my face one night I’ll definitely wake to a breakout. As I get situational acne, if you will, applying this daily and all over is too much for my skin but when applied directly to my breakouts, I see improvement literally overnight and they’re gone a day or 2 sooner than usual. Pure tea tree oil is too strong for my sensitive skin and scarred my cheek for months the first time I used it but though tea tree is in this oil, I’ve had no adverse reactions.
