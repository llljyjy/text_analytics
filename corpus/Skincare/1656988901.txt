My skin is combo but with patchy dry spots. And this cream really helped because it didn’t make me break out in my “normal” skin areas. I’m normal and dry rather than oily. 5/5 would definitely recommend and a little goes a long way so you definitely get your monies worth. I received this gift in exchange for review and love that I found another great product to buy. >best creme
