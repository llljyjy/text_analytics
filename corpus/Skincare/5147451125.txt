As a woman of color it’s very important to use a sunscreen that doesn’t leave at “ashy” look. I love how this melted right into my skin and blended perfectly. It’s very lightweight and doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily. Usually I have to wait at least 15 minutes before I can apply makeup after using sunscreen because it leaves my skin so oily. This sunscreen immediately absorbed into my skin so that I can apply my foundation right after. I am very sensitive to smells so the fact that it has a very light scent is a plus for me.
