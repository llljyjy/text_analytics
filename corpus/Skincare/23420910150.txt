I received this product free to review. I was not expecting to receive something like this, but I have been using it religiously every day since I got it 3-4 weeks ago. The packaging is very nice and the product comes out easily, it’s a light feeling serum that’s very light on the face and didn’t leave my face feeling sticky. I can tell an improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. Also, my face hasn’t been breaking out as much. I would definitely recommend this product! Great serum!
