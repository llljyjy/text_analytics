This eye cream has risen to holy grail status at a meteoric race — I can’t believe this eye cream isn’t talked about more! I’ve been using this for a little over a week and a half and the lines under my eyes have SIGNIFICANTLY. Prior to using this cream, I had huge problems with concealer settling into the lines under my eyes - I barely notice it after using this cream. The improvement is noticeable even without makeup — my under eyes look smoother, which makes me look more awake overall. Additionally, this eye cream provides nice hydration under the eyes as well. I even like to pat the excess over my smile lines, where I’ve noticed improvement as well. I’m so glad I found this eye cream! nan
