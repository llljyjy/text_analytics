I have been trying all kinds of different products from expensive to very cheap to help with my VERY dry and yes even cracked around my lip and eye area face.   I’ve been working outside this winter and it has taken a toll on any skin that has been exposed. I was about to give up, but so happy I didn’t!  It was actually soothing when I put it on the first time there was no burning and I’m so amazed that just after a couple days how much healthier my skin not only looks but feels. Just try it I’m sure you will be just as amazed as I was! So happy!
