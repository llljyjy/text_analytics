I’ve enjoyed Dr. DGross skincare for about 5 years.  Now that I’m 52, my skin is craving quality moisturizer. I tried this one as a sample when I purchased the regular Vit C moisturizer and I was hooked!  Went in and bought it the next day. I love the hydration it gives my face. I use it at night and on my ‘no makeup’ days. The ideal moisturizer.
