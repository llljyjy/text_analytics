This crap felt thick but not heavy or greasy. It absorbed into my skin nicely. The scent was pleasant and not too intense. A nice moisturizer, though I did not notice any difference in my skin or a reduction in lines. I received a sample of this for free for testing purposes and was able to get a couple weeks of use out of it. nice moisturizer but no effect on lines
