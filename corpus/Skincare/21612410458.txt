*I received this product for free in exchange of my honesty review from influenster.*I have always LOVED the Belief brand of skin care. I was excited to get the Aqua Bomb brightening vitamin c cream to review for free. And boy did it not disappoint. It not only has vitamin c but FOUR hyaluronic acids. And my dry skin loves all moisture! They also sent me a deluxe sample of the body moisturizer too and my skin is in love! It also has a slightly sweet citrus scent that is what I think of when I think summer! Love it! amazing
