Let’s address the elephant in the room- this Essence Treatment Lotion is exorbitantly priced, but it’s actually cheaper than its competitors. It gives more of an immediate effect to my skin than SK-II’s Facial Treatment Essence, though I’ve only tried trial sizes of both and can’t speak to long term effects of either. I also got less oily during the day with EL’s product versus Amore Pacific’s Vintage Single Extract Essence. I never had any pilling when using Micro Essence Treatment Lotion; it played nice with every product I put over it whether that was an anti-aging, anti-acne, or any other product. I could pat it in at any time, using only my palms, and get soothed, calm, even skin. It was lightly hydrating and helped amp up any moisturizer I used on top of it.It only takes a few seconds to pat it on, but it feels so luxurious to me to pat expensive water that immediately lightly plumps and hydrates my skin. It never broke me out and only left me with positive skin effects. It’s not a skincare must have, but I can’t say I won’t purchase this if I found it at a discount.Thanks to Estée Lauder and Influenster for the chance to try this product! Lovely if you have the money
