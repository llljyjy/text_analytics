I got this balm in a sample kit. I am surprised by how sticky it is. I can see why the full-size comes with an applicator. It also doesn’t hydrate. It seems more like a pot of lip gloss, and trust me, you can tell why they have lip glosses come in a tube when you try to apply this mask. There is no way I’d pay full price for this. Sticky, Non-Hydrating
