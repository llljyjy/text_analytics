The Hyper Even Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum is one of my new favorites. I’ve had a couple of dark spots from blemishes that I couldn’t get rid of at all. I’ve been using the Hyper Even Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C serum and it’s faded significantly.  The serum absorbs well into my skin and is also pretty gentle. I have semi-sensitive skin and I’ve experienced no issues with the product. I really recommend it if you have dark spots. nan
