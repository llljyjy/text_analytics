All these great reviews I had to try— I have been using claudile moisture cream for years now and thought to try new brand … well this one made my skin feel tight at night even after my serums and eye cream. It didn’t give me enough moisture at night and almost same price for one I was using . I will probably use this up and buy mine . I’m disappointed because I have to waste this heavy jar . I wish I could take it back but threw  away the  box since all these great reviews were posted … I sometimes wonder if all their  reviews pay for their own nan
