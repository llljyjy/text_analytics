I am not the best about skincare, but decided to try this.  I have been using it 1-2x a week and will just use it when I am in the shower.  The first time I used it I was surprised by the red-orange color of it--so don’t be alarmed.  I like this mask because it is a little gritty and I feel like it gets rid of build-up on my face/skin, however, it doesn’t leave it feeling so dry afterwards.  I feel like my skin has become more healthier since I have been using this. nan
