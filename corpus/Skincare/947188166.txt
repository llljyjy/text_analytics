Not sure why some people find this moisturizing! It’s seriously overpriced for a product that actually does the opposite. I usually put it on before bedtime like I have with other lip balms, and my lips end up unusually dried out in the morning, unlike with other lip balms I’ve had before. The only pros are the packaging. What a disappointment. barely minty, overpriced
