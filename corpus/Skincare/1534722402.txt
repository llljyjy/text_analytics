I wanted to like this. Pilled when moisturizer applied over top. Felt sticky and didnâ€™t absorb well. Also caused a fun swollen eye even though I avoided eye area. I know for sure it was this product that caused it as I stopped using it for a few weeks and the swelling went away. Tried using again and it came back within an hour of applying :( Caused swelling to eyelid
