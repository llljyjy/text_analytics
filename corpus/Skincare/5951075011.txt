I have been afraid of changing my face products because I have acne prone skin. I had been doing serum, oils, and masks but got tired of not seeing results. I was looking for a product to fight fine lines and improve my skin complexion.I have been using Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Cream Moisturizer for a few weeks and I really notice an improvement. This moisturizer is creamy and rich but does not clog my pores and has not caused any breakouts. It absorbs fast, It is lightweight and not oily.I apply a small amount in the morning and evening. My skin is softer, has a natural glow, and my fine lines are less visible in my forehead.I really like that Premier Cru Anti-Aging Cream Moisturizer is refillable; once finished, you can purchase refills for it instead of buying a whole new jar. I would highly recommend it. freeproduct Fine lines are less visible in my forehead.
