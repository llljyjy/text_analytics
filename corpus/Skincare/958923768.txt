Lacome’s products are always really great and this Rénergie H.C.F. Anti-Aging Triple Serum is no exception. First of it is beautifully packaged. Compared to other Lancome products - this is exactly what you would expect from a high quality luxury brand like Lancome. This is something you’re going to want to keep on your countertop not hide away in a drawer. It is a really nice item to buy for someone else as it is so beautiful. I also LOVE really great instructions on a product and this gives such wonderful instructions for best use. Really it’s a face lotion so you probably already know what to do but it’s really nice to get the recommended application times, usage and pumps suggested. I followed the instructions to a T and was very happy with the results. It is really easy to use, just a single pump provides a triple serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C + Niacinamide and Ferulic Acid. I have used this product for almost two months now and it’s still going strong. The product comes out evenly and I would want you to know that I never feel the need to wash my hands after application. It applies easily, smoothly and cleanly. There is no noxious odor and my skin feels well hydrated. I would recommend this product to anyone especially those living in a cold or dry climate because it keeps my skin very well taken care of. While using this product I still use other products as part of my daily and nightly routine - this does not replace everything and is not designed to be a single use product but it does contain three different serums which make application effortless. I do wish that I could see how much product I have left, the outside of the bottle is so beautiful so it is worth not knowing but I don’t want to run out and I wish I knew how much more product I had before I need to re-order! Overall I am very happy with this product and enjoy using it. Beautiful, easy, works
