Just looked and my last order of the Jumbo was 5/10/21, so $0.25 a day for perfection feels pretty reasonable! I started with the travel size, so refill that and keep the big jar in the back of the fridge with parchment on it. It’s always fresh! This is one of my never replace, will weep when it’s discontinued, favorite ever parts of my routine. I have very dry (USED TO) skin and use a good whack of this every morning on face and neck and then rub the remainder into my hands. It has a real aroma, but as someone with very sensitive skin to perfumes it doesn’t bother my skin and I love the way it smells. Clean, citrus and it dissipates almost immediately. I feel terrible for the folks this doesn’t work for because I ran out TODAY and was just so mad at me for the few days I’m going to have to live without it. For my skin, nothing has ever been better.
