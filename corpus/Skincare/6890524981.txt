I am so pleasantly surprised by the Lancôme advanced Génifique repairing night cream! It has amazing ingredients such as hylauronic and ceramides and prebiotics. My skin has been going through so much lately and this cream is helping my skin go back to normal. A little goes a looong way and it makes my dry skin look supple and hydrated. It gives my skin a nice healthy glow. I have a lot of spider veins in my face and this cream helps my skin look nice and plum and the veins look less visible. I really enjoy using this cream! Would highly recommended it. New favorite night cream!
