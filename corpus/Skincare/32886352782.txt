This is a great way to check what the Cicapair line is about. The serum is my favorite of the lot, I found it highly effective at soothing my skin during a breakout. The color correcting cream definitely lives up to its cult status. The odd man out was sadly the cream, but 2/3 winners ainâ€™t bad at all! I definitely recommend to anyone curious about these products. Great to try the Cicapair line of products
