I’ve been searching for a long time for a new eye cream and so glad Summer Fridays has launched this one. I’m a big fan of their other products, so naturally, I was stoked about this one. I love using it under my concealer in the morning—it goes on really smooth and just helps you keep with that natural makeup look. It also feels so refreshing to put on. Sometimes, I like to follow up with an eye roller I keep in the fridge. Using the roller really helps your skin soak up the product. In the evenings, I use it after I wash my face and use moisturizer. I’ve been waking up with far less puffiness and have visibly noticed I don’t look as tired in the morning. The vitamin addition is definitely an added bonus. Happy to be keeping this as part of my skincare routine! The Best Eye Cream I’ve Used So Far
