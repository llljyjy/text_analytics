I love using St. Tropez for self tanning, and this is my first time trying a face tanner. I mixed it in with my serum in the evening and liked that I could customize the level of tan by the amount of drops I put in. It felt nice and smooth on my face and didnâ€™t have a noticeable smell. In the morning, I noticed a slight tan and glow but not as dark as I normally like, so will try again with some more drops! Easy customizable glow
