This is the product that finally got me to wash my face every night! It has a lotion-like texture and doesn’t foam, so I wasn’t sure how clean my skin would feel after using it but I was pleasantly surprised. It leaves my combination skin feeling perfectly balanced by removing excess oil from my t-zone without drying out any part of my face. I don’t usually splurge on cleansers, but I look forward to using this every night and the rose scent is calming Splurge worthy cleanser
