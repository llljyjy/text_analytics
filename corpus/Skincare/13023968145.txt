I received this product completely free for testing purposes. I have combination oily skin but I like to do an intense hydrating moisturizer for overnight. This moisturizer is very heavy. I wouldnâ€™t wear this under makeup because I definitely feel like it gives more of a slip to the skin. I love the way it makes my skin feel and would highly recommend for a night time moisturizer. nan
