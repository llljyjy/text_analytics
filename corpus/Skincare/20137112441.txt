I received this product in exchange for a review.  Overall, I think it’s a great moisturizer! It smells good and not too overwhelming. It also works quickly and I could tell that my face seemed hydrated and the skin seemed more firm. I’m taking away a star though, because it is definitely not for sensitive skin types. I felt a slight burn after applying this product and my skin was a little irritated. Sad that I can’t add this to my daily routine. However, I did let a friend try/have it and she had great results and no irritation! She is very happy with it, but if you have sensitive skin it may not be for you. Maybe not for sensitive skin
