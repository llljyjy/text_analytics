Overall use is pretty great and doesn’t scratch my skin compared to other cheap plastic facial razor. This is the first time I have had a metal facial razor and that’s sustainably great! Otherwise it is counterintuitive on how it comes in a plastic case; I know it’s important to showcase the product, but we could do that by keeping one in a display case. An alternative would be to sell this in a clothed pouch. Additionally, I love how there are three additional blade refills that come with this and a separate purchase for refills! I know some reviews have said that it’s a bit difficult to remove the blade, which initially I agreed, but it’s not impossible to remove it. When I first tried, I used my pair of beauty scissors or you could also use some tweezers to push the blade out with that little plastic tab (make that metal too!). It’s actually okay that the blade doesn’t come out too easily because who knows if it could come out while you’re dermaplaning your face yikes! Wish This Wasn't in a Plastic Case
