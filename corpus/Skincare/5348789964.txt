I have awful roseacea and this product has changed my life for the better. I find it wears very well. I wash my face, apply a thin layer of moisturizer, then use the cream. Then I carry on with my regular makeup routine (concealer, foundation, powder). It completely hides the redness and lasts all day. I highly recommend this and now cannot live without it! Life changing product!
