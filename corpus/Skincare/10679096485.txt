Omg I did not expect to be blown away by this little gem!! This stuff is a miracle worker!! I’m in my mid-30s and I’m just starting to see some under eye wrinkles, crows feet, one small half line on my forehead and some smile/marionette lines. The worst of all though is that the skin above one of my eyelid’s had started to droop significantly. After reading the reviews for this I decided it wouldn’t hurt to try - I mean it’s less than $10 anyway!! Let me tell you, this stuff actually works! My forehead half-line is gone and although the lines around my mouth are a little more stubborn, they too are barely noticeable now! The least effective results have been my under eye lines and the crows feet but they are still significantly improved. The most amazing results however, have been my drooping eyelid area! The droop is now gone and my eyelid area looks like it did when I was in my 20s!! If you’re on the fence about this, trust me just buy it! I didn’t start seeing these results until I was on my second bottle so be patient, I promise you’ll see results with continued use! The Holy Grail!!!
