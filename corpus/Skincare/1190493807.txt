I been using this toner for about 3 weeks now twice a day every day, and I feel like it definitely cleans without irritating, I haven’t noticed differences in my pores but my face does feels very smooth, I have texture and It has help me with that, maybe not a lot but with some, I’m going to continue using it and hopefully I can update with more results soon!! This toner was gifted to me by Algenist in exchange for an honest review Great toner
