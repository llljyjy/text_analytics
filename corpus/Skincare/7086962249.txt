I really liked the feel of this cleansing balm. I usually have my Go-To that I always use, but I had heard such great things about this and since I do double cleanse I wanted to try it. It felt amazing on my skin, did not strip it and left me very cleansed! Itâ€™s extremely gentle and I definitely will be keeping this as my 1 of 2 balm cleansers. Worth The Hype!
