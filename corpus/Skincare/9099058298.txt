This is by far, my favorite oil cleanser! It is definitely worth the hype and has high ratings for a reason. It instantly melts when applied to the hands and the face, easily melting off all face makeup. Waterproof mascara does take extra work, but it will come off. A little bit of product also goes a long way! I got the standard size, which also included a sample packet of honey halo, and it lasted me about 3 months. I had to purchase the holiday set with different scents as well. a must try and must have !
