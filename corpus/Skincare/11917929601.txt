Caused me to breakout after a week of use. My skin typically never has breakouts from trying new skincare but this time it did. I used it every morning and I noticed after about a week, I started to get pimples all over my face. When I used this product, it felt amazing, it is super hydrating and the price is great but If you are concerned with having a breakout I would not recommend this product. caused a breakout
