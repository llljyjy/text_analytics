I received this product complementary from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder and exchange for my honest review. The design and coloring of the jar gives the feeling of richness and elegance. The John looks very nicely lined up on my vanity along with my other products. I love the fact that this is not a greasy cream and it goes on really softly and smoothly. It is not at all tacky on my fingertips nor my face. The scent is very pleasant. It is not too strong and is tolerable. I have an oily T-zone area yet dry in other areas. This cream has begun to even out my skin tone in just a couple of weeks. This cream has also hydrated my entire face even the oily areas are not as oily but definitely not dry. This cream has truly made a difference in my skin overall. It is now vibrant and never dull in appearance. I will consider purchasing this product on my own and highly recommend as well. Love It!!
