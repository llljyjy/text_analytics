I received the standard size in a box from Influenster and was very excited to try this. I have normal skin, combination at times. I will say this is a thicker cream and while fragrance-free, it does have a scent because of the ingredients. It will be strong at first, but dispersed after a few minutes. If you’re sensitive to “earthy” scents, this may not be for you. As mentioned, this is a thicker cream. It may be suitable for the winter, but this would be too thick for me during spring/summer. Maybe if you have very dry skin, this would be great, but for me, I would only use this as part of a night routine.  I tested it out twice as part of my morning and evening, and while I didn’t look oily, it felt like that after some time. I think this is better as part of a night routine, but it wouldn’t replace my daily, personally. Deep Hydration for Those Who Need It
