I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I have used Laneige Water Bank Sleeping mask and I instantly loved their results. Likewise, I used this serum in my night time routine and I cannot stress on how much it has helped my dry and dull skin.I have been using this product for over 3 weeks and I started seeing results almost within 3-4 days of use.It gives a dewy glow making my face supply and healthy looking. My husband generally does not notice any difference in me after using any skincare products. But with laneige, he infact asked me what I did to my skin that it looked so dewy and soft. To be honest, I am a shade brighter now. Definitely definitely recommending this to 30+ yr old women with dry and dull skin. Absolutely worth it! Soft and supple skin - Very effective for dry skin
