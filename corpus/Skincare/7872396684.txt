I got this sunscreen last year and loved it. it was great for my combo skin for the cold season. not drying, moisturizing, glided on smoothly, not greasy and sticky, was great under makeup. So for the new cold season I bought it again, and what happened?? the new formula is AWFUL! Itâ€™s sticky and greasy, and peals off terribly! It feels like a generic cheap sunscreen. impossible to apply makeup and I have to use a mattifying primer now. stop fixing what is not broken! AWFUL new formula
