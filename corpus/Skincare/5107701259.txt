I received this moisturizer for my honest review and honestly, I love it. It is a thicker cream and coming out of winter, my skin desperately needs moisture. I used it on my face, morning and evening. It goes on smoothly and soaks in without leaving a greasy feeling. It has a very, very mild scent that quickly dissipates. I had no breakouts or irritation and my skin is soft and clear. nan
