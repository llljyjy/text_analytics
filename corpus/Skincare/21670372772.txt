I received this product as a free sample through influenster for testing. It smells really nice and it is exfoliating without being too harsh. Although I liked it, it didn’t wow me and it is a little pricey for an exfoliating cleanser. The directions also seem a bit misleading because I think exfoliating your face every day would be too harsh for your skin. I have oiky skin and wouldn’t recommend using everyday. nan
