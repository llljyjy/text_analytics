I thought this device was very cute. I downloaded the app & registered it. I had trouble turning it on, but finally did. It didn’t seem to stay turned on, so I put in new batteries. That seemed to work, and I was able to measure the moisture level of my skin, cool! I tried to use it again to clean, but it was no longer paired with the app. I re-paired it. When I tried to use it the next day without the app, it didn’t work. I opened the app, but it didn’t work even when the app showed it was working. I tried a few different ways & times to get it to work before I’d had enough. Every day for a week I lathered up to use this thing & ended up just washing with my hands because it wouldn’t work. I returned it. Try something else
