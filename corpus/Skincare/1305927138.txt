I’ve been using this moisturizer daily in the morning and evening for a month. Overall, I have enjoyed this product and feel it has several benefits. First, I love the ingredients including  vegan collagen and hyaluronic acid. I don’t have to worry about the quality of ingredients with this product. Second, I appreciate it has a subtle smell. Third, the texture is thick and rich, but it absorbs easily and quickly in the skin. I love the brightening effect it leaves and that it makes my face feel firmer. I feel it has improved the look of the fine lines around my eyes since using it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great moisturizer!
