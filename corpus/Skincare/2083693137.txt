I am currently pregnant with my first child and have never had any issues with eczema in my life. About a week ago, I woke up with what appeared to be a small scratch under my right eye. By the end of the day, it had become a big, red dry patch. The next morning, it was under both eyes. I just attributed it to the recent change in weather as it has been cold, dry, and windy.The following day, I woke up with my eyes swollen and my eyelids were completely red and cracked in the creases going up to my brow bone. I knew this wasnâ€™t an allergic reaction and have heard that developing eczema in pregnancy is common. I came across this product this past Sunday and purchased by Sunday afternoon. I immediately applied to clean skin upon arriving home, then again at bedtime. As of writing this, I have been using the product twice a day for roughly 48 hours and all that remains is just a bit of redness, but the swelling, dry patches, and itchiness have all disappeared. I have never used a skin product that not only did what it was intended to do, but did so in roughly two days. Absolute miracle in a tube!
