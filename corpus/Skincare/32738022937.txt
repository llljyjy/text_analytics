i really don’t know if it’s really working or not because i still get acne from time to time, maybe because of the long hours of wearing mask? but overall:- there is a distinct smell that i kinda find too strong but tolerable - the green pigment does not really bother me at all since i wear mask and i’m just at home most of the time - i don’t think i will buy again but let’s see because there are other options out there that i still yet to try - lastly, the results took some time for me but worth a try! Uhhh
