The first two weeks of using this was… interesting. I had so many breakouts on my chin from this. I read that you should try to continue with a product for a few weeks before giving up on it, and I’m glad I did. My skin purged but now it is SO smooth!!!!! I definitely recommend but dont be alarmed by the purge stage. wonderful AFTER the purge
