This is a fantastic mask and I can see why Tatcha has such a strong following. The only complaint I have is I wish this did not have any fragrance. Fragrance is unnecessary in this product. I have sensitive skin and am particular to scents. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and the container looks stunning on my vanity. It makes my skin feel soft after use and it washes off easily.*gifted by Tatcha nan
