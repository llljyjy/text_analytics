With dark spots, you really need a lot of actives in one product, because it’s such a hard condition to treat. The formulation of this serum rivals and is superior to most top end brands like Skincuticals, Paula’s choice, Murad, Peter Thomas Roth, etc. and I would say its also much more effective than using the Ordinary’s brightening products, as its all formulated into one serum which penetrates evenly and simultaneously, and isn’t compromised by over-layering. I personally saw a decent benefit, but it was a bit too sensitizing for my skin.Warning: • Don’t use this with high percentages of tretinoin.This product is very sensitizing. If you are using other chemical exfoliants or a retinoid in your routine, this will probably be too much for you and I would go with something gentler like Faded by Topicals. Remember, if you irritate your skin it can make your darkspots WORSE!• USE SPF!!! If you aren’t using sunscreen you might as well just pump this serum down the drain because its not doing anything to you, and actually probably making things worse. This HAS to be combined with sunscreen to do anything. One of the best, but not for sensitive skin
