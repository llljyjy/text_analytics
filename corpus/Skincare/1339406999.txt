I received this product from Tula/Influnster voxbox for my honest review. This is the first time I received Tula skin care products or even heard of the brand. I was very impressed with the product, from the packaging to the vegan brands ingredients. I used the eye balm at night before bed and noticed my undereyes did feel very hydrated and looked less puffy and dull the next morning. I usually keep my skin care products in the fridge and felt that the coolness may have helped as well. Itâ€™s super hydrating, so for someone like me with dry skin this helps a lot!! Ultra Hydration!
