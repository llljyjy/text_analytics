I was a skeptical at first being a first time Retinol user and honestly a little scared as I’ve heard horror stories First week, i used 3 nights consecutively (I only use them at night of about 2-3 drops) and on the 4th day I felt a tingling sensation and my skin got very sensitive but hear me out. That’s when I discovered first time retinol user should slowly introduced it to your skin care routine. So I took a week off, and started doing two times a week (using 1 drop), then increase to three times a week for two weeks (increase it to 2 drops). I don’t get any irritation anymore ever since I slowly introduce them this way. Before photo, my skin area next to the nose (both left and right) have bigger pores and I’ve noticed them for years. Over the weeks, the pores reduced in size and the skin area actually smoothed out significantly. Aside from the pores, the skin area is brighter and some of the smaller dark spots have lighten a lot in the after picture. I’m very impressed to say the least as I’ve not found a way to minimize the pores on the side of my nose. I am definitely adding this to my skincare routine and happy that this works out really well for me. Drunk Elephant delivered!
