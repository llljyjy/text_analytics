I bought this product to see if it was any different than the ordinary’s niacinamide. I definitely did not like it as much. I feel as if it pilled a lot and made my face a bit more prone to breakouts. I have oily and slightly acne prone skin but the ordinary’s product definitely interacted with my skin better. I heard later that the inkey lists product may be better for dry skin. Not for my skin type
