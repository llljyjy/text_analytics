Absolute great serum. I received the Caudalíe premier cru through top box as a product sample. And I have absolutely fallen in love with it. I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin and doesn’t make it feel tacky or greasy. I also love that it doesn’t have a strong overpowering scent to it as well. I do have a tendency to have dry spots and areas and I noticed with just in the last few weeks that has helped clear up that area. I would highly recommend this for anyone I need help with hydration in their skin. It is definitely a product that I will be buying again. One of the best serums I've tried
