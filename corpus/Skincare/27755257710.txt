I got this product for free from #Topbox for a reviewing purpose. One sachet was enough for 2 or 3 times for me. To my surprise, the serum has shiny particles like a pearl, I haven’t seen a serum like this. Someone said here that it has a rainy consistency but for my opinion it’s not that watery but more like a Hyaluronic acid. I didn’t get any irritation, pimples or other issues. The ingredient list is quite impressive. I would be happy to try a bigger bottle.#freeproduct Like a pearl
