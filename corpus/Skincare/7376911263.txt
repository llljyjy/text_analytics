I recently started trying to incorporate anti-aging products into my skincare routine. Although this serum came in unsealed packaging, I really enjoyed it and it goes to show that quality doesnâ€™t have to be expensive. After a week, I feel like it helped cleared up some stress acne on my chin and cheeks. nan
