I absolutely loved the face wash in this set and it was the main reason I bought it. I had heard great things about it in the past and it will be the reason I give this product 3 stars. The serum is nice and fast absorbing, however It didnâ€™t feel very special/as if it was really doing much. The moisturizer, however, did not meet my expectations. It is oily, albeit not super sticky, and made me break out badly. I had tons of little whiteheads that are typical of my bad reactions to moisturizers, and I would deter you from using it if you have acne prone skin. I will likely buy the full-size face wash at some point. Good Quality - Moisturizer is bad for senstv. skin
