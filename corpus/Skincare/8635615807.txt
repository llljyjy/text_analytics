I love almost all of the youth to the people products so it was difficult to say that this one was a complete let down unfortunately. The formula is super thick and refuses to melt and remains chunky even when applied on to the face. On top of the that, every time I used it vs when I used a different cleaning balm, it would burn my eyes every time and meanwhile leaving most of my eye makeup behind :(  the glow recipe papaya cleansing balm so far remains the unbeaten holy grail Not worth it!
