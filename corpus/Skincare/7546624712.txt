I really wanted to like this product but it just left me feeling “influenced“. Spraying it on my face, even when I am careful to avoid my eye area, made my eyes sting so badly after a couple of hours. If this product was marketed for the neck area, I would have no problem with it but the ads and the name are misleading. Stings my Eyes!
