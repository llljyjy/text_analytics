I am actually flabbergasted at what this is doing for my late 50s skin !!! I’ve used almost every high end skin care products on the market and have never seen this kind of result . I’m only at 10 days and my lines are less noticeable and the little bumps are almost gone . I’m not one to exaggerate and would never say something this expensive is working if it weren’t. Absolutely stunned and will not stop using this product. Unfortunately now I have to add the eye cream and serum to my collection !!! Excellent product!!!
