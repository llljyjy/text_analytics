I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser and farmacy. I had a small sample of this and immediately bought the full size. I am now on my second bottle! It is so gentle and refreshing and my skin feels so soft after I use this. It’s clean and good for the planet and you only need a tiny tiny amount. I am so amazed at how little I actually need to use. I don’t plan on changing my cleanser anytime soon. Smells and feels divine! A must-have
