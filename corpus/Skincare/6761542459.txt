Used this for the first time today in my morning routine, under makeup, and for real, it still looks good!  I did use my usual primer with it as well, but I didn’t get the separation  and cakey look by the end of the day like I have been.  Hoping it will work long term so I don’t have to switch primers all together, but I’m impressed with this first day! what?!!
