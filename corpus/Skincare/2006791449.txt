This lotion gave me a great color and even looking tan. It was also easy to apply and I liked how it took a bit to rub in but that ensures you get no streaks. However, I did not like the watermelon scent. It almost gave off a musty BO scent and took hours for it to finally disappear. I didn’t notice any firming effects either but I’ll keep using it too see if it helps. My skin felt a bit sticky after but that went away shortly after. nan
