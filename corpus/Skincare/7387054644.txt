I received this product from influenster to test and review. I’ve been using it for approximately 2 weeks. My skin type is combination and I have been caring for my skin for 8 years now. I use this brightening moisturizer in the AM after applying a couple of other serums from a mélange of brands. I look for quality ingredients in my skincare. Tula’s moisturizer is a welcome addition and my first time using pre and probiotics on my skin. I ran it through the EWG ingredient assessor and it scored 5, which is neither “good“ not “bad“. Moreover, the shelf life indicates 12 months after opening, but vitamin C oxidizes at a quick rate and so I’m not sure how effective that ingredient will be with the passage of time. While I really enjoy using this, the price leaves something to be desired. Fancy moisturizer
