I purchased this product earlier last year in its older formulation (deep yellow tint versus the lighter beige colour now) and enjoyed the product! The original smell was similar to sulphuric acid (but not terrible) and it was something I got used to. It never made me feel sick like the other reviews. With the new and updated formulation, it smells like they’ve added perfume but there’s no fragrance listed in the ingredients on my package. I preferred the older formulation over the new one, because when I wash my face I can still smell it!! The scent is like cheap-classic grandma perfume masking the original formulation, and it’s headache inducing!! As far as the efficacy of the product 4.5/5 stars. Helps heal hyper-pigmentation from new acne spots and calms down my skin. I don’t know if I can keep using this product now unfortunately. The smell is unbearable. Fragrance!!??
