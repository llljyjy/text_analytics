Great!  Melts into your face and holds makeup on top like a primer. I love that it’s 50 and it doesn’t burn my eyes which is the biggest thing when looking for sunscreen. I was turned off by the packaging at first because it’s so flat and difficult to close to close when you have product in your other hand, but it’s flatness fits well into pockets, bags, etc.A bit pricey for the quantity, but I have yet to go through a full bottle yet and it’s been 3 weeks.
