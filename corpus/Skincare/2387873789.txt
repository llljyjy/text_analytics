I’ve been loving to reach for this sunscreen! It has a lotion consistency that doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on my oily-combo skin. Once blended in it doesn’t leave behind a white/gray cast or cause peeling. The texture is very lightweight, hydrating & leaves the complexion with a gorgeous glow! Leaves my skin looking so radiant & healthy!
