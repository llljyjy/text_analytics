I received this product free from Influenster to try and give my honest review.  I have tried this product now for three weeks and I like it. I have fine lines under my eyes and have noticed they have diminished while using this eye cream. I also like that it has a slight to no smell, is not a thick or heavy cream, did not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes, nor  did it interfere with my eye makeup durability. Iâ€™m close to 50 and this is just what I need to keep my eyes looking younger. Really nice!
