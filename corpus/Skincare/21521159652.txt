I really enjoyed this serum , it does have a slight smell of fragrance to it. I did receive a sample of this , so I donâ€™t think I can really tell if I saw any improvement but I can say that it does feel really skin on the skin and hydrating. It does take a min for the serum to sink in to your skin. Hydrating
