I received a sample of this moisturizer from Influenster & Clinique for testing purposes. I have dry/ combination skin and am always looking for hydrating and calming moisturizers. This moisturizer is lightweight and hydrating with a mild floral like scent. I used a small amount of this product daily and was only able to get 4-5 applications from this sample. I didnâ€™t notice any dramatic changes, but my face did appear more hydrated. The only downside of this product is that when I layered my sun block on top of this moisturizer I noticed some piling. Overall, I loved the scent and formula of this product!! nan
