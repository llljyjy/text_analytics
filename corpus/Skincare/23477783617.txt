Looking for a CC cream for a trip later in the summer. I wish this was available in stores because it’s hard to shade match online. The one I got from the shade finder looks too dark on the models and customer photos. I tried my best to guess based on undertone and shade (fair neutral/cool, picked 100C) but it was so cool that it made my lips and every lip product I own look orange. I added blush and bronzer and it pretty much matched my neck but I need to return it and try another shade, hopefully 105N is not too warm. I appreciate that they have cool tones available in the lighter shades unlike IT cc cream which runs very warm. It also felt very nice, didn’t break me out and stayed put through hours of walking in warm weather. I used All Nighter setting spray to keep it from rubbing off on my glasses but no powder because it was already so light. There was no pilling over the Protini moisturizer. Hard to find a good shade
