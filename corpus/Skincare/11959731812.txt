I was impressed by the non-drying formula this mask boasts, there is no tightening/drying feeling like some detox masks have, which is a plus for my sensitive skin. My skin is acne prone, and this mask has been helpful in keeping my skin clean. My one concern is the charcoal beads, it is the fun part, but they create a light physical exfoliation I am not a fan of. Besides that, it does have effective clearing ability, my pores are visually cleaner after each use, and my skin looks healthy. I also like that it has no added fragrance, and it is clean. Decent and non-drying.
