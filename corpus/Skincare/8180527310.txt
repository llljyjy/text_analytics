I’m typically a cream moisturizer girl, so when I received the Clinique Moisture Surge sample free from Influenster, I wasn’t sure a serum would be nearly as effective. My skin is typically blemish free, but the tone is somewhat uneven, and sometimes a little dry. Being 41, I also have signs of aging, like fine lines and less tight skin.The first time I applied the Moisture Surge I almost laughed. It’s so thin and light! I felt it wouldn’t hold up to my go-to product.Halfway through the day I felt my face and realized it was actually very smooth. And my face felt almost refreshed. After using it for a full week in place of my go-to I can honestly say that this is a great product. It smooths, refreshes and even make my face appear to look brighter and healthier. Would recommend to anyone similar to myself. Lightweight and Effective
