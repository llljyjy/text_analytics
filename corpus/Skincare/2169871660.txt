I guess overall it was OK. I bought this to give myself a light glow for my best friend’s bridal shower. It made my body look great and went on very evenly. But my HANDS were very very clearly orange even though I used a mitt. I can’t even imagine if I had bought the medium or dark colour....yikes. Was just OK
