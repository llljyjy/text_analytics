These reviews have to be fake. I bought this last year during the VIB sale because it had such a high rating but have not finished it. I have since come back and dug through reviews which reflect what I have experienced. Dry, burning, flaky eyes every single time I put this on my skin. Leaving this to save someone else from wasting their money. During the sale I also bought the OLEHENRIKSEN Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Cr√®me which has lasted me a long time and is very soothing... far better option than this! Dry, Burning, Flaky Skin!!  Don't do it.
