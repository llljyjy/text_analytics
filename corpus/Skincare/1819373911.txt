really enjoyed this cream as part of my nighttimeroutine and also before applying my makeup. It isthick and rich but does not leave me oily which Ireally loved about it! It says it’s supposed to besmoothing but as far as texture on my skin it looksabout the same. Maybe I need more time to see theoverall results but other then that I would definitelyrecommend if you want to splurge on a beautifulthick cream. It’s thick like la mer but without a strongscent and melts into the skin so much better!Definitely will be repurchasing for my nighttimeroutine! This only thing I wish it came with a scooper like most lux products do lux cream without the oiliness
