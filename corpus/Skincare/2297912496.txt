I got a 7 day sample to try from Butterly. Smells wonderful!!! What an amazing texture!! It doesn’t feel like an oil, it is completely non-greasy and has a silky feeling as you massage it into your skin. Absorbs amazingly into skin and feels so nourishing.Skin feels instantly soft and smooth, I couldn’t stop touching my face!!!This serum feels so good and gives a visibly noticeable healthy glow. After just a few days I felt the texture of my skin and the look of my pores improve!! Hydrates and plumps making wrinkles less noticeable. I love this stuff so much but the price tag might be a bit scary...but now that I got to sample a 7 day sample I see that very little is needed as it glides nicely all over the face. Even the tiny sample for each day was more than enough to totally spoil my face and see quick results. One component of the serum is a gel, the other half an oil, they come together and make my face happy! As far as the firming claim, I don’t know if 7 days was enough for me to speak of firming effects but it did give my skin a bouncier and plump look and feel to it. NON-GREASY luxurious oil/serum.
