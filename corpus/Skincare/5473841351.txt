I’m a supplement lover. I study for along time before adding anything to my supplement routine. This is my 3rd bottle of this product. I use it mostly when eating out .I’m a vegetarian and like to eat light on everyday bases but when eating out I don’t have a total control of the dish and used to often feel bloated and heavy , not anymore !Even convinced my boyfriend to it. He hates supplements but loves results. You just have to remember to pop a pill before a meal , the timing was the only thing i struggled at the beginning Love it for eating out
