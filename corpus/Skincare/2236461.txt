This eye cream is the best of any I have tried.  Not only are the circles under my eye lighter, the puffiness is also reduced.  I love it because it is not heavily scented and goes under very smoothly without a heavy feeling.  The lines under my eyes also appear to have improved.  Try it - you will be pleased with the results.  Itâ€™s worth the price. Bye Bye Dark Circles
