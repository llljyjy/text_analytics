After trying this eye serum for 7 days, i can definitely tell that my undereyes are much smoother. Immediately after application, it leaves my skin with a glow and super soft skin. The consistency is thin and a little bit liquidy (just like any serum) but it absorps pretty quick. It does have a slight smell but it is not too over powering. I would definitely purchase this serum to see if it really helps with firming. Leaves your undereyes super hydrated
