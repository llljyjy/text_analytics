This face wash is amazing for my skin, I have really oily skin and it works so good. I been using this product for about 4 months now and it’s so good I feel like it dries my acne out and my skin has been looking more clear lately and less oily. One thing about this product is that dry my skin a little but it’s okay because I apply the moisturizer right after and it goes back to looking fresh and normal. If you buy this face wash you should also buy the moisturizer that goes with that face wash. I also have the most sensitive skin and all the products that I bought before made it worse… but this face wash did not hurt my skin at all. BEST OF THE BEST!!
