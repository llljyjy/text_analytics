I had a chance to use this product over the last few weeks. I wasn’t sure what I would think of it because I have been using the blueberry cleanser for so long and been happy with it. This really exceeded my expectations. It is a very creamy consistency and lathers nicely. It works well for helping dissolve any makeup you’re wearing, but is gentle enough for those with sensitive or dry skin. Will definitely be purchasing this! A new must have in my routine!
