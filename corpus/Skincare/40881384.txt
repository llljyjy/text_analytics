I was given this product from Influentser, in exchange for a fair review. That said, I have no idea why they sent it to me, since my profile is very clear and descriptive .  I am 53 years old.  I am blessed with melanin. Wrinkles are NOT my life - they weren’t even my grandmother’s life when she passed at 84.  I’ve come to accept that the puffiness under my eyes are here to stay, since they’ve been here since the day I was born, but if I can find a product that will help, hey, I’m all in.  That said, Clinque Smart Clinical Repair didn’t do anything for me, so I won’t be showing a before/after pic. I don’t even know anyone to donate this product to.  Do better, Influentser - read my profile next time. Not the product for me
