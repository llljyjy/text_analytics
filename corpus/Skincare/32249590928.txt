literally my new holy grail product. Lots of people have issues with this because it either burned them, irritated them, or broke them out. Let’s not forget purging exists. And yes, of course, if you don’t prep your skin right to exfoliate, it’ll irritate and burn and wont be pleasant. Use this right after you’ve cleansed and for NO LONGER THAN 10 MINS and you should be good. If your skin gets too irritated to use this for 10 mins, start out with five and then build up, etc. Wear sunscreen. This thing really works. I never had to use a physical exfoliator ever again. incredible
