I try to be open minded in trying new skincare products, but it is very hard for me to give new products a chance with my sensitive skin. This product will definitely be added to my routine in the morning. The packaging is cute and slim, perfect to throw into my bag for travel or just to reapply throughout the day. The applicator is cool and feels amazing while applying. I noticed the puffiness went down almost immediately after application and lasted throughout the day. Helped to wake my eyes up in the morning. Would recommend this to anybody to add to your skincare routine. New addition to my routine
