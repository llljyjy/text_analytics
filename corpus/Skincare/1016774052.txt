Kiehl’s is one of my favorite skincare brands because it is nostalgic to me. This barrier cream is a great addition to their line and really soothes my dry and irritated skin. Sometimes my skin is so flakey and irritated that I can’t wear makeup, but this makes a great base. I love using it day and night and love that it comes in a tube. nan
