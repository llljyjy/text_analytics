I’ve been using the peel pads 2x/week and the serum every other night (and not on peel pad nights) for the last month as part of my nightly face care routine after cleansing and before moisturizing. I can’t say anything about ~wrinkle fighting~ so far, but I am waking up with noticeably smooth skin! Gotta be careful with this stuff though, because my usually not-so sensitive skin is sensitive to retinol etc. And note: the pads are a little rough on the skin and the chemicals do build up on the lid rings.*received complimentary via Influenster Rough, but does make skin feel smooth
