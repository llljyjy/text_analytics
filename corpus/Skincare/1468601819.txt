It really trips me out with all the bad reviews…The smell, It’s oily, well Duh, it’s an oil cleanser.  Really!  I have Never experience a smell also if you shake it before squeezing the bottle you will get a better consistency.  Oil separates from anything.  Look at salad dressings that have pil in them.  Really people.  SmhI double cleanse always and love this product and Never have I had a break out our a hard time rinsing it off or dry skin.  My skin is left glowing.While cleansing I add a lil water and it turns a lil milky on the face.  I NEVER apply this oil to damp skin. nan
