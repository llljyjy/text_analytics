This mask is amazing. I love the feel during and after use. Unlike other masks, it feels refreshing and deep cleaning. I like how it exfoliates my skin, and after cleaning my skin is powerless, even tone, and oil free. Doing this mask once a week makes my skin radiant for days. It gives an original glow and the best part for me is the vegan and cruelty free part. This mask is amazing for all reasons. But the best part is the after glow. Amazing Mask
