My skin used to be so oily and now that I’m getting older (I’m sure the cold weather and wearing masks 12 hours straight for my job doesn’t help) I’ve started getting dry peeling skin on my face, especially around my mouth. I tried piling on expensive moisturizers but this is the only product that fixed it! I also used it with the tower 28 sos spray as I read that it worked really well for someone else on here and she was right! Great for dry skin and you just need a tiny bit. 10/10
