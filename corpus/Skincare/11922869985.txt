I normally don’t leave reviews but I had to for this. My lips have been chronically dry for as long as I can remember. Regardless of the lip balm used at bedtime, I would wake up to rough and dry lips that peeled before I even had my morning coffee. I’ve tried them all - lanegie lip sleep mask, fresh lip balm, caudalie, qtica, Vaseline, Burt’s bees, etc. Some were better than others but none of them have done what this lip balm has done. In less than a week, my lips have become soft, moist, plump. There’s nothing to peel! I can’t stop looking at them and I’m totally amazed by the transformation. I was hesitant to pay so much for a lip balm, but I’m so glad that I did. I can even go without balm during the day now and my lips stay soft. Seriously, if you’ve tried it all like I have, you have nothing to lose by trying this one too. You can thank me later. HG lip balm!
