I’ve been using the Nova serum for a full week. I used it morning and night right after I cleansed my face. I followed with the Herbivore Botanical Tansy oil as well. So far, I’ve seen a lot of improvement with some of my dark spots! I’ve attached photos to show before (black top) and after (tank top). The consistency is nice and creamy. 1 pump is enough to cover my entire face. I like that the pump locks in place with a twist so I don’t accidentally waste product.I will say the scent is a bit strong for me at first. But the turmeric scent doesn’t linger once rubbed into the skin. All in all I really enjoy the Nova serum so far. I can definitely see some improvements already and it’s only been a week. I’m excited to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks of using Nova consistently. Less dark spots win 7 days!
