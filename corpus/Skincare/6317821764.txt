I was really surprised at how effective this serum worked. I have extremely sensitive skin and it is really hard finding products that don’t burn/irritate/break out my face but this product didn’t cause any of that. It actually helped calm it and reduce redness. After 3 weeks the texture had improved as well. Sensitive Skin Safe
