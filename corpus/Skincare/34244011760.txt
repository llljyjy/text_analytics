This is going to be my go to sunscreen for quite some time. I love how it doesn’t have a white cast (I have medium-light skin) and it goes on clear. I deal with persistent acne and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I love that this sunscreen protects my skin whilst also not causing me to break out. At first, I thought this sunscreen was too greasy. I have oily skin. However, I just recently realized that I haven’t been rubbing it in properly for the past several months! At least for me, it takes several minutes for it to absorb properly into my skin. If you’re having similar issues with the oiliness, try working it into your skin for several minutes. It’s personally helped me out so much! My only complaint is that this sunscreen is definitely pricey compared to others. However, I have found that it’s worth it to invest in a good sunscreen. Hope this helps you! I love the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen :)
