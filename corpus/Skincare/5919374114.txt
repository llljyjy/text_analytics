I love this serum, it’s a bit pricy but very high quality and worth the effect. It has a delightful ginseng scent. It’s very hydrated and absorbs into my skin like drinking water without any greasy. It’s quite amazing. I apply only in the morning. I do see that my face becomes very dewy and firm after a few applications. It does bring an overall brightness and improved my fine lines, esp my eye areas. Highly recommend. Highly Recommend for firm and dewy skin
