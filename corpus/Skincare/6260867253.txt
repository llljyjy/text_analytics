Some of the reviews really surprise me. First off, this isn’t advertised as providing light or medium coverage like a foundation would. It’s a moisturizer with SPF that gives skin a slight glow, so you don’t have the usual white cast that you get with spf moisturizers. It is very beautiful on the skin. I have not noticed any pilling and it absorbs fairly quickly; it doesn’t transfer especially if you’re applying appropriately by patting into the skin. I don’t have great skin (acne scars) but this leaves my skin glowing and healthy looking. My skin looks every so slightly sun kissed. I’m obsessed with it! Obsessed!
