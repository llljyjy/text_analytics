I received this product for free to try out from Influenster. It’s ok- but not something I’ll buy again. I prefer panoxyl, which is cheaper and foaming. I did notice an improvement in my acne- but I think I can get the same benefit from another 10% benzoyl peroxide cleanser Nothing to get too excited about
