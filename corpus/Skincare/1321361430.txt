This moisturizer is fantastic. I had used it before but received a free sample as well. I have combo skin, very very dry cheeks but very oily t-zone. This moisturizer soothes my dry cheeks and doesnâ€™t make my t-zone look oilier or make me break out. This is a staple for me in the winter, when my skin is so dehydrated. Love love love! So. Good.
