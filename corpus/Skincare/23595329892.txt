I’ve never owned a Drunk Elephant product before, and was so excited to receive my first sample. I already love the clever and convenient packaging, as well as the expandable pump, which makes storage leak proof and compact (and travel friendly).The formula is thick and creamy - it’s truly a balm. The scent is subtle, herby. The product is free of fragrance and essential oils (the scent is likely from the ingredients). This is a very clean product, based on the ingredient list, and it really does make a difference. The area around my eyes feels smoother and hydrated. I’m a bit hesitant to try this brand due to high prices but if you’re deeply committed to clean and high quality skin care, then this product is for you! deeply moisturizing and nourishing
