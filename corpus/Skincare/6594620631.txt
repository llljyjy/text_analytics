I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review, I havenâ€™t been using it for long but so far I love it, leaves my face feeling smooth and glowy. During the winter months my skin gets dull, any product that can change that is a plus in my book. I do recommend moisturizing a good amount after every use. love it !!
