Well I donâ€™t have much experience with the oils. But I use this one after I wash my hair simply so that it just absorbs all the nutrition. And it looks shiny and healthy. However if you put a lot then it would look sticky of course. And sometimes I use it on my face as the last step to lock in my skincare ingredients. nan
