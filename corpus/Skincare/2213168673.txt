This cleanser smells so fruity and delicious. The texture is not for me. I’m not someone who likes physical exfoliation in a cleanser. This isn’t a bad product. I could definitely see people loving it. If you have very oily skin and love a deep exfoliation, this is for you. Depends on your skin type
