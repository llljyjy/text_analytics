This product did a great job of removing all of my waterproof/ transfer resistant makeup. It comes out of the tube as a gel and turns into an oil, and I loved that it did not feel super heavy on my skin. I used this first when double cleansing, and I used a regular gel cleanser afterwards to get it off completely. I definitely wouldnâ€™t use it alone because it left a slight film after rinsing. Great for removing heavy makeup
