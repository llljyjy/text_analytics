I really love this sunscreen. It gives a nice subtle glow to your skin and protects you at the same time. I wear it under my primer and foundation and it works perfectly. Some of the sunscreens that I’ve used in the past made my makeup application kind of funky. But this one didn’t give my foundation a problem. Knowing it is Tula and clean makes it all the better. I will for sure purchase this again! Love the glow!
