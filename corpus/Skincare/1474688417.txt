These are definitely effective exfoliating pads. The mechanical exfoliation from rubbing a pad across my face plus the glycolic acid definitely left my skin glowing and baby smooth. I saw some of my pesky pimples pop up too as the exfoliation brought them to the surface. I have mildly sensitive skin and would say this can be a little harsh, so use sparingly. But I like it overall for occasional deep and even exfoliation! Deep Exfoliant
