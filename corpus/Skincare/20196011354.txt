I have combination skin & seasonal eczema so I’m very picky on my skincare products. First impressions , it’s not scented which is something I prefer to avoid breakouts! My skin color is a medium sand / tan color in terms of makeup, and this sunscreen delivered with NO WHITE CAST! I love that it does not feel runny or oily ! And so far no breakouts <3 10/10 for me !!! love it ❤️
