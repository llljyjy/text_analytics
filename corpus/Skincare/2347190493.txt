This product is bad, even worst than what I expected. The consistency is sooo runny and oily that it takes a long time to dry out (and doesn’t dry out entirely). Also, I am not sure if two or three drops are enough for a full sunscreen protection. You might probably need more than 4 pumps to get a good amount of coverage. Besides all that, the amount of product doesn’t compensate the price because if you are reapplying every two hours to get a good sunscreen protection, it would probably run out in less than a month. Don’t spend your money in this product.
