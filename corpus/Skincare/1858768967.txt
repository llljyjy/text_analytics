I’m 31 and have never had a standard AM/PM skincare routine. I have sensitive skin and would always find I’d get breakouts or my skin would become oily. With the Eadam Cloud Cushion Airy Brightening Moisturizer, I find I can’t wait to put it on after I wake up and before bed. It has made my skin feel so silky soft and I love the light cooling sensation I feel when putting it on after a long day. Bonus: I haven’t had any breakouts. Also, while one review mentions they wish it came in a pump bottle, I love that it doesn’t because I think it prevents waste. I absolutely recommend this product. 10 Stars
