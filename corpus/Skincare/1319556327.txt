I have dull, combo to normal skin with rare blemishes or breakouts but I like to use products that minimize pores and smooth my skin. I also noticed the products with AHA/glycolic acid prevent break outs for me especially after wearing masks or makeup all day. I liked this because itâ€™s clean and gentle on my sensitive skin! Love natural products!
