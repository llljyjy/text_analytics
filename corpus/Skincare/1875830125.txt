I wanted to love this product because i love Ren’s daytime moisturizer.  Unfortunately this balm just feels greasy, doesn’t absorb well into the skin, and causes me to get little breakouts the morning after i use it.  I bought it to use with my gua shua at night and it does work well for that, but will not be buying it again. Too greasy and gives me breakouts
