I received the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm as a free sample, and I am so glad I did!!! This cream is incredible! Thick and indulgent, smells good, and it smooths on so easily. I used it under my eyes (bags area), below my brow bone, and where the crow’s feet start... I saw a difference in the Lil crow’s feet I am developing too! Plumped them up just right! I will be buying this cream, I am very happy with the results. Love this product!!
