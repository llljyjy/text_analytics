I loved the initial light shade I purchased over a year ago however the most recent light shade I purchased does nothing. I also noticed the bottles in the store of the same light color were different shades/consistencies. Iâ€™m hoping this was a one off because I really enjoyed the original product of this. I use a couple of drops of the tanner in lotion when applying. different mixture ?
