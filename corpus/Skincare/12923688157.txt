I have been using La Mer products since 2016 and I’m very happy with it. My skin is very sensitive and in the winter it gets so dry because i live in Nyc. La Mer products are the only one that keeps my skin hydrated and brighter. I’m so in love with the New Treatment Lotion by La Mer i have been using it after i cleanse my face. I apply a few drops and gently press into my skin it absorbs super fast. It feels like a very thin serum, the scent is light, it’s super hydration and it doesn’t leave my skin sticky. I follow up with The Concentrate for face by La Mer, The eye concentrate by La Mer and the moisturizing soft cream by La Mer Perfect for dry and sensitive skin
