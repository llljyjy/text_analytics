It was the only new thing I added to my routine, and after a day of use, I had a terrible rash all over my face. It also made me break out. I stopped using it immediately and my skin calmed down after two or three days. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m guessing I’m allergic to something in this, though what, I don’t know. It felt greasy on my skin as well so over all it’s a nope for me. That being said, it smells great and if it might work well for those on the dryer side. However, be sure to patch test and read the ingredients first. nan
