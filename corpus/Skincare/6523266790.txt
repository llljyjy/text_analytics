I’ve enjoyed the sunscreen so far. Is it worth $60, I’m not sure. It does make my skin look better when I apply it. I store this sunscreen in a cool dry place, but the packaging is peeling off like crazy. I get bits and pieces stuck to my skin and it’s really annoying. Wish they would have thought this one through better. Good sunscreen but PACKAGING
