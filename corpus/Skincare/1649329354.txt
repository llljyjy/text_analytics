Haven’t given this product a full try yet, just the test patch in the pic. Please excuse my unshaven legs... lol. This test patch is one application after maybe 3 days. Still trying to decide if this would be a good move to try all over... but it definitely gives pigment to the skin. On my pale skin, it doesn’t come off as gradual (it’s a big change), but the color is more bronzey than orange. Maybe I’ll get brave and try it all over! nan
