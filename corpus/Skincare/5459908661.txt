Best thing for dry, sensitive skin that is acne prone. I tend to breakout on my chin often and try to spot treat. After listening to a podcast where the Esthetician recommended people with my skin type exfoliate more to prevent pimples from happening vs spot treat, I started using the peel pads every morning- and within three days saw a difference. This is the only thing that keeps the stubborn chin pimples at bay. I can’t use benzoyl peroxide or I develop a serious rash, salicylic acid is ok for a quick spot treatment, but doesn’t quite do the trick. These peel pads are amazing! nan
