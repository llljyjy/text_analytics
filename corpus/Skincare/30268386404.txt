Wow Wow Wow! I didn’t really know what to expect when I received this in exchange for my opinion. I used these pads in conjunction with the glycolic retinol serum. I am currently finishing the serum and I have about 10 pads left. I will be buying both again immediately. When I began using this, I had been on deployment for two weeks. My skin looked even worse than this “before” picture but you couldn’t have forced me in front of a camera. My skin was truly suffering from lack of sleep, poor diet, stress, dehydration, and exhaustion. It was sagging, hollow, and generally rough. I was using another high end brand of retinol at at the time, so I wasn’t expecting much from this serum. I knew it couldn’t make my skin any worse so I dove in. It felt so nice on my skin! It was a few days before I really paid attention to the mirror and I was shocked. My face didn’t look as “sunken” and I was quite surprised. That was enough to get me excited about the end results. I used the serum every night with zero irritation or burning. No adjustment time from my other skin care either. My skin looked better every day. I did the wipes when I remembered (about every 3 days). The serum went on like silk and the pads had a texture like other exfoliating pads and there was slight temporary burning on any broken skin.Now, after four weeks, I am stunned. I expected, at most, a difference in fine lines, but I am blown away. I haven’t changed anything else. I’m still not sleeping, I just don’t look like the walking dead anymore. I cannot speak for the wrinkles just yet, but my texture, the hydration, and increased volume in my face can all be attributed to PTR.  The hollowness under my eye and around my mouth were my biggest concerns and they have changed significantly. The proof is in the picture! nan
