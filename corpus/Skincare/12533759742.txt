I received ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum as a free sample from PinchMe. I really enjoyed using this serum, it made my skin look so moisturized, good ingredients and I love how it has SPF 40 also. It smooths on nicely and absorbs quickly, making it easier to add other products on top like foundation. I incorporated this serum along with another moisturizer and it fits so well in my routine. The packaging is super nice, I love the pump action so you can control the amount of product, I use three pumps.  Overall, I do recommend this product, I don’t think the color choice does anything, or I haven’t really noticed a difference with the color choice of the product. Maybe with more use over time I will see a difference. Either way, you should definitely try it. Absorbs quickly, skin looks nice.
