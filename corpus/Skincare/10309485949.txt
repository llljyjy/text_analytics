Really love these tanning drops!  I use St. Tropez’s self tanner (usually 2x a week), but naturally my face tends to fade first from removing makeup, using multiple skincare products, etc.  I first tested this on my wrist before using on my face.  The next day, I noticed a nice little tan where I had put a couple drops. It blended into my existing St. Tropez tan nicely, so I tried it on my face.  I added 2 or 3 drops to my moisturizer, mixed it together, and applied.  I put makeup on right after, so I didn’t really notice a tan until the next morning.  I love the color it provides!  Super easy to mix with a moisturizer to keep up with your tan.  It also smells AMAZING! Highly recommend. Highly recommend!
