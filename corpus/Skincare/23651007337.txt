I have very dry skin that just absorbs moisturizers quicker than I can put them on! This was one of the better ones I have used. Usually am applying moisturizer 2-3 times a day as it just disappears. This was different. I only had to apply it once and left my skin dewy for most of the day. I gave it four stars because I havenâ€™t used it long enough to get long term effects. I would recommend this to all skin types. The perfect dew
