I will be repurchasing this cleanser. It is gentle on my skin and has helped keep my skin clear. My teenage son has been enjoying it aswell. It says it is scent free but I do find it has a mild clean scent to it that I enjoy. The price point is great. I hope that Sephora keeps making this one. A New Fave
