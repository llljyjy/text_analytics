I received this product as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for a honest review. As someone who skin tends to be very dry at times I tend to stay away from exfoliating products because the can sometimes make it worse. After trying the goopglow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser I was not impressed it didn’t seem to do much for my skin. It felt good going on but my skin felt dry after. I wouldn’t recommend using it daily  maybe every other day or  1-2 times a week. I was not fond of the smell either it reminded me of citrus cleaning products. nan
