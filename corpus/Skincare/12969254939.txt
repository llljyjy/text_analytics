I received this in a voxbox from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When first trying this out I was worried that the salicylic acid would dry my skin, but it did not. My skin was super moisturized and my hormonal acne went away so quick compared to normal. This seemed lightly scented which I loved and the moisturizer came on super smooth and didnâ€™t feel sticky. Pleasant
