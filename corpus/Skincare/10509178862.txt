I’ve been using the Water Cream for years. I loved the lightweight formula. I applied it twice daily after washing my face. It easily glided onto my skin when I applied it and absorbed into my quickly making it a mess free application. My face felt hydrated and smooth afterwards without feeling weighed down with product. However, when I most recently re-purchased the Water Cream I immediately noticed that the consistently was different. The cream was no longer lightweight. It felt heavier and almost had a whipped texture to it. I really had to rub the product to work it into my skin, but eventually it felt like the smooth product so was used to so I chalked it up to me overthinking it. However, within a few hours my face felt itchy and when I was able to look in a mirror I saw tiny bumps all over my face. I immediately washed my face off and used a different moisturizer to try to soothe my face. I’m aware that people’s skin changes over time and need to adjust their skincare regimen over time. But because the cream felt so drastically different I looked into it and Tatcha has confirmed that they “had some very minor ingredient changes to the ingredient list to make it comply with international regulations.“ I am so disappointed that they changed the formula without putting anything in their product description or on their packaging in a way that i found noticeable. I won’t be using this product again. Formula has changed
