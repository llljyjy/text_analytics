I got this on sale after eyeing for a while. It definitely works to scrape out oils and blackheads. I make sure to mist my face throughout to keep it wet. You have to press a bit hard to really get things out, and that can cause redness, but it fades pretty quickly. I’ve also found that it works better if your skin has been prepped with steam or a shower. I took off a star because it doesn’t get everything, and is a bit loud. I actually thought it might be broken when I first turned it on because it was so noisy. I’m going to keep using it, it seems to really help as part of my routine. Really works and oddly satisfying
