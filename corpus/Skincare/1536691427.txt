Not my favorite Kiehl’s product, but not the worst.  I have a solar lentigo on my face, and some freckles from too much sun years ago, and I tried out this product to see if it would lighten the discoloration.  It’s an easy product to use; it doesn’t aggravate my prone-to-rosacea skin, but after 12 weeks I didn’t see a difference on the dark spots on my face.  They aren’t terribly dark, and it might work better on someone with more sun noticeable sun damage.  I would certainly use it as an all-over clarifying product, but when it comes to Kiehl’s, my absolute favorite skin product is still their Retinol Skin-Renewing Daily Micro-Dose Serum, which, if I could give it ten stars, I would. Adequate for skin clarity, less so for dark spots
