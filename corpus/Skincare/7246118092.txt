Have been using the largest jar of this cream for a few months now, have way over half left. My major skin concern was dry, heavily flakey skin, I bought the matching face wash and this cream with hopes to reduce skin flaking. I must say, now that winters starting and I’m due for the dry skin, this cream is working overtime to keep my skin hydrated. Anytime I use this cream, my skin is bouncy, glowy, very hydrated and almost seems like wrinkles are reduced, most importantly no more dry skin, no flakes just glow! I find the price would be great lower, but I can justify the price since it’s looking to last me a full year and results I haven’t seen in any other product. Fixing my very very dry skin!
