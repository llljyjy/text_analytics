I was excited about the watermelon scent bc I don’t like the smell of fake tanners. It smelt good while applying it but in the morning it smells even stronger of fake tan than any others I’ve used. The actual appearance was a no. I’ve used 10+ fake tans and I’m good at applying, making sure to not give myself streaks in the morning but this is so uneven and streaky I used once and never again. Noooooo - Just. No.
