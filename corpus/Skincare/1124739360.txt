Love! This formula is prefect for my combo skin type and dark skin tone. I love that it’s hydrating yet didn’t have an oily feel. The smell is subtle and the coverage absorbs well. I would highly recommend this formula for its protection and to those seeking a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white ghostly caste on your skin. Perfect for Melanated Skin
