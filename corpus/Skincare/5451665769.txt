The cream did not do much to cover the redness but instead left a white coating on the skin. It also dehydrated my skin. I tried applying it after moisturizing but it still made my skin look flaky and patchy. Overall the product is a dud and does nothing for redness. Drying and leaves a white cast on the skin
