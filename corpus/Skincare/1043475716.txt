This product works and it works pretty quickly. I have lines and crepey skin around the eye and saw an almost immediate improvement. It’s not a great moisturizer, but I’m not using a retinol product for that purpose. I apply it first and add a moisturizer over top. Then I add a primer (wait until it’s no longer tacky) and apply concealer with no problem.  If it’s balling up on you, use less since you need very very little. Make sure you have at least a moisturizing primer before applying concealer. Does what it says it will do
