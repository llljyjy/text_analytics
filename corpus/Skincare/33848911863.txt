Loved this product! I have very sensitive skin and before this I never used any Lactic Acid. When I first started using it gave a little tingling sensation for few seconds when applied. But it did not bother my skin. I have been using this for few weeks now and I have noticed my skin looking healthier and very smooth. Would 100% recommend this product! This Stuff Works!!
