I was excited for this cleanser because it has a really nice texture, unlike most with acne fighting ingredients, however it has menthol in it as well which gives it a strong scent and a cooling sensation that I found irritating. I would imagine those with sensitive dry skin the menthol would be counter productive. If the menthol was taken out, this might be perfect, however the price is pretty substantial...
