I’ve been using this for about a month as my daily moisturizer and I really like it! It’s very creamy (which I personally love), it’s very moisturizing without making me feel greasy and my makeup applies beautifully over top! It does have a slight floral scent but that doesn’t bother me at all and the scent fades quickly. I received this product free from influencer and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest opinion. A great everyday moisturizer
