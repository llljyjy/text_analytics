My best friend told me about this sunscreen after using it for a while. Come to find out she was actually allergic to it because she was getting mild hives even after using it for a year. she didn’t realize it was the sunscreen causing her rashes randomly. Now it’s my turn and I started having allergic reactions to this as well. I didn’t think anything of it initially just thought I was having sun rashes but I stopped using it for a few months and it stopped. I ran out of sunscreen the other day so I thought I would try it one more time and surely enough, I had another allergic reaction. It’s been two days and my neck and face are still swollen and itching. She and I have sensitive combo skin. sensitive skin beware
