For me this set was such a great value as I had been wanting to try more from the YTTP brand. Overall my favorites were the Vitamin C serum, I really noticed lightening of my acne scars, and the Yerba Mate exfoliation. I’ve since purchased full sizes. The rest of the products are ok but not better than others I’ve tried. Eye Cream is hydrating but didn’t lighten dark circles which is my main issue. Moisturizer is ok, not better than their sleep mask which i happen to love for winter. Cleanser is very average, I prefer cerave. nan
