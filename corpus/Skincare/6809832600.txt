This stuff is really nice. I’ve used it both at nighttime and during the day under makeup, but my favorite way to wear it is under makeup as a primer. It makes my face look so healthy. It’s somehow thick and lightweight at the same time. A little goes a long way. That being said, I still like to use a lot of it! At nighttime I put it over my serums and under another moisturizer. Good job Dior!
