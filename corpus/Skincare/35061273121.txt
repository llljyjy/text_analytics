after using this product for a few weeks to a month, i must say it has made a significant difference in my skin care routine & my overall skin barrier!! the texture is very nice though personally, i don’t really enjoy the smell. it’s not very strong so i don’t mind very much… the texture is quite appealing though i got this not in a pump but with a small spatula type container which i slightly dislike due to the large amount of bacteria that can grow inside the container due to the consistent contamination of the spatula…the overall product is great in my opinion though! nan
