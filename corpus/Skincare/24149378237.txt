LOVE the product.  HATE the packaging!!! Product goes on silky smooth, evens my skin tone just the right amount and more important, excellent sun protection that lasted through an entire sweaty golf round! The packaging- flakes off and sticks to your hands and face- looks like fish scales. Please please fix! LOVE the product- HATE the packaging
