Okay so the product itself is great - can definitely notice a difference on dark marks as well as it helping zits not rebirth in the same spot. Only downside is the packaging… I somehow can’t figure out how to not have it erupt every time I untwist the cap. So much serum leaks out that I feel like half the product is wasted. Please fix packaging!!!! Great! But in dire need of new packaging
