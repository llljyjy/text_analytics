This retinol oil is amazing! I have never used one before and was a little worried about the “retinol purge” people have talked about and since I have combination skin, but that didn’t happen with me! My skin feels amazing. I keep it in my skincare fridge and use it every morning after I wash my face, and my skin stays hydrated and soft all day long. I definitely recommend. Amazing!!
