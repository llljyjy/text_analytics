I have struggled with my skin the past few years. I have been trying to build a skincare routine that addresses my skin concerns including scarring, acne, and pores. When I received this product complimentary from Laneige, I fell in love with the packaging. Itâ€™s very unique in its product dispensary and the bottle itself is very chic. It has a nice but subtle smell. The consistency is perfect, not too oily (I naturally have oily skin).  I have only used it for a few days but have noticed some changes in the texture of my skin. I plan to continue incorporating it into my skincare routine. Love this product and packaging!
