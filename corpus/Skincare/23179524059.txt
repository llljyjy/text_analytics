I received this product complimentary as a sample to try it out and give my honest review. I enjoyed that this serum had a slight fragrance but not overpowering. It was easy to apply on the face and smooth in texture. I used 6 drops morning and night after washing my face and before using moisturizer. Made my skin feel like silk!  I would definitely recommend giving this product a try! nan
