Luckily I get to #trybeforeyoubuy this Caudalie eye cream for free. This eye cream is amazing and I would definitely purchase when this one I got runs out. It is light cream textured, easy to spread out and getting absorbed fast. It is definitely not heavy for eyes, so I can apply relatively generous amount around my eyes. My fine lines are getting smoothed out over the past month with this product. Trust the process and the results will show. #trywithtopbox nan
