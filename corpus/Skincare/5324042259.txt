I am not big on sheet masks but do enjoy them occasionally. Sephora masks are usually nice and very reasonably priced. Some of them have strong scent that I do not like but strawberry mask is a good one. It does have a prominent scent but doesnâ€™t feel heady or overwhelming once applied. It has just the right amount of serum so you get a well saturated mask but not too much of drippy liquid mess. Over all I enjoyed this mask and if you are not sensitive to the scents, I will recommend giving it a shot. nan
