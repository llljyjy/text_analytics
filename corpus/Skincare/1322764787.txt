I was already such a fan of NUDESTIX, so I was excited to hear about their NUDESKIN line of products. Recently, I discovered their Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel and I am absolutely obsessed. This peel visibly cleansed my pores and let me tell you, my skin is looking so much better! I have used it every other day for the past two weeks and my skin is looking more even-textured, bright and free of whiteheads/clogged pores. It seems fresh and delicious. I cannot believe how much it has helped the whiteheads on my chin and nose. My skin is now so soft thanks to the hyaluronic acid. I cannot wait to try other products from this line and have already recommended this peel to my friends with similar skin issues to mine. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Obsessed with this peel!
