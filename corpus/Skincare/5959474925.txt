This product works amazing. Hydrates your lips and plumps them up! This stuff lasts forever too, even with multiple applications a day. That being said make sure you’re picking a scent you’re going to like for the entire time you’re using the jar. Sweet candy isn’t that great of a scent, very mild and I got sick of it fast. I would recommend the vanilla or berry instead! Best product, but choice your scent wisely!
