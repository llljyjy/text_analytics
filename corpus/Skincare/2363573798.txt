I received this product to try for free. I love the pump on the sunscreen which makes it easy to dispense. The product blends in well and absorbs quick. It wasnâ€™t hydrating enough for my skin and I also expected it to have more coverageThe shade i received was a bit too dark for me. It also has an orange tint. Ok sunscreen
