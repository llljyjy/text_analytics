I have combination skin, oily t-zone and dry on the outer portion of my face. I personally use it at night and in the morning and my face has been really hydrated. It is also lightweight which I love and makes my skin very smooth to the touch. Aside from that it has spf which makes me feel protected. Also, a little goes a long way :). Would recommend. (Received from Influenster as complimentary for testing purposes). Enjoying it!
