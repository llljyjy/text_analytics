I have really enjoyed this face oil! I’ve been using it for almost 2 months and I’ve seen a difference in the softness of my skin. A little goes a long way so the bottle will last a long time. The price is fair for the product and the amount you get. The only reason it is not 5 stars for me is because I have really dry skin and this is not the most hydrating oil I’ve ever used. I do recommend though! I did receive this product complimentary for my review, but all opinions are my own. Very nice
