I love serums since I have an oily skin. This one did not disappoint. Upon application, I noticed that my pores became small and l like that it felt light. There’s also no smell so people who doesn’t like fragrance in skin care will like this one. I was given a sample for testing so I can really attest for long term effects. nan
