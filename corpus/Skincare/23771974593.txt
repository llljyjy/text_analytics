The texture of the product is insane - feels luxuriously thick and light and silky at the same time. Absorbs so easily and leaves skin feeling plump and amazing. I love that its fragrance free too. Four stars for the price, but otherwise just a really great moisturizer packed with awesome ingredients. Texture is Amazing
