I have combination skin with oily t zone. This has become my go-to *daytime* moisturizer layered under the Paula’s choice wrinkle defense SPF 30. It would be too light and drying if I didn’t put the SPF on top but it’s phenomenal for layering.Not heavy enough for nighttime moisturizer though Daytime layering moisturizer!
