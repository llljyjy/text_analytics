I received this using my Insider points along with the Ultra Moisturizer. This is definitely a great mask.  I have oily skin and large pores on my nose and lower cheek area. The upside of oily skin is less wrinkles over time, the downside is clogged and potentially large pores. This mask is not too thick and dries relatively quickly. Only a thin layer is needed and you can use in in specific areas if it is too much for your whole face. Does the Job Well
