This was fine. Just fine. The texture is pleasant, not too greasy, but moisturizing enough. I did find that it pilled if used during the day. What I could not abide was the scent - it was cloying, and did not seem to dissipate during the day. For reference, I have a sensitive nose and really do not care for scented skincare, even in my bodycare products. it's OK.
