I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. I bought this a long time ago and just like all the other reviews said I felt like it just sat on the surface of my skin and didn’t soak in. I also felt like I started to break out from using it so I stopped for a long time. I was running out of my moisturizer one night and had this one lying around and put it on since I couldn’t find the other one. Surprisingly when I woke up the next morning my skin actually looked a better more glowy and health, so I decided to keep using it again. I think the trick is to apply it right after your showers and after a while it will sink in, so this is more of a 3.5/5. nan
