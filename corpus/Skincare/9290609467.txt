I love everything about this product! I received this product complimentary from June Jacobs labs. Before using, the packaging makes sure to let you know how clean this product is. Always love cruelty free and eco friendly packaging. The product itself is a creamy liquid moisturizer. Kind of reminds me of a cream serum/sunscreen. Very moisturizing. The scent is a little overpowering at first but very refreshing. It will calm down to a pleasant light scent eventually. nan
