I understand that this product is supposed to “lift” your face, but I honestly don’t use it for that. It’s expensive and I don’t think this is an item 100% worth the price, but I think it was a good buy for me. I get terrible tension headaches and after using it for over a month I noticed that my headaches weren’t as strong or noticeable after using this every morning and every night. I used it in the morning to de-puff my face (which it does make a difference, I look awake and bright) but I mostly use this for my headaches. As for a difference in my face, I think over time it genuinely does “lift” under my chin because I see a slight difference, but my only concern is the elastic stretching over time. Also, it doesn’t stay cold as long as it did from when I initially got it. Overall: Good for headaches and waking you up in the morning, but you need to use consistently to see noticeable changes to your face. It depends
