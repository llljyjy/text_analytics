Although I received this eye cream as a sample, I really honestly enjoyed it.  I’m not a big fan of eye creams -- I’ve tried countless products over the years and never saw good results, didn’t like the scent or texture, etc.  However, with this Kiehl’s eye cream, I thought the texture and light scent were amazing.  I find myself looking forward to putting on the eye cream nightly...the smooth texture is light, not greasy, doesn’t leave a film, and feels like it’s really absorbing into the skin.  I also like how the packaging tells me exactly where I can place the eye cream (“brow bone“ to “under eye“.  Haven’t used it long enough to notice any immediate results but it’s a remarkable product and highly recommended. nan
