I suffer from adult acne hormonal acne and I’ve been struggling for years and I’ve received this product complementary for testing purposes and I’m glad I did I just wish I got a bigger size instead of little bottle but a little goes a long way and I saw results in 2 days! Y’all this is magic In A bottle for real!!!! In 2 days I noticed it evened out my skin tone, decrease formation of keloids scars and dark spots. And it’s okay to apply on top of broken skin due to acne because it speed up the healing process (truly magical) it’s not going to clog your pores, it help my acne! I noticed it was amazing at locking in the moisture! it’s extremely lighter than most products out there! I use this in the morning that’s works best for me I put it on the last after some of my other products I noticed it worked best chilled in the fridge it left my skin with a fresh gliding sensation with a powdery after fill it was weird I’ve never experienced that but I loved it but the rule of thumb always test new products for a few days on your inner arm that’s where your face won’t be a mess but this is a must!  I will have to say this is not getting the buzz it deserves! This is one thing every woman and men should own
