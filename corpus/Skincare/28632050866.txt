I actually have really enjoyed using this eye cream, it’s is on the thicker side compared to some others I’ve used but also very hydrating and wears nicely underneath multiple concealers.  I’ve only been using for about a week now so it’s too early to tell if it will work on diminishing fine line and wrinkles but has left my eye area feeling very smooth. I would have given it 5 stars but I prefer products with minimal oil due to my specific oily skin type. I am looking forward to seeing the results with continued use. Lovely, new hydrating eye cream!
