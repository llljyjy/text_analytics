I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review, YTTP is one of my favorite brands so itâ€™s no surprise that I selected this product to try and review. The texture of the serum is a mix between liquid and a gel. It is a little sticky at first but dries down and absorbs into the skin and leaves skin more hydrated and plumped. My skin remained hydrated throughout the day with just this serum, my moisturizer and sunscreen. I use this serum in the am/pm and I absolutely love it. I even noticed a difference in my smile lines as well. My skin definitely has a youthful appearance, and the texture of my skin has improved. The YTTP Oasis serum is definitely one of my favorites in my collection, and I can see myself repurchasing this in the near future. This is a definite must have!!!
