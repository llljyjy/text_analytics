I have combination skin and was looking for a good cream to apply in the evening and day time. Iâ€™m so happy I was sent a sample of the Revitalizing Supreme Moisture Youth Cream. It was super hydrating on my skin and I appreciated that it did not have a strong scent. I could definitely see a difference in just a few days! A+ product! Dream Cream!
