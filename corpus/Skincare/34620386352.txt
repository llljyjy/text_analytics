The worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It pills or separates whether I use an oil-based moisturizer, oil free, or no moisturizer! It leaves a white cast once it pills and feels absolutely gross on the skin. For the first few seconds I feel moisturized and glowy and then it all goes down the drain! It sits okay on my cheeks and forehead but my chin, nose, eyelids, upper lip, brow area, etc are all pilling! I can’t leave the house if I use this sunscreen and I’m very disappointed. AWFUL!!!
