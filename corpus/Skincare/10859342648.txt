Love this product. A little goes a long way. I’ve always struggled with acne and finding products that don’t make me break out can be a struggle. My dermatologist has me on a strong prescription for acne that is similar to Accutane. I’ve had amaaaaazing results but often times my skin will purge and tends to be sensitive. I use this every night and it soothes my skin. I wake up looking glowy and refreshed! You need this!
