Product: Amazing, feels like it transformed my skin over night, I had very dry skin and acne and this cleared up both. Issue: On the far right of the image is the 1st bottle I got in a sample kit, the product is clear. that’s the only one I’ve used. the middle is from my 1st order, I was sent a replacement which is the one on the left. they seem to be coming more yellow each time. I did get a refund, but I think I’ll have to buy it in store in the future for this product, which is hard as I’m at least 45min away from any. I also can’t find any reliable info online whether this is normal or not. Amazing product, but keeps coming yellow.
