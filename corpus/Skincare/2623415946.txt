I’m in love.  Okay, so this is potent.  I’ve been using otc retinol for years and as I’m getting older I felt I needed something stronger.  Well, this is it!  At first I was using it daily (don’t do it kids) and it left a very light chemical burn on my upper cheeks, just below my eyes, and on my neck and chest.  Healed after a few days and I scaled back to 2-3 times a week.  Still getting some light skin peeling, but after a gentle scrub the glow is absolutely insane.  It was worth the trial and error.  My skin texture is so smooth, this is my new go-to retinol WOW!!! JUST WOW
