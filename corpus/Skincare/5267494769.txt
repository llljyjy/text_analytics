I was extremely excited to try this product with reading so many good things about it improving skin texture. Texture is a great concern of miners from previous bouts wt acne. It’s light weight & applies quiet smoothly. Noticed a healthy bounce & suppleness to skin with just a few uses. Been using it regularly after cleansing & toning at night, I’m looking forward to see results with continued use, but I’m loving the glow my skin has when I wake up. Upgraded my routine a notch
