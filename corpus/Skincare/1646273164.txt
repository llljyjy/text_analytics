I received a bunch of samples and I didn’t like the fact I can’t physically get all the product out. The jar would be much better in the future. After trying this eye balm, every day and night for about 2 weeks, I didn’t notice any improvement of my crows feet, which is my main issue. However it definitely did a great job keeping my eye area moist and supple. It doesn’t have a strong fragrance- it actually might be fragrance free, a must for my breakout prone skin. Overall, not a bad experience but for the price I don’t plan on purchasing this eye cream/balm. Not bad but not great
