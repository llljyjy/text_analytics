I have been using this cream every day for the past 3 months and love it. I feel like it has hydrated my skin and has decreased my wrinkles. I received 2 complimentary jars of this and am expecting to start the 3rd jar sometime this week. Definitely worth the price for how long it lasts! The pictures I uploaded of the full face was from shortly after starting the cream and the close up picture is the most recent. Hydrating and reduces wrinkles
