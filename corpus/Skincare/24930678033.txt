just a heads up- this has a smell so beware - patch test !!!!! - start use once a week and gradually up your usagei used this in conjunction with other products and it has definitely been a game changer. this has a serum/gel like texture so apply after moisturizer. follow up with spf if you apply at the beginning of your day. i noticed this didnâ€™t react well when i applied my glow recipe bha/aha toner so stay away from those ingredients while using this product. also be cautious of how much you exfoliate when cleansing your face, this product might irritate. JUST MF BUY IT
