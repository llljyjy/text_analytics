I was going to buy this online until I read the reviews that said it smelled bad - I went to the store and sure it enough, this is the worst smelling product ever. I thought I could stand the smell, so I smelled it again and it was so bad I put it back. Also the bottle oozed immediately after I took the cap off - bad design. I’m glad I was able to see it in person before deciding if I would buy. I probably won’t ever buy this no matter how good it is, until they change the scent. Smells so bad, not for me
