If you love the smell of jasmine, then you will instantly fall in love with this sunscreen. It smells luxurious. It comes out a touch yellow but blended into my light-medium skin seamlessly. The texture is perfect for a makeup primer, or just on its own! Makes skin so blurred and smooth! Love it. Your new jasmine SPF
