This definitely does tighten the skin, but it wore off once my natural face oils came through. About an hour. Plus, i tried putting makeup over it, and it completely took away the firming effect. I didn’t experience the white cast like other reviewers. TIP: Put the product on laying on your back. Have a hand held mirror so you can see exactly where you’re applying it. Wait for it to dry completely before standing up. . Works, but...
