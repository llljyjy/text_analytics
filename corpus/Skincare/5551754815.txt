I started using this a few days ago after returning from a trip that left my skin dull and acne-ridden. While it’s too short of a time frame to see long-term results, I was pleasantly surprised by this. My face felt noticeably smoother after my skin absorbed this serum. It’s a bit more watery in consistency than I was expecting. nan
