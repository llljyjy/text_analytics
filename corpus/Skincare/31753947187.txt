I usually don’t write reviews or anything but this could be just because of my skin type. I will say this stuff smells AMAZING. But the results I got from it; were not ideal. I had the worst breakout on my face I have ever got. I had literal pimples everywhere. The only thing I changed in my routine was this. So before pointing the blame I stopped using it and bam my skin cleared up. I’m not sure if the fragrance irritated my skin. But I know my skin hated it. But the feel of it and smell was amazing. Maybe not meant for dry skin. If you oil or non sensitive skin this may work for you! Not for Dry skin
