Omg, where has this been all my life? I no longer wear heavy makeup every day (now that I work from home), but I’m big on mascara and brow makeup, so removing it can sometimes be a challenge. I tried micellar water and while it’s good for removing foundation, it’s not great for my eye makeup (plus you have to rub it into your skin so hard!) I used to remove makeup with jojoba oil, but it was always so heavy and would sometimes leave a residue even after washing. This is an excellent in-between product. It feels like it’s really lifting all the dirt, oil, and makeup from my face after a long day, and i find I really enjoy applying it - it feels soft and luxurious. I’m not excited about the price point, and a little bit of the product clouds my eyes, but I will happily take those two cons over the harsh rubbing and pulling I had to submit myself to with other makeup removers. this is the one I’ve been looking for
