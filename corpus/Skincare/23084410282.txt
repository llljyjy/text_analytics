I was using Farmacy’s products for my face routine, but recently grabbed a set of 5 products from glow recipe, and it has become my new favorite brand! This moisturizes my skin like no other, and I’ve tried quite a few brands out there due to having itchy/flaky eyebrows. I can feel an actual difference in moisture and softness, and I mean all day long. This product along with all the others I’ve tried have been absolute game changers! My face is overall clear most of the time, but sensitive when using products. Having said that, I love that this is a clean brand at Sephora. Definitely recommend! nan
