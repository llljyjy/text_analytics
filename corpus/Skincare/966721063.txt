I received a sample of this from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. It is scented but not heavily and the smell is pleasant. It has a very thick consistency. My skin was feeling a little dry from the cold weather and soaked it right up. It made my skin feel very soft and well moisturized. It could be a little too thick for some people. As far as helping with fine lines, I didn’t notice a big difference, but the sample I received was pretty small. I had enough for a handful of uses. Overall, it’s not bad. I don’t think I will be buying it. nan
