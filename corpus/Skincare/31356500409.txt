I love the Dior Off/On foaming cleanser. My skin feels clean and not overly dry. it feels moisturized and fresh after each wash. The scent is light if any scent at all. I have oily skin but it is not irritating and did not cause any breakouts. I strongly recommend! I received a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion. A must try
