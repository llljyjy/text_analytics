I haven’t tried probiotic skin care before and have heard many good things about Tula products so I was excited to try this product. Seeing ingredients like caffeine, apple and watermelon along side tried and trusted ones like hyaluronic acid and squalene. I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about a month and while I’m pleased with the product, I didn’t see a significant change in terms of reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eye area. Pros:- this worked very well under makeup. I didn’t see creasing or wear time of my usual makeup affected by the product - Within only a few days the skin around my eyes was more hydrated- I think the stick balm design is really innovative and reduces product being wasted, or messy application Cons: - I didn’t see a difference in fine lines and wrinkles- the product takes quite a long time to absorb, so I prefer to apply it at night or I have to allow enough time before makeup application - the stick pulls a bit upon application, which seems counterintuitive considering the sensitive skin it’s treating Innovative design
