After only using the product for one day I saw results! I struggle with acne and have been on tretinoin (which if you have tried it you know dries your skin out a lot). Because of this I have been experiencing dry flaking skin. I only use this once a week on the days I don’t use my retinol and it gets all the dead skin off in one go! Not to mention a little dab goes a long way. This product makes my make up lay beautiful too! I will definitely be purchasing a refill when it’s time. Texture GONE!
