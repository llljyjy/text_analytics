I was recommended this product as a chemical exfoliator due to my makeup looking patchy or dry on some areas (e.g. cheeks or my temples where I layer more products for blush, contour, bronzer). I use this in the PM after cleansing my face, and I slather on a thick moisturizer (I use Cerave). I try not to use it everyday; I alternate on nights I use retinol cream on my face. But this has been life-changing! My skin’s complexion has never looked brighter and cleaner up until now (and it’s only been about 3-4 days since I started using this). I used to think I have NO HOPE in fixing my skin problems (red hyperpigmentations, uneven texture, dull complexion, pimples here and there)—but with the proper usage of this, it’s helped my skin sooooo much! On nights I use this, I don’t use other products other than my moisturizer after cleansing my face. I wash it off in the morning or when I’d wake up to go somewhere and put on moisturizer + SPF (as skin can be more sensitive when first using this). LIFE CHANGING! DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE USING!
