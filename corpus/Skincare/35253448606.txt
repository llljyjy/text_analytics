I received Shiseido’s Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate complimentary from @influenster and @shiseido for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for a few days now and I can honestly say I am seeing a difference so far. My skin looks and feels smoother and is staying moisturized despite the cold weather! My skin has a tendency to get both oily and dry during the winter (weird I know), but I feel like my skin has been balancing out since I’ve started. One thing I noticed right away was that the Concentrate absorbed into my skin and didn’t leave any greasy residue, which I appreciate throughout the day! The product features “Fermented Roselle Extract” which “increases water retention and protects skin resilience” and “Heart Leaf Extract” which “detoxifies, soothes and strengthens the skin’s protective barrier.” So far I’m enjoying it and I think it’ll be a keeper in my daily skincare routine!#shiseidoskincare #ultimune #complimentary @Influenster @shiseido This is a keeper!
