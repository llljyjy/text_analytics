I LOVE THIS SUNBLOCK . I love all tatcha products in general but this is an amazing sunblock. It is a little tinted and i wasn’t expecting that but i don’t hate  that it is . It’s light weight and applied smoothly! Leaves a fresh dewy look if you’re not putting any make up on top of it . Been using it for about a week now and not break outs! nan
