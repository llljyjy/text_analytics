it’s been a week of using this daily along side a couple other Tula products. So far I haven’t noticed any change in my dark spots or fine lines but I have noticed the bags under my eyes have firmed up. It does absorb into the face just fine and doesn’t feel gooey or sticky at all. since starting this line I have noticed my skin is so smooth and soft feeling and it lasts all day. when first applied I did notice at bit a stinging feeling and slight redness on my skin but it didn’t burn and went away quickly. I give it a 4 out of 5 as I’ve only been using it a week and still waiting for promised results. nan
