I’ve been trying to remember to use this every night before bed after my shower.  I work outside all day in the cold and my face gets super dry.  This is really helping my skin glow.  It’s quite oily at first but within seconds it soaks right into my skin, making it really feel like velvet.  It smells like wine and leaves me feeling fresh and ready for the snow! velvet!
