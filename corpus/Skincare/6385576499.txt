This product is my beauty staple!  I first bought it late in the pandemic because I was bored and browsing Sephora and it looked interesting.  But after two weeks of use on my face I realized that I had better skin that I’d had for over a year!  It nourished my dry skin, making my face bright and even-toned without any of the greasiness I’ve experienced with other facial oils!I bought some more before my summer roadtrip to the Utah National Parks, and used it as a face/body/hair oil.  It single handedly kept me presentable through 4 weeks of desert summer.  I’ve now completed my 3rd bottle of this product (in about 1.5 years) and it has become a staple on my vanity  that I absolutely cannot live without (I’ve even bought some for my mother!). A must have staple for dry skin
