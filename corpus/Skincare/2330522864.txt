I really love this product. It has an amazing relaxing smell (reminders me a little of lavender), which is perfect before bed. I will often use only this product after washing my face if I feel like keeping it simple for my evening routine. My skin always looks amazing in the morning after using it. This would not be for you if you do not like any fragrance, it is a very light and natural smell though. Love the light fragrance
