As someone who has sensitive skin, I can say that this product is safe for it. I had no issues with this product on my skin. The product has a nice, minimal, scent. A little goes a long way and it absorbs pretty quickly.I am not one who likes to be glowy so I was pleasantly surprised that this gave me just the right amount of glow and I didnâ€™t look like an oil ball. nan
