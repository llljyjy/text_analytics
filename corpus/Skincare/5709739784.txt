I have only been using this product for a few days but it does feel quite nice on my skin. I do have fairly dry & sensitive skin. From what I can tell so far, itâ€™s not having any negative affects on my sensitive skin. However, I think I would prefer it to be a bit more hydrating for my dry skin. Otherwise it seems great so far! Seems good!
