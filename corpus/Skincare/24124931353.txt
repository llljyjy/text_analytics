I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. This is such a great everyday moisturizer. It hydrates my skin but does not make me greasy after few hours. The texture is somewhere between a gel and a cream. It absorbs really quickly too. It does not feel heavy and did not make me break out. The cream has a faint citrus candy smell which I quite enjoy. It is expensive for sure but worth it. Love it!
