For a light weight moisturizer, it is actually quite oily/sticky while applying. I think it takes some time to get absorbed into the skin, but hasnâ€™t left my skin overly greasy a couple hours after application. I love the refills since it makes the product more affordable. Will try for a few more days to see if this will me my go-to moisturizer from now on! nan
