My skin type is dry and honestly feels like the sahara desert during the winter! I’m always trying to find ways to keep it moisturized via skincare and humidifiers.I’d heard of Kiel’s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask and knew it was a beloved product for many people already. And I can tell you it’s absolutely worth the hype. Pros:- Extremely hydrating, only need a small amount which makes the product last longer- Long-lasting, which is great for a super-dry gal like me!- Relatively short & great ingredients. I use tretinoin so the simple & hydrating ingredients work best for me!Cons:- I don’t love the jar packaging. I prefer skincare that uses pumps or squeeze bottles because I find it more sanitary- This isn’t an issue for me, but the product is very thick. Less is more for this and if your pores clog easily, this may not be for you Perfect Winter Moisturizer!
