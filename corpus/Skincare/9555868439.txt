I’m an avid sunscreen user and used supergoop unseen sunscreen for almost 3 years before switching over to Sunday Riley’s light hearted sunscreen. What I liked about the former was how easily it spread but Sunday Riley sunscreen gave my skin the shine it needs given the dry texture. This product is a miraculous combination of both! I loved it in the first go. It spreads so easy and gives my face a great matte finish leaving behind no white cast. Def repurchase! Holy grail alert!
