I bought this in hopes it could replace the discontinued Tarte Ready Set Radiant spray, which was able to provide a moisturized feeling to my face when I sprayed it on over makeup. (I am not a fan of *looking moisturized* I care about actually feeling moisturized with my too oily yet too dry skin.) This stuff doesn’t really do a comparable job despite having the most similar ingredient list I could find. If you just want a dewy look, this is probably fine; but if you want something to penetrate your makeup to moisturize when your skin gets too dry after you’re already done up, this isn’t really cutting it. Not very hydrating
