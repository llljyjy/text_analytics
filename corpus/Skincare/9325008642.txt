This is probably my least favorite moisturizer I’ve tried from Sephora. It has a really off smell, which usually I wouldn’t mind but I can’t get over it. It might be from the rose hip oil, but it smells like a foot. The ingredients list looks great, but I don’t like the way it feels on my skin. It feels cheap and not rich enough. If I didn’t use SPF or a serum prior this would feel drying and very matte which is not for me. nan
