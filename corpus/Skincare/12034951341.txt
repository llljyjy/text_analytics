The very first time I used Confidence in a Cream, I loved the way it made my skin feel.  It went on smoothly and absorbed into my skin. All of a sudden, it had a silky, soft appearance. I have been using it as a part of my morning and evening routine for almost three weeks. I can already see the fine lines in my forehead and at the corner of my eyes fading. This cream is wonderful! Love it!
