I received this product from Influenster in return for my honest review. This is first gradual tanning lotion I have tried so I have nothing to compare to but I did like it quite a lot. Itâ€™s easy to apply and it does feel like a regular lotion at first but then you get a little darker and darker. I will definitely be using it this winter and on the spring to avoid getting pale white as I normally do during cold season nan
