Such a good product. I love this blush because it’s light and as someone with rosacea this takes my already rosy cheeks and makes it look like it’s on purpose with the sheen that comes with this product. A little goes a LONG way so I’ve had it for a long time. To compare to the rare beauty it’s a lot lighter and less pigmented which I like and it’s a lot more blendable since it acts almost as a skin care product. I got a sample size of this and RAN to buy the full size. The only reason I knocked a star off is because it’s expensive. nan
