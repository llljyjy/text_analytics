I absolutely love this product.  I have severely dry skin.  I will say the only downside to this product is it was very thick to go on (I am assuming BC it has SPF 15). It can feel like there is a little oil left over on the skin hours after application.  I loved the way it lasted all day and went well under my tinted moisturizer.  I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the “Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm“ so i stopped all Clinique products but highly recommended for my dry (without acne) peeps. nan
