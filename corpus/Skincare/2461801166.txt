I was honestly excited to try this product with the squalene. At first I thought it was going to be creamy, but itâ€™s more solid like a balm. The instructions says to use your fingertips, but I used a spooky instead. I would leave the mask on overnight and did not notice much difference. Maybe a bit hydration. Although it did not irrate my skin since I have sensitive skin. Bonus: It has no fragrance! This may benefit people with skin more on the dry side since I have combo skin. it will be great for dry skin
