So far I love this product. I love how silky the product is and the way it feels when applying. I used the right amount for light coverage and it looked beautiful on my skin. It made my face have a do we glow look. Their is a healing dark spot on my face and it covered it lightly, but if I build on that, Iâ€™m sure it would minimize it even more. Love the silky feeling
