I had the opportunity to try out the new Tula Balancing Act toning pads and was overall impressed by the improvement I’ve seen on my skin using these pads as part of my nighttime regime. The pads have a nice refreshing mint scent and leave your skin refreshed and cleansed when dabbing on your face. While the pads are somewhat tricky to separate from each other (to avoid accidentally using 2 stuck together), the pads do an amazing job lifting extra oil from your skin that weren’t able to be cleaned through a cleanser. I especially LOVE how regular use of these toning pads doesn’t dry out my skin or result in any redness or breakouts, and overall leave my skin toned, refined, and more matte during the day. Leaves skin refreshed, toned, and matte!
