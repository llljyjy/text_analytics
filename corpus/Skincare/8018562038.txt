I got this as a sample first and I absolutely love it so I immediately purchase the full size, but for some reason it’s different than the sample, the sample is more creamy and leaves a bit of a matte finish while making my skin looks great, but the full size I bought has more of a watery texture, and it did little for my pores. I even checked again and again to make sure they are the same product, 2 stars because it still smells lovely and glide on nicely, but I don’t think I’ll ever buy it again. nan
