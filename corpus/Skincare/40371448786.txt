Receiving the full size version of the Lancone Renergie H.C.F.  Triple Serum was an awesome surprise. I tried the serum for the suggested two weeks period, adding it to my normal skin care routine. I did notice how much softer, supple, and less pores. My skin didn’t feel dried out or irritated after application. It absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving any sticky residue. It’s definitely lightweight. My one minor con is the dispenser. When I first pumped the product out I wasn’t getting an even amount of the three serums and that may affect the effectiveness of the overall product. For the price tag I would have thought the bottle would be made of glass. I’m glad it isn’t because I’m clumsy but it would have given it a more luxurious feel. I really liked the  colors of the packaging. Nice addition to my skin care routine
