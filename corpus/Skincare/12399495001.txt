This was my favorite moisturizer before they changed the formula. I appreciate that it’s “clean” now, but the change left my whole face with zits quickly after I started using the new jar I purchased. I hoped it would mellow out after a few weeks but it only got worse. I ended up throwing the rest of the jar away, I didn’t even want to give it to someone else to test it. Not to mention that it didn’t moisturize my face anymore and also left a sticky feel. This was my go to, day & night moisturizer but i have since had to find a new alternative. Horrible, no longer worth the price. new formula is awful
