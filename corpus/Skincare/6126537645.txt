Love this sunscreen!  I use it on the days I wear foundation as the last step in my skincare routine (I use Supergoop Glowscreen on days I don’t wear foundation).  It is invisible and doesn’t pill under my makeup, and the texture is nice.  For reference, I have very dry, sensitive skin and this isn’t irritating at all. nan
