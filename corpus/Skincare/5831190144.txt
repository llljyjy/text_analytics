I have very dry skin that reacts badly to some ingredients (retinol, for example). During winter I have dry patches and during summer I can easily burn. So, I use good cerimide moisturizers all year long. This is a great one! It’s not the typical heavy cream, but still very hydrating. It don’t peel under makeup, works great with additives like Booster drops and oils. My only complaint is the price point. But this brand is amazing and I’ve already tried another products. Good moisturizer for dry skin
