I have mixed feelings about this product. More often than not it does flake and/or up. I’ve tried various methods of application: a little, a lot, soon after moisturizer, waiting a long time after moisturizer and there’s no consistency in how it ends up. There have been times when it works perfectly and looks amazing all by itself, but I try to recreate the application method and again it’s flaky and honestly a little gross looking. Trying to correct the flakiness makes it worse. For the price I’d expect top notch quality every time I use the product. The search continues. Mixed results. Honestly I’d give 2.5 stars
