Tip kinda- for better results I stopped just applying it like a serum under stuff and I started to mix it in with other products, it gives a nice slip to make moisturizers spread a long way. The price is amazing!! I literally ordered this for $4 (free shipping) Buy it <3 Perfect, inexpensive skin oil
