First time trying dermatologica & I am loving it! Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry. Sure really nice & feels good on skin. I like that itâ€™s unscented. Have been using consistently for about 2 weeks and I feel like I can already see a difference with the skin. My husband is now obsessed with this face wash! nan
