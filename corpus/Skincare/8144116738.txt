Love this. I was having a break out and I used it. It dried out my pimples ( just a dab with q-tip) and I have a cold sore for 2 weeks. It healed it. I don’t know how. I have sensitive skin so I don’t used this for toning or exfoliation. And I used this once a month in my under arm after shower. I don’t like deodorant and I don’t sweat that much. nan
