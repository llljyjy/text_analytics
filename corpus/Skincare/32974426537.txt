I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion and review. The product is packaged in an elegant white tube placed inside a white sleek box. It has a nice creamy texture and foams up nicely when applied to your face with water. It left my face and neck feeling clean, soft, moisturized and smooth. There was no dryness or tightness like I’ve experienced with some cleansers. I’ve been using it for over a week and I still have almost a full tub. You only need a small amount to thoroughly cleanse your face. The only thing I do not care for is the fragrance and the amount of time it takes for it to wear off. I would recommend this product.
