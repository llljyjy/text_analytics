The smell is so off putting I was compelled to write a review (which I never do). It literally smells like yeast mixed with rotten eggs, mixed with sweaty socks. Literally every morning and night I’ve applied this I’ve complained to myself about the scent (I’m not even that picky) but I will never repurchase based on that.In terms of the quality, I believe the ingredients work as advertirse and the texture and feel of the cream is very nice. I also like the skin balancing/ protective ingredients and the nice glow it leaves…However the smell is just too much, and for this price I would rather go for the DE Lala cream, which is perfect in every way. worst smell I’ve ever experienced
