So...a lot to unpack here. The only reason the product is getting 4 stars is because the packaging leaks and it creates peals on your face very easily if not applied properly. I sampled this product at Sephora and really liked it. I love the dewy finish and its perfect for the “clean girl“ look that is becoming popular. Another plus is that it has SPF. I don’t use this as my daily SPF because I have another one that I use. I don’t necessarily recommend this as a daily SPF because I noticed that the first time I used this it created little peals on my face. If you do use this as a daily SPF wait 5 minutes after doing anything in your skin/makeup routine before this and wait another 5 minutes after using this if you will be applying anything on top. If you are fungal acne prone or just have fungal acne be cautious about using this product because it made mine flare up (which is why I don’t use this everyday). Other than that there isn’t anything bad about this product. I love this and use it a lot in my makeup routine. LOVE...but.
