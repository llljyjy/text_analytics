I liked this Brightening Vitamin C cream it’s very light which I like for my Vitamin C cream. It doesn’t have a strong scent, a slight lemon scent, I prefer a nice scent with my creams. It does seem to lightly brightening my skin, I have used other Vitamin C creams that brightened my skin more. Overall it’s pretty good. nan
