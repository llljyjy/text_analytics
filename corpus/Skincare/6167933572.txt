The Avocado line of Glow Recipe is my absolute favorite! As someone who is just getting their gut health back up to par, and healing my skin in the process, this product helps speed up that process. It is so moisturizing while using, and with continuous use, I noticed that my skin felt super soft and smooth in the mornings when I woke up. I go between this wash and the Blueberry Bounce cleanser, but for the winter months, I think Iâ€™ll stick to using this wash the most! Glow Recipe did it again. It amazes me how great every single one of their products are, you can tell they put a lot of work and love into making sure every product works! Amazingly moisturizing!
