I received this product as a free sample to test for an honest review by @Influenter. I have used the product for about a week and reduce puffiness and sunken/dark circles. It’s cool and refreshing on the under eyes area and feels like a delicate massage. It’s very refreshing to use after a night sleep to start the day with some self care. nan
