I’m replacing a much loved clairsonic brush after many long years. I was really hesitant and skeptical that the foreo would create the same kind of lather and luxurious deep clean feeling. After a week this brush has really impressed me, it still creates a good lather with much shorter ’bristles’, and feels much softer overall than the bristles of the clairsonic. It’s a nice touch that you can customize the intensity and length of pulses for different areas of the face but it’s slightly frustrating that face cleansing brush needs my email, age, skin concerns, and even location (bluetooth), to even turn on. Feels really invasive for something that just needs to vibrate. You don’t need the app after the first setup if you don’t want it but, they’ve already collected the information.... Final comment is that because of the small nature, my whole hand and forearm get drenched every single time I use this, manageable but can be messy. Replacing Clairsonic, Happy Shopper
