I have never taken the time to write a review but had to with this one.  This razor is a total gimmick.  Nicked myself badly on the back of my ankle (while following the directions of not pressing down on the razor) - something I haven’t done in years.  The shave doesn’t last any longer than a regular razor.  Majority of previous reviewers are “incentivized“ - I won’t trust those type of reviews ever again.  Really shocked by how bad this item is. Don't trust incentivized reviews.  Razor sucks!
