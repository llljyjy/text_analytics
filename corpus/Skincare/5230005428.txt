15/10!! I am OBSESSED with this cleanser! I’m gonna start off by saying I’ve been so discouraged about finding a good cleanser for months and this is it!!I was using VaniCream since my skin is super sensitive but I’d have to wash my face 4-5 times to just feel clean (even had to use an oil cleanser as well along with it) After my first use of this cleanser, i felt refreshed, soft, and CLEANSED. The fragrance is overwhelming sometimes, but it’s truly incredible. It’s been a month of me using it and my skin feels clearer as well. So good for sensitive skin + u feel the cleanser working, thank u Biossance! best cleanser ever for sensitive skin!
