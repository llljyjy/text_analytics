If you have oily or combo skin, you should be using this! You can feel it working immediately after application. Super easy to apply and rinses clean, leaving nothing behind. Really cleans well inside the pores as well. I absolutely love this. My face feels amazing and it doesnâ€™t dry my skin out or cause breakouts. In my opinion? A nearly perfect mask. For the above-mentioned skin types. Light, pleasant fragrance that dissipates after rinsing. Nothing crazy. Magnificent product.  Highly recommend! #trywithtopbox #free #freebie #freeproduct A MUST for Oily/Combo Skin!
