I received this complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. There were things I liked about this cream- the smell, which has a slight sunscreen smell to it but was not overpowering, and the texture. I did not get the intended results. My skin still felt and looked dry and flaky, especially under my foundation. nan
