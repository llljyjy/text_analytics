This is my first time sampling a skin product by Fenty. I have been applying the “Fenty Skin, Cookies and Clean Whipped Clay Detox Mask to my face for approximately three weeks. In application, I applied to my face on two separate days during each week and for fifteen minutes each time. After using this skin product for approximately three weeks, I could definitely notice a difference in the reduction of oil on my face. Also, my pores on my face looked reduced in sized. In comparison to other products with similar claims, I believe this product truly lives up to expectations and definitely delivers results. I would definitely recommend the “Fenty Skin, Cookies and Clean Whipped Clay Detox Mask,” to any one that wants a great skin product that works in controlling excess skin oil on your face. nan
