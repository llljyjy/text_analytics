I realllyyyyyy wanted to love this product. On paper its exactly what I wanted. The good: it feels great to apply, like a light cooling moisturizer, the packaging is beautifully designed, not greasy or oily, it seems to reduce some redness The bad: it really does next to nothing. The glow can be comparable to any glow you get from a drugstore sunscreen. I took tons of photos and videos to compare wondering is this doing anything? I’m not sure how much you should be applying but it seems the more you apply, the more it emphasizes texture. I will admit in some lightings it looks pretty, like in low indoor lighting. But in direct sunlight it’s just lackluster? There’s really no difference Does it actually do anything? No not really
