Wanted to love this but it made my skin so greasy looking. I’m black with combination skin and while I do think this did pretty well with the white cast test (didn’t leave me looking like a ghost) it just felt super greasy applying and once it was on. Giving it the stars for the sheerness and the fact that it didn’t burn my eyes - but definitely wouldn’t buy again Made my face way too shiny
