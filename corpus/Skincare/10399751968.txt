This serum is liquid gold in a bottle! The smell is heavenly, and as a saffron lover it is everything dreams are made of! It goes on so smoothly and adds the most beautiful glow to the skin! I’ve been using it everyday for a month paired with my Kansa wand and my skin looks brighter, more even, more supple and over all so happy!! I cannot express what a game changer this serum has been! The littlest bit goes the longest way so it’s lasts quite a while too! If you’re worried about the price, let me just tell you that it leads to noticeable improvements and is worth every penny! Liquid gold in a bottle!
