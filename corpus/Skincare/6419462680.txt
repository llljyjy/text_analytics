Received this from Influenster to test out and review. Been using this for 2-3 weeks now, wanted to give it a fair shot before reviewing. So far I can say it’s very lightweight and leaves a velvety feel on your skin. Doesn’t pill under other skincare & doesn’t take long to sink into the skin. I do notice less redness in the morning when I apply it before bed but to see long term results, you need to give products like this 6-8 weeks of consistent use. I’ve been using this a few times a week and so far I do see myself repurchasing this. I like serums that feel nourishing without feeling heavy or tacky. So far it’s a thumbs up from me! Nourishing and lightweight
