Love this luxurious 3-in-1 cream! It is very gentle to my very sensitive skin, even when I had skin rash issue that needs a powerful moisturizer. After using for a week I can tell that the cream helps bring out a smoother skin with more elasticity. I havenâ€™t experienced a noticeably brighter skin after a 1-2 week use but it seems to help improve my uneven skin tone. Longer use might bring the full benefits. Overall very satisfied with Lancome products (Genefiqe, Tri serum) and this one in particular. It is quite affordable if on sale. Amazing luxurious cream
