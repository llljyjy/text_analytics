When I first received this product, I was not a fan. I felt like it just sat on top of my skin and was greasy feeling... But then my awful dry winter skin started. I was going through my basket of potions, and decided to give this another shot. Now I love it! My skin is rehydrated and smooth and does not feel greasy at all. This product has saved my skin! Iâ€™m almost out and definitely will purchase more. Happy I gave it a second chance.
