This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. Chemical sunscreens give me a lot of brown spots from the heat, so I have to stick to physical sunscreens, but they often make me break out from leaving a residue even with double cleansing, and also feel thick and heavy with a white cast. I have tried every possible other sunscreen, cheap, expensive, popular, korean, dermatologist recommended, none work the way this one does! Protects, feels lightweight (I don’t even feel it after 10 minutes) doesn’t make me break out, doesn’t leave a horrible white cast, doesn’t look like I’m wearing a layer of foundation. I don’t wear makeup during the day so I can’t speak to how well it works under makeup, but for me it’s absolutely perfect. Please don’t ever stop making this. The only bummer is it does stain white clothes, but I still wouldn’t give it up. nan
