I haven’t used this as regular as I should but that being said - a little goes a long way. It’s hydrating, silky and I have noticed smoother, tighter pores without my sensitive skin breaking out. I’m happy there is a refill option to minimize packaging so this just very well fit in my routine. I did see that they still test on animal “when necessary” so while they seem in the right direction, I will most likely seek out a cruelty free alternative. Good for sensitive skin
