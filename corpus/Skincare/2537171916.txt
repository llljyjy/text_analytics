This is a great product for my combination oily skin. I was afraid at first that it would be harsh on my skin but it did the opposite. Iâ€™m not usually one to purchase gel moisturizers but decided this was a great way to try some and I was very pleased. A gentle moisturizer that I would recommend for all! A great moisturizer!
