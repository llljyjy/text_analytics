Loving this Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme by Estée Lauder. It’s texture leaves you feeling smooth and silky without the greasy feeling that can come from some other creams. You only need a dab or two to feel its effects. The feeling of prickly pear enhances your skin. It quenches and gives it nourishing replenishment. A definite feel good fix for your face to help to aid in long term healthier skincare. Silky and Sublime
