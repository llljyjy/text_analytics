After using Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream for a while, I am completely impressed by my experience so far. Since I have started using this product, I no longer have to reapply my day moisturizer multiple times in order to prevent my skin from getting flaky in patches. I have also noticed that my skin looks smoother and clearer. I also like that this product absorbs into my skin quickly, but leaves my face feeling so soft and firm. Even after I wash my face in the morning, the results last. I have even had colleagues that I see on a daily basis ask me what I am doing differently. A New Must-Have!
