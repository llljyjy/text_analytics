I received this product for free from influenster and Sephora for my honest review. I have used this serum morning and night and haven’t seen a difference in the brightness of my skin. It’s very watery, a little tacky after application. I didn’t notice much of a smell. I wouldn’t purchase this product. It was only a sample size so it could be that there’s not enough product to notice a difference as it really takes 3 weeks of use to see a noticeable change in skin. nan
