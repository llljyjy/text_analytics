“I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review” I have used this product since receiving it for quite awhile now and I can say that I have seen a reduction in lines and my skin has never been more hydrated. It works great with makeup, I have not had any skin sensitivity or break outs from it. The drawback is that it is very liquid not at all like a traditional lotion. But once I got used to that I LOVE it!!! I highly recommend the product. The cost is on the upper end but I personally will purchase this item again. Excellent hydration and reduction of lines!!
