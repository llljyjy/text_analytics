I received a free sample of this moisturizer that was small, but lasted almost two weeks because of how rich the cream is. This was hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy and I used it both at night and in the morning under sunscreen. It is scented, but didnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin. I would consider repurchasing a full sized version. nan
