This cream was everything I was looking for and didn’t have. I received this sample free in exchange for my honest review but now Este Lauder will have my money. It is great. At first blush, it is occlusive and had a bit of slip when first on. Nice. Then as the day goes on, your face continues to feel hydrated and I had a subtle glow beneath my makeup that truly looked youthful and fresh. Not greasy, and didn’t pill under my foundation. I also have sensitive skin and experienced no breakouts due to use of this product. I love it! Glow-kissed Facial In A Jar
