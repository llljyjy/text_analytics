I received this free in exchange for my review. This has not been my favorite product to use. The texture was slightly greasy even though it’s oil free. You have to quickly apply it so it doesn’t run off your fingers. The scent is not bad. I won’t continue to use as it leaves a white film on my face. Just Okay
