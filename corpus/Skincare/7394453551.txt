I have sensitive and “maturing” skin since I am in my mid thirties now and since my skin is ALWAYS very dry I am always sure to follow the instructions in regards to exfoliating products. I prefer gentle daily or at the very least almost daily exfoliating products ans this product is one that you can use more than once a week depending on your skins reaction which is nice if you prefer a product that can become a part of your regular skin care routine. The product itself is nice, the pads are the average size for this type of product and well saturated in the solution which is nice I didn’t find that I needed more than one pad for my face each use. The pads are also a good weight and sis no have to worry about them tearing during application. I cannot recall a scent so there either isn’t one or it was very faint and not strong enough to bother me. Having sensitive skin I did not find that these were irritating so that was a bonus. I do feel as though my skin felt smoother after using and certain area of my face remained that way longer than other between uses. I use a similar gentle exfoliating solution that I really like and although I like this product I don’t think it will replace my current go to. Perhaps results would’ve been more noticeable and long term with prolonged use. I liked this product but I didn’t LOVE this product. Like it but don’t love it
