Personally, I found this helped so much with my dry skin which btw, also suffers from eczema. I usually get very dry under my eyes and bottom lip and this did wonders for me. I found that after washing your face, it’s best to apply this when it’s damp. I found doing it this way helped my daily moisturizer stay on longer! It dries to this sorta tacky texture but nothing that’ll dry and stay flaky. At least that didn’t happen to me. My only complain is that the bottle is too small. Really wish they made a bigger version of it. I used this day and night and it only lasted about 2 months. Didn’t over use it but also wasn’t using pea size amounts like I was advised to. I felt it was too very little for me, that is. Other then that I would recommend it if you’re looking for something cheap but that actually works. LOVED IT
