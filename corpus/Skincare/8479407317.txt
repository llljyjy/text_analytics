I love this clay mask!! The scent is very minimal, but gives spa vibes. It definitely has a gentle gentle exfoliation factor too it, but I was more impressed by the clay factor. So far I really like it! The only thing I dont like is how the ingredient “alcohol” is mid way through the ingredient list. nan
