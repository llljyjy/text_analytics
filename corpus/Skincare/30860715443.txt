I was given this by my sister, I tried it out once and of course, it didnâ€™t do much but after a few months, I saw results! My skin became soft and plump after every use and it seemed to help the dark spot I had and reduce the redness I had! I loved it so much that I went through 3 jars and used it on the small stretch marks that I had on the side of my waist and it became invisible and nearly gone! I truly hope they come out with a bigger jar or pump because this product is truly a holy grail! Just Amazing, Wish For A Bigger Jar!
