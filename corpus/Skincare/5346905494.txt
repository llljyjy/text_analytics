Definitely not worth the money unfortunately. I have very normal skin and get just your basic pimple every now and then but wanted something to clear up blackheads on my nose since the Sephora nose strips weren’t doing it for me. This cream did nothing and works more like a poor exfoliant. I noticed my nose was smoother but the black heads were still there. Every-time I would use it I would get 1-3 small breakouts on my nose which was exactly where I was applying it. Sadly I realized too late that this product wasn’t working for me and I don’t return it :( for reference, I normally use the fresh soy face cleaner and origins moisturizer and never have breakouts with those products! led to breakouts on my very NON ache prone skin
