Usually I’m skeptical to try super hyped products because they end up being a waste of money. I bought this on an out-of-character whim the other day, and it is totally worth the hype. I’ve been looking for a sunscreen that evens out my complexion for over a year now, and I’ve tried a lot of drugstore options that did not work. This product however gives you the perfect even glow that looks absolutely gorgeous as a no-makeup makeup base. I also have really sensitive skin and I cant even feel this on my skin where a lot of other sunscreens make my face red, sting, or make me breakout. My only complaint is that I love it enough to buy more once I run out because this b is expensive. But seriously it’s that good! Just for reference, I’m a redhead who lives in Florida so I have fair skin with a little suntan. With that, I can’t speak to the quality on darker skin tones, but it seems to be more glow and less shade-specific pigment. If I go broke it'll be from repeat buying this
