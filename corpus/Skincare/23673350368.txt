This product is thicker than expected, but it goes on smooth and does a great job of hydrating the skin. I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin and appreciate that it is in a pump bottle so it’s easier to differentiate it from the other products in the line, which all look very similar. The only thing I don’t like is the smell...very glue-like! Great moisturizer!
