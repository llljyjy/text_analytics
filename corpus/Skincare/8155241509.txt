this is a daily thing i use, its great to use on freshly popped pimples (so i’ve found) right before bed. i wake up, rinse my face, and they’re gone! i do wish it worked better on un-popped pimples, and i wish it worked on black heads and clogged pores, but i’ll take what i can get! literally has pulled pimples out of my skin
