This is truly great sunscreen! Its very lightweight, silky-smooth texture that glides perfectly on the skin and absorbs fast! Its really pleasant to use, and I use it daily as a last step of my morning skin care routine. It does have a slight scent but its because of sunscreen actives, and no added “fragrance/perfume,” which I really appreciate! Because of its skin-caring ingredients like Camellia leaf extract, hyaluronic acid, bark extract, etc. it delivers long hydrating and moisturizing benefits to the skin. Skin is glowing:) I am very happy to receive this product and will definitely buy it again and again! Amazing skin-caring spf!
