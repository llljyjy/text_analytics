Product should not be used daily. I went to visit my aesthetician for a facial, after noticing dry patches around my chin area I mentioned this product to her. My skin was super dehydrated! It wasnâ€™t my moisturizer since I have been using it for a while and I have never had an issue with dryness until I started this product. Not worth the money. Dermalogica should not be advertising this as a daily exfoliant. caused dry skin
