I started using this products with high hopes. My skin is extremely sensitive and luckily this products did not irritate my skin it felt very soothing and the consistency is very nice and not to heavy. Unfortunately where my skin is prone to acne for some reason I started breaking out from this products. Not sure if it’s from the Soybean ingredient or want but if you have acne probe skin I would be cautious. Otherwise it’s a nice products. High hopes
