This moisturizer is super rich and hydrating. It feels amazing. It was not irritating for my sensitive, acne prone skin which is something I’m always looking for as I tend to have reactions when I deviate from my normal brands. It’s definitely not for people with oily skin. The only downside for me is the price. nan
