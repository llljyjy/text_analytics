I received this #freeproduct as a part of #trywithtopbox. This eye cream is top notch. The first time I applied it I noticed it immediately brightened my under eyes and gave me a blurring effect and a glow from within which I love. This is due to a blend of sensory pearlized brightening powders which visably increase skins luminosity and targets 8 signs of aging. Within 2 weeks of using it day and night I have seen improvement in my dark circles,  puffiness under eyes, fine lines and my skin is so much brighter and hydrated. I also love that this eye cream goes great under my makeup and u can still see the glow it gives. Also really love the metal applicator which feels really nice when applying the eye cream and itâ€™s detachable so that you can keep it clean which is great. I am very happy with this product and have already recommended to friends and family. Great eye cream, love the glow.
