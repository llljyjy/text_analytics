Overall, this mask is a good exfoliating mask. When I received this mask, I was really excited as I have dry skin so I enjoy putting masks on and exfoliating my skin! This first time I used the mask, i absolutely loved it as it did what it claimed. However I feel that is what happens when you introduce a new skincare item into your routine! I used this mask about once a week for 4 weeks! I truly don’t think it changed my skins texture too much, I felt as if I was still reaching for my BHA chemical exfoliate more since I see my skin really make a difference with that. But this mask is nice as it’s super quick and it is nice to apply to you face, doesn’t cause rashes, super gentle so if you have normal to oily skin this might be the mask for you! nan
