Over the past nine months I developed extremely reactive, acne prone skin. This is the ONLY moisturizer I’ve used that has been able to hydrate me without breaking me out. Even the Dr Zenovia $80 cream isn’t as good as this. My skin doesn’t even like squalene, yet it loves this. A holy grail product for me now, about to order a second fav moisturizer
