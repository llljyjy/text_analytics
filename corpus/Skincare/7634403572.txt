Easy to use, glides on the skin and moisturizes well. I am above 40 and can definitely notice a difference in the fine lines. Currently about to finish my 5th tube. I only use it at night. It is difficult to use the last bit of product when it is about to run out. (The metal part starts straching the skin) I find using a q-tip to scoop out the product works.I get 2-3 more uses out of each tube that way. Easy to use, works well
