I received this product complimentary from Influenster.  It makes my skin feel super soft but other than that, I haven’t noticed much difference.  I usually have a lot of puffiness due to allergies and this doesn’t help with that.  I didn’t expect it to though.  I like that it doesn’t have a scent.  I will continue to use it to see if I will notice a difference over time. Nice, but…
