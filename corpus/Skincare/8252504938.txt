I purchased this product after the toner I  used for years was recently discontinued. After using Frecks toner my skin feels clean, soft, refreshed and hydrated. I also love the smell it reminds me of eucalyptus, it is not overpowering but faint with a slight tingling sensation during application.The only downside is the packaging. The bottle is glass and really heavy for its packaging design and usage (easily weighs more than a 16oz full water bottle for reference) however that does not take away from the usability of product for me so 5 stars. Instantly loved this toner!
