Okay for a double cleanse. The first few uses were fine, but then the oil started separating from the other ingredients which is annoying and messy. I thought it might be a temperature thing, but even when it started getting cooler it kept happening. I tried storing it on its side, massaging the tube before use...nothing. Always coming out separated now. Okay for double-cleanse
