I had been searching for a cleanser to help move me away from using physical exfoliants as often. Usually gel and cream cleansers don’t leave my skin feeling clean enough and more pores start to get clogged after a few days without exfoliating. This cleanser has struck the perfect balance between being effective without stripping too much moisture. I feel that it’s gentle enough to use morning and night, but I usually only use it at night. I love the foaming and light minty scent. A little goes a long way, so the full size tube will last a long while. After using this cleanser, I used a different gel cleanser at my boyfriend’s house for a few days and noticed my pores were getting super congested and I was starting to break out. I will definitely continue using this Checks and Balances cleanser in the future! Gentle and Effective
