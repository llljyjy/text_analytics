I got the mini sample from the bday gift set and I was impressed. A little goes a long way (mini sample lasted 1 month, applied once a day). I have an oily forehead but dry cheeks so I was concerned on how this would do but it passed the test. My entire face is moisturized throughout the day and it doesn’t look like I washed my face with grease :D It’s expensive so I suggest you buy the sample first before making a purchase. Expensive, but give it a try!
