I don’t really have problematic skin but this made me break out for the first time in year. I have borderline normal/combo skin type and every day after using this cream, my forehead would feel as if I could fry something on it - s greasy and oily! Definitely ask for a sample before committing to this! I’d say this cream is only suitable for those with dry skin. I could fry an egg on my forehead!
