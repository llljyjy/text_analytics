I am very picky about my skincare, and for the past 15 years have only used products from my favorite spa I purchased after facials. When I first opened this product I thought the packaging seemed a bit tacky, and I did not like that this was a scented product. But holy moly do I love the results! I’ve struggled with dry skin since I had my daughter two years ago, and this product gave me the most moisturized, glowy skin I’ve ever had!  I’m a Lancôme convert and plan to purchase another bottle once I’ve used up this sample. Pleasantly surprised!
