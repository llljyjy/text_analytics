For those who are annoyed by the seperation, that’s just what happens with natural products - give it a good shake with the lid closed and it goes right back to normal. Ok now for my actual review: I really liked this product when I first started using it (I do have really fair skin so as long as I warmed it up between my hands it blended well) HOWEVER I’ve been wondering why I’ve been breaking out so badly (seemingly new whiteheads, blackheads on my cheeks which I’ve never had before, and lots of cc/texture) and have discovered that both butylene glycol and dimethicone cause breakouts in those who are acne-prone (the two biggest ingredients here). Going to throw out my jar, what a shame! Liked At First, Causes Break Outs
