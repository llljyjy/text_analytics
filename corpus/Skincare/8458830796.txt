So, I have been looking for a eye cream and found this. After a bit I had the worst dryness on my eye and even under. See I donâ€™t mind buying expensive things for my skin. But this is NOT IT LOL. I have psoriasis so it was a terrible experience. Wish it was better sorry I had to type this out for people like me going through this experience. SAD TO SAY THIS
