Product is slimy. Has a slightly nice smell. Does not work that well, especially with removal of eye makeup. I constantly have to go back and remove my eye makeup. Iâ€™m the type of person to read reviews very skeptically. This could work for you, but I wear make up 12 hours a day & need something that actually works. I bought the 1.69 fl.oz., & almost gave it away. I bought another product which actually does melt the makeup off. This product is not worth the waste of money. Don't understand the great reviews
