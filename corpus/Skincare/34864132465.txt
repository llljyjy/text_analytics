I really love this toner because I have dry skin that gets especially worse during the winter. The toner has helped make my face feel more hydrated throughout the day and I’ve noticed it looking a little more plump. I use it morning and night and just use my fingers to press it into my skin. It’s a liquid texture but a little thick and has a milky color to it. staple in my skincare routine
