I was lucky enough to receive this product from influenster for my honest review.  I absolutely LOVE it! I have pretty sensitive skin and this product works very well on me. I was concerned at first as it seemed a bit oily but it absorbed in minutes making my skin feel fresh and smooth. I have been using it for two weeks now and definitely notice a postive difference. There is no overpowering smell and its clean ingredients.  It’s hard to find good vegan/cruelty free products but this is definitely at the top of the list. I’ve noticed my skin looks and feels alot smoother and I will 100 % be buying this product again as I want to continue using this in my skincare routine! I do recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about buying it.  It is worth the price. I was extremely impressed! Great Product! Highly Recommend!!
