I love the way this product applies! I’m normally not a cream sunscreen kind of person but that’s because most of them make my skin sticky and it feels very heavy this one on the other hand is very light,moisturizes your skin, soaks right into your skin, and doesn’t leave any sticky or weird feeling of residue after applied.Although I’m not a cream sunscreen kinda girl I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is because it is definitely worth it for the luxurious feel it gives you while also performing well at blocking the sun from burns This feels amazing on my skin!
