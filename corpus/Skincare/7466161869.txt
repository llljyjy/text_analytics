I received this product as part of a’free sample program’. This soap smells sooo good. It makes my skin feel soft. My review is unbiased because I was asked to review it as an honest customer and was not told what to say. The soap lathers really well. I know it says to use on face but I get acne sometimes and I am scared to use just this on my face. Try it and see if it suits your skin. I like the look of this soap also. nan
