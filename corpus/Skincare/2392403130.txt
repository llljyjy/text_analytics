I wanted to like this moisturizer and thought that I would given I’ve used other Fresh products with satisfaction. I have combo skin and have pesky dry, flakey spots since I moved to a dry climate. It’s been challenging to find a moisturizer that absorbs really well into the skin, providing deep hydration to rid the dry patches while also not causing oilier skin or break outs. Though this moisturizer didn’t cause any break outs, it doesn’t deeply hydrate either.  It sits and pills on top of my skin vs sinking in. My skin ends up feeling oily yet not soft or hydrated. Plus the pilling is just a pain when trying to apply makeup. I’ll be returning and will continue hunting for a better moisturizer. On a positive note, I do like the subtle cucumber / rose scent. nan
