I never really write reviews, but I just love this product so much. I have extremely sensitive skin, but this works really well for me! It’s definitely helped clear up my acne and clogged pores. I definitely suggest this for anyone with sensitive skin who struggles with clogged pores or blackheads! It gives my skin that post facial glow and feeling of freshness. It causes some redness/pinkness right after using it but it dies down after an hour or so, and then it leaves my skin looking INCREDIBLE. I wouldn’t suggest using it more than once a week, and I wouldn’t use any other acne clearing products after using this. My new favorite way to exfoliate
