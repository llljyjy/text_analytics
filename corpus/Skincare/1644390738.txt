Bought this because I was tired of spending so much $ on tiny tubes of moisturizer. It’s really great. The price is just a bonus. It absorbs quickly but makes my sensitive skin feel moisturized. It’s not super thick, but I have pretty dry skin and I am happy with it. I would probably get something thicker if you’re really dry though. Great for summer. Does a nice job
