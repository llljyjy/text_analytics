If you are thinking about this product….JUST DO IT. I was on the fence but figured since it was cheap, I’d give it a shot and oh man is this a game changer! I like to dermaplane at home but it causes my jawline to break out every single time. I’m not even kidding when I say it cleared up my jawline right after I washed it off. Y’all….this product has to be made with angel tears and fairy dust. I’ve used it twice so far, and I didn’t notice any results from the first time, but the second time was where it’s at. Definitely give this a shot! Definitely a Staple Product!
