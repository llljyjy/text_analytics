I have lupus so my skin is hyper sensitive to absobloodylutely everything it comes into contact with. I am a red head with fair skin & blue eyes so there’s a lot going on.I LOVE THIS ENTIRE KIT!! The rep was at my Sephora store in Folsom and I came in originally to just get cream. That’s it. But he asked about my skin (dry, sensitive) and showed me how each product in this kit will work on many of my issues. First time I used it was today - and I have NO REGRETS. The scent is very light, the application is without trouble, and the way I felt afterward made up for everything else. It is a pricey brand and a luxurious skin care line. But I wish I had bought it much sooner. Wish I had bought this sooner!
