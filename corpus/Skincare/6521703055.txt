It’s a good spf but I have tried better. It goes on a little sticky and takes about 5 minutes to really get absorbed in your skin (at least on mine it does) so you do have to be mindful of that if you’re in rush. I do like that it didn’t break me out! A lot of sunscreens can irritate my sensitive skin but this one didn’t and the white cast also goes away within a few minutes of applying it! nan
