I started using this serum for about 3 1/2 weeks. I love the soft silky feel and it goes on super smooth. I can see an immediate difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. It feels like my under eye area is getting a fresh drink of water. After long term use I do see a slight difference! I’m sure I’ll see more of a difference the more I use it. I apply it after I wash my face in the morning and night. Love this serum
