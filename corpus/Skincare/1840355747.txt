This is my holy grail product. It doesn’t transfer and you can choose how dark you want to go. The smell is not bad and it leaves me perfectly glowed. It will only stain your hands if you don’t wash them afterwards. I mix the drops with a regular moisturizer, not directly on my skin. I love this product so much! holy grail product
