My review on this is that it makes my skin really soft and I do notice the wrinkles I do have seem a bit fainter. I am 25 so I am at that stage where I want to prevent any wrinkles from forming and I think this is a great product to throw on before a moisturizer. I do not have any pilling from the product which I’ve read as an issue for some people. I would say sometimes I even put too much on ( without meaning to) but it still doesn’t pill. It feels very soothing and refreshing on the face. nan
