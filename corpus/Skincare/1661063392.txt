I enjoyed adding this product to my nighttime routine. It is supposed to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, discoloration, and texture, with minimal irritation. I have very sensitive skin and was not bothered by this at all. I used tretinoin before this so I didnâ€™t notice a huge difference, but my skin did not get worse either. I will continue to use this product. Good retinol product
