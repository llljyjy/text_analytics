I do not care for the scent that this eye cream has. It has an odd fragrance which makes it a challenge to use. I do not need much of the product to apply underneath my eyes. It goes on smoothly. The consistency of the cream is kind of grainy to me. I did not notice a difference after using this product. I received a free sample of this product from Bzz Agent. nan
