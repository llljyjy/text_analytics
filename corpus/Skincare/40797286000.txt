I received this product complimentary from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been using this for over 3 weeks and the only difference I’ve noticed is firmer skin. This creme doesn’t stand out to me. I have combination skin and I didn’t like that it made me shiny. This creme was very moisturizing but it’s not for my  daily use. I actually prefer to use this at night. I honestly do not recommend this Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme. It's ok.
