I have never bought anything from Sephora in my life. I was selected to receive a review sample of this product. That being said, I believe I’ve found myself my new go to product to absolve skin redness and irritation. I have very sensitive skin around my neck and on my face. This makes shaving usually an unpleasant experience that leaves me with red scars for days on end with endless itching, colour, etc.  Before any shaving experts come after me, yes I’ve tried different razors, moisturizers, after shaves, oils, etc. Nothing has had as great of an effect as these drops. I only need to add 4-5 drops to the affected area. And while I’m not going to lie and say it’s complete magic that solves all my issues in 5 seconds, it usually causes redness, irritation, etc to fade within about an hour or two. I love the light, non-overpowering scent of the solution. It just makes me feel clean. It doesn’t leave any residue or unpleasant feelings on your skin. I’ve never tried probiotic skincare products before, but I’ll definitely have to do more research into it, as it’s just about the only thing that’s worked for me thus far. I’ll definitely keep using this product whenever my skin feels dry, appears red, or is otherwise irritated. For what it’s worth, this product deserves my recommendation, and is genuinely something worth looking into if you (the reader) relate to my struggles with skin irritation. I hope the Sephora down the hall from my workplace continues to stock this in the future! My New Go To For Redness Reduction
