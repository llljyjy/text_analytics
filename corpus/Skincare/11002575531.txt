Loved the product! I have sensitive skin and have had no issues using it on my hands or face since it has almost no smell! I most frequently have been using it on my hands and on dry spots I have on my face at night. It is a good moisturizer but I do think it’s pretty expensive thought I’ve found a little goes a bit of a way Works well
