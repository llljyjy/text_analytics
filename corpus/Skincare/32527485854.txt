The TULA Skincare sunscreen is amazing. It massages well into the skin leaving little to no residue. There are exfoliating beads, however I didn’t notice it while applying or throughout the day.  Disclaimer it is cool in my environment so I didn’t experience it’s full effect out in the sun. Great daily sunscreen
