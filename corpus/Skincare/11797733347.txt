I received this product for free fromInfluenster and Dr. Jart+ in exchange for my honest review. My skin tends to be on the drier side. I am always in search for a good moisturizer. Also, as a mom I barely have time to brush my teeth sometimes so the fact that this product is also a concealer and sunscreen is a plus. It does not feel greasy upon application, In fact I don’t even feel like I’m wearing anything. It doesn’t feel heavy which is great for those hot and humid days. You have to try this product: a concealer, moisturizer and sunblock all in one. The packaging is also really sleek and there is a pump to help administer the product. I will definitely be purchasing this product once my sample runs out! ##complimentary #PremiumBB @Influenster @drjart I would buy this product again and again
