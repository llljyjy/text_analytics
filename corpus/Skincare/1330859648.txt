I was pleasantly surprised with this cleanser! I wasn’t expecting to like it because sometimes you’re really just paying for the name with high end products, but it lathers really nicely and doesn’t leave my face feeling tight. It’s pretty gentle and doesn’t have much of a scent other than “soap”. The bottle is also pretty large so I feel this would last a decent amount of time. If you have the money to spend, go for it! nan
