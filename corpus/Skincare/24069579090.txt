I have been using the “Confidence in a Cream“ for a few weeks now, and the main difference I see is in my pores. It appears to have reduced my pore size drastically. I can’t tell a huge difference in the elasticity or tightness of my skin, but the pore size being reduced makes it appear smoother. I am not crazy about the scent, but it isn’t overpowering. I love the way the formula makes my face feel hydrated and not sticky or greasy. Noticed a slight difference, worth a try!
