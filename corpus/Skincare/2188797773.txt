I’m super impressed with sunscreen gel! I already have a go to face sunscreen but now I’m switching it up. The Tula Sunscreen gel goes on smooth and has a light banana scent to it. I don’t feel sticky after applying. The best feature and what sold me on this sunscreen is that it make my skin glow. I catch myself in the mirror and say wow I have great skin! If you’re on the fence about this sunscreen I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Get it, you won’t regret it!!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Glowing, radiant screen Sunscreen
