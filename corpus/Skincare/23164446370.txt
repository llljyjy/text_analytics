I bought this one because it has the least retinol percentage compared to other products. Even ordinary’s lowest percentage retinol caused me hair fall so that’s why I was looking for a product which has the least amount of retinol. Retinol definitely made my skin soft but bumps are not worth it for my 31 yr old face. Broke me out with small red bumps
