I can’t believe how good this makes my skin feel.I feel like I’m wearing a protective barrier on my face. It’s so thick but it smooths out so easily and absorbs into my skin with no residue or sticky mess left behind. I love the fact it has Colloidal Oatmeal and Beta-Glucan to help transform dry sensitive skin into a healthier appearance.its so simple to use apply it over it over your facial serum and mass as he in .if your skin is extra dry you can apply it both night and day. It’s great for any type skin it’s definitely keeper for me. It really is a barrier for you facial skin. Like wearing a golden mask
