I was gifted by Laneige this gel in return for my honest review. It comes in a cute blue container with an applicator. The scent is a water/ocean aroma. It smells nice reminds me of being at the spa nice and relaxing. The gel is amazing! It has cooling feel, applies easily, and instant hydrates. My skin feels soft for the entire day. Even after cleansing in the evening my skin is still left feeling soft. Cooling Hydrating Gel
