I received this item as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I have oily skin, and large pores. I was excited to try something new. I feel that my pores have shrunken a bit after a weeks use. My oily skin is still there though. This mask is easy to use, and easy to wash off. Ive added it to my weekly routine and will continue to use this. Shrinking My Pores
