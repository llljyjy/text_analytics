I received the mini version for an honest review from influenster. It does feel very luxurious and moisturizing it evened out my skin tone and definitely felt amazing. It’s thick and creamy and I did see it minimize my pores. It’s almost like a smoothing cream. I’ve been using it for about a week and I do see some change in how my skin feels. Because it’s the mini version it’s good as a tester. Or a travel pack. I would definitely buy the full version of this product. Lushous
