This broke after 10-15 uses and would not turn on at all. I ordered this item before Christmas and it took forever to ship, and by the time I got it and actually started using it it was outside the 60 day return policy and Sephora would not take it back. Now I have to contact the manufacturer to get a refund through them instead. Don’t waste your money...I’ve bought many great products from Sephora, but this one is garbage. Terrible Quality
