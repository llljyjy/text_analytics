I had received gift cards for my birthday and this was one of my purchases.  I bought it not really knowing anything about it, so I was pretty nervous. I LOVE nearly everything in this kit.  I received in early May.  I do switch from the cleaner here and CeraVe just because my skin doesn’t love using the same thing every day. It’s now July and I’m hitting the end of my products and I’m getting sad.   CLEANSER: My most favorite. The smell is super light and it just feels so good. A little bit goes a LONG way. I do use it with a konjac facial sponge. FACIAL SERUM: This is a must have in the morning. I love the texture of it. Again a little bit goes a long way. It distributes amazingly and is not oily at all. MOISTERIZER: I honestly didn’t use this much. It was a little thicker than I care for. I used it mostly at night and would wear something lighter during the day. FACIAL OIL: I used this at night.. but not every night.  Does feel great. I just don’t use oils too too often. But when I do need an oil, THIS would be the one I would use.  I’ve tried a few others and honestly they don’t compare to the lightness of this one. EYE CREAM:  Thick, feels good. I would throw some on my smile lines and my squint wrinkle too just for good measure at night. RESURFACING ENERGY FACIAL: Right up there with the cleanser for me. I used it a couple times a week. My face was getting a lot of texture on it and this literally reversed it. Feels so good waking up to it. The smell is light. It is pretty abrasive feeling to the touch yet my face never even pinked up or looked like I had used an exfoliant. OVERALL: I would probably buy everything in this kit again except maybe the moisturizer and maybe the eye cream. But honestly. For the price and the longevity of the products (if you don’t use more than you prob should) I would absolutely purchase the whole kit again.  If smells overwhelm you I think you would love these. The scents are very clean smelling. Very very light. LOVE it!
