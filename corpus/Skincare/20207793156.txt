I really REALLY wanted to love it, especially since it barely leaves a cast on my brown skin, but unfortunately it isnâ€™t sensitive-skin safe and broke me out into little bumps all over my face and dried me out. I looked at the ingredients and it has citrus, which may bother some people. Not for dry sensitive skin
