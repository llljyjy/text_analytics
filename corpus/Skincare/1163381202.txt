I got a deluxe sample size of this item a few years ago and REALLY liked it.  I wanted to buy the full size but just didnt want to spend $100 at the time.  Once Sephora got the brand, I was excited and planned to get it during one of their sales, however... This specific item took a while to come over to Sephora.  Well anyways it’s finally here, hooray! I have tried numerous acids and retinoids and what have you, and this one is my favorite.  My skin is quite normal (slightly oily t zone in the summer, slightly dry cheeks and forehead in the winter), and I do have early signs of aging showing (some fine lines, one bad sun damage spot), and this stuff just makes my skin GLOW when I wake up in the morning.  It’s crazy!! You also get a decently sized bottle for the amount of times you actually use the product (I think 3-4 times a week is what’s recommended, but start with maybe 1-2 days a week).  It is 100% worth the price and is super underrated! Miracle product
