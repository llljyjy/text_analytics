If I could rate lower I would!If you have oily skin hear me out .. STAY AWAY VERY FAR AWAY from this “gel cream” it was like adding 20 pounds of pit on top of my already oily face.Bought as a a recommendation from a sales lady and honestly is sad to say she was just trying to get her commission and not help me what so ever. She sold this product like her life dependen on it. I truly believed it was going to do all she promised. Stay Away … It’s not worth your money
