After using this product for a few weeks my lips feel so much more hydrated. I am definitely a chapstick addict but this left my lips feeling soft and less in need of chapstick. The only reason I am taking off one star is that it is confusing packaging in my opinion. At first, I didnâ€™t know how to get the product out! Leaves Lips Hydrated!
