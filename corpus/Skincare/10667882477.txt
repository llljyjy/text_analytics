Love this product!! This moisturizer is super mild but incredibly moisturizing! I have pretty sensitive and flaky-dry skin and have found this to be the only moisturizer that truly hydrates me the best without leaving me with congested pores, breakouts, or burning and irritation. It has a nice, rich and creamy texture that works into the skin really well without making me feel greasy. I find that it even smoothies together nicely with oils when my skin is feeling EXTRA dry! It does have a faint scent to it, but as someone who can be prone to irritation from scents alone in some products, I’ve never experienced any from this and find that is dissipates almost instantly upon working it onto the skin. I’ve been using this product since it’s launch!
