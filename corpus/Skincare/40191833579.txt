After my first time trying this cleanser, I was hooked. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, and removes my waterproof mascara like a dream. The other reviews are correct, this is not a sudsy bubbly cleanser, and more of an oil based product. It does well with my combination skin, but may not be the best for oily skin. New favorite cleanser!
