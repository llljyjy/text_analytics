For reference, I have combination oily, dehydrated skin with larger pores. I received a 5ml sample to test, used for a week. I did not notice any good results using this product, I applied it directly after the shower and still noticed dry patches popping up on my skin 20 minutes later. There was no hydrating feeling at all. The positive with this product is that I didnâ€™t break out. nan
