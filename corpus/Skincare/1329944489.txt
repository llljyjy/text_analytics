Pure junk ! I don’t know what people are raving about … it’s the biggest disappointment I’ve ever experienced in skin care product ! A sticky liquid that has absolutely no effect on a skin, but a desire to take if off ASAP. I’m just upset that I waisted money on it and kept “ giving it a chance “… too late to return it . So it’s going into the trash.  Going back to Kiehl’s Vit C serum. And least it’s the devil I know , and it works ! Do not waste your money
