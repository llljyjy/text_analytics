I received this sample product from influencer & Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.  The Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Treatment Lotion has great essence. It really refreshed my skin after my face wash routine. I have Combination skin & thankfully there was no oil build up, which sadly happens quite often with certain products. It gave a good moisturizer to my dry skin areas.  The light rose scent isn’t overwhelming. I found the texture a little thicker, but it doesn’t feel that way when applied to my skin & it was absorbed quickly. I would try again & recommend. Lovely Hydration
