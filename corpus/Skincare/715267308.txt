I have oily, sensitive skin and mild rosacea. I normally use Bare Minerals Hydrating Cleansing oil but decided to try this after seeing everyone raving about it. It smelled pleasant and did what it needed to do, but over time I started to notice that my skin felt slightly dry and tight after using. Then I started noticing more bumps and rosacea flare ups. My skin had been looking pretty good, but after using this it started getting blotchy and breaking out. Stupidly, it took me a while to realize that this was causing my breakouts. I went back to my old faithful Cleansing Oil and my skin immediately cleared up. nan
