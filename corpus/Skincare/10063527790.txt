I was hesitant to sample the new Confidence In A Cream because I wasn’t the biggest fan of the last formula.  Oh my gosh I have a new favorite!  This cream glides on so velveeta smooth.  It feels so rich and lux!  It’s hydrating but soaks into the skin quickly so there’s no heaviness!  I’m very impressed! amazing new formula
