Nice and light moisturizer! I was anticipating a thicker cream but this is very nice and has a “whipped” like texture. It’s fragrance free which I truly love more than I realized. I’ve been using every morning and feel my skin is doing so great! It targeted some dry/patchy areas around my eyes so well and has not clogged my pores at all! Definitely worth trying! nan
