After just one night of use I could tell this product worked.  I have tried a few different products that feel hydrating in the moment but have never had any where you can clearly feel the hydration when you wake up in the morning.  I live in a dry climate and think this will be a game changer in my night routine.   I appreciate that its fragrance and paraben free --  my only complaint is that there is a slightly unpleasant scent associated with the cream but itâ€™s not a deal breaker. Great Hydration
