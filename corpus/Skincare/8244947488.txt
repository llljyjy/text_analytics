It cosmetics claims that the new Confidence in a Cream formula, with silky cream texture is now also clean.Paraben-Free, Mineral Oil-Free, Free of Drying Alcohols & Artificial Colorants and Vegan. Unfortunately this new “clean” formula is not fragrance free.I am na fan of fragranced skincare products because I’m prone to experience skin irritation, and contact dermatitis from scented products. I would not recommend if you are sensitive to scented products like me, and  I hope the brand releases a fragrance free version, so we can all benefit and experience the 10 signs of aging skin—solved in just two weeks! This new “clean” formula is not fragrance free.
