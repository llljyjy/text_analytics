So happy Sephora finally started carrying this serum. I discovered Alpha-H when my esti recommended I incorporated an AHA into my routine because I was complaining about “ageing.” I tried a handful of products, but this serum is by far my favorite! I love that lux oily feel on my skin, but HATE a greasy mess. This absorbs right in! Not only does my skin feel brighter and tighter after use, but it has also become my go-to post travel. My skin gets super dehydrated from flying and this helps remove any dry texture or rough spots…like new skin! Also, I have noticed my foundation sits better/doesn’t crease as much and I can go a bit longer in between “tox” appointments if you know what I mean! Morning GLOW
