I love how lightweight yet moisturizing it is. I Use it in the mornings under my sunscreen or at night. Its perfect for all skin types. If you are someone like me who likes lightweight moisturizer that makes the skin soft and supple, this product is for you. There is no pilling or itching. Just soft amd smooth skin. I am quite impressed. So lightweight and moisturizing
