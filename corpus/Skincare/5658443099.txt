I got a trial size one year as part of my birthday gift and loved it. smells great, good ingredients. I have pretty sensitive skin and I was very happy that I did not react to this product. It’s very hydrating and the container will last a long time (5-6 months). it’s worth the price. Definitely worth it, even for sensitive skin!
