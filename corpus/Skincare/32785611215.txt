I bought this serum over the summer because I have some hyperpigmentation under my eyes. The product advertises that you will be able to see results within 2 weeks. I used it, as directed, in the AM & PM. No progress. I continued to use it for 4 months because I couldn’t justify tossing such an expensive product. Still no difference in my under eyes. The product pills after 30 minutes. I also dislike the tint that the it contains because it misleads you to think that your under eyes are instantly brighter. Once you wash it off, you’ll see they did not change at all. It’s basically like applying a watery concealer under your eyes, with no additional benefits. My skin is not sensitive at all, but I did feel occasional tingling/heat after applying the serum. If my skin was sensitive, I’m sure this product would result in irritation. This is the first product I’ve purchased from Murad, and after wasting $60+, it will probably be my last. save your money
