I received a small sample in exchange for a review and I was able to get in a weeks worth as a small amount actually went a long way!  I do have to say it feels lovely on the skin and not sticky and helped my face feel hydrated.  Long terms results I cannot say as it was a small sample but I would try it again to see the longer results. So far it seems great!
