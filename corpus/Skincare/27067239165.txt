I received a free sample of this product and my face did not like it at all. As soon as I applied it, the first thing I noticed was that my skin started to sting and turn pink. The second thing I noticed was the scent. I hadn’t realized the product contained fragrance and I am guessing this is what caused my skin to react that way (I don’t usually use fragranced products). I had to wash it off right away! Thanks, but no thanks. Made my skin sting
