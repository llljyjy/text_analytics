My favourite serum for daytime! I’ve tried the alpha arbutin + HA in the past and it seemed to have broken me out. Then I tried this one and it worked perfectly for me! I have oily skin and this does give you a glowy look that I’m not a fan of but my skin looks like that naturally so might as well add some antioxidants to it lol I lost count of how many bottles of this I used but I keep coming back, it’s great at evening out my skin tone and fade blemishes scars. nan
