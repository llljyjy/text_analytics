This was decent; it did not irritate my skin and it felt nice after application but it does not perform as well as my other esscenses that are a fraction of the price.  If you are dedicated to the brand and have the money to invest in this by all means it is lovely, but it is not a “must have” in my book.  I used ur in the morning and my skin was pretty after. I will say the smell was better than expected Refreshing
