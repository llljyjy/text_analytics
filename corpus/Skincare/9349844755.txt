This concentrate delivers! One pump provides the perfect pea-sized amount of milky serum which readily sinks in. I’ve been using this most nights for about a month and I wake up with the loveliest supple and silky skin. Nights I don’t use it I notice a difference. It’s great on its own or layered under lotion. The only reason I gave 4 vs. 5 stars is I don’t like the bottle design. The top is cumbersome to put back on and the bottle’s sleek shape makes it easy to drop- not ideal for glass. Other than that this is an incredible serum. It’s given my dry winter skin a much needed boost. a new favorite
