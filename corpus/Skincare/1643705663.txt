First of all, the packaging and container are beautiful. The moisturizer itself is great! I have very dry skin and this has definitely helped, especially when I wear it under makeup. I love how it smells, but if you’re not a fan of products that smell like sunscreen, this might not be for you. For me, that smell is a plus. I feel like I’m on vacation. I love that it has SPF, especially living on South Florida. It glides on easily. Does not leave any stickiness. Feels light on my skin. Overall, I’m very happy with it and I plan on repurchasing when I’m all out. nan
