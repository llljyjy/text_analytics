I used it wrong the first few times (dab dried my face after cleansing) so I didn’t think I liked it. I have really dry skin, and it wasn’t very happy this winter with the dry air. However, once I figured it out (I need a full on layer of mist or my face needs to basically be wet) - my skin felt so smooth and supple, I was actually freaking out. It’s been a while since it’s felt this good. Mind you, I use the adaptogen moisturizer afterwards to lock it in, but it has done wonders for my mid 30s skin. I truly didn’t want to like it - it’s yet another product on my skincare shelf - but I love it and I love YTTP. nan
