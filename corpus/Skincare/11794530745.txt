I was never big into eye creams because I never really noticed a big difference. However, the story is completely different with the SF eye cream. I use it both in the morning and at night after my cleanse and serum. It definitely reduced my dark circles. But favorite part about it is that it depuffed my usually puffy eyes as well. It’s super lightweight and applied very smoothly. I’m so obsessed with is this eye cream! nan
