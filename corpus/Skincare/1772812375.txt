I have sensitive skin and rosacea. My rosacea has been getting quite rosy with having to wear a mask as well. Saw this and thought I would try it out. I am stunned by the results. I was a bit worried at first because it tingles when you wash your face, thought that may be too much drama for my skin but my skin loves this stuff. It took about 7-10 days but now my skin looks so great!! My face is less red. My breakouts have been reduced. This stuff really cleans my skin and doesn’t dry it out. It’s worth trying it out to see if your skin likes it. The only downfall is that it doesn’t remove all my eye makeup. I have previously used Fresh Soy Cleanser and Drunk Elephant Beste - this one is way better for me. Highly  recommend!! perfect for sensitive skin!
