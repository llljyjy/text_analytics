This cleanser truly works... This is so far the only cleanser that has truly worked on my oily/blemished skin. It’s just too bad it’s so expensive so i can’t keep constantly buying it again and again.. I REALLY wished they would lower the price. It is way too expensive even for the good quality that it brings... but if you CAN and ARE able to buy it.. go ahead.. it definitely works (: Works but is Expensive...
