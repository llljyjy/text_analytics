I’ve tried a few H/Acid serums and was going to give up cause they all caused breakouts on my skin but decided to take one last chance on this after reading the reviews and now I too can celebrate in finally finding the “right“ H/Acid for me.Anyone with sensitive, reactive skin should certainly try this if you think you can’t use H/Acid serums and I saw results after only a few uses. Sensitive skin friendly!
