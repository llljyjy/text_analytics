Amazing! It almost immediately absorbs into the skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and non-greasy. If you have many steps in your routine like I do, this is a must by. I have occasional breakouts and scarring. After just a few days using this, I already see a difference. Start with a Glow Recipe toner and I finish with the Plum Pump hyaluronic cream. new favorite addition to my routine!
