So I’m not sure if I’m suppose to use both at the same time or not. I haven’t tried using the pads and the serum together like at the same time. I would suggest using the pads like once or twice a week for starters. It doesn’t have a scent to me. Also if anyone has any suggestions feel free to lmk . Are you using both together or do you use it by taking turns . Seems like a silly question lol but I’d like to know great pads
