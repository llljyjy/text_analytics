I received two samples of this with two of my Sephora orders because I really wanted to try this.  With both samples the cream and water had separated so that gross water thing came out.  With one of the tubes I shrugged it off, mixed it back together - and my skin didn’t like that, so I stopped using it right away.  The second tube also had separation and I tossed that out right away.  I don’t know if the samples were expired, or if the warehouse they were stored in had temperature issues (maybe they heated up in shipping and went bad).  I’ve tried the Victoria Beckham cream that was made in collaboration with this brand and really liked it - so I’m 100% sure it was just a couple of bad samples (maybe more than a couple of bad samples, judging by some of the reviews).  Defo not going to buy it from Sephora and will go to their official website instead. I selected I would recommend the product, but be careful where you get it from - if it seems bad, don’t just shrug it off and return it instead (or toss the sample). Bad sample?
