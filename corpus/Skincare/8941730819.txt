What a beautiful hydrating facial spray. It comes out in a super fine mist, and is light but still refreshing. It has a light, delicate rose scent and the packaging is just so beautiful. A frosted glass bottle and gold cap make it feel luxurious and fun to apply! My only issue is that since the mist is so fine, I feel I need a lot to get my whole face and thus drops a lot each time I use it. Overall a gorgeous product and will buy again! Luxury in a Bottle!
