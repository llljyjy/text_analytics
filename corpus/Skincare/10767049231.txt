This is a decent moisturizer. It’s not great but it’s not horrible. I disagree with everyone saying it feels lightweight because it’s actually a thicker and more occlusive cream. It absorbs very fast around my dry patches and leaves an oily sheen everywhere else. I’d caution sensitive skin against it. I personally have combination skin that gets very dry and sensitive in the winter. My skin is also reactive to high doses of niacinamide. This product burns my skin upon initial application and has been breaking my out. The breakouts are very similar to what I get with The Ordinary’s Niacinamide serum so I’m guessing this product also has a high concentration of it. That being said, it moisturizes and would probably work better for less reactive or sensitive skin. It’s missed too many marks for me. TLDR: absorbs fast in dry paces and slowly on normal skin. Too much niacinamide and causes breakouts. Burns on contact with sensitive skin. Too much niacinamide, absorbs weirdly, burns
