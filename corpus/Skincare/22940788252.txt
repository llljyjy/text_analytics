It is a very good vitamin C booster, it feels like a gel (lightweight) and absorbs quickly into the skin, it smells a bit like citrus, and my skin was feeling super soft and very moisturized. I love it so much that I think Iâ€™m going to buy it again  because this product need to be in my skincare morning and nitetime routine from now on. Great product
