I personally am a busy, working mama of 2. I am constantly trying new whitening products, because I LOVE trying to get my teeth as white as possible. But so many whitening products take time to use or they just feel nasty on my teeth. This GLO to Go Pen, along with Gloâ€™s Vials have been a game changer for me! Having a product I can put on, and have easily absorbed is absolutely incredible. I love not having to sit around with a light or have thick goopy product stuck on my teeth. If you are busy, but still want a bright smile I would HIGHLY recommend! Perfect option if you are always on the go!
