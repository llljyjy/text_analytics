I never leave reviews but I am absolutely dumbfounded at the low rating this product is receiving! I have extremely pale skin and while this does leave a bit of a warm, orangish tint behind, if it is blended properly down the neck it is not noticeable at all! If you find there is a harsh line at your jaw, then you need to spread it down further. SPF should go down your neck as well anyways. Personally, I find this wears really well under makeup, feels moisturizing but not greasy, and leaves a really nice bronzed glow on my complexion. Picked up the mini in the sale and I am really happy with it, so once Iâ€™ve run out of it I will be grabbing the full size. Excited to finally be able to pick this up in Canada! Huge fan
