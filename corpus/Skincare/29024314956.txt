It’s rare to get results while spending so little. I’ve been mixing a pea sized amount with my moisturizer a.m. and p.m. for the last few weeks, and my skin shows a noticable difference. More even tone, smaller looking pores, softer appearance. All with zero irritation.The improvements are subtle, but enough for me to continue to repurchase again and again. It’s a new staple for me. This does have a noticable, natural (plant?) like scent. Doesn’t bother me, but might turn some people off. It’s also a booster, not a stand-alone moisturizer. I suppose it could be used as a moisturizer, but it’ll be gone FAST if used in that way.If you’re curious about bakuchiol, you can’t go wrong trying this! nan
