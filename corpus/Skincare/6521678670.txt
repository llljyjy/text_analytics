A great daily sunscreen. It doesn’t leave a greasy feeling or white cast like some sunscreens do. The consistency is perfect for even application. It didn’t cause my acne to flare up either which was great. I’m not sure I would go out of my way to purchse this product however. I feel like there are other options that are comparable for lower prices. nan
