I used this cream twice daily for over a month to test its effectiveness; once with a powdered additive (mix-in) and once without.  First -- the product itself comes in a tub, great for using all of the product as dispensed.  Second -- a little goes a long way -- this product has excellent glide.  This is not a greasy product and tends to absorb fairly quickly.  It played well with the other products in my skin routine, and it was a great carrier for a few other products that needed water based moisturizers to absorbed properly.  This moisturizer would be great for all skin types. Great Water Based Moisturizer
