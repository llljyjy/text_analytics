This was easy to apply and the color was beautiful and very natural looking. I’ve used it twice so far. No streaks or orange tones which I love! The smell is terrible though. Maybe it doesn’t mix with my body chemistry but even after showering I still had a lingering smell. Gorgeous color, terrible smell
