This isnâ€™t going to be a super moisturizerising cream but it does exactly what it is supposed to! I needed a retinol eye cream to help all the milia (tiny bumps) under my eye. I have tried multiple expensive retinol creams and this one worked quickly and better than everything else I have tried. nan
