It’s very difficult to find a product that doesn’t contain hyaluronic acid so when I saw that it didn’t I bought 2 of them. However, I did not notice that it contained sodium hydroxide and alcohol. I’m not a chemist but I do realize that you need a stabilizer but isn’t that what propanediol for? This also contains sodium benozoate which is a preservative so why does this need to have lye and alcohol in it? No hyaluronic acid in it, finally!
