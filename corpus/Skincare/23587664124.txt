This is worth the money if you are someone like me. I have had bad cystic acne in the past with occasional flare ups and needed help (strong help) with the hyperpigmentation that comes after the acne. It has made a great difference in brightening my skin and making me look more alive in the mornings! I’ve used it about 2 months now and it’s almost half gone. I use two pumps every morning. Additionally, I have incredibly sensitive skin and had no problems with this. nan
