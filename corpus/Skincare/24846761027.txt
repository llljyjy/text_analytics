I have cystic hormonal acne and pretty oily skin, but it’s relatively rare a moisturizer makes me feel this oily. I’ve been using this before bed for the past few days and every time I wake up, my face is caked in oil. I exfoliate beforehand too, so all that oiliness pops up overnight somehow. I have very sensitive eyes too, and this did irritate my eyes a bit when I accidentally put some product too close once. My skin does look nice, but I feel like The Ordinary natural moisturizing factors + HA or just good old CeraVe cream makes my skin *feel* better than this does though. Would probably work better for someone who’s skin can handle about oils/pore-clogging products in small amounts. Gonna continue to use to see if my skin will adjust at all, since it hasn’t made me break out. Made me oily.
