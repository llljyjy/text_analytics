I used this product for a week after being gifted it and I can say it definitely will be staying in my line up of skin care! Itâ€™s plumping and very hydrating for my combo skin. 2 pumps of the product is a generous amount for my skin for it to be absorbed easily. I took off one star due to the packaging because I find that the pump can get messy and would probably be better if it were a dropper for dispensing the product instead. Be sure to always shake the product before use as it separates quite easily in the bottle. Gifted/ Hydrating for Combo Skin
