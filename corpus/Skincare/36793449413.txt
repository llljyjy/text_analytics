I have been using this product for less than 2 weeks on my problem areas (nose and chin) and it has reduced the look of my pores and blackheads. They were very large, especially on my nose. They are noticeably smaller and around half the size that they used to be. These are so much better for my skin than the pore strips that Iâ€™ve been using for the past few years. This is such a great product! I have very sensitive and dry skin. It is a bit irritating but that is why I only use it on my nose and chin. I use this once a day at night. This has really reduced my pores and blackheads
