LOVE this cleanser! When the Cerave SA Cleanser went viral I bought it and went through two bottles with little to no changes in my skin. Within just a few weeks of using this INKEY List Salicylic Acid cleanser my skin has cleared so much. I definitely notice a difference in the pores in my problem areas like my nose, cheeks, and chin. I suffer from hormonal acne and this has helped to clear a lot of the bumps I had. I love how affordable this product is, I just wish it came in a bigger bottle. For me, I did go through a skin purging period, for about a week or so. Once I got through that, it has been so amazing at clearing my blackheads. nan
