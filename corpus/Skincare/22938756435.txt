I have white 30 y/o sensitive skin that’s combo and acne prone- This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. It’s not too heavy feeling, deeply moisturizes and I don’t think it causes breakouts. The refill is a little tricky- watch a tutorial before you do it or your gonna get your hands all up in the stuff. Best moistorizer ever.
