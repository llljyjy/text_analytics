I got this during the fall sale and it has been over a week that I am using it (a few more times than the suggested usage). I have trained my skin with acid already, I usually use the Tarte Knockout and I have a hard time deciding which one is my favourite. I like the moon juice because I see the results the following morning. I had a few occasions that it burnt more than just a tingling but it’s okay. It happens. I am fine and so is my skin. I would understand why some people aren’t impressed and have issues! It is a strong acid ! I am not a fan of the application but I also managed … I think it is saving product by having it put a few drops on my face directly without a cotton pad Excellent product
