I got it a few weeks ago and I love it. it feels really nice around my eyes, definitely help hydrating my skins especially at night i get so dried out by the house heat. It has a light smell of cucumber which I love, it’s like getting it from a spa. definitely keeping this one in my daily routines. it’s a nice to have. nan
