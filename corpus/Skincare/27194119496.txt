I received sample sizes from Influenster to review and honestly, it was difficult to get the product out of the sample packs. Aside from that, it was extremely sticky and I didn’t really care for how it sat under my eyes. I didn’t notice any visible difference in the look or texture under and around after 7 days, either. I wouldn’t recommend spending money on this product. Didn't care for it
