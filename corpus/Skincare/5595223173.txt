I honestly got this product with zero expectations but I literally just wanted to upgrade my skincare routine. I bought it on sale and I now that I had it for months, I believe it’s worth the original price. I love it so much and I believe it made a difference with my skin. The same cleanser I’ve been using is now giving me better results. I don’t know why there are so many bad reviews
