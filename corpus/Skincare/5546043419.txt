Thank you Influenster and Dior for this complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.  I was unsure how to use this product and was pleased to read that it has multiple uses to treat and soothe skin.  The timing of receiving this product could not have been better.  I started the Musely Spot Treatment regimen in November and had just received Stage 2 of my regimen which caused extreme dryness to my cheeks and nose as well as redness to my skin.  The flaking on and around my nose was so bad that I couldn’t apply foundation.     I applied Dior Cica Recover Balm to my face for 3 weeks in the morning and evening.  I used less than a pea size amount to moisturize my face.  The balm is thicker once dispensed and I thought that my skin would look and feel greasy after application due to the product’s consistency.  I was pleasantly surprised that this balm melted into the skin and did not leave any greasy residue.  There is no noticeable scent and it did not clog my pores.  After 2 days of use, my skin dryness and flaking were non-existent!  This is an extremely effective, lightweight balm that works wonders for dry, sensitive skin!  Unlike other products that just lock in the moisture, this truly hydrates the skin.  I will continue to use this in conjunction with my Spot Treatment for its gentle hydrating properties.  Dior Cica Repair & Recover Balm is the only product that has effectively cleared up & kept the dryness and flakiness at bay. #diorskincare Soothing & Effective
