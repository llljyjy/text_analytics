I am definitely enjoying this product so far. I’ve been using it every other night for almost a month & it’s definitely helped with my redness and possibly a bit of my texture. I like that it’s very light feeling on the face and it doesn’t make me breakout in any way. I’m going to continue to use this and may repurchase if my texture continues to get better. good beginning retinol product
