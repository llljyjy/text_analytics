This is such an amazing serum. So gentle but so effective. I have oily/combo skin and large pores, not much hyperpigmentation but definitely some dullness. This serum has brought AMAZING brightness to my skin, keeps my skin exfoliated and clear and makes it so I really dont need a physical exfoliant. I say work up to using it more often, once a week to start and then you can go up to every other night if you feel comfortable/if your skin needs it. This serum is so worth it and provides real, great results! BEST gentle exfoliating serum ever.
