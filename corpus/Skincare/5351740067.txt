As with any product the best way to get a full understanding of it is to have ample time to test it out. Since Iâ€™ve only been using this for 2-3 weeks I would say it has shown some signs of improvement in my skins texture and tone as far as evenness, but I did notice a kind of purge my skin did when I first started using the retinol. I make sure to use this 2-3 times weekly at night and always wear a sunscreen daily. This product does work but as with anything else it will take time to show improvements. I find it is especially good for my oily skin using a combination of retinol and AHA on a weekly/ bi weekly schedule. Find what works for you and this could be a great addition to your skin care routine. nan
