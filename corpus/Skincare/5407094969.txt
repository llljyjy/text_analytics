Some of those reviews are saying this product didn’t work.  You can’t expect overnight miracles.  I had two big deep-under-the-skin pimples.  I applied this twice a day for 5 days.  The two hard pimples are GONE!  No dark spot left behind.  This is my only spot treatment that I reach for.  Not the pink drying lotion, not the pimple patch, not the tea tree essential oil.  This succinic acid is my savior. really works!
