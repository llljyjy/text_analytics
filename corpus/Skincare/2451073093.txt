This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin looking refreshed and hydrated. The texture of the cream is supple and rich but doesn’t apply heavily. I think it’s a great addition to a your summer care skincare routine. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
