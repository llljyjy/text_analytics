I think this debuted through QVC in some kind of exclusive launch last fall, that is when I noticed it first on their website. I have been using this at night for almost 6 months, and do trade off using this on top of my Ordinary Squalene oil or slugging with Cerave’s healing ointment. This works great as a night time under eye mask, way too emollient for daytime use. My under eyes are hydrated and plump after using, this was a life saver during the winter when the cool air outside and dry heat inside, cause my skin to dehydrate terribly.  I also purchased the Beauty Bio eye firming cream from QVC and that must still be exclusive to them since I haven’t found elsewhere. Another perk to using this is that a little goes a long way, and no milia issues. I know that is an issue that is different for everyone but I have had issue with them forming when using thicker eye creams. This hasn’t caused issues at all. Very hydrating
