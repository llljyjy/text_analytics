I liked this product specifically for the texture of the cream itself. As a product that advertises strength boosting for skin and collagen peptides, the strength of the product is reflective of the strength it will give your skin if you use it for a consistent amount of time. The texture actually gives you some resistance when you touch it, and that intrigues me! I actually really liked it. I did not have any adverse reactions using this product. The scent is light and lovely. I actually look forward to using it in my morning and night time routines! Big big fan!
