I love this product. It doesn’t dry out my skin like normal cleansers. This will definitely be a staple in my skincare routine. I use it in the morning when my skin is usually the most dry. I don’t use it for assisting with makeup removal. I have really dry skin so I thought this may help with cleansing without drying. A must for those with Dry Skin
