My holy grail moisturizer lotion for my face. I’m 28 years old and have suffered from acne in my teens and early twenties. At that time this was the only product that didn’t make me break our and left my skin feeling good. Now in my late twenties I constantly try new moisturizers to find something better but it’s always worse. I always go back to this one and buy the biggest one possible to save money. Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin. favorite moisturizer ever
