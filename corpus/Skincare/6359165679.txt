I was so excited to try this super versatile cleanser and was amazed with how well it cleansed my skin. I normally double cleanse in the evening as part of my routine and I didn’t need to with this product. It also didn’t irritate my sensitive skin! Would highly recommend as a solid facial cleanser.
