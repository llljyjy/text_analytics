It smells like a crayon and almost feels like one too. Maybe I got a bad one, but looking at the reviews it seems the formula has changed for the worse. It left my lips even dryer than before application, which btw was painful. Not smooth and has an odd texture. For $10 you can get better. nothing like the OG
