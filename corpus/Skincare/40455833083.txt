I am looking for a good exfoliator to use for my mature skin. I stumbled on this product and started reading the reviews on here. I see many reviews say that they received a free sample from Dermalogica. I thought it would be a good idea to try and receive a free sample for myself to see if I like this product. I went on the site and put in my email and phone number, which is required to sign up to receive the “free“ sample only to find out that you have to make a purchase in order to recieve the “free“ sample. To me this is missleading. I did give the product one star as I had to choose yes or no to place a review on here if I would recommend the product. Based on others reviews I thought it at least deserved one star, maybe more. I just wanted others to know that some may be getting the free sample but some are not. But now they have my email and phone number. Dermalogica sample- Free sample may not be free.
