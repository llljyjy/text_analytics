I had no acne problems until I started college. Stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep really did a number on my skin and for the first time in my life— I began experiencing very painful breakouts. I have used this product consistently for 4 years now and it has helped clear up my skin so much. I still periodically breakout (especially after I travel) and this mask has never let me down. For more intense breakouts, I leave the mask on overnight after I have done the rest of my skincare routine and have never had any issues (although I recognize this might not be the right move for people with dryer skin). It dries out whiteheads, pushes blackheads to the surface, and reduces redness. It’s great for full-face application, but also works just as well if you’re only trying to cover a few spots. Love, love, love this product and will continue to use it! First photo is from Feb 2020 (height of my breakouts) and the second photo is from June 2022. Excellent for long-term and short-term acne care
