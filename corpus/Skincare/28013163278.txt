If you haven’t tried a cleansing water before, this is going to blow your mind! I’m still new to skincare and apparently I’ve been wasting my time with makeup wipes and balms. This works amazingly and I am never going back. I soak one cotton pad in the solution (the pump bottle makes it so easy!) and I start with my eyes, I’m usually wearing heavy pigments in vibrant colors and lot of mascara and eyeliner so I hold the pad over them for 10 seconds or so, then gently drag, and it is ALL GONE in those seconds! I then take the clean side of the pad and gently drag it over the rest of my face, and I’m bare faced in less than a minute, and my fresh skin feels plump, bouncy and hydrated, no rinsing needed! I am telling everyone I know who wears makeup that they need this! nan
