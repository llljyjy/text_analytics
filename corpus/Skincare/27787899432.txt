I do not have dry skin but I do suffer from dry patches so I was ecstatic to get my hands on this product. The serum is phenomenal! It is super hydrating and leaves my skin soft and plump. The packaging is also so nice; it feels luxurious.  The ginseng scent is not overpowering at all and the formula is lightweight. I paired this serum with my Sulwhasoo firming cream. So luxurious!
