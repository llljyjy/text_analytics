I wasn’t expecting much honestly, I’ve used tan waters before and ended up with patchy results. After just one night of this I’m truly shocked!! My color developed into a really pretty violet-based golden color. I prefer more tans with a more violet undertone bc I’m Asian and certain brands can look green/yellow on me. I typically use the Loving Tan in Medium bc I LOVE the subtle color it gives and the violet base but I hate the feeling of being sticky. This is exactly what I was looking for and I wish I had found this sooner!! So happy I found this
