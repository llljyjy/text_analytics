Iâ€™ve used cleansing balms before but this one is unique. It really does feel like it melts into my skin and melts away my makeup. I usually have to wash away my mascara several times to remove it with my other cleansers or makeup wipes but I was able to remove it easily the first time with this cleansing balm. It also look off my long wearing lipstick with no problems. I also noticed it really hydrated my skin and made it feel really soft. A little bit also goes a long way. Great at removing makeup
