I love the Sunday Riley brand and use nearly every product they offer. This moisturizer was a miss for me. The floral smell is so incredibly strong I couldn’t get past it. I am not usually sensitive to fragrance but this one was intense and did not fade after application. The moisturizer itself feels beautiful! A creamy gel texture. I’ll be going back to their original CEO moisturizer. A Rare Miss for Sunday Riley
