I was so excited to receive the SATOCANE Pore Purifying Scrub Mask to try. I love skin care and am constantly using at least one mask a week for my combination skin! The packaging was cute. I loved the calm, neutral colored tones and thought it made it look more high end. Parts of the bottles were also made with recycled rice husk, which is awesome!The texture was thick and smooth. I loved that the mask requires you to leave it on for 5 minutes, I feel like most masks are a 10 minute minimum! I used this once a week and loved the way my skin felt after. I have combination skin and both the dry and oily areas felt refreshed. The exfoliation is also not too rough, so I appreciate that it won’t cause issues later in life (like faster aging) from being too bumpy. Overall, I’d recommend this product if you’re looking for a quick mask that is very gentle. It’s probably best for textured and combination/oily skin! nan
