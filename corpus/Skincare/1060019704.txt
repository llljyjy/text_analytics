This absorbed very quickly into my skin. It left a slight tacky feeling for a while after application. I didn’t see any effects of the vitamin C but also prefer to use my vitamin C as a separate step and not combined in a moisturizer. As a primer, I found it caused my foundation to seperate on my face (I tried it with 2 types... Full coverage matte and foundation serum). I’m going to continue to use this in my travel bag because it will take up less room instead of using 3 different products. Once it’s done, I would not purchase.  I received this product as a free sample box. nan
