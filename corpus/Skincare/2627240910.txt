The key to using this is to use it by itself after washing your face. My line of work requires me to use n95s all the time and I get these fungal bumps and skin discolorations from friction on the bridge of my nose and around my nares and sometimes on my chin. I shower, wash my face and plop this on (1-2 pumps), tap it on my cheeks, chin and forehead and then spread it evenly. Done! I go to sleep, wake up and am amazed at how evenly toned my skin is. My other faves from this line are the watermelon moisturizer, hyaluraunic serum, Bha/aha toner (a must have!) and watermelon sleeping mask.My skin is combo/dry at times during the winter. These items keep my skin from overproducing oil to compensate. Freakin awesome stuff! nan
