WOW, I really love this scrub. Initially received as a sample, then went back and purchased the mini size. Immediately felt and saw a difference in my skin after the first use. I saw some other reviews saying the product “balls up quickly“ but I feel like that is the dead skin cells coming off. Skin is incredibly smooth and bright after use, and helps to speed along recovery of post-acne scarring. I bought the mini to start and I think it’ll last quite a long time, a little goes a long way. Thinking of purchasing the value size for use on my body too! Immediate results!
