I received this product for free through Topbox Circle.in exchange for my honest review.  This face cream is a new and improved formula and packaging is more eco-conscious.  As soon as you open up the jar, you’re hit with this light floral, citrusy fragrance.  This linen-coloured cream has a light whipped watery cream consistency that once applied its buttery softness melts into the skin absorbing quickly.  It leaves your skin with this soft, smooth, luxurious satiny skin-like finish.  Although, with a slightly tacky after feel, this non-greasy cream leaves even the most dehydrated skin, hydrated and nourished.  It’s like it literally wakes up the skin, allowing it to look more refreshed and rejuvenated. Omg....What I love about this cream is its plumping effect  it has and my face looks more fuller in appearance and brighter too!  Thank you so much Topbox Circle and Innisfree for this amazing product!!!  Wow, am totally blown away by how hydrating it really is!  It’s the perfect secret weapon to combat winter dry, chapped skin!!!!  Love it so much!!!#trywithtopbox #freeproduct A Total Game Changer in terms of Hydration!!!!
