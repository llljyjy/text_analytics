I recently took this to brunch with my girlfriends - it was a savior! We did not expect to sit outdoors in the sun for so long, so this sunscreen mist saved our skin. It feels super light, and the scent is lovely. I usually dislike perfumes or scented products, so I was surprised by how much I like this product. It is a win-win for me during the hot summer months in Southern California. It travels with me wherever I go for sun protection throughout the day. Great, easy to apply sun protection.
