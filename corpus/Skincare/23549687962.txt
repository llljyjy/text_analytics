Very disappointed. I love GR serums and I expected a new fav. However, this stuff irritates my eyes like no other sunscreen I had in years. Once applied in lip area, I’ve got that strong chemical taste that lasted till I drank a strong coffee. On top of everything this stuff peels off like no other and actually leaved a white cast and felt sticky. I can’t comment on spf protection because I wiped this off my face and used  another better and cheaper sunscreen from Sephora. I’ll give it 2 starts for the nice tube. nan
