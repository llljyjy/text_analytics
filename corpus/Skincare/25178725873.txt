Simply put -- I havenâ€™t found a moisturizer that agrees with my skin type that has SPF in it. SPF is obviously one of if not THE most important part of skin protection and routine so I knew I had to get it in somewhere! This mister is perfect, light, and layers on top of my moisturizer (FAB Ultra Repair) without feeling sticky or heavy. Worth every penny. Exactly what I needed!
