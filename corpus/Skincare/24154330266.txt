skin type: mild acne (t-zone), oily (t-zone), sensitivethis was a PHENOMENAL purchase. bought it for the cica component and it’s working beautifully--doesn’t irritate my existing acne and if anything is helping veeery slowly to heal it. my skin much prefers the hydration-based approach to acne treatments, so this product is a pleasant and most welcome new tool in my anti-acne arsenal.since i have oily skin, most moisturizers will just sit on top of the skin, leaving an oily sheen on application and even oilier sheen in the morning. no surprise, this product also left a mild sheen at night BUT i woke up the next morning with beautifully hydrated/plumped skin--everything had absorbed! as far as i’m concerned, i don’t mind looking a little bit shiny in the evenings if these are the results. the jar says to use 1/2x a week, which i started with, but i’ve carefully worked my way up to a little bit every night and there’s no irritation so i think it’s safe to use daily IN MODERATION. 9.5/10, slightly oily but WORTH IT
