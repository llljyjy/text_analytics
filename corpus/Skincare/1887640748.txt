I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this. Tho- I probably would have thought I’d still get better results. Nope! Pros, it’s applies nice and doesn’t have a horrible smell. Con, I’d never use this again. It’s more then streaky, it just stains random areas of skin in abstract designs. Now I’m going to have to keep exfoliating the next few days to try to remove it. Shouldn’t have strayed from my Tan luxe gradual tan lotion for the cheaper price :/ & yes I know how to prep skin prior to self tanner and have used plenty of brands over the years. It’s definitely this product. horrible
