This product has actually made a difference in helping my skin retain moisture during a very dry winter.  Winter air has been sucking my skin dry this year, especially the delicate eye area, and I was at my wits end futilely slathering on every moisturizer I owned. A Sephora store associate recommended the Plum Plump serum, and after a week,  I can legitimately say I have experienced noticeable improvements. I highly recommend it for the winter. I wish there were a specific eye version too. nan
