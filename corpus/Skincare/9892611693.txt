one of my favorite skincare products currently! I’ve been a fan of acne treatment oils for a while. I have fairly minor hormonal acne (w skin that scars easily) but my skin is mostly normal, just a tad oily. I first started using herbivore’s lapis oil, which I still think is a great product, but I didn’t use it up before it expired so I decided to try out this one since there’s a smaller bottle available. i love it! Results are just as good if not better and it absorbs super quickly. If I notice a pimple popping up at night, it looks 10x better the next morning after applying this. It’s so nice to have a treatment that doesn’t dry out my skin nan
