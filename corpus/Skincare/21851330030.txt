I received this product complimentary. I have combo oily skin so in the past I’ve never really benefited much from Niacinimide. I have only ever used Niacinimide by the ordinary so using Paula’s choice was new and different for me. Similar to the ordinary I found this Niacinimide to improve the texture and dark spots on my skin. It’s made my scarring fade however I haven’t noticed any drastic changes how others have. It could be my skin type or i need to just keep using it more. Okay for oily combo skin
