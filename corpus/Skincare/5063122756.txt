The packaging on this product was so poorly thought out. Since it’s a curved bottle with a short pump when you try to dispense product it doesn’t all go onto your fingertips because you can’t put you can only put one finger under the pump and this is a very liquidy formula. You have to pick it up and tilt it to dispense better. Considering how expensive this product is and how little product you get I’d hope that would have at least been better. As for the formula, it’s greasy and takes what feels like hours to sink in but if you’re reapplying as often as directed it won’t ever fully absorb. I haven’t tried this with makeup on and I have no desire to considering how greasy it is. It seems like makeup will not mesh well with it, but I’m not sure since I didn’t try it. Overall, I was expecting so much more since I like their unseen sunscreen. Not What I Was Hoping For
