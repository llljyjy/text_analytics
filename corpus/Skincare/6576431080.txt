I was excited to try this out because I’ve been needing a good moisturizing lip oil however this feels more like a gloss. It’s advertised as non sticky but It definitely is. If it were advertised as a sheer gloss I’d be happy because it does give a cute red sheen to your lips and the cherry scent is amazing. Also my lips felt just as dry if not worse after the product was gone. I love it just not as a lip oil. It’s a lip gloss.
