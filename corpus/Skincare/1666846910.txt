This is a great mineral sunscreen. If you’re an oilier skin type you’ll definitely love it because it dries down to a matte finish with a nice grip that serves as a primer if you choose to wear foundation. I’m a combination/dry so a use my serums and moisturizer before applying. The white disappeared immediately on my light skin tone. 11.5 zinc oxide and 4 percent titanium dioxide. It has a wonderful light citrusy lime smell that also dissipates quickly. Never leave the house without sunblock, rain or shine. Oh how I wish I knew that in my teens! lovely
