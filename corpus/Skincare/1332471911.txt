I receive the clarins double serum for free in exchange for an honest review. I received a seven day trail and used it every night for one week. Itâ€™s not always possible to tell if a product is effective after just one week but here is what I did notice. My skin did feel softer and appeared to have a more even tone and slight changes to texture. The formula was not greasy at all, which was surprising because when I initially opened the first trail pack, it looked like to could have a greasy texture. This product is scented but smells lovely. My skin feels so soft!
