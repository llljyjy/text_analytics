This was a miss for my combo, dry-leaning skin. Left my skin feeling tight afterwards,  like it was squeaky clean (aka stripped). The smell was also really unpleasant—like a kids magic marker interpretation of blueberry. Very glad I decided to get the mini size first and didn’t waste money on the full size. On the plus side, the packaging is great. Love the pump and full cap, which along with the mini size, makes this super travel-friendly (which I’ll keep it in the back or of my drawer for). 2 stars, as I imagine this would be more of a hit for oiler skin babes. Pass if you have dry skin
