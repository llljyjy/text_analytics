I received a jar of It Secret Sauce anti- aging cream in exchange for a review. First, it is not greasy and goes on smoothly.  There is a very light scent to it and it does not irritate my skin. I have a deep wrinkle that looks diminished. I can tell because it was profound and now is less noticeable. Would definitely recommend this cream. nan
