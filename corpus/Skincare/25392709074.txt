I received a complimentary sample size of this product from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. My skin is generally non-problematic, though I do have many pores. I do experience some dryness in the winter months so I was excited to see reviews stating Good moisturizer this product helps with that. I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and it’s not shown me any added benefits from other facial moisturizers I’ve used in the past. The scent smells like a sunscreen as well ehhhh
