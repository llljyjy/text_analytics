I suffer with acne and dry/combo skin. I’ve tried everythinggg and nothing works. I bought this serum along with a cleanser from the same brand. Let me tell youu my skin never felt this good. It’s so soft and bright. I don’t have breakouts anymore. (I bought this recently tho) but I’ve never tried a product that was that good. I also use the Cerave moisturizer as the final step after this serum. The moisturizer didn’t work that well on its own and I used to breakout from the moisturizer alone but I gave it another try after I bought these products. I don’t know what is in these products but if you’re like me and suffer from dryness and acne, give this a try. If you have dry/ acne prone skin, TRY THISS
