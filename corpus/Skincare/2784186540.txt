I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review. This sunscreen is a good option if you enjoy the brand. It works great under makeup and on its own. It has no tint (white) and blends really well on the skin. The face feels slightly oily after you let it sit but it is not significant. It has the typical sunscreen scent but itâ€™s not overpowering and fades away after applying. I want to see Shiseido and many other brands move towards being Cruelty-free. Does the job!
