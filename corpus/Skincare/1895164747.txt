I have pretty sensitive/dry skin and I was a little nervous to try out this face wash, but I’m so glad I did! It’s gentle enough to use daily as long as I am following it with skincare immediately. I enjoy the scent as well, and it is controlling breakouts/helping with dullness very well so far! nan
