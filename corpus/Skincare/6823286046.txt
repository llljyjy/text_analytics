I’ve used this product a few times - I thought it worked pretty well the first time (I had never used a product like this before), but it hasn’t been as effective since then. It still works fine but the blade wears out really easily. Also, the online videos say that it’s nearly impossible to cut yourself, but I actually had some minor scratches all three times I’ve used it. It’s a balance, since you have to add some pressure due to the nature of the blade. Also - the replacement blades are way too expensive. I probably would recommend it if it was more affordable. Slightly disappointed
