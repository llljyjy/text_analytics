Initially the first day, I absolutely loved everything about this cream! The texture was beautiful, the packaging was beautiful and it seemed to moisturize my skin beautifully! I have combination skin, which is very oily with very dry patches. I wanted to try something that was extra moisturizing for my dry flaking skin. I’m in my late 40s and this seemed to fit the bill, especially after I read such amazing reviews! I also loved the ingredients list. At first, this seemed like the perfect product…After four days of using this cream, my skin was peeling and flaking especially around the mouth! So sad. I don’t know what ingredient in this cream was drying out my skin, but it made my combination skin into a hot mess! I had clogged pores, acne and chunks of dry skin all around my mouth. I have never seen my face so dry, ever! This face cream is too much money for a face cream that doesn’t moisturize at all and makes your skin peel after a few days. Sadly, I returned it! This face cream was a hot mess!
