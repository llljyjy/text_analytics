Love the eye cream and normally get the jar but thought I would try this as a way of not having to use my fingers as much and that i like the look of the packaging but I really dislike the packaging. The lid is hard to get off and I don’t like the feel of the sponge applicator. Might be good for you if you’re on the go but I rather add a few extra minutes to my routine and take my time. it’s alright
