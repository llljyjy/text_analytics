I received this as a sample size to test out from topbox. I liked the texture. It has a pearlescent brightening shimmer to it which was nice for a serum. It goes on smooth and is very easy to blend into skin. It dries beautifully! Not sticky at all! And feels like thereâ€™s nothing on your skin which I love. It also has a matte finish which is great for daily wear. I was only able to test out a sample for a one time use but would be interested in trying it out a little longer before recommending it. Not bad
