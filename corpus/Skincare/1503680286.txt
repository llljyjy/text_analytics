Nice moisturizer that doesn’t feel heavy or overly scented. I appreciate that a little goes a long way which makes the product last longer. I’ve been impressed with all of YTTP products and my skin appears more youthful, smooth, and less oily. Now I only wish they would pause on making so many anti aging products and finally release a SPF moisturizer! Does the job it is intended to do.
