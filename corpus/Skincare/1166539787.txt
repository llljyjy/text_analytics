I absolutely LOVE this balm. I also don’t understand the bad reviews about the lavender scent. It’s very true to the smell of natural lavender, and that is stated in the description. It’s incredibly moisturizing and the relaxing scent of lavender makes it perfect for nighttime use. I alternate between this and Lapis oil and no longer wear foundation. (when you’re over 45, this is a beautiful thing) Highly recommend it. Love this!
