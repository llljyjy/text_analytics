Would be five stars if not for the added fragrance. Ingredients comparable to Skinceuticals but with the fragrance it may cause irritation for some. Definitely has helped hydrate and brighten my complexion. Each major ingredient is stored in its own tube and gets combined in your hand once you pump it out; in practice, I donâ€™t know that it makes a difference with ingredient stability but it does look cool. nan
