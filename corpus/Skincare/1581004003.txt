This did not work for me. There was no improvement in puffiness or baggie-ness. There was a cakey white residue. Moisturizer under and over didn’t help. Makeup wouldn’t lay over it. Just overall, I looked much worse for having used this product and had to wash my face and start over. First PTR product that I’ve hated. Test it first…
