The product comes out as a liquid, but as it’s applied, it feels like a powder on your skin. Blew my mind! It doesn’t leave you skin greasy or oily like typical sun blocks. It has a slight tint to it, but it’s not opaque enough to cover up any uneven skin tone. I loved the product by itself, but when I wore my typical makeup over the product, my makeup would sink into my wrinkles and make them look twice as worse. I would consider using this product on days I don’t use makeup, but I use mineral sunscreen daily to get the best protection, which this product unfortunately is not. Good without makeup
