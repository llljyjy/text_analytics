Be careful with this set! I had some acne and bought this set. I was confused bc at first I thought I was getting more acne but it was actually a really bad reaction to having my skin barrier being completely destroyed and now I’ve been diagnosed with rosacea. I have used plenty of acne products for 15 years but it’s now a year later and I’m still trying to repair my barrier and my rosacea. This is very potent!! way too strong
