I have dark circles under my eyes. I had tried so many products and nothing is working for me. So I tried Ole eye cream, I see noticeable difference. My eyes are not puffy anymore and I can see the pigmentation reduces a lot. Now my cheeks and my eye skin tone is same. It has vitamins c which helps reduce pigmentation. It is fragrance free and it’s good because it doesn’t irritate my eyes. I highly recommend this. Dark circles are reduced
