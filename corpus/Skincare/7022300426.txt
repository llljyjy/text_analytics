I have always struggled finding the right product to hydrate my sensitive/oily combo skin, and I need something effective that also works with retinols and Vitamin C treatments I use. This is it! I mix it with serum, apply on it’s own, you can’t go wrong any way you get this on your skin. It’s water light but works better to keep my skin hydrated and flake free than anything else I’ve tried. Also helps with redness when I use every day, no matter what other treatments I’m using with it. The most incredible hydrating product!
