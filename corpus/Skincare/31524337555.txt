You can see in the name that it is basically a moisturizer with SPF. It has a light creamy texture, melts and absorbs on skin very fast, doesnâ€™t leave any white stains after using, so you can easily use it under makeup. And of course - it moisturizes pretty well, but feels a little bit heavier than a regular moisturizer. Not water resistant. nan
