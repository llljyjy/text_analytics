LOVE this product. Quick and easy to use and get an even application. I put it on in the morning and never smell like “self tan” throughout the day. I was a little unsure the first time I used it but it went on pretty even, then second time it ended up flawless! The only thing I will warn is wear socks and then blend down after; the fallout will mess up your feet pretty badly. Color lasts a week as well and I do NOT take care of my tans. I’ve used every self tanner, airbrush tan, spray booth, etc. and this is the first time my husband won’t stop talking about my tan. Tanning junkies, DO IT!!! ADDICTED
