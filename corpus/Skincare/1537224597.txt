I wear sunscreen every day and this one is close to perfect.  This sunscreen ticks all of the boxes for me.  It goes on mostly matte, doesn’t leave a white cast, doesn’t sting my eyes and doesn’t make my glasses slip.  The only drawback is the packaging.  While the round bottle looks nice it’s awkward and bulky, taking up too much space in my bag.  Five stars for the product because I love it and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.  I just hope they change the bottle. Love the product, hate the bottle
