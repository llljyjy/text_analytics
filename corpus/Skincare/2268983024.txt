I’m usually pretty reluctant to try a new moisturizer. I admit that I am glad I was able to try this one though. This IT anti-aging moisturizer left my skin smooth and hydrated. I applied nightly to clean skin and awoke with nice skin that didn’t have dry patches. I’m giving 4 stars as I have nice skin, aside from dryness. I don’t have any aging signs, as I believe prevention is key. I feel this brand holds true to its claims and am excite to see how my skin looks and feels in a few months. I will updated my review then. Seems great so far
