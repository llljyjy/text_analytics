This is a great retinol serum and I loved that you mix it so that it hasn’t been sitting on shelves for a long time. Unlike some other retinol products that can be too drying or harsh, this stable formulation did not irritate my skin. The innovative dispenser ensure that I got the right amount of product each time and felt substantial in the hand. I’ve seen improvements in the texture and tone of my skin already. Great product! Fresh and Effective Retinol Serum!
