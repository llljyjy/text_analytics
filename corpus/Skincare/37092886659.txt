Horrible packaging just as everyone else says. greasy on the face and awful smell. Opening the bottle slowly liquid spurts all over the bottle and hands too. I use a lot of Tatcha products which I love but this one was a huge disappointment.  Buy the other Tatcha sunscreen no grease and no awful smell. don't waste your money!
