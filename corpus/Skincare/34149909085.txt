I got this as a sample so I can’t speak for how it would work over time but the 2 times that I did use it I didn’t love it because it pilled up over my face and did not absorb. The directions say to pat it in so after showering I did, and maybe I just used too much, but it just would not really get in there and kept pilling up on my fingers and face. I had to really pat it for quite a while and I still don’t think I got everything in.. Left strange texture. pilled up, hard to absorb
