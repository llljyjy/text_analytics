I tried this product as a gift from a purchase and blew my mind. My skin changed dramatically in a few days. I have melasma and texture problems (not scars, just irregular texture in my skin), and I canâ€™t say my melasma is fully gone, but the texture is more even and even some fine lines have diminished. Will be rebuying this. a must have
