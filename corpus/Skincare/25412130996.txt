The packaging is annoying and the powder felt it went everywhere but my face. I don’t think it would work alone. It’s definitely more for reapplying sunscreen. I use it after using my native sunscreen to mattify the sunscreen look. The way it releases product isn’t consistent so I have to work hard to get enough on my face. It’s okay
