I have normal Asian skin, which can become dull due due to lack of sleep. I’d tried various moisturizers over the years, but had never been really impressed by any. However, this moisturizer is wonderful. It makes my skin hydrated, smooth, and glowing. I also love its delicate warm scent. This is the first moisturizer that I’ve used up in such a short amount of time because I love using it every morning and night, and now I’m back for the second jar. It has helped me become confident in getting rid of foundation in my daily makeup. This product has become a favorite friend in my self-care regime. Must try! The best moisturizer I've ever tried!
