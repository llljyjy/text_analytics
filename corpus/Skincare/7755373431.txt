I always seek out percentages of ingredients in skincare to judge a product’s likely effectiveness, so I was impressed that this formula has a significant percentage of retinol (Vitamin A) paired with a desirable percentage of Vitamin C to help with hyperpigmentation and Vitamin E to neutralize the potential drying effects of retinol.  I still suggest patch testing and using it one or two times a week when beginning this treatment and gradually working your way up to using it every other day or daily once your skin has acclimated.  My skin is sensitive and light-toned, and when I tried this treatment for the first time, I experienced some stinging and redness that lasted for several minutes.  I’ve found that applying this every other day works best for me, and I always follow it with a heavy duty moisturizer.  Now when I use it, I no longer experience any irritation but rather only a slight tingling.  This product is definitely worth any adjustment period because it leaves the skin looking brighter and more youthful.  My deep forehead lines and crow’s feet are starting to look shorter and more shallow.  They are only prominent now when I smile or raise my eyebrows.  Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare.
