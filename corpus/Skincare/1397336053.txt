I’m grateful to have received this product in exchange for an honest review. I took about a month to use the product and feel that it did help to brighten my under eye area. I have previously purchased the original banana bright under eye cream and was a fan of the product so I was happy to see it get a great upgrade. The product is thick and goes on very smooth with a little amount needed to cover the area. It helped to moisture the skin and served as a great primer for my concealer. It’s a plus that it’s vegan and clean. As I’m getting into my mid-thirties, using products that contain clean ingredients is important to me. I look forward to seeing more improvement over time. Favorite eye cream!
