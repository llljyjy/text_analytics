I received a complimentary Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream for testing purposes. To be honest I have just not been taking care of me and my skin as of lately. I had multiple flaky, dry patches and redness on my face. This cream is thick and applies well. At first application it hydrated my skin and took care of the dry patches. It doesn’t have a scent which is helpful on my headache days. I really like the way my skin feels and it helped soothe the dryness and reduce redness. A must during these cold winter snaps. nan
