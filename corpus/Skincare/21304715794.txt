Such an interesting texture and leaves a beautiful finish on the skin. It is balm like, firm at first then melts as soon as you get it on your fingertips. Itâ€™s rich but not oily at all, sinks in quickly and makes skin look really lovely, great under makeup. I love all the active ingredients, a lot is packed into one product! Hydrating
