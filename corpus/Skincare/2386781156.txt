I received this product for free from Influenster and Lancôme for my honest review. I have used this product for 3 weeks now and although it is smooth on the skin and not too heavy, I haven’t noticed any anti-aging qualities. It smells very nice, not too strong. I didn’t like the fact that it required extreme shaking and I had to store it upside down to be able to get all three components to dispense. Although I like the product to make my skin glow and it is even under tinted moisturizer, I think the price point is high. Nice serum
