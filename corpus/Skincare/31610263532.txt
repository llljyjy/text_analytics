I thought I would really love this sunscreen because if felt like a primer so I thought it would work well under makeup but it definitely didn’t. It pills so badly that it was literally falling onto my chest. It also felt really heavy and wouldn’t absorb into my skin and it had a bad smell that made me feel kind of nauseous. It was really hard to wash off too. If you plan on just wearing this and not layering with any serums or makeup or anything I think it could work for you cause it does give a nice blurring effect and doesn’t leave any white residue. Otherwise I think it’s a no. PILLS REALLY BADLY
