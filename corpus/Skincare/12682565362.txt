I’m always reluctant and skeptical when it comes to trying new eye serum, but this stuff turned out to be pretty good. It has a nice cooling sensation, it goes on smooth, and within 24 hours, I started to see results. I bought it in the hopes of eliminating under eye circles and to make myself appear more rested. It took about a week to see the full results, but it was worth the wait. No more dark circles and I haven’t had to use as much concealer. My skin is also firmer and smooth. No harsh smell, no skin irritation, no burning, and no side effects. this serum works!
