I was asked to give my honest review of this product (received in mail)! First it feels amazing. I was using another eye cream that was very thick, heavy and hard to apply! I have dark circles and get dry around my eyes, so this hydrating! Pleasant, subtle smell, and is great for sensitive skin (which I have)!I have been applying twice a day (morning and night), for the last two days, and I do see a subtle difference. I will definitely keep using and canâ€™t wait to buy the full size and add to my skin routine! Amazing!!!
