This stuff is great!  I have to say I haven’t met many Kiehls products that I don’t like.  This of course is no different.  It’s got a nice light almost gel kind of texture.  I love that it doesn’t look greasy when I put it on though and doesn’t add extra shine to my face.  It’s done a great job nourishing fine lines around my eyes.  I can also notice a difference in my dark circles which are always pretty noticeable.  Definitely will buy again! nan
