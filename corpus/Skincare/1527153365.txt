I love the formula, but the packaging is awful.  As shown in some of the pictures from reviews, the spray coat on the bottle just disintegrates.  Then flakes just end up in your hand, which then is applied to your face with the SPF.  It’s an absolute terrible experience, which is a shame because the formula itself is DIVINE.  It’s such an expensive SPF for such cheap packaging. Pls change the packaging!!
