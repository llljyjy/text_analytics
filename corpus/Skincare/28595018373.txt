I have had no problems with this product on top of any of my foundations/ tints! I needed something to be able to reapply on top of makeup and was a bit scared of a powder because I have very dry skin but this works great and does not dry me out whatsoever! I think the packaging is super convenient for carrying and applying. I will definitely be looking at more supergoop products for my base! very convenient and not drying
