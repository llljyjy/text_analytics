i havent tried the product yet but am convinced i will love it!just received it in the mail today and will use later on, but i was reading the reviews here and couldnt help but notice a lot of reviews around the same time in 2020 say the bottle is almost half empty or just air. i just came here to say it must be a manufacturing issue that has since been resolved (or not and i just got a full bottle), but my bottle is full and i wanted to show what it looks like when it is full. i opened it just now, tapped all of the product to the bottom of the container, and this is how much i can squeeze it before product comes out.i would say still buy the product and just return and get a new one if you experience it being quite empty nan
