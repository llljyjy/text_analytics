I really love the finish of this moisturizer! It’s not overly greasy or super shiny, and works well under foundation! What really sold me - I got this moisturizer at the beginning of July, and on July 4th, like an idiot, I got pretty bad sunburn on my face. I slathered this on before bed and overnight I felt such a difference! I kept using it morning and night and my face never dried out and peeled like it usually would, around my nose/forehead specifically. Definitely recommend! There is a scent but it’s super light and you don’t continue to smell it after application or anything! New Favorite Moisturizer!!
