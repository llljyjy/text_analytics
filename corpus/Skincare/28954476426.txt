I was sent this product #free from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest review. I have been using the Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence for 3 weeks now in the PM along with my night face routine. It has a water like consistency, so 1 pump really is enough. I havenâ€™t noticed a big difference in the brightness of my skin, but the product does feel really nice on the skin.  I love this brand, and will continue to use, as I feel like more time is needed to see a change. nan
