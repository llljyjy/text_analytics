I received a deluxe mini of this product as a promo or for points (I can’t recall which). I find that it does melt my makeup, including waterproof mascara, however, it does not rinse clean. I have to follow up with a gentle foaming cleanser to remove all residue and feel that my face is fully clean. I will continue to use it as a first cleanse, however I don’t plan to purchase the full size since another product works better for me at removing all makeup without the residue. As for the Bamboo Booster, I LOVE IT, and wish they sold that product separately. The exfoliating beads are nice and smooth and round, therefore quite gentle. Love the beads, but this doesn’t rinse clean
