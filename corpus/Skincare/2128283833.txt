This cleanser changed my life.. (sounds dramatic I know but really) even now in my 30’s I was still breaking out pretty badly. I went into Sephora begging someone to help me and that’s when Tata Harper  came into my life. The price tag is a little expensive but totally worth every penny. Because it’s part of the clean collection I was able to use it during my pregnancy as well. Must have!!
