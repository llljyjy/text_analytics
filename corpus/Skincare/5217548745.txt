This product melted into my skin so nicely. It didn’t leave that weird tacky texture or shiny film of some previous products I have tries.  Under eye was far more hydrated.  I took off points for packaging, I don’t like putting my hands into products, it increases risk of bacterial growth no matter how clean your hands are.  I received this product free from Influenster for my honest opinion. Like butter..
