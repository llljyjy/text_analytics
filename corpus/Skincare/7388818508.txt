After using this Glow Recipe Serum, my face felt glowy and even brighter. I have sensitive skin and most of the time acids are irritating, but that isn’t the case with this product! I think it’s a great gentle exfoliant you can use in the AM and PM. I haven’t seen any big difference in my skin texture, but I will continue using it to hopefully see results as time goes by. Great Gentle Exfoliant
