I have been using retinol for 15 years and this is one of the more strong retinols a little goes a long way. I use this only 2-3 times a week evenings only. Been using this now for 3 weeks and have noticed a difference on the texture and smoothness of my face! I am close to 40 yrs old no botox & this has made my face glowy & less fine lines! Affordable retinol treatment & worth the purchase! Must have retinol treatment!
