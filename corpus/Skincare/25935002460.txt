I’ve tried so many products to clear up my acne and this is the only one that works consistently! I use this once a day in the morning and mainly focus it on my problem areas. I’ve noticed that if I apply this to my entire face my skin gets very dry. You have to apply this product in a certain way. After my toner dries I apply this and then wait at least 20 minutes for it to be completely absorbed into my skin before I put my moisturizer on. If you do not wait it will start to pill and flake off your skin. My skin has a more even tone and texture after using this product! great for acne and uneven tone!
