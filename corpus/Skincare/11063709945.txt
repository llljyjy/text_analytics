It’s a very moussey texture. You have to damp your face and hands to use this product and rub lather in your palms for a little bit to get that creamy milky texture. It has a subtle flower smell but just a hint of it. I have sensitive skin so unfortunately, this stung me a littleeee bit. I don’t have any reaction after, it’s just during the wash. Otherwise, I recommend it! nan
