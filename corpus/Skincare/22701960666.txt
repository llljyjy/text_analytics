I’ve been using this moisturizer for quite a while - overall it’s a good moisturizer for anyone who has oily skin or just wants a lightweight gel-like formula (especially for the morning). I have combination skin, and I did however find that it just is not as hydrating as my skin needs. As with other reviews, this moisturizer does in fact peel/pill. I’ve noticed this with and without makeup. It’s the only pitfall of this product in my opinion. This gel has a lovely fresh scent that is not overwhelming for anyone who is sensitive to smells. I would describe the smell to be like fresh garden peas. Overall, it’s a solid product and I believe the positives outweigh the fact that it peels off/pills. nan
