I’ve very dry skin that appreciates any hydrating products. This serum is one I added recently to my routine and so far I’m loving it! It’s a creamy serum that can act like a moisturizer if you don’t have super dry skin. I do go in with a moisturizer on top of it as my skin skin needs it. I apply this after my toner and other serums. It definitely feels luxurious and great on the skin. One downside is the quantity you get for the price as it’s primary job is hydration and we got to use it daily, I think it should at least be a 50 ml bottle for the price. Hydrating!
