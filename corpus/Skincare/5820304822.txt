This product does exactly what I need it to, which is reduce my morning eye swelling and add some light moisture. Doesn’t impact makeup and eyes are de-puffed in just a few minutes. I’ve consistently repurchased it. Given that this product is targeted in its primary benefit, I use a heavier moisturizing/anti aging cream at night to get all the other benefits I’m looking for. Eyes look wide awake!
