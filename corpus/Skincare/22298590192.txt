I recently got this product free in exchange for my honest review. I loved this wrinkle correcting serum. I found it worked great on my skin. It didn’t leave my skin feeling oily or sticky which is a must in my skincare routine. I loved that it was easy to apply and the instructions were easy to understand. I loved that it doesn’t have a strong scent. I applied this in the morning during my morning skincare routine. I would definitely recommend this product. #freeproduct Great Wrinkle Serum
