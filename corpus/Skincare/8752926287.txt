This is a great product! I got the exact tan I wanted, and it was simple enough to add to my lotion after my shower.It does have that typical fake-tanner smell, which I don’t mind. It’s not overwhelming, and it fades in a couple hours.Don’t be convinced by the people who say this product streaks; that’s just user error, and they don’t know how to apply it properly. After showering and exfoliating my body, I used rubber gloves to apply it so my hands didn’t stain. I squirt some lotion onto my finger, put about 5 drops (per area on my body) into my palm, then took my free hand to mix them together, and finally applied to each area just like I’m putting lotion on. No streaks, no patches, just a flawless, beautiful golden tan.This product does everything it claims, when used properly.BACKGROUND:Having said all that, I am not a fake-tanner. I don’t have a lot of experience with it, I’ve never even been to a tanning salon (I’m 30). The most experience I have with fake tanning is a bottle of Jergen’s natural glow I used at least ten years ago. I prefer the natural tan I get from being outdoors. However, I haven’t had time to get outside as much as I’d like lately, and I’ve been craving that beautiful sun-kissed look. (Although, self tanner is just as harmful to your body as a sun tan due to the DHA or erythrulose in it, if not worse since you’re not getting any vitamin D, in fact, it’s depleting your body of the vital nutrient. I believe using it in moderation is ok, just as time in the sun in moderation is ok.)Now, I have a jump start on my summer bod! :) Beautiful, summer tan when it's 40 degrees out!
