I’ve been trying a few different types of eye creams for the last several months to try to find one that works for me. So far, this one has been my favorite! I just repurchased a second container and I will most likely stick with this one for a while because it helped my dry and very fine line under-eye concerns. I never experienced any pilling/flakiness or irritation due to this product. I don’t think this eye cream is suited for everyone, it definitely helped with making my under-eye a bit more “snatched“ but I’m also in my early 20s; if you’re looking for more out of an eye cream, I don’t think this product is for you. This eye cream is more targeted towards younger people who don’t have any major under-eye concerns. Fantastic Eye Cream for Younger People
