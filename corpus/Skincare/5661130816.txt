I’ve been using this cleanser in leu of my favorite one for about a week now. I experienced a day of purging in which my face broke out. That quickly diminished after continued use. Now my skin feels balanced and plump. I wouldn’t say this has replaced my favorite cleanser, but I would recommend it for anyone with normal to combo skin who’s looking for a non stripping cleanser. A very nice cleanser
