This moisturizer is super duper thick and creamy. It would be ideal for those with really thirsty skin. My skin gets oily easily so this has tended to make me a bit greasy, so I likely wonâ€™t buy again. It does smell great! I was given this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review through Influenster. Very thick and creamy
