Def one of my all time fav makeup removers !! Takes everything off easily without much/ any effort. Clean ingredients make my skin and soul happy. I switch between this , Clinique take the day off and the elf makeup remover. This one is probably my fav as it’s the only one that doesn’t leave a ton of ‘residue ‘ ( if you use balm to take off your makeup you know what I mean haha) Takes everything off with no effort
