I have had this device for about 6 months now. If you are a products junkie like me, and even if you aren’t, this device helps make the most of everything you put on your skin. I like to use the extract function in conjunction with my favorite clay masks, to target the pores and texture specifically around my nose and mouth. I love to use the infuse setting to send my hydrating and firming eye cream deep into my eye area. I have noticed astonishing improvements in the texture and elasticity of my skin. Consistent use has made the biggest difference, but I have friends who have tried this (disinfected before and after!) and noticed an improvement after just one use. Investing in this tool gave me a better “rate of return“ on my investments in targeted treatments and a good daily routine. Level up your favorite products
