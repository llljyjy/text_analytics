I received a free trial of this product for my honest review and I have to say I was impressed with how it made my skin feel. It felt soft and smooth. I have really dry skin so it was nice to feel smooth skin. The scent isn’t over powering. The packaging is cute. The sample size was very small I only have enough to use it twice so I wasn’t able to give it a try long enough to see if it had a lasting effect. Made my skin feel smooth and soft.
