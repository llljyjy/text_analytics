Will not purchase again. The actual serum seems to hydrate my skin but the container is awful. It shoots the serum out like a bullet flying out of a gun and you never know which direction itâ€™s gonna shoot. In addition, the amount that comes out is about the size of two peas. Which is fine but if you want a little more you need to squirt again and it may go in a totally different direction. I usually combine my moisturizer and hydrator in on my finger tips which I could do easier with the drunk elephant hydrator but with this machine gun-like dispenser good luck! Dispenser firms projectiles!
