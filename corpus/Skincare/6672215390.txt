Itâ€™s a decent moisturizer. Overall, it hydrates and moisturizes. I did not have any adverse reactions, but I also did not have any significant noticeable changes to my skin either. It was light and the scent was pleasant. I felt like I had to use a little more than other moisturizers to get the same coverage.I received this as a complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. nan
