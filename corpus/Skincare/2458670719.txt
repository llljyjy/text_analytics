You can do way better for this price point. It feels and looks nice at first but not that hydrating and doesn’t really do much for redness. Also, if your redness comes from irritated skin and you’re negatively affected by essential oils, stay away. This has lots. I don’t hate it but it’s not great. Glad I tried it via Mikayla’s kit rather than a full one so now I know it’s just not for me. it’s just meh
