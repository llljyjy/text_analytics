If I could give it zero stars, I would. Not only does this product have such a weird smell, but it oxidizes way too quickly and went from a nearly translucent serum to neon orange because of the oxidation. Even before it fully turned orange, it gave my skin a weird orange tint (while still being a clear serum) and turned my sunscreen orange as well. Save your money!!! There are definitely better products available. not for me
