My skin gets dry during winter. I need a rich cream that doesn’t feel sticky and this does the job. It is moisturizing and gets absorbed pretty quickly. It will be my go to night moisturizer during winter time. I will switch to a light gel moisturizer during summer though. I don’t think my skin will tolerate this cream during hot temperatures. I also love that it has no fragrance. nan
