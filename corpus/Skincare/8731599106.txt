I love the face wash. It goes easy on the face, it has fragrance but when you washed out, the smell goes away. It’s very light face washer. if you don’t us lot of makeup daily, this wash can clean perfectly your face, but if you do, consider to clean your face with another makeup remover and use this as second step. For me is perfect, considering buying a new one, because mine is almost finishing. P.S little goes along way. When you clean your face use no more then two pumps. Nice daily face wash
