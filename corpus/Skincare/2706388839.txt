This cleanser could not have arrived at a better time for my spring routine. A small amount lathers well and is easy to apply to my whole face. It was able to remove makeup as step 2, after my cleansing balm. There is a strong floral fragrance reminiscent of my mom’s luxury makeup. But I am willing to overlook the scent because it leaves my face cleansed and soft. Good value considering you don’t need much product! nan
