I received a sample of this product complimentary of Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I honestly haven’t tried many serums and was pleasantly surprised that this one left my skin feel more firm and tighter than normal when I woke up in the morning. The only thing I didn’t love is that it left a sort of oily film on my skin that I was afraid was going to transfer onto my bed sheets! Maybe if I had put it on awhile before going to sleep it would’ve had more time to absorb. nan
