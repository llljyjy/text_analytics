This review is from my wife. This serum is the best I’ve ever used. It took only 3 days to notice dramatic results. My fine lines on my forehead have nearly vanished in just three days! The scent is very  light. It doesn’t make my face feel greasy. It doesn’t irritate my skin either which happens to me with other creams. The pump is wonderful because it dispenses the perfect amount of serum you need per application. Best serum ever!
