I received the Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream by KORRES deluxe sample for free from Influencer in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer didnâ€™t either impress or disappoint me at first. I took a break from it for personal reasons and when I started back using it I tried a different skin care routine to prepare my extra dry skin for it.  I use an exfoliator and skin mask then applied this moisturizer and it made a big difference for me. My skin had a visible healthy glow and the moisturizer lasted until the evening. I now would give this a big thumbs up. I would definitely buy this again if it had a sunscreen in it as I burn fast. Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream by KORRES
