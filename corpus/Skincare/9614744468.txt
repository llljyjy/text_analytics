Don’t cheat on this product!!!!!!!! Although it can be a bit pricey it is so worth it! Not many Niacinamide products have worked well for me so I assumed my skin doesn’t mesh with the ingredient. However, I saw so much talk of this product I decided to purchase a few months ago and I was obsessed! Only after 3 days did I notice that my small stubborn bumps started to dissipate. The fragrance isn’t anything that has bothered my sensitive skin thankfully, and I’ve recommended this to so many of my friends :) Glass skin in a bottle!
