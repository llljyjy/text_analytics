I thought this cream did an amazing job on reducing the appearance of pores on my skin. Thanks so much Influenster for sending me a complimentary gift for testing purposes. It left my skin with a shine-free glow and a slightly dewy look. I also like the fact that it is hydrating as well. Another amazing ingredient that this product has is the Santorini Grape Extract. It helps renew your skin. This product does not have a very strong smell to it. Itâ€™s very light and airy with a hint of grape. Amazing!!
