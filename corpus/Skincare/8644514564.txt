This is hands-down the best facial oil I’ve ever used. I have super oily skin, so I’m always hesitant with oils but this doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy at all; it just leaves me moisturized and glowy. I have rosacea and acne scarring and this completely evens out my skin tone. I’m on my third bottle and will continue to repurchase. nan
