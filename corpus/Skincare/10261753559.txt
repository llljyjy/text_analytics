I am now repurchasing this for the third time. I love this product and use it every night. It lasts a pretty good amount of time, smells lovely and works great. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and nourished. For an even more moisturizing effect I layer few drops of the youth to the people dream oil on top when my skin is feeling extra dry. I have very sensitive skin so it’s hard to find products that work and don’t irritate it, but this is one of my favourite skincare products ever! great as a nightly moisturizer
