I am very disappointed in this product.Packaging is bad. It get’s very messy, but that’s not the worst part for me: I didn’t manage to make this work with any of my skincare/makeup. It peels ! I tried couple of times to not wear makeup, just skincare and this sunscreen and it peeled the same way.I will not be purchasing this product any more, unless it gets reformulated. Bad packaging + it peels
