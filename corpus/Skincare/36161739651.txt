This is a luxurious cream. It has a nice light rose scent that is not too strong. It goes on smooth and is not greasy. You don’t need to use that much which is good because it’s expensive. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I have always been a fan of Lancôme products and this did not disappoint. Luxurious cream
