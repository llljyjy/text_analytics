I was gifted by Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer. I think this was nice but I liked their water bank moisturizer better. The gel was colling on the skin so it would be nice during summer especially if you put it in the fridge. If you need a thicker moisturizer then get the normal water bank moisturizer.
