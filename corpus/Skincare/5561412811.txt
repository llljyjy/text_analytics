I think I’ve found my forever moisturizer! I have combination skin and was previously using drunk elephant protini. I find this moisturizer absorbs much better into my skin and I’m no longer experiencing the dehydrated tight feel to my skin I would have on occasion even though I’m more prone to oiliness. My skin is also somewhat sensitive and so far no breakouts! I’m very happy with this moisturizer. I plan on trying the complexion booster next I hopes it will help with my hyperpigmentation from acne scars. nan
