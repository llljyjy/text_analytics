I have been adding this now to my nightly routine to remove my make up from the day. After having been using it for about a week and a half now, I absolutely love it. Even from the first time I used it, I love it. The scent is very good and it goes on very smoothly on my face. When I rinse it off, my make up literally just melts off and my face is silky smooth afterwards. I get very dry skin in the winter and having used this, my face feels so hydrated for the rest of the day and I donâ€™t notice any more dry spots on my face. I highly recommend this. Must buy!!
