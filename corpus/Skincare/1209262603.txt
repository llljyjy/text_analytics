I received this product for free from Influenster and Community Sixty-Six in exchange for my honest review. I love a good moisturizer and how it makes my skin look. I typically lean more towards thicker creams even in the morning but really enjoyed this one. It’s slightly thicker than other gel moisturizers, I would almost call it a hybrid, but dries quickly. It’s slightly sticky and maintains that feel for a bit after it dries down. I find this to be helpful when applying make up but if that’s not something you like I would avoid this product. The only con is that there is a slight unpleasant smell to it. It’s in scented but smells “product-y”. Definitely wasn’t enough to deter me, but if you’re sensitive to smells I would keep it in mind. nan
