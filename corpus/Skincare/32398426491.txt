Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator. This is complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling..It should be, easy to use, and the effect is visible to the naked eye~This cleansing powder is the most basic and star product of their family.For me, it works better than the grey one, and it’s a bit cheaperI use it once a day, usually in the morningAh, maybe some friends think it will be too exciting as morning clean.I feel a little irritating, add a little more water particles and feel a lot less all of a sudden, it is a slippery non-foaming facial cleanser.Maybe it’s a white fuss, after all, it’s not that dirty after a good night’s sleep in the morning.But I exfoliate and dead skin directly.Get a good night’s sleep, use it once in the morning to feel refreshed.The skin is slippery, and it’s good to apply anything on the face and it bleeds~Persistent use, I feel that the face is really a lot, and the white is also a lot clearerI’m still very effective~ There is no harm in being bold and not exciting~If you have sensitive skin, consider a week. Slowly adjust the frequency.Worth a try~ Great product
