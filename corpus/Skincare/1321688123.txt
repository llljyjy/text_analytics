Retinol Cream did not irritate like others I have tried. Seems to make my skin feel smoother, but after almost finishing the bottle, I haven’t noticed much difference. I would’ve given 4 stars but the packaging really does not work for me, the pump sometimes sticks and not very practical.  Too much plastic, too big a footprint being that it’s only 1oz of product for such huge plastic container. Product is ok, pump is a pain
