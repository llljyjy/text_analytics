I am liking this so far. This cream is very thick but feels a bit lighter when it goes on your skin, it feels very luxurious when applying. It feels a bit heavier than a standard moisturizer and doesn’t fully absorb into your skin so I prefer to use this as just a night cream. My skin is very oily so I don’t like having such a heavy moisturizer in the daytime. Luxurious
