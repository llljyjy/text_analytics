I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for an honest review. What I liked:no scentWhat I didnâ€™t like:noticed no difference with fine linesit was too runny, took too long to dry  stickyapplicator is too big, makes a messOverall- I give this 2 stars. I personally would rather have a cream than a serum for under my eyes. Thank you Influenster and Dior for letting me try this product! nan
