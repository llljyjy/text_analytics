I initially purchased this product when it was TikTok viral over a year ago (impulse buy before it completely sold out at the time) and have been a weekly user since. I had my doubts because I am not a mask user by any means and because many products irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin. This mask visibly removes excess oil (you can see its color change while it dries down) and leaves my skin noticeably softer. Afterward, I just follow up with a thin layer of moisturizer in areas that are prone to dryness on my face, and this locks in the feeling of softness and freshness from the mask. Anytime my skin is feeling dull this is my go to. Noticeable effects, good for sensitive skin
