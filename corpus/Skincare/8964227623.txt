I have been using this sunscreen throughout the year for the last 5 years and it is amazing. The price went up from $21 but it is still worth it. I use it almost everyday even during winter time because it protects your skin from the screens we use all the time. It is lightweight, it moistures the skin and it doesn’t leave a white cast at all. Good for people with acne as well.Clinique can’t never go wrong on good skin care for sensitive skin. It is my go to Sunscreen for years!
