I received a #freeproduct sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from TopBox Circle. The sample was very small and only enough for one application. The serum goes on smooth and has a pleasant scent. It is impossible for me to rate the efficacy of this product on wrinkles based on a single use. For that reason, while I recommend everyone should try the product, I do not know if it actually has an effect on wrinkles. Smooth serum, unsure if it affects wrinkles
