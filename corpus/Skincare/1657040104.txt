I have dry sensitive skin and this balm is a great first step in a two-step cleanse. It removes sunscreen and makeup really well, though it does leave my skin feeling a bit slick afterwards. That’s fine since I follow up with a second cleanser (usually Goop Cloudberry), which removes any residue. I’m happy with this product abs would buy it again. first step in 2-step cleansing
