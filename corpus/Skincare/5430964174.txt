This is the only cream I use now. My skin feels smooth and soft. I used it for 2 weeks taking a before and after photo to see if i could notice a difference in my skin. I can see and feel a difference. It’s perfect for my skin. I use it twice a day. I have used other products that I thought were pretty good but they don’t compare to this. I also use it on the back of my hands. I’m in my 50“s, dry skin and some discoloration. I would recommend this to anyone but anyone over 50 should get this. This is best yet!
