This cream is nice and thick but absorbs into the skin very nicely.  It doesn’t leave it greasy or wet looking either.  I’m in my 40s so my skin likes lots of moisture and this cream is really nice.  It’s creamy and has a light scent.  I have been using it a couple weeks and I do see my skin looking more hydrated and plump looking. Good
