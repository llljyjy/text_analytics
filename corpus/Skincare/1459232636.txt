LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I’m obsessed with resurfacing serums, and this one did NOT disappoint. The texture of my skin has improved greatly. I’m receiving so many compliments on how smooth it looks, and to me, there are not many things you could say that are more flattering. My skin is supple and plump, fewer fine lines and just overall beautiful surface texture. I used this every night and in conjunction with the resurfacing pads 2-3 times a week. Truly the perfect balance of results without overdoing it. My skin still felt hydrated (as long as I used a moisturizer on top, plus in the mornings!), while still showing a difference… something that can be difficult in the world of resurfacing. Will be purchasing and adding to my collection of skincare! Texture? What texture?
