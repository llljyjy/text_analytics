It cosmetics Confidence in a Cream really lives up to its promises. It goes on smoothly, doesnt feel greasy and absorbs quickly. After using it for a month I have seen an improvement in my fine lines and some wrinkles.  My skin looks a little firmer and plumper and it definitely looks more radiant.  It also did a wonderful job smoothing the lines on my neck.  Compared to other brands I have used this is definitely a winner. I will definitely buy this when I run out of the product. nan
