This worked very well for me, after years of gentle cleansers that didn’t really get ALL of my foundation/makeup off. I would always find some color left on cotton pads when I used toner after. This one really gets it ALL, for a much cleaner face. The one knock is that it is slightly drying for me, but just moisturizing after takes care of that. On the whole it’s been good for my skin and I’ll be sticking with this. A very effective cleanser
