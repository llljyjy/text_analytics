Day and Night cream without SPF. While I like the flexibility to use at anytime, I feel like having to buy both to ensure you’re covered from the sun’s UV rays is wasteful. The Hydrating cream is applied the same as the Day cream. I didn’t have to apply a lot to feel the moisturizing effects. Although whenever I did over apply, my face felt suffocating and greasy, so go easy on application. My skin looked smoothed and even overall. nan
