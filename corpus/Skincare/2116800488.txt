A wonderful professional grade product however YOU HAVE TO READ the INSTRUCTIONS. This is the only reason I’m giving a 4 star is because it can potentially damage the skin if you are not careful. Do not use or keep on face more than the recommended time or you will cause chemical burns on your face. Ok, now that that is out of the way. This is an amazing product. For me it’s a nice weekly treatment that I do that makes me feel like all of the dirt and excess is being zapped right out of my pores. After you remove your face just feels brighter and smoother. You definitely want to follow up with an oil. I use Josie maran argon oil and this gets my skin glowing by morning. nan
