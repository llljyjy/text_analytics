I’ve only one of Kosas products before. It was the lash serum so I was very interested to receive Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum. I have to say the smell is horrible. I like the feel of the spray serum and the convenience of the product. Unfortunately, the smell really truthfully makes me dry heave. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this product. I was soooo excited watched the training and couldn’t wait to get the product in the mail. I tried the product several times and I just could not past the smell. I really like the concept of a spray serum. I would still be really interested in trying more products from Kosas. I liked the lash serum alot and thought it worked really well. I’m just really sensitive to fragrances as are alot of people so it’s just super disappointing. Fragrance spray serum
