The product itself is great, but the packaging is SO BAD. Iâ€™m usually tolerant with less than ideal packaging, but this product is almost unusable. I keep it stored in a cool, dark drawer standing upright and it leaks so much. It leaks out of the cap, and explodes everywhere when you open it. I have to rate it 1 star because I would probably not buy it again based on the packaging alone. If they fixed it I would love to purchase again. Poor packaging but great product.
