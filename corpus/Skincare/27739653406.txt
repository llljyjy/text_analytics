After using this product for a few weeks I am in love! I use this as my first step in a double cleanse and my skin feels great. I have used so many cleansing balms and this one does the job for such a good price. My skin does not feel oily afterwards and it removes all of my makeup. I have already purchased a back up! Favourite oil cleanser!
