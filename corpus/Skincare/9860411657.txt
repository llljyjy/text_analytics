I received this #freeproduct from Topbox and I have to say that this is my first time trying this brand and it is absolutely new to me. First of all, I love this glass jar packaging and it surely does give off a luxurious look. I have used this green tea moisturizer for the past 3 weeks twice a day (morning and night time) and I have to say that the texture of this moisturizer is absolutely wonderful. I love that it is very lightweight so it spreads on the face easily and absorbs quickly beneath the skin. As for scent, I am very much thankful that my face doesnâ€™t experience any irritation and I like that this is lightly scented and it dissipates quickly once fully absorbed. Instantly my face feels hydrated, soft and smooth with continued use, I have seen a nice dewy look that I absolutely love. I can see myself purchasing this when I finish off this generous full size sample that I got for free. Hydrating moisturizer
