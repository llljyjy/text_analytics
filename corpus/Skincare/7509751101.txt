Minus 1 star because I donâ€™t love this for my face, salicylic is supposed to make my face LESS oily but this makes it kind of sticky all day. However! It is excellent on the bikini line for clearing up bumps and ingrowns, and the oily texture is actually good for keeping it gentle and not drying out the area. Definitely recommend and love for that particular use. nan
