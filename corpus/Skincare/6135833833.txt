I received a sample of this when I went in store.  For the price, I thought this would be a really good moisturizer. I feel that my vanicream face lotion hydrates my face more than this and I have pretty dry skin... DRY.  I might have to try it with their face oil to see if that helps. It has a nice consistency. It doesn’t have a super tacky or oily residue. It doesn’t really smell like anything.  I feel like if you are prone to oily skin or breakouts, you might want to give this a try. This is considered an anti aging cream, I didnt use this long enough to see if it has anti aging benefits. I do wish it was more hydrating. Reptilian skin
