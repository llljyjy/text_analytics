Despite the reviews, I gave it a shot since it was on sale. I actually quite liked it! It did give my skin a nice glow, even from beneath my foundation. I found it more effective to dab it only slightly on my cheeks and temples. 4 stars only because it dispenses a hefty amount that you donâ€™t necessarily need for application. very nice!
