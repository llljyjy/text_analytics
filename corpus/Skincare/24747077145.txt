At sale price i found it very worth it. Its not a sheet like normal sheet masks, it is like a gel sheet and it feels awesome. It doesnt slide all around on your face like many of the reg sheets and it lays pretty taught too without wrinkles/folds. My skin has been very dull and had an unusual amount of acne lately. It smoothed my skin and made my skin look much happier. My acne i thought may get worse since it isnt a cleansing mask but i washed my face before and rinsed after and my acne is actually better (i dont think the mask made it go away but it definitely didnt make it worse). I dont like paying more than $3-$5 for a single mask so at $3.50 i found it worked really well. Smell is mild/pleasant and not fragrance-y. Feels good + makes skin look good
