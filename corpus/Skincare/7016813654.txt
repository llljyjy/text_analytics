I love how this serum is helped me with my acne.I put it on my pimple and the next morning it was less red and shrinking.Very happy with that.This serum contains two percent salicylic acid and visibly eliminates and prevents ache blemishes. Its lightweight, soothing formula contains niacinamide and vitamin C to reduce the look of post-breakout discoloration and zinc, which helps minimize excess oil. nan
