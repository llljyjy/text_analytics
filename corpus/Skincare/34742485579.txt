Absolutely in love with this product, my first ever from the Korres brand. I appreciate that. Is ecofriendly and cruelty free. :) The ingredients are also similar to my other skin care, so overall my sensitive skin appreciated this formula. I tend to have dryness and allergic reactions, but this formula even after a week of using it is still gentle on my skin and does not irritate my pores. <3 would suggest Gifted by Influenster
