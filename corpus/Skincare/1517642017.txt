I received this product as part of an advanced launch and I have to say it is really nice. It is super lightweight and has a great smell. I didnâ€™t notice any pore blurring effects on my skin but I found that -maybe because it looks like makeup- I was always tempted to put on less product than my usual moisturizing sunscreen. I do wish it felt a little more moisturizing- my skin needs that. But this would be a DREAM daily SPF for folks with oily skin or who run from sunscreen out of fear of clogged pores. Nice job again, Saint Jane team! Lightweight and Smells Great
