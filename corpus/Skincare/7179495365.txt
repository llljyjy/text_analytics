Love this product. I use it at night time usually and my lips feels so soft and healthy in the morning.  I do suffer from cold blisters in winter time and this is the only balm that keeps them under control. it really helps with the healing process.  also it last a long time. the smell is very nice tooo, not strong but pleasant. great for healthy looking lips
