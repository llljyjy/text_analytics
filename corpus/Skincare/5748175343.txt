I was recommended this by a Sephora employee and was told to use it as a moisturizer, but it just isn’t hydrating enough for my skin so I do have to follow up with a cream. A few drops will cover my whole face, and I’ve definitely seen improvements in my skin after using it for a few weeks. It’s got a small amount of shimmer that adds a bit of glow to your face. Overall, it’s pretty nice, but because I still have to use a cream after I don’t know if it’s a must-have to incorporate into your skincare routine. Not a 100% replacement for a cream moisturizer...
