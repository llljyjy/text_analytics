Never got to see if it worked because the second time I went to use it the nozzle was unconnected from the tube, I wasted half of it trying to reconnect the tube! Very frustrating! Product was too thick to use out of bottle. Iâ€™ve used many serums in similar packaging and never had a problem getting to all of the precious serum. Bottle concept is poor. Waste of my money.
