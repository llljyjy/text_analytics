I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I’m a big fan of skincare and was very excited to try out a sunscreen with skincare benefits. The formula is an oil free mineral sunscreen with hyaluronic acid that blends into the skin quickly without leaving your skin looking greasy and helps your skin stay hydrated. The first real test for me was a day at a park where it was almost 100° and full sun. I wore this sunscreen for around 3 hours and did not burn at all. I’ve also swam with this sunscreen (trying not to get my face wet) and did not burn even after 2 hours in the pool. The formula is more watery and you have to work it into the skin quickly before it absorbs. At first it does look like it has a white casts, but blending it in more will sheer it out to clear. It is great to use under makeup as a primer since it feels silky smooth like a silicone primer, so I have used it every day whether or not I am going outside. I love that it is a broad spectrum SPF 42 and water resistant for up to 40 minutes. My only complaint is that the price may be more expensive to most people for 1 fl oz. However, I love that you can put this small bottle in your purse or bag for travel. I believe that it would a great addition to a skincare collection for daily use or for vacations. 4/5! #complimentary #shiseidosuncare @Influenster @shiseido Small Package with Big Results!
