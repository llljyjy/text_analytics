I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I was definitely excited to try this sunscreen. It overall an good sunscreen but It has a light color tint to it that’s I’m not an fan of because it gave me an white tone to my face. It absorbed quickly and easily without leaving a oily or greasy feeling. I would recommend this product to individual who like a light tint in their sunscreen. @SHISEIDO #SHISEIDOSUNCARE Good sunscreen
