I received this free to review from Influenster. I like it. It seems like it is not full of chemicals. It has no color and no scent. It doesn’t irritate the delicate skin around the eyes. I just don’t know if I saw a huge difference with my eyes. I will continue using it and perhaps over a longer period of time, I will see more results. Nice eye cream
