✨LOVE this product. I have sensitive skin so was nervous it would be irritating, but I had no problem. Slight tingling at first doesn’t last. I thought these would be drying, but they moisturize my skin and my skin feels hydrated yet so clean after using. ✨ I’ve seen an improvement in my texture of my skin. My tone is more even. My pores are smaller. My skin is clearer. I honestly cannot believe the improvement I’ve seen. ✨ I would recommend this product to anyone , and it is now a staple in my evening skincare routine. new staple in my routine
