This is so great! I love that it has more retinol than a lot of other products, and that the retinol is encapsulated so it works for my sensitive skin. I also love the stick formula; if you’ve washed your face, you can literally put this on in bed without a mirror. And it makes you a little shiny, but nothing too obvious, and it leaves no residue. Such a great product! It works so well for fine lines and “tech neck“! So easy to use and so effective!
