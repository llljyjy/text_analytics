Not sure what the hype is with this. I got a sample with my Sephora points. Sure, it takes makeup off but it leaves a greasy residue that anyone with normal to oily skin will hate. I couldn’t get that residue off with normal face wash either, I had to take Dove bae soap to my face to remove it. It smells nice, that’s about it. nan
