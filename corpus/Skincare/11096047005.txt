I have been using this mist for over 2 years now and I cannot go without it even for a day. I have combination skin and this mist hydrates my skin enough to go without an additional layer of moisturizer. Gives a rosy glow to face and leaves the skin soft and supple.The only drawback of the product is tge spray/nozzle. Does not work sometimes and leaves liquid dripping from the nozzle. cannot live without this product!
