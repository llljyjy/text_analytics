I loved this moisturizer more when it was the old formula.  There is a noticeable difference in the scent as well as how it moisturizes the skin.  I still had some of the old formula( for comparison) and I just wish that they kept this old formulation and they couldâ€™ve made a fragrance free version too.This moisturizer was a game changer when it came out.  Now I find myself looking for a new moisturizer after years of using this one. Old formula was better
