I hate that I love this serum because it’s so pricey ! I received a small deluxe glass jar sample size for free in exchange for an honest review and I’m in love. Even the glass bottle felt luxurious an amazing. The product itself is a thicker serum, but it still spreads super easily and absorbs just as easily. It makes the skin fee velvety soft. Love the product … hate the price
