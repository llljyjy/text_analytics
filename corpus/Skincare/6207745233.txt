Sooo wonderful. I have so many lip glosses and oils in my pursuit of the perfect one and this one is in the top tier. It’s non-sticky while not being super slick that it feels like it’ll come off. The color is also gorgeous, giving your lips a touch of color that looks fresh. It is very heavily scented like candy apple yet does not have an overly sweet taste when it transfers. My only critique is I wish it was tiny more shiny/glossy. Gorgeous
