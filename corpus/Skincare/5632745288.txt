The grapefruit wipes exfoliating wipes have been my favorite....forever. Well they just changed the formula or whatever and it’s totally different. The cloth itself is different and just doesn’t work the same? It’s heartbreaking because I loved them SO MUCH. These still get the job done I guess, I’ve only used them a few days. But why Sephora, why? You had the most perfect product. This new cloth isn’t even as damp. Ugh. BRING BACK THE OLD STYLE. OH NO - Sephora changed the Grapefruit Wipes!
