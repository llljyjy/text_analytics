I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. This spot cream is really nice. I like that’s is also hydrating and you can put it on top of your makeup too. It’s not the best acne spot treatment for the price, but it is effective. I like using it after taking off a pimple patch to prevent redness, scarring, and further breakouts. Overall nice product. nan
