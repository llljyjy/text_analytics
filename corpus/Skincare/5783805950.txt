I bought this on a whim during the sale as it was so dead cheap. My skin is pretty resilient, so I have actually been using this product everyday as a face wash instead of a mask. I put it on in the shower and then wash it off after I’m done showering. It’s kept my skin in check and has not irritated it at all since it’s so gentle! For the price point, I honestly recommend grabbing one and trying it! I’m gonna buy a few more since it says it’s a limited product offering…not sure for how long though! nan
