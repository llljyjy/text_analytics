I got this as a free sample to test out & all I got to say was this product amazed me. Normally my skin can get irritated quickly to products I’ve never used before but surprisingly this product didn’t irritate it what so ever. It felt so refreshing to put on after washing my face with my favorite face wash. The scent wasn’t to strong & it definitely made my skin feel very moisturized. Definitely Worth Checking Out
