Love this! First time trying self tanner at home and I used it with a glove I bought from Amazon - super easy application and not intimidating to put on alone.  I didn’t have the “Prep It“ product but it went on perfectly fine.  I have a decently pale complexion and it looked totally natural - worked well on face too (thank god, ha!). Natural Glow
