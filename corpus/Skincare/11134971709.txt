I love the way this cleanser works and makes my skin feel. That being said, after about two weeks, a black substance starts to form inside the lid. This has happened in both bottles Iâ€™ve had - I bought a second hoping the first time was a fluke. I have 16 other products in my shower and none of them do this and my shower is cleaned thoroughly every week by a housekeeper. I will not be purchasing this product again. Black Mold?
