I’ve been using this product for about a month now every morning and I enjoy the morning glow it provides my skin. A little goes a long way and I’m just getting to the end of my first bottle now. I will have to say, the design of the bottle/pump is horrible. There’s still a good amount of product left in the bottle, but the pump refuses to pump any of it out. Instead I’ve had to use the pump as a stir stick to try to use any of the remaining amount (see photo to show there’s still a good amount left in my bottle). I would also advise that if you’re going to use this product, please remember to use sunscreen as well to optimize the benefits! Good product, terrible packaging
