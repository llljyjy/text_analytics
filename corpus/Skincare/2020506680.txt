This product worked great for my dark circles! I saw a difference almost instantly. The applicator also makes it so easy to apply. I have super sensitive skin under my eyes and with other eye creams I usually get irritated or feel a stinging but this I had no irritation at all! My only negative comment is that it didnâ€™t depuff as much as I would have liked it to. bye bye dark circles
