I was a little skeptical when buying this product because it’s on the cheaper side but I absolutely love it. It’s non scented, gentle and makes your face feel so clean. I highly recommend and I’m definitely going to buy more when I run out. Just a little note though don’t squeeze the bottle too hard because it’s easy to squeeze too much product. Non-scented, gentle and amazing!
