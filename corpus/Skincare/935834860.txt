I received a free sample from Influenster to test. I have always been a fan of Korres products and was very excited to be asked to test. This cream is true to its lightweight description. This cream does not have an SPF and I initially used it as a night cream. Itâ€™s very hydrating and had a matte finish.  I substituted this as my primer and it provided a more breathable feel. nan
