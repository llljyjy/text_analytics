This product is amazing, I’ve been using it for the past few weeks right after removing my make up and I’m in love. When combined with water it produces a soft foam. The fragrance smells so good, it’s not overpowering and it leaves the skin with a nice scent. My skin is a combination of oily and dry and I feel that this products helps it clean and balance the hydration. I would definitely buy it again. One of the best cleansers I've used
