I love this stuff. It is so easy to put on. You just mix the two serums together, then apply around the eye area. It spreads so well, and is easy to get an even amount all the way around. I have been going as low as my cheekbone to ensure I really get all of my under eye dark circles. I noticed after just a couple days of using that my skin felt firmer, and less dry. Amazing product
