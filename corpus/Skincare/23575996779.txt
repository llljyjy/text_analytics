I’ve use this product for a couple of weeks now the pros and cons are:  PROS: -it is vey hydrating/ moisturizing.-the hydrating of it lasts a long time -saw a little bit of plumpness in my under eyes.-doesn’t really have a fragrance-it’s CLEANNN CONS: - every time I apply this under my eyes, my eyes starts to water non-stop. -I didn’t really see much difference with the under eye fine lines or wrinkles Hydrating
