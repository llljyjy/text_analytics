I really liked this moisturizer! It works well with other products such as my eye cream and all my facial foundation products. I noticed a difference in my skin texture and the smoothness of my skin in about 3 days. I used about a dime size amount to apply to my whole face. I will definitely be repurchasing in the future. A moisturizer that works with your make up!
