Worst mask ever. Skin felt tight and dry. Burning sensation. Morning woke up with full skin. I even added face oil and moisturizer after the mask coz of how dry and irritating it was and in the morning still looks dry and dull. I wonâ€™t recommend it for sensitive skin. Too expensive. Stick to SK II, dr Jart ceremidin, or Tatcha. nan
