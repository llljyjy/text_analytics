I tested this product for a few weeks and I really liked it. I’ve been applying during my morning skincare routine. Shiseido is a great brand and this moisturizer meet my expectations. It have SPF 20 which I love.. besides I still apply my normal sunscreen, it is nice to have extra protection. The scent it is a little strong, burning like the smell of it.   I didn’t notice any improvement in my fine lines, but I did notice improvements on the aspect of my skin, it is very soft and shining, and it help me in the cold winter. This product have ginseng root extract that energizes skin and it have Hyaluronic acid too that strengthens the moisture barrier on the skin. Good moisturizer
