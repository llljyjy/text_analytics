I’ve been using this product along side with the a-gloei retinol oil and the TLC framboos glycolic night serum before bed, and I’ve noticed such a difference! My skin tends to be sensitive to products, since in my youth, I was never one to use face products, not even lotion because my skin absolutely HATED products. I use it every night before bed, and I’ve noticed such a major difference in my skin. My skin seems healthy and hydrated. I have had a pimple breakout on my chin (I believe it’s caused from stress), but it wasn’t cause for concern since it was only one. I’m so sad I only received a tiny sample of this product, but I’m excited to purchase the full size soon! amazing!
