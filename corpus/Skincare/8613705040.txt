This is a nice eye cream, great for everyday use. I could see this working best for normal or oily skin as it dries done to almost nothing, provides light moisturizer. If you have dry skin I definitely would pick a more substantial moisturizer for under your eyes. The package is ok, I wish it wasnâ€™t in a pot form. I received this product for free from Influenster and brand in exchange for my honest review. Nice for everyday
