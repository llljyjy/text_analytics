I received a deluxe sample of this and am pretty disappointed in this product. The texture isn’t bad.. smooth application but gets a little greasy. But the emulsion has an iridescent shimmer and a very, very pungent essential oil scent. (Heavy on the Lavender.) It’s very strong and off putting. I would not purchase this again. Iridescent shimmer & strong essential oil scent..
