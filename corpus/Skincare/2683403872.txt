This is really great for those pesky pimples that pop up out of nowhere since once in a while I get one that pops up on my forehead and cannot explain why. My hyperpigmentation is also very bad so it’s nice to have a product like this on hand that will help to get rid of my blemishes before they turn into any dark spots. I recommend pairing it with their aloe moisturizer since it can of course be drying to your skin. Redness isn’t a much of an issue so I can’t attest to that feature but it definitely helps to clear up pimples pretty quick! Works Great
