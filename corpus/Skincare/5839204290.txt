This exfoliant is very gentle yet effective. I am closing in on forty and have acne prone skin that is combination oily and dry in places. This last a long time and a small amount goes a long way for my entire face and neck. It rinses well and my face feels so soft and less congested.  Iâ€™m just a week my face has started to clear and is much smoother. This was gifted by Dermalogical sampling. nan
