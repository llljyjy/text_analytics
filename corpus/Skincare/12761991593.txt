I have VERY reactive skin and even Vit C and peptides can irritate it. My derm told me I really need to start using retinol but to start slowly. Knowing that I tend to tolerate YTTP products, I started slow with this. After two weeks gradually using it, I am using every night and it’s amazing!!!! ZERO sting and and minimal dryness (I already have dry skin and only notice it a little on my nose). My skin tone is much more even and pores smaller. Skin is the smoothest it’s been in my life, even better than AHAs. I’m so delighted I can finally use Retinol, the most powerful I can get OTC at that! No stinging!!!!
