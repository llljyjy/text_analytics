I have high hopes for this mask. I love how it feels and the consistency. However, it’s worth noting that my skin purging really bad right now. Atleast I hope that’s what it is and it will clear up soon. If not, then this product has caused the worst breakout I’ve had since middle school. Fingers crossed! Purge City
