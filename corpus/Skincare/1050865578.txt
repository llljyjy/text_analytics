I love how light weight this eye cream is, and easily absorbs into my skin. It’s not too heavy and does not give me the milia bumps under my eyes like many other eye creams do. I definitely notice my under eyes being more hydrated, and my make up sits nicely over it without any pilling. My dark circles are slightly less noticeable, but not drastically, and I honestly expected more of a difference. Overall it’s a great light weight eye cream that keeps your under eyes hydrated all day! Great hydrating eye cream!
