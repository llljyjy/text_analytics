I’m 47 years old and my skin has become dry and damaged over the years. I’ve gone through a ridiculous amount of facial cleansers and Tatcha is the only one that actually makes my skin moist and glowy. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it delivers so it’s worth it. This is one of the few products I am completely dedicated to. The only moisturizing cleanser that does its job.
