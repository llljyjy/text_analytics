I’ve been looking for a good retinol for a while. I found some of them a little too expensive even though this one is $72. It is cheaper than some of the other ones that performer I have use this for about a few weeks and didn’t notice peeling in the first few weeks I would say follow the instructions of using every other day when you first start using to prevent skin irritation, I was very happy with the results of using it after a few weeks with a reduction of some of my fine lines and just a nice clear looking face will definitely add this into my regular night routine Good add to routine
