I absolutely loved this eye cream. It’s super moisturizing and immediately made my under eye area lool a lot less crepey. It also dried down to a nice tacky finish which worked perfectly under my day time makeup. What I liked most about this eye cream though was the consistency. It’s almost like a creamy gel and it really does sink in and plump up the fine lines. Highly recommend. Holy Grail!
