Great experience using these masks for the first time. I struggle with dehydration and have somewhat sensitive skin but these masks are perfect and gentle, no reactions so far. I used them every few weeks. Once was particularly helpful after a sunburn, cooled my face right down, like drinking a glass of water to rehydrate my face! Worth the money, use every few weeks
