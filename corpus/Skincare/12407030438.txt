I am not loving Kiehl’s dark spot corrector serum nor am I hating it. The serum smells like aloe vera and the consistency is not too thick but not too runny, either. It made my face feel extremely sticky and tight, so I started doing just spot treatments. I am a child of the 80’s and spent my childhood in the sun, without sunscreen. Unfortunately, I have sun damage and the serum did seem to lighten some of my sun spots. I did not have any adverse effects, such as redness or peeling from the serum. nan
