I really wanted to like this, but it didnâ€™t work for me. It has a lovely rose scent, but it is super sticky. I was hoping to use this as a refresh throughout the day or to add moisture to my dry skin before applying foundation, but it felt so tacky once sprayed on. It made my skin sticky and did not work well under foundation. I then tried using it at night, but still a no-go. I gave it an extra star for the nice scent at least. nan
