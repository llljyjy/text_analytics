Best cleanser by far! I’m still struggling with my adult acne. I’m approaching 30 very soon ha! I’ve tried quit a bit. This isn’t what I use for makeup removal per say. But for skincare and the health of my skin and it’s a clean product & a GREAT ONE!! There’s nothing disturbing about the smell, I can’t believe what people are saying about the scent. I have two other Tula Products I’m planning on buying after I finish my travel best sellers set. The Glycolic Toner & Sugar Scrub Are Amazing! Best Cleanser for Oily Acne Prone skin
