The product absorbed quickly and I like that there is no strong fragrance. It’s definitely a lighter texture, but isn’t too thick or greasy. I would have preferred a heavier texture for the colder months, but it’s a neutral moisturizer to wear all year. I like how I can wear it under make up primer or above serums.  It is not greasy and my skin feels hydrated without it making my skin feel heavy with product. nan
