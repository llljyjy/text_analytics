The Ordinary does it again! I’m loving this Niacinamide powder! Such an easy way to incorporate it into my all-over skin and body care. I mix this in with my body butters and creams and it’s given me this all over glow that is absolutely beautiful. Mixing this powder with retinol makes you look like you got your 8hrs, drank all your water, and reapply sunscreen every 80 minutes. Highly recommend that mix! The only thing I wish they’d improve on is how we actually dispense the product as well as how accurate the measurements are. You Just Can’t Beat It!
