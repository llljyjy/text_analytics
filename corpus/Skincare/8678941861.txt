Amazing cleansing balm. I used their original Green Clean version previously but stopped using it because it caused a reaction with my sensitive skin because of the heavy fragrance. This has no scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. Removed makeup well, better compared to the Glow Recipe cleansing balm or the Clinique. HOLY GRAIL FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
