I receive a 7 day sample of Clarins @clarinscanada Double Serum from @thisisbutterly in return for my honest review of the product. The product arrived in 7 individual cards which you snap in half to mix the two products, which make up Clarins hydric and lipdic system. Other notable ingredients in the product are Curcuma and Turmeric. Turmeric is often used to decrease inflammation, so I was intrigued with the product immediately. One of my favorite skin products are serums, so I was excited to try this product. It arrived at the perfect time as the weather has turned cold  and my skin is beginning to dry out. I used Clarins Double Serum at night and was happy that it wasnâ€™t too greasy, as often I use products at night and they get all over my pillowcase. This product did not. It seemed to absorb almost immediately. After using Clarins Double Serum for 7 consecutive days I did notice my skin seemed smoother and more hydrated. I will definitely be buying the full bottle to see if I continue to receive added benefits from using it for a longer period of time. I recommend anyone who needs a little extra hydration to in incorporate Clarins Double Serum into their routine. Unique Serume
