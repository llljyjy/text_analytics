I really liked the idea of this product! It has a great sheer color and doesn’t sting my eyes. However, once the product dries down, the pigment settles into any fines lines that I have and will very easily pill up when touched. I think I’ll use up the bottle I have, but I just can’t justify buying another. Especially since it’s hard to layer anything (like concealer) on top of this product. Not bad! But not my favorite…
