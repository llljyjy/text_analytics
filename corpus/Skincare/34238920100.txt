I received this Caudalie Premier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer complimentary from Top Box Circle. I use it after toner in the morning and after toner and essence at night. I would say it is a wonderful cream. Itâ€™s a yogurt-like cream, smooth, moisturizing and not too rich or greasy. No strong scent, which looks very natural. I can feel my skin softer and healthier especially when I wake up in the morning. In addition, the detachable refill design is also very good. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Wonderful Cream
