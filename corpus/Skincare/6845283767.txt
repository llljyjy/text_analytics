I received this product for free as a sample to test and overall it is okay. I Have not noticed too much of a difference in my skin. The product says to use twice a day everyday, but I am nervous it might be too strong so I have only been using it on my left cheek where I have problem area. I am going to continue to use it to see if I notice a difference, but so far I don’t see really anything happening. It is a big bottle so it should last a good amount of time if you use it twice a day. It’s okay
