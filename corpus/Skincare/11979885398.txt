this cream is particularly excellent if you have oily or sensitive skin. its lack of fragrance and blendable formula has allowed my skin to stay hydrated without being too shiny or oily, which is great. even though it is complimentary from innisfree, it is now an essential hydrating formula in my routine. nan
