Got this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. Everything about this product is great from the sleek glass bottle, to the easy applicator, refreshing scent which is not overpowering, and of course the hydrating and non-sticky texture of the actual essence. I’ve been using this twice a day for a week and I already feel my skin feel softer, it also works well as a base product before my regular skin care routine and doesn’t make my skin extra dry or oily. Will definitely be purchasing this again! Refreshing & hydrating product!
