I’m not someone that believes the more expensive the skincare the better it is. I’ve tried La Mer, meh, and an assortment of higher end brands but I’ve found the most luck with Skinceuticals, SkinMedica, Jan Marini, etc. i am a major skin care aficionado and regularly get facials and have done two rounds of IPL treatments over the past five years. In other words, I put a lot of time, effort and money into doing the best I can for my skin. I read about how Augustinus Bader actually is scientifically-based/proven, and not all about packaging and hype, so I gave it a try. I never spend this much on one product. Well, it’s great. My skin has never looked this good. My texture looks better, my pores look better and I have a beautiful, natural glow. I am blown away. I’ve been using it nightly for two months and would say it’s been the last two or three weeks that I’ve noticed the shift. An expensive habit but wow, that’s all I can say. I really wish I didn't like this but I love it
