Skin type: dry, sensitive, hormonal acne.This product is by far the best overnight cream I have ever used (and I have tried a LOT - farmacy honey cream, kiehls, biossance, drmtlgy peptide cream,drunk elephant, etc).  the texture is unlike any cream i have ever used - itâ€™s beautiful.  In my opinion, this cream is definitely worth the bit spendy price tag.  Also to note, this cream is fragrance free. Just buy it... the best. Truly the best.
