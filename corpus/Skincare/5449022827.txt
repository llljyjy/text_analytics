This is probably the first face mask in my entire life that doesnâ€™t get rid of blackheads. Like, at all. Not even a little bit. I was surprised to see my skin exactly the same as it was before. I was in shock actually lol. I was expecting so much more from this product with the high ratings. It does feels nice on the skin, not overly drying or anything like that. But seriously bummed. Especially for a clay mask. Clay masks are IT for blackheads usually... Will not be repurchasing. Not for blackheads
