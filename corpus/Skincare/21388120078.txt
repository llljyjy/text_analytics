Giving this 2 stars because there is no white cast but that’s about the only good things I can say about this product. It’s heavily fragranced (I can smell it pretty much all day), it pills whether I wear make up or not and if it gets anywhere near your mouth you’ll be tasting that fragrance all day, and most certainly don’t get it in your eyes. Definitely not something I would reapply. I’ll be returning for my usual PTR water drench sunscreen I just thought this could save me a few bucks, unfortunately it’s just not it. pills, smelly, just no thanks.
