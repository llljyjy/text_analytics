I have tried almost every eye cream on the market and the sales lady told me this one performed miracles. I had high hopes for this, and truly gave it a good shot. It did absolutely nothing for my eyes, nothing. Iâ€™m so disappointed. I used it under my eye creams, I tried it without the eye creams, both day and night, nothing worked. $69 for nothing. I am so disappointed. It did nothing, save your money.
