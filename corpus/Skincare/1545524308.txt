When you charge $60 for 1.7 ounces of sunscreen, you better make sure the experience matches the price.   The sun screen in itself feels like a quality sunscreen but that is all negated by the peeling of the bottle that others are seeing.   Itâ€™s really bad .  Now if this were  $30  , I would have overlooked that but sheesh,  $60 for 1.7 is a lot for a pure skin care product, much less for just a sunscreen. Not a luxe product
