The first day I applied this product was at night time. In the morning my skin felt really soft and not very many bumps. It smells like charcoal which is interesting but I like it! When I first started using the product it was pilling up on me so I used less after that and it didn’t do that anymore-so don’t overdue it! It’s soaks into the skin rather quickly and it’s not SUPER moisturizing. Some days I felt like I needed a little extra moisture so I added another product in dry areas as needed. Overall I do like this product and think it does keep blemishes at bay! Quick results!
