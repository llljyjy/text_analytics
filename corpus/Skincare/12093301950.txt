Can’t say enough good about this stuff. As someone who struggles with acne, it’s hard to find products that won’t break me out. I use this twice a week, and the glycolic acid toner twice a week. Between the two it keeps my skin dewy, clear, and soft. It helps to chemically exfoliate any dead skin off, and even removed any small remaining acne spots. For the price this product is amazing, and super gentle on my sensitive acne prone skin. I’d recommend anyone with sensitive skin to use once a week, and work up to 2-3 times a week. Wouldn’t recommend for daily use, As over exfoliating is never great. But used a few times a week, it keeps my skin like glass Skin like glass, don’t sleep on this stuff
