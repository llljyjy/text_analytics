I bought this for my 50 year old mom as part of a Christmas gift last year and ever since her skin has improved so much! She recently updated her ID and she looks even younger in the picture than she did in the one she had from 10 years ago. She even repurchased it after the one I bought her ran out despite the price because it’s so worth the splurge. Her face looks more hydrated, brighter, and youthful! She’s a big fan of J-LO now thanks to this cream lol nan
