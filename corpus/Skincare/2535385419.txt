Have really been enjoying this moisturizer so far! I live in Utah where it’s quite dry and there’s also a lot of air pollution so your skin can really take a beating here. This cream has been great at helping with my moisture levels, over all tone, and feel of my skin. It’s thicker in consistency, but melts right into the skin. Also creates a lovely base for my makeup as well. More-sturizer is really 10 out of 10
