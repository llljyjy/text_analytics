I was actually surprised by the texture of this product. I was expecting like an actual peel but it’s not that at all. Make sure to do this over your sink because you’ll get bits of it everywhere. I personally have combination skin and I found this amazing but only on certain parts of my face. I found that the cheek/around the lip area it just dried me out and felt warm for an hour after the rinse. However, for my chin/nose/forehead... this thing is actually amazing. Normally when I run my fingers over my chin area I can feel the raised bumps of pores but after using this only twice I noticed clearer and soft skin! The price tag is a little high in my opinion but if you only use it on target areas like I plan on doing this could probably last you awhile and bonus it works! nan
