Ok so, I have been using this product for over 2 weeks and there’s quite a few things I love. First, the texture is so light and it’s so easy to apply. Second, I don’t find the scent to be too strong, (it’s like a muted down “sunscreen” scent) and third it does leave my skin feeling nice and hydrated. However, I wish the spf was a bit higher than just 20. Also, it is hydrating indeed for my dry skin, but I live in a humid climate, and I’m not too sure if it would be hydrating enough if I was somewhere a bit more dry. nan
