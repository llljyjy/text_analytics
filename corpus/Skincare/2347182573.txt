I received this free to test. At first I liked it. It didnâ€™t have a strong smell, is was very emollient, a little went a long way, and it has important ingredients!  After a few weeks of use only in the mornings, I noticed a few pimples! I spent a month narrowing down the problem.  I am very middle-age, breaking out is ridiculous.  Nonetheless, while I loved the feeling of this magic cream on my face, it did nothing noticeable to my many wrinkles, fancy massage and all!  As well as it caused me to breakout.  I am of the opinion that this is best for someone in their 30s with dry skin. Not great for my older skin.
