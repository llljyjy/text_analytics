Great but not a depuffer.  I absolutely love how hydrating this product is without being messy.  It leaves a dewy finish and is an easy application.  I found it did not do well for the look of tired eyes.  It is not a depuffer and does not help with bags.  If you are looking for a depuffer or a retinol-like product, this is not for you.  If you are looking for an easy moisturizer for your eyes and a dewy finish that won’t cause raccoon eyes, this is for you.  4/5 for the fact it is a balm that doesn’t depuff like balms should.
