This product would be fine if it was in the 30-50 dollar price range. Iâ€™ve been using this product for a month consistently and saw little to no change in my discoloration or dark spots. Before that, I used to use Faded by Topicals and it really helped my discoloration and even tone. This product will do the same at a slower and more expensive rate. Pricier (and weaker) version of Faded by Topicals
