I admit, I don’t use moisturizer as often as I should. I have been using this for a month and love the way it makes my skin look and feel. Normally I’m apprehensive about using a thicker texture moisturizer due to my sensitive skin, but this didn’t give me any negative side effects. I didn’t break out or have any skin irritation after application. Would recommend! nan
