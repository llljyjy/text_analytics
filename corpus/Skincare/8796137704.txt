I recently discovered this product bc of one my fav tiktok influencers. I’ve been dealing with cystic acne for a while and this product has done wonders. I know some people may think we’re exaggerating when we say you can see a difference within one day of using but IT’s TRUE! I bought the small bottle at first to try it out, and it literally did wonders within the first week, even my mother started using it. I was out of it for like 3 days but i finally bought another bottle and this time the big one so I won’t be caught off guard. And my skin was looking amazing when I used it again. I’ve tried a million products for acne for years and this is definitely a gem. It is pricey, paid 85 with tax but worth the money. This product has brought my faith back to clear skin. I actually like the smell, it’s not bad to me. It’s worth it
