I like that this sunscreen has no white cast at all, it’s super transparent, but if you have oily skin, I’d avoid this like the plague. It’s quite greasy and would make my nose kind of itchy like something was crawling on it. I had to switch to a new one, but I’ll continue to use this on my body until it’s used up. I’ll say it adds a nice glow to the skin on my body but it’s never going near my face again. Think twice for oily skin.
