I LOVE this product!Several months ago, I decided to get off Birth Control pills. Anyone who’s been on BC knows how flawless it makes your skin while using it. A few months into being off it, I started getting breakouts (hormonal). I needed a gentle exfoliator (which was missing from my routine) that wouldn’t irritate or further dry out my very dry skin. After tons of research (I’m new to face acids) this seemed to be the best for me to try due to its gentle properties. It’s been about a month since I started using this, and it’s AMAZING! It gently exfoliates, and when I use it, I don’t experience any type of irritation or redness. If I have acne bumps when I use this, it goes away the next day! It literally zaps away my acne!I will say though that after my initial use, my skin felt uncomfortably tight. My skin was not used to it yet. After a couple weeks, it got better. With that being said, start off slow! I started using it once a week (which is hard to do once you see how well it works!) but stick to it until your skin can handle a higher frequency. I found that using it every 3 days (at night before bed) works the best for me. It catches any new acne formations, and it’s the most exfoliation my skin can handle without drying out. Also note that you may experience some acne purging during the first month or two using this product. It is normal for that to happen when using AHAs or any product that induces high skin cell turnover. I experienced it, and it is scary. But it will go away. Make sure to moisturize well and use sunscreen!Stay patient and consistent, and you will have clear and even skin! Great for dry skin or if you’re new to face acids!
