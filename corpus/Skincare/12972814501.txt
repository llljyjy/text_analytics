Based on the sample I received, the double serum made my skin smooth and moisturized. I have oily skin. The problem was that the idea of the sample packet wasnâ€™t smart.

The sample product was not enough to see results of fine lines going away. It gave me a breakout but that may have been because of trying new products. Soft and moisturizing
