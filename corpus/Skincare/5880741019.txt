My sensitive skin didn’t like this product one bit. I used it a couple times after receiving, and both times I’ve noticed more breakouts than before and the bumps I already had, increased in size. I guess this was to be expected, because even though I applied it as directed (as a spot treatment), the second I applied it to the spots. There was immediate redness, and irritation. Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin. nan
