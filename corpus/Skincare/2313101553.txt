It is one of the best sunscreens that I can find at Sephora. It is reasonably priced and not too oily. Its unpleasant smell is not too strong and will disappear shortly. I usually use it in autumn/winter. Unlike many other brands, its price does not have a steep jump, I have used Shiseido, Dr. Jart, Belief, La Mer, and Supergoop so far. I am sharing my own experience for your reference. Dr. Jart is better priced on other platforms if you are OK with imported products. Belief is a Korean brand where you can occasionally get two for the price of one on their website. I am not a big fan of Belief because it is moisturizing and I prefer using my own moisturizer. I am also not sure if a two-in-one product is less effective in terms of sun protection. La Mer is pricier and I donâ€™t see anything special. As for Shiseido, I have never used the white bottle, but the blue bottle is way too oily. Supergoop tends to make my skin oilier. One of the Best at Sephora
