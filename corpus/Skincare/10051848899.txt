I received a sample of this product for free from Estée Lauder and Influenster in return to my honest opinion. I’ve been using it almost every day for about a month. Although it was a sample size, I’ve been able to use it morning and nights since a little bit goes a long way with this product. I have a combination skin more towards the oily in my nose/forehead area. This cream is very moisturising and I was concerned at first that it may cause me to get pimples, but it didn’t. I noticed that some of my expression marks that tend to be a little noticeable by the end of the day, were not. When applying, it makes my skin feel smooth and easy to apply makeup afterwards. I would highly recommend this product. Great product
