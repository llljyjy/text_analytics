This sunscreen is absolutely amazing! I have sensitive skin and eyes, and am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen to reduce irritation. The necessaire mineral sunscreen was irritation free, glided on beautifully (not too watery, not too thick), and didnâ€™t feel sticky on my skin throughout the day. I used it on my face and body. Love the fact that it was pure 20% zinc oxide which is the correct amount needed in a mineral sunscreen to actually protect you. As with any mineral sunscreen just make sure to rub it in well to avoid a white cast. After that, it blends into the skin seamlessly. sunscreen that feels and looks great
