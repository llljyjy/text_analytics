I received the wrinkle correcting serum via Top Box for a review #freeproduct. I used the sample in the morning for 5-6 days. I liked the absence of fragrance and the application of the serum is very pleasant. It seems to be a good serum, but maybe not the best? I didnâ€™t see any change in my skin firmness, like other serums. Maybe not the best serum?
