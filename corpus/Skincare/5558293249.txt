Very thick cleanser. Barely any scent. Very moisturizing. Cleans face well. Do not like that a tiny bit gets in my eyes and makes my vision cloudy. As much as i rub it with water, and then rinse it off, i still get a bid of cloudyness. I would see myself using this more in the winter. Careful with eyes
