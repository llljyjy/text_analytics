I normally purchase all my skincare products from my dermatology office, but I was excited to try this. I was familiar with Charlotte Tilbury’s brand name. The container is beautiful and made of glass. I also loved the packaging. I didn’t care for the scent (smaller like roses). The consistency was med-thick. It took a while to absorb, so I only use this at night. I DID think that my skin felt softer after a few days of usage. The downfall is that it didn’t absorb well enough in the morning for me to wear under makeup. I received this produce from Influenster. Good for Use at Night Onlh
