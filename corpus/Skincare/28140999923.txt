I received a 5ml sample of #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to review the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I only used it in my night time routine after cleanser, toner and serum. The sample only lasted for a few days and during these few days I didn’t see any improvements on my skin. What I like about this product is that it’s very lightly frangranced, if any. However, for my normal to dry skin type, it’s not hydrating enough and I needed to use more amount to cover my whole face. A so-so product
