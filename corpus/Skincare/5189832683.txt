I received a travel size sample of this product free from influenster in exchange for my review. It’s a little runnier than any serum I’ve tried before so I accidentally used a ton the first time trying it because I didn’t expect that much product to come out that fast to beware of that if you get the travel size! That being said I love how light it feels on my skin and how quickly it absorbed. My skin IMMEDIATELY looked glowy and felt tighter. I think I will buy the full size when I run out because I really enjoy this product :) So glowy!!
