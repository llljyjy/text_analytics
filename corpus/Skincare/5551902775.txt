So I bought this product last year I ran out and I’ve been using other sunscreens. I didn’t have an issue but now I just bought it a few days ago and I haven’t changed anything in my skin care routine but this and it broke me out badly. My face was finally clearing up and now it looks bad. I’ll add a photo I did pick at it tho so it looks worse but none of those break outs were there before. This was all due to the sunscreen. It smells nice blends out well and I’m sad that it didn’t work for more anymore. I have oily combo skin and large pores. so sad it stopped working for me
