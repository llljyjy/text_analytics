I am writing the review from the perspective of a black woman that has always had a tough time finding SPF that works but also doesn’t my my skin look ghostly. I appreciate how easy this one is to rub in and the texture is pleasant. I’d like to continue use to see how I like it long term. But for now, I like it! nan
