this is seriously the BEST serum i’ve ever used. i have dry/combo, eczema-prone skin, and i haven’t gotten dry patches since using it. i’ve used it for 7 months now, and i can confidently say it is one of the most underrated skincare products on the market. i especially love using this in combination with the innisfree green tea toner. do your skin a favor and buy this!!! most underrated serum ever
