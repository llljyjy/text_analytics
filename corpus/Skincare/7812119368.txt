I did receive this in exchange for an honest review. This product soaks into the skin very well, so well in fact, you can completely forget you even had it on. I have combination skin, and when I use this product injunction with all of my other daily products, I tend to feel more oily than usual. That isnâ€™t a direct reflection on this product, because it can be attributed to a combination of the products I use daily. Like I tell anyone though, try it for yourself you never know how it will work for you. Not for me
