I have tried every lip balm: Bite, all of the Laniege types, Dior, Fresh, glossier, etc. This is the only thing that actually makes my lips STAY hydrated. The laniege mask used to work but i swear now that is such a cult fave they upped the fragrance and have less of the nourishing ingredients. It’s just not the same. It’s been a rough new york winter and I’m so happy I finally gave this one a go. It took me so long to try bc DE is not my go to for skincare. If you are considering, just TRY IT!! BEST AT SEPHORA
