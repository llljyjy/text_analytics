I got this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. I tested this product out for one month to make sure I got the full effect of the mask. I have to say, I am impressed! The mask feels very cooling and hydrating as soon as I put it on my face. I like to put a little extra on my cheeks because of my dry patches due to the cold winter. It really helps to moisturize my face overnight and I have definitely noticed a difference in the way my skin feels. My skin isn’t as dry and it’s no longer peeling. The only downside is that once I wash the mask off, my skin is back to feeling super dry. Not sure if that’s just my skin or if I need a better moisturizer, possibly one similar to the hydrating mask. Overall, I am very happy with the mask and I definitely recommend this mask! Very Hydrating!
