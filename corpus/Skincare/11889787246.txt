Pros for me it didn’t strip my skin and foams up nicely there was no break outs when I began using this product either and now onto the cons the scent smelled like a dove bar soap to me and it didn’t take off all my makeup but it did take a good chunk of it off. In my personal opinion for the price point I probably won’t go out and buy it just to pay for the brand name. Pros and Cons list
