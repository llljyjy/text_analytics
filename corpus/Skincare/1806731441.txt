The Moon Dew eye cream has a thick, rich consistency that I really like, yet it absorbs quickly into my skin. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues at all with irritation in the eye area. The skin around my eyes has definitely felt more hydrated since I started using this cream. Plus, I love that itâ€™s a retinol alternative! Great retinol alternative
