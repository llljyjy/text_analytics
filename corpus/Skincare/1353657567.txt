I switched from using Dermalogica’s Active Moist, a lotion I’ve used for 5+ years, to this product for more moisturizing action for day and night time use as I live in a very dry and hot climate (desert city). The cream does the job at keeping my skin moisturized all day without feeling greasy or experiencing any breakouts. However, the smell of the lotion turns into a rancid funky smell after it’s applied to my face and I HATE IT! The funk stays with me all day. I don’t think my body chemistry reacts well to this cream so I’m switching back to Active Moist. I LOVE the scent of the Active Moist cream and how it reacts to my body chemistry. I’ll stick to reapplying throughout the day when needed. Lesson learned: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Smells Rancid After Applied to Skin. YUCK!
