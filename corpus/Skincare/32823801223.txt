Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud cream is packaged in a high-quality navy blue jar with a black lid that is easy to open. There is a safety seal when you first open the cream that is easy to remove and protects the product. I am happy to see this, as I know the product is fresh and has not been tampered with in transit. Upon first impression, this cream is a light blue and appears to have a smooth texture. When applying, the texture is confirmed to be very smooth and the cream is very thick, with the slightest perfume -- so faint that it gives the product a nice fragrance without being overwhelming. The thickness of this cream inclines me to use it as the very last step in my skincare routine to seal in the other products I’ve used and provide extra moisture. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea and found this cream to be gentle and did not experience any irritation with use. I was gifted this item, however, I would recommend this moisturizing cream to friends and would absolutely purchase it, as I like Kiehl’s brand, I trust their skincare products, and I like that this product is vegan. nan
