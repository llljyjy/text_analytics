I have used St. Tropez products before and wasexcited to try this product. The smell is similar toother St. Tropez products, and when I mixed thedrops into my moisturizer, it didn’t offset mymoisturizer’s smell by much. I used 3 drops on onethigh to test. After 8 hours, my skin felt soft andsupple, but there wasn’t much of a difference incolor. I will probably use this during the summermonths to add some glow to my natural tan. nan
