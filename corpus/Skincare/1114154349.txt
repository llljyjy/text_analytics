While I absolutely love the product and it has done wonders for my dry winter skin, the refill packaging, while great in theory, is terrible. It does not fit properly in the original container and squeezed out the sides when I was trying to screw on the lid. I ended up having to throw away the original push pump too, which is supposed to keep the product sanitary, and had to just cover the tub with the top lid and scoop out the product manually. Also, once the product was getting empty, I realized the refill capsule only had half the amount of product as it appears from the outside. There is a false bottom halfway up the container. While I love the cream, I would never purchase the refill again and would be forced to buy the original tub, which defeats the purpose of the ‘sustainable packaging.’ And for the price, it’s very disappointing that the packaging makes it appear you are getting much more product than you are in reality. Great Product, Terrible Packaging
