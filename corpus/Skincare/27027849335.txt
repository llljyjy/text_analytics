I love, love, love this product!! I love my dewy finish after my morning skincare routine and I have been looking for an spf that is not tinted and doesnâ€™t have a matte finish and this is finally it!! It is nice and thin but not at all drippy and even though it appears white, it does not leave a white cast once applied. So far, so good. Great Dewy SPF!! Finally, a no matte sunscreen!!
