I received this to try out before the product even launched from Influenster. I really like the advanced night repair serum so I knew I would love this eye cream. This texture is very interesting and a very little bit goes a long way which is nice bc the jar is tiny! Not sticky, very hydrating and I’m hoping with continued use it will help my “mommy” dark circles and fine lines but definitely has helped for sure and definitely recommend!! Great eye cream for a mom of 2 littles
