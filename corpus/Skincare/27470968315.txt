I only just started using the pads about 2 weeks ago, but I’m already noticing improvements with my skins texture. I’m also noticing that I am seeing less wrinkles/lines as well. My skin is rather sensitive, so right now I am only using the pads 2x per week. They don’t really have a smell to them, which I really like. They’re easy to use and one pad is more than enough for your whole face. I’m overall impressed so far. I received this product complimentary to try. Overall Impressed
