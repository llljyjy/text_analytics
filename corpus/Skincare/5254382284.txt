MUST HAVE FOR WINTER SKIN! Living in cold and dry MN my skin is like the Sahara 6 months out of the year. This moisturizer is so smooth and a little goes a long way. My skin practically drinks it. There is no weird smells and I’m confident it’s keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. If you are in between this or the aqua bomb I suggest trying this one first! YOUR SKIN WILL DRINK THIS
