I am really happy with the Shiseido Urban Environment oil free mineral sunscreen. I love that it has Hyaluronic acid, you can use as a primer, and all in my sunscreen. I have had skin cancer so sunscreen is important and SPF 42 is a good coverage for the face. It blends into the skin well and smells good. I was in pressed with the product and will continue to use product. I recommend others to use because sunscreen is important for anti aging and this product doesnâ€™t dry out your skin. Sunscreen - everyone needs it!
