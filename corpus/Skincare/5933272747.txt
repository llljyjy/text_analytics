The only nice thing about this product is the smell (which doesn’t last). It feels good while first applying but it absorbs very quickly and doesn’t leave your lips feeling moisturized. I feel like it dries my lips out more and I’m constantly having to reapply. It’s just not worth the money. Stick to Vaseline or Carmex! Not Worth It!
