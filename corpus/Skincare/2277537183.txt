So I’ve been able to test this out for weeks now. I’ve used it for all sorts of purposes, and honestly I absolutely love this mist!It’s very refreshing on a hot day, and it’s not at all sticky. Works well with humidity (still feels refreshing), and the scent is very light so I don’t have to worry about headaches. It’s not the best makeup refresher, but it is great to hydrate and cool down skin. As weird as this sounds, I’ve been keeping in the fridge (it’s been SUPER hot and humid) and use it throughout the day. Don’t knock it until you try it! I’ll absolutely be buying this when I run out, but it’s lasted me this entire time (and I use it multiple times daily), and it isn’t running out anytime soon An amazing mist!
