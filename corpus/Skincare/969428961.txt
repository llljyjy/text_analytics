This is just heavenly. Love the beautiful lux glass packaging. It has a perfect misting sprayer, which can be hard to find. (Nothing more unpleasant than trying to set/refresh makeup with rudely spattering droplets unevenly blasting out onto your face.) Jasmine is a strong fragrance which can easily become cloying but this one is perfectly blended so that, while it’s not faint, it doesn’t overpower at all. No drying, no stickiness, no irritation. I thought it might be a tad pricey for what it is, but now that I’ve used it...honestly it’s so perfectly executed that it’s worth it. And I’m worth it. I feel spa-level pampered every day when I use it. Bottled Bliss
