I’ve heard a lot about this cream, but had not tried it until now. I sure wish I’d tried it sooner as I really do love it. It’s luxurious and rich, but not too thick and heavy for summer, and it leaves my skin soft and moist without any greasy, tacky look or feel. My skin looks smooth and pretty after a couple of weeks of using this and I’m definitely going to keep this in my routine. Luxuriant cream
