this sunscreen is much more lightweight than most, virtually no slick or stick when you apply it to your face. The moisturizer is great for a no-makeup day in the sun. I enjoyed trying this on the weekends when doing work in the yard. It didn’t feel sticky, and my pores did not feel clogged with this extended all day wear. I look forward to trying this at the beach!If you don’t have a daily sunscreen routine, I highly recommend starting one and I highly recommend trying Shisheido! Finally a lightweight, non-sticky face sunscreen!
