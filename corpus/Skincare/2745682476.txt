Started using this as soon as I got it because I really needed a hydrating moisturizer since my skin is more on the dry side especially with this winter weather here. I definitely loved the fact that the cream itself has a rich thick feeling to it. Not to mention the smell is beyond amazing! When I put this on my skin I felt very hydrated And it wasnâ€™t clogging up my pores either. It sat right on my skin, not too heavy or light textured. I would recommend this to anyone with dry prone skin. Definitely worked well. Amazing rich cream !
