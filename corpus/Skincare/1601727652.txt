I’m not sure if they’ve changed the formula, but the bottle I got is not the thick, creamy version I see in pictures. It is very thin and watery. The down-facing squeeze tube is not good packaging for a formula like this; I have to hold the bottle upside down, and gingerly tip the bottle down to get the product out which will easily just flow out of the tube. In fact, it will get everywhere if I’m not careful. As for the performance of the product, it’s ok. It doesn’t break me out , irritate my sensitive skin, and it cleanses well without over stripping.  It just doesn’t perform any better or worse than my preferred cheaper drugstore cleanser. Perhaps if it was the thick, creamy formula advertised I would have liked it better. Very thin product, bad packaging
