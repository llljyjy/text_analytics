I went to Sephora in search of a sensitive skin friendly cleanser that wasn’t rough on my skin. This was the sales ladies number one, highly rated product… my skin broke out into zits… never before have I ever gotten more than whiteheads or blackheads… this item is NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. It also made my skin super dry afterwards and tight which means it’s too touch on my skin, and overall my skin got worse with this (I even used it for a whole 2 months before hating it because sometimes it does need to get worse before it can get better, not the case here). Not good for sensitive skin
