Obsessed with this and the retinol eye stick. I keep them on my nightstand as a final step in my skincare routine, and use it every other-every third night. I noticed improvements in fine lines almost immediately if thatâ€™s even possible and getting to be more precise with your retinol application is my favourite part. nan
