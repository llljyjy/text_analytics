This cleared up my acne so well!! I’ve been having horrible breakouts and this dried up my whiteheads and soothed my redness. It did sting when I first applied, but as an esthetician I know if your skin isn’t red and hot, it’s not an allergic reaction. After 3-4 minutes, the stinging went away. I’m so glad I kept it on and used the liquid in the package as a serum! Gonna buy 5 more!! Run, Don’t Walk To Buy This!!!!!
