This serum is a great addition to your skincare routine (I use it at night). It makes my skin feel clean and soothed and prepped for the rest of my routine. I was unsure what I was getting, as it had no reviews when I decided to try, but I am so happy with the results. It is one of those products that becomes a staple. It does not make me feel oily or break out and it soaks nicely into the skin. I enjoy these “superproducts” which contain many key ingredients that are great for the skin. Will be buying again! Great simple serum
