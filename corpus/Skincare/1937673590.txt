I am so happy I found this product. I’ve never used spf on my eyes, but since I’m in my 40’s now, I’m realizing it’s past time! I use the Supergoop face cream, which I love, and I love this product as well. I use it over an eye serum, and have never had issues with dryness or pilling. It doesn’t sting my eyes, a little goes a long way, so it’s lasted me forever. As long as this product is available I will use it! nan
