This is the nicest feeling moisturizer I have ever used on my face in my life! Soft skin that’s not greasy...the smell is not great but 100% worth what the cream does. Does not smell herbal or like cbd in my opinion. Honestly never smelled anything like it before but you can’t smell it once the cream is on. This is the first cream that actually felt completely absorbed by my skin Amazing
