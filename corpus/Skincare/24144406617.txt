i had a huge breakout of dark spots and pimples around my chin. it would not go away no matter what products i used. i used this serum during my pm routine and saw a difference between a week. this serum definetly has a very oily texture, but it didnâ€™t bother me because i only used it during night. it did an excellent job at cleaning my congested skin. love it, new holy grail. clears like no other serum
