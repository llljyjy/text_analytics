Over the years I have heard about this cream by name and I always figured it was just a gimmick. Like, confidence is a very complicated concept with a lot of factors involved.BUT, when I had the opportunity to TRY this product, I was like OKAY WOW.I love the thick yet easily absorbed formula. It feels lightweight yet rich, and it really absorbs into my skin.But what I really love about it is the REACTIONS. I only used it once and a guy I know said I was looking great? Like ok? That’s just one guy. But then 2 more guys said I looked great? Then my roommate’s son said I look younger than his Dad, my roommate who is 4 years YOUNGER THAN ME! Finally after like 2 weeks of using it, I was on Zoom with lifelong friends who kept saying I look amazing.Well confidence definitely comes from experiences like these! I feel good and it is making me look good and I am super happy! Lives Up to the Name
