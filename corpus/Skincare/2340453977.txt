I really liked this moisturizer! My skin is sensitive and gets pretty flakey and dry in the winter while also being oily and acne prone AKA the most annoying combination ever. So when I come across a great moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated without clogging my pores and causing an acne flare up I definitely get excited! I applied this moisturizer in the morning and at night after washing my face and applying my toner. It smells nice and my dry skin loved it! No acne after and my face didnâ€™t become overly oily throughout the day either. I definitely recommend this for anyone with sensitive combination skin! Hydrating and great for Combination Skin!
