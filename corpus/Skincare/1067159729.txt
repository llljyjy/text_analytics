I bought this mask to try and I donâ€™t understand people who complain about packaging, or the mask not working. The package is fine, it opens up fine, and the mask is easy to apply. The mask itself works pretty well. It is not supposed to make you look like an Instagram filter, but it did even my skin tone, and cleared the pores. For $9 you are getting a pretty amazing deal. For anything heavy duty you gotta go to a spa. In the meantime, treat yourself! Put on a mask, and sip some wine or herbal tea. it works. stop complaining
