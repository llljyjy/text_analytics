My primary use for this product is as sunscreen. I have had precancerous growths on my lips, and I’m not trying to have my lips cut off as I age. I put it on first, let it soak in, then do my lip color. You can also wear it alone, of course, but it seems like people don’t like it for that purpose. As a sunscreen it’s great, because it’s not so goopy. Ideal for under lip color.
