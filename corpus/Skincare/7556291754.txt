Love love love this lip mask. Iâ€™m not going to use it as a mask, just as an intense moisturizer for my lips lol. If your lips have been taking a beating this winter, this balm is amazing. Super thick and moisturizing. Just be careful with the packaging, I was super impatient when I got it and you need to turn and click it to dispense product, I turned it way too much and it keeps dispensing every time i open it lol. New favorite for winter/dry lips
