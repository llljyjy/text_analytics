I have used this mist every other day for about 3 weeks. I have found that it gives a very subtle tan to my EXTREMELY fair skin. It definitely provides a lasting glow after application and feels quite hydrating. I have enjoyed this product and find that it works for me. It isn’t too orange and it isn’t streaky. If you are light-medium skin toned or darker I do not think this would work for you as a self-tanner. Very subtle tan and very glowy
