I received this product complimentary via Influenster for my honest review. My first impressions were good; the pump was much appreciated and it smells a little like a creamsicle. After looking at the ingredients, I was worried the citrus would irritate my eczema prone skin but thankfully it didn’t, even after prolonged use. The vanilla extract doesn’t seem to serve any purpose apart from fragrance which I’m not impressed by.I am very happy with the brightening effects, though I wish it was more moisturizing for my dry skin. If there’s a serum, I might pair that with a richer cream. nan
