The first thing I noticed about this serum is how it felt when applied. Without even reading the ingredients I could tell that dimethicone (silicone) was high on the list. On the plus side, it applied very smoothly. I have noticed since using this product that my under-eye area is brighter with fewer dark circles. But this product is VERY drying. I actually developed lines that were not there previously! My skin dried out considerably and I found I needed to use another eye cream on top of this one to counteract the drying effect. Personally, the cons far outweigh any benefits I have seen with this product. Delivers and Then Takes Away
