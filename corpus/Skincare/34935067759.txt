I noticed results after 1 week. I’ve had acne since my teen years into late twenties, this has been the first product that I can use everyday, or even twice a day without irritating my skin. It truly has done wonders on preventing future breakouts, even monthly hormonal flares. Of course, it won’t stop everything, but it will make breakouts disappear in about 2 days! Also, my skin is combination, oily t-zone, dry around the mouth and eyes, but this is super sensitive and won’t dry me out after washing. I follow it with their skin barrier moisturizer. Love it.
