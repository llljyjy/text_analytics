Amazing Serum for a great exfoliation. I donâ€™t understand why this has only a couple of reviews and the one with a picture of a sample packet is not even of this product. Do not leave reviews when you just sampled a product. Any product averages two weeks minimum to show results. Your skin needs to adapt to the new product. This is A+ and the price is very reasonable. I have spent more in serums that did nothing in 6 months. Great Product
