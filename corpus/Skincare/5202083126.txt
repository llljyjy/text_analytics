I was fortunate enough to be chosen to sample this eye serum for my honest opinion on it. I absolutely loved the tip on it. The metal felt good spreading the serum under my eyes. I felt that it definitely helped with the puffiness and bags under my eyes that I tend to suffer with daily (no matter hope much sleep I get or water I drink) but I felt it didn’t help at all with the fine lines and wrinkles I have around my eyes. I also wasn’t thrilled about how strong it is scented. It actually made my eyes water when I applied it because the smell was so strong. I’m glad I was given the opportunity to try this but I think I’ll stick with the eye serum I’ve been using that costs only a fraction of the price of this Dior serum Not for me
