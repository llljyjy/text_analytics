First off, I was surprised by how much product was in the casing. A little bit goes a long way too. I use about wo fingers worth of product. I applied the cream as a mask and left it on for 5 minutes to get a more deep cleansing after a long day of wearing makeup. The Jojoba beads are perfect and not too rough as I amwashing myface. With the immediate cooling effect I can feel the product deep cleaning my skin. Afterwards my skin feels so bright, refreshed and hydrated and very soft. Iâ€™m living for this natural glow!
