I have been using a retinol for a while already so I can’t say I’ve seen massive changes to my skin, a lot of my problem areas were being tended to for a while already. For this particular product, the texture is nice and feels good on the face. Doesn’t smell great though and I’m sensitive to that so took off one star. Using retinol in general my skin is much smoother, the coloring is more even and I’m really in it for the long term anti aging effects nan
