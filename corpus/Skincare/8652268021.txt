very nice product for sure. it is definitely a serum like texture and goes on pretty smooth. not oily.  it does for some reason slightly remind me of the smell of sun screen which is weird... but only after I’ve rubbed it into my face. but it absorbed well into my skin and Def gives me more life lol considering I’m 29 and a mom of 2 with one being a 4 month old.  I haven’t used it long enough like over a month to say the long term effects are good or not though. Nice serum to try!
