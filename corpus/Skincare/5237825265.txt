I have a combination skin, and I’m starting to notice the 35+ wrinkles appearing. The product does have a nice, very light smell to it. The consistency is tick, and I feel I’m using more product than I should. I am using it mainly at night because I feel it’s a bit too greasey for use during the day, but it does give my skin a nice glow when I wake up in the morning. but I haven’t noticed any wrinkle change yet. I gave it to my mom, and she likes it better. It makes her skin feel more elastic. Good, just not for my skin.
