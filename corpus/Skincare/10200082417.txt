I am a ROUGE. I bought this product on Sephora 20% off day. I really like this product. I recently run out of my old one, and when I open a new one, I found the product seems like someone have been used it!!!!!!The shell is very dirty, and more than half of the cream is gone!!!!!!!!!!!! I use my own money to buy a product which is other used it!Luckily, when I opened this product, my home camera recorded my open box action, I am going to report !!! Buy a returned product, dirty, less half cream
