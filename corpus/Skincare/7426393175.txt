Absolutely amazing at helping restore your moisture barrier! Skin is soft and smooth after continued use. It is a thicker cream so it is quite heavy but thatâ€™s ideal for what this cream is marketed for. The only issue I have is it starts pilling with other skincare which can be annoying since I use my active serums at night. Instructions do say to apply to clean, dry skin but I prefer a night cream that can mix well with my night serums. Awesome but starts pilling?
