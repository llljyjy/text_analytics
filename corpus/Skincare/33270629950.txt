I struggle with severe cystic acne. I have been using this product for 6 weeks & my acne is GONE! I’m shocked every time I look in the mirror... nothing helped. For 20 years I was either covered in pimples, wounds and scars... or wearing a full face of makeup. Not only has my acne improved, but my skin is truly healthier. At first, The Ordinary products sat on top of my skin - my skin couldn’t absorb them. Now my skin soaks them right up. I haven’t had a breakout in a weeks & scarring is improving.Here is how I introduced the products to avoid a flare up. #1 CerVe Foaming cleanser. I kept my facial cleanser. It’s cheap, it’s gentle, it works & everyone in my house uses it. #2 Niacinamide 10% with Zinc 1%: I introduced this first. I waited 3 days then...#3 Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum. I have dry skin, & every other salicylic acid product I have ever used has made my acne much worse. This product is different!  I waited 3 more days, then I introduced...#4 AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution. I started with 3 minutes. After 3 more days, I introduced...#5 Granactive Retinoid* 2% Emulsion. I waited 2 weeks (until after my “purge“ where I had a pretty bad breakout) to introduce...#6 Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA. This feels a little to rich for my skin. I use it after the Peel, and a little under my eyes.My AM routine1) CerVe Foaming Cleanser2) Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%3) Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum (spot treat)4) CerVe Ultra Light Face Lotion with SPFMy PM Routine1) CerVe Foaming Cleanser-Once a week: AHA 30% + BHA 2% + Exfoliating Peeling Solution. 10 min2) Niacinamide 10% with Zinc 1%3) Granactive Retinoid* 2% Emulsion4) Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum4) Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if my skin is thirsty) +  CreVe Ultra Light PM Face Lotion (if my skin is normal)I hope this helps someone!
