I received this sunscreen from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange of my review. To be honest, this is one of the best sunscreens I have tried so far. It is creamy and thin, gets absorbed very quickly and leaves you feeling moisturized. It is not greasy, or leaves any residue. I love that I can use it on top of my makeup. I noticed that I have less pigmentation on my neck since I started using it. It really works well from protecting your skin from the sun and burning. I love that itâ€™s very lightweight, and easy to fit in my purse. I highly recommend this sunscreen by Shiseido! By the way, their skincare line is also amazing. nan
