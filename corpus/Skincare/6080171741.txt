Really moisturizing. I went a little too hard with the acids and caused my skin barrier to me extremely damaged. I used cerave moisture cream thinking because it was thick and having the ceramides thought it would help. Honestly it was not working for me. I had a small packaged sample of Drunk Elephant LaLa Retro and OHMGEE. When I tell you that it applied so smooth, oh boy. I could immediately feel the hydration and just my skin slurping all of it up. Too see the price of this cream is killing me. I know itâ€™s worth it because it gets the job done. I also appreciate that the proceeds goes to a great cause. If I purchase this I will be extremely stingy with it lol because eek. Idk when my pocket will be able to afford it again. LaLa Love It!!!
