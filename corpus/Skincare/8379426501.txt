I received this product from Sephora collection in exchange for my honest review. The resurfacing peel mask is honestly pretty good for the price and Iâ€™m really happy to find out that the ingredients are mostly clean! I have large pores and after two weeks of using this consistently (basically two times) my face seems a bit smoother and tighter. Great to reduce pore size overtime!
