This is one of my fav clay mask and trust me when I say I have tried all kinds of clay mask there are on the market. It has a cool sensation and does not dry out / crack after you left it on for 15mins. I do recommend follow up with hydrating products such as HA or Niac and a good moisturizer for a good night skin care spa and next day your skin will be glowing. Youâ€™re welcome Love. Love. Love
