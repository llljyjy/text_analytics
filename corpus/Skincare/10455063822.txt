Loving this clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting eye cream.  I just turned 41 and have been trying to find an eye wrinkle cream that I could start using. I’ve used all kinds of different products they are either too oily or run into my eyes making them burn. Cliniques smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting cream is just the perfect touch. It’s not oily, it soaks into your skin just where you put it, no running into my eyes making, and it smells wonderful!  A little goes a long way too so the jar is going to last for a good while. Just a dab on your clean finger tip and tap tap tap on your eye area helps with the fine lines and wrinkles! I love it and have my mom using it now too! Amazing eye wrinkle repair cream
