This is one of the best cleansing bars I’ve ever used. To start with Packaging: it came in a standard soap box packaging, nothing fancy. Easy to dispose of box. Smell: it smells fantastic. It has a soothing relaxing smell to it. Slightly herbal/flowery.Use: I actually cut this soap in half. I keep one in my bathtub for body wash and another half by the sink for face wash. It does both fantastically. A cold wash to the face after this soap leaves my face tingling and fresh. Again up there with the best. In the month and a half that I’ve consistently used this, I’ve noticed my face breaking out less and also my skin being hydrated. I do use a hydrating serum after wash but still there’s a clear trend. It lathers well and quickly, does not feel harsh to touch. Fantastic. Would 100% recommend and would buy Something to add to your facial routine
