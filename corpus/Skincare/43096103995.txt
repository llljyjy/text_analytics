I have very dry ance prone skin, that reacts to literally anything that is put on the face, and this product has been wonderful. It supplies hydration to my skin while not feeling overly greasey. my skin has had no reaction to it which is great because this is the only moisturizer that doesnâ€™t break out my skin. a must have to my routine that I'll always grab.
