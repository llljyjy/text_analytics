After using this cream from past few weeks I’m loving the results my skin feels so soft and plump I’m definitely seeing a difference in my skin , I have combination skin n it suits my skin very well , the consistency of cream is thick and it has no fragrance which I love , after applying at night when I wake’s up in the morning my skin feels so fresh , I definitely going to buy this again and would recommend to my family and friends A must have in my night skin care routine
