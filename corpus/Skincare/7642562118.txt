I have been using this serum close to a month now and I have NO complaints. It claims to brighten and hydrate the skin and it does ! My skin definitely looks more hydrated than before. I usually put it mostly at night but I have used it in my day time routine as well. It barely has a smell which I like. One pump dispenses a good amount of product as well. I say give it a try !!!! Nice serum
