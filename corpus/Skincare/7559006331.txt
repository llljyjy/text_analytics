A little of this cream goes a long way. It seems thick and heavy as it comes out of the tube but it transforms into a light and refreshing foam. It does have a scent that lingers even after its washed off. I quite like the scent and donâ€™t mind it at all; I find it refreshing and perfume like (in a good way IMO). The cleanser was complimentary from Influenster. Excellent Cleanser
