Like so many others, being a fan of the SOS mist, I was excited when a serum was released. This is such a welcome addition to my skin care routine and so easy to use between my essence and moisturizer. Though I don’t suffer from acne or eczema, my skin feels so soft, hydrated and rejuvenated after using this serum - which has surprisingly few but clearly very effective ingredients. It does come out a little forcefully, so be mindful of that when you’re squirting it into your palms. Terrific serum!
