It does have this cooling effect which is really soothing and refreshing.It also hydrates the eye area. While using this, a little is all you need so you don’t end up looking so blue around the eye.I loved the ingredients combo list with the exception of the hydroquinone in it. Overall, I did think it was a good product but I don’t see myself repurchasing the eye balm Cools and soothes the area around the eyes
