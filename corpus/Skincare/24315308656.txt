Literally brings my acne up to the surface so quickly. I spot treat with it in the morning and use all over face at night. I always wake up with the acne I can see it coming in up to the surface. It actually clears the acne from the pore. It gets rid of the stubborn deep acne very quickly as well. Is obviously oily and thin in texture because it’s anhydrous, so if you don’t like that feeling then I don’t recommend for you, but I stopped noticing it very quickly. I only use 2 drops for whole face, and 1 to spot treat and that amount does the job so well. AMAZING
