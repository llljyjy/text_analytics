I received two deluxe samples, and it was perfect timing because my skin was recovering from a reaction to idk what but it was red, bumpy and flaking. My skin felt thin, tight and literally hurt. My skin felt soothed as soon as I put the cleanser on my skin. I like to use a lot because the texture feels even more luxurious the more you use. After even the first use, my skin felt so much better. The bumps and redness disappeared within days, and my skin felt strong and hydrated. Overall, the texture of the cleanser is creamy and rich, and the lather is soft and frothy. My skin felt healthy, restored, stronger, and hydrated. It did sting my eyes if I opened them, though.I am purchasing the full size and definitely recommend, especially if you live in cold climates. Perfect for sensitized skin
