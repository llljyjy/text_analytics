I am 32 and have only a few small lines around my eyes. Prior to using this eye cream, I didn’t use anything on my eye area. So I am approaching this as a preventative step, and in that context, this is a great eye cream. It is smooth, light, and very moisturizing without being greasy or irritating. It contains squalane, peptides, and caffeine. It also contains NO alcohols, which in my experience is a rarity, especially at a lower price point. Due to its active ingredients, nice texture, non-drying qualities, and ability to sit well under my makeup, I would say this is the perfect eye cream for someone who isn’t looking for a major intervention. I have repurchased and will continue to do so, though not from this website. Downside is the weird applicator, as others have mentioned; it spits out product every time you close it. I have incorporated this extra blob into the amount I use, but still, it’s annoying. Non-irritating, very moisturizing, good actives
