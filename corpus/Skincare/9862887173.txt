I have mixed skin and I usually struggle with open pores and blackheads. Since the first time I used this product I noticed a change on my face, the blackheads are gone and the texture of my skin is much softer and smoother than before. I donâ€™t use it every day, but its effect lasts for about 3 days. I loved this product, I actually replaced the exfoliant that I was using before, and I will continue using this one. Totally recommended to everyone! Love this product!
