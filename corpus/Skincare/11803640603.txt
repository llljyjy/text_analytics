I love this oil. I personally do not use it on my face because I have breakout prone skin, and if you ladies also have the same issue you can use this as a hair oil. The ingredients in this product are beneficial and nourishing for the hair just as it is for the skin, it definitely helped my hair grow. Makes a good hair oil
