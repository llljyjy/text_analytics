I haven’t been using too long and i already love this product so much. i deal with a lot of acne scars and general redness and this has really calmed it down. i’ve tried a few bha’s/aha’s and my skin doesn’t seem to like them very much. i have extremely sensitive/dry skin. i feel no irritation whatsoever when i use this. although it does say you can use it daily but i wouldn’t recommend that. i use it about two or three times a week and it’s working really well for me!!! my skin will break out over anything and haven’t had a pimple since using this i love it. i recommend using a gentle cleanser without any (somewhat) harsh ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide before using if you’re new to products like this especially sensitive skin approved!!
