Amazing product! First off, it smells good. I’m not a fan of putting chemicals on my face that smell like straight up acid, this however smells pretty darn good. It does it’s job very well. I used it for weeks now and I can visibly notice dark spots fading. I have seen a major difference in my complexion. Where I apply it , my skin seems way brighter as well as more hydrated, which is a bonus. It’s also very, very fast acting. It works within a week, and you can truly see the difference. I would definitely recommend as a little goes a very long way :) So good.
