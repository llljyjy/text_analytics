This is for reviews like lovieduvie’s. This is a face wash, it’s not gonna completely transform your skin. If skincare isn’t something you actually ENJOY investing in, there is absolutely no reason you should spend this much on a cleanser. A salicylic acid cleanser from the drug store will do almost the exact same thing. A cleanser is on your face for one to two minutes tops, that’s not a lot of time to treat your issues. If you’re going to invest on skincare, I would suggest investing in serums. Every other item can be bought adequately from a drug store. It’s just a face wash lol
