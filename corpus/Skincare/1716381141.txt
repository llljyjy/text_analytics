I can’t stand the feeling of sunscreen, especially on my face (it’s a texture thing) but this feels just like a lightweight cream. There’s still a little bit of greasiness at the beginning but it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin smooth- no pilling. I haven’t tested how this behaves under makeup but on bare skin it’s amazing. The cool/untinted shade starts out a bit grey but that also goes away after a bit. I hate sunscreen but I love this
