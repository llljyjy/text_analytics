I received this product from Influenster to try out. I have pretty sensitive so I started out only using 1-2 times per week, along with the resurfacing serum. I simplified my skincare routine to just face wash, toner, these two products I was testing, and a moisturizer. I did not have any breakouts or irritation from this products which was nice. If you have sensitive skin like me definitely start off slow with these pads. The pads were soft on my skin and left me feeling refreshed and moisturized. I definitely had a radiant glow after using these. nan
