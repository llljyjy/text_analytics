I was really looking forward to this product as I LOVE my drunk elephant baby facial (not available in Canada). I love that this a clean product. It’s a very gentle AHA face mask and would be a good introduction to AHA masks for people with more sensitive skin. The packaging is very nice looking as well. Overall it’s a nice mask, it did slightly improve my skins texture and didn’t cause any irritation. Starter AHA mask
