I just used the papaya mask for the first time, and I wanted to see if the “resurfacing” of the skin really happened to me. This product feels like a thin, liquid-like gel and a little goes a long way, so, I wanted to see how good it would work only using the bare minimum amount (less than 1 pump). I was also unsure if this is a PEELING mask as in it peels off, or as in it exfoliates. Well, it is not a peel off mask, and it seemed to smooth my skin. I didn’t expect a miracle in one use, but it’s gentle enough to use 2-3 times a week if used properly. Definitely worth the buy for $10! NOT a peel off mask
