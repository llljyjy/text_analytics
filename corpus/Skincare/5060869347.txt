At first try, not particularly amazing, and did not absorb right away. But I over exfoliated the other day and oh wow, this cream saved the day. All of my other skin care products tingled when applied, this did not hurt at all and absorbed so well. I find that if you apply after working the cream between the palms of your hand until cream appears clear, it absorbs way better. Might have something to do with temperature? Saved the day
