The Community Sixty Six Hydrating Gel Moisturizer is a decent moisturizer but it is my least favorite product of the line. I have combination skin but I found that it wasn’t hydrating enough for me. I was l only able to use it at night because the moisturizer would cause my foundation to pill. Maybe the moisturizer would be better suited for just oily skin types but all others from combination to dry might find it isn’t hydrating enough. Not for me
