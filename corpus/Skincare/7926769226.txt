I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 months now and it really hasn’t done much for my skin. I don’t think it’s stands well enough on its own for my dry skin, so I feel like I have to use an oil after this to make sure my skin is still hydrated in the morning, which is disappointing for how much this product costs. It is very lightweight in my opinion, so I think it might be worth trying for people who like that in a moisturizer. Didn't do much
