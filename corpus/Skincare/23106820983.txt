Ive been using this product for a week and I definitely see and feel a difference in my skin. It’s a nice textured serum…slightly runny but nice texture. It smells lovely too. I have fair, sallow, sensitive skin. This serum brightened my skin, evened my completion and tightened it slightly. I almost felt confident enough to wear no makeup by day 6 lol. Almost…(I will never be seen without at least mascara). I received this in exchange for an honest review. I swear I’m being very honest. I really love how this seemed to transform my skin from red, blotchy and dry to clear and velvety. Well done Clarins. Adding to my wish list! Great for sensitive skin
