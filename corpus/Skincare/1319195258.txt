I found my perfect lip hydrator! After finding a matte lipstick I loved + entering my mid 30s, I found myself in desperate need of a good mask/balm/whatever for my lips - whatever worked, I was willing to do. I tried Laneige, which did almost nothing for me. I tried La Mer, same. I was about to give up hope but decided to try Kissu and was SO GLAD I did - I found my solution in the form of this lip mask! Shockingly, I find that I don’t even need a lip scrub anymore, I just put this one before bed and  I’m golden. Hooray!In addition to WORKING, this product comes in adorable packaging and feels LESS thick/goopy than Laneige, so it’s very wearable. Could not be happier! I found my lip hydrator!
