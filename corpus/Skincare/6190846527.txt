Right know that I’m breaking out more, I’m happy to have received this cream. It has salicylic acid which I normally use on breakouts. When I apply the cream I noticed it does hydrates my skin and mattifies pretty quickly, making it easier to apply my foundation right after. But a couple of hours I get oily again. It does say it blurs pores but I didn’t see any difference nor did I have expected it to work for that. I like this moisturizers so far, I will continue to use. I received these products for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. light moisturizer
