I gave it a 3 star because the product was only meh for me, especially given the price and the hype. My skin didn’t feel particularly anything after using this..maybe it is more suited for oiiy or blemished skin type. For the price and size, I’ve used better products. I’m quite disappointed because I’ve read so much about it and was excited to try. An okay and meh product for me.
