I received NUDESKIN Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer as a sample for being part of the bzzagent community. I found this product to be no different from a less expensive pharmacy cream.Pros: a small amount goes a long way, smells ok, the design of the tube.Cons: the smell is not for everyone, just saw the price of this product-dont think its worth that much.I’m glad I got to try this cream for free, otherwise I would not have purchased it. I didn’t notice anything change with my skin while using this cream, I was really hoping that it would help brighten or lighten my skin as vitamin c is known for this, but i didn’t notice this. All I noticed was just a small amount of cream gets a lot of coverage. Not worth hype
