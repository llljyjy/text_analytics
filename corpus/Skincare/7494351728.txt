Absolutely love this. My first bottle a few years ago came from Freck directly, and its amazing how much of a difference it makes. Smoother skin without sacrificing hydration and none of the burn! Iâ€™m so glad they have this at Sephora now so i can skip the shipping and the wait :) the smell is clean and super faint, and the bottle lasts for a while at 2x daily use. does not dry out DRY skin, recommend to everyone!
