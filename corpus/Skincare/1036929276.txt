Being almost 52, I am obsessed with treating my neck area. I have visible horizontal lines across my neck and am hoping to lessen their severity. I’ve been loving using this neck serum with peptides both in the morning and at night. Most products I’ve used for the neck area are a cream in a jar, so I really like that Necessaire put this in a convenient pump bottle!! The texture of this formula is more of a serum/cream combo that is really nice. It glides on so smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving my neck area feeling soft. Acfew other notes on this one is that it’s fragrance-free which is nice, as some of my other skincare is scented so when applying all my products I like having an unscented one in the bunch. I also love it’s formula with a 9% peptide blend, with no silicones or parabens. I can’t wait to see what continued use will bring, but so far my neck is loving the progress! Fabulous Neck Serum!
