Overpriced. Will never purchase again. I do NOT recommend. Relied on the fact that I like the Wonder cream, and on the Tilbury brand. I did not mind the scent, but the oil itself did absolutely nothing after almost three months of using.  If anything, my skin seems to have gotten dark spots!!!! Also, after about a month it started to look a bit cloudy - even though I was using the dropper cleanly.  My most disappointing Sephora purchase ever, especially for the price point. Overpriced, no benefits, dark spots afterwards
