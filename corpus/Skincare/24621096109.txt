I was at Sephora 2 days ago browsing around and I stumbled upon the tanning section. Honestly when I swatched the serum I wasn’t expecting much, but today I noticed an dramatic difference in color. The product does kinda smell bad but for the results it yields, it’s worth it. I really wish I tried it out on my whole arm so that I didn’t have a patch of bronze skin. LolI’m definitely going back to purchase it and this time, I’ll properly spread it around. Sold… I’m buying it!!
