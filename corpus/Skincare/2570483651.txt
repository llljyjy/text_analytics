This stuff is a life saver! I had a terrible allergic reaction to a different product. It caused me to have really bad eczema under my eyes. I only recently realized the cause. I tried every deep moisturizer eye cream but nothing would work. This actually healed my skin! The redness and dryness went away. The only reason it isn’t 5 stars is it takes forever to soak in so I can’t wear it under makeup. But it truly healed my skin! nan
