I enjoyed the texture of this and I didn’t find it to have any weird scent; however, it caused me to break out pretty badly. At first I thought it was purging but then I got deep, painful cystic acne and dark spots that haven’t resolved almost 3 weeks after I stopped using it. Guess my skin doesn’t respond well to azelaic acid but that’s not the product’s fault. nice texture. made me break out
