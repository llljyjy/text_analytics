Love this!! I mix a few drops in with my moisturizer and it creates a really nice tan glow that actually looks natural. I have pale skin, but I use this on my face and the body oil mixed in with my lotion in the summer to create a natural looking glow without exposing my skin to sun damage. I’ve gotten so many compliments and people asking me if I just had vacation because it looks so natural. Always shocked when I say it’s from self tanner. Cannot recommend enough! Love it!
