I’m all for mineral SPF as it is better for the reef life but unfortunately some brands really just don’t formulate well. Necessaire isn’t one of them. This mineral SPF glides onto the skin so nicely and is very moisturizing. The only downside I have for this product is the initial white cast when being applied, but it does fade away after a while, but would’ve preferred it, if it would just fade away instantly.
