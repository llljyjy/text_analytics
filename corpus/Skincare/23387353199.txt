This cleansing balm is very effective at removing makeup, even waterproof mascara. I really like the rose scent and that it hydrates my dry skin. It also leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I love how effective this cleansing balm is and my skin feels so clean and refreshed.  Great product! Clean and refreshing
