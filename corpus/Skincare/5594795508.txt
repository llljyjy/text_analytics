I wrote a review on the serum. Pretty much the same here. Don’t waste your money on this it doesn’t work. All the rave 5 star reviews are from people who were literally gifted this product for an “honest” review. I actually spent my money on this and can tell you it doesn’t work. Made absolutely zero difference with my skin. No changes. Buy something else, there’s plenty of products that work. Watch out for those reviews that are all made by people who didn’t even pay for this stuff. 2 stars for not irritating my sensitive skin. That’s about all it did. Don’t waste your money.
