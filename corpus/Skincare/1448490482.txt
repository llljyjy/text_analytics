Why does this have sunscreen in it? To get SPF 30 protection, you have to put on between a 1/4 and a 1/2 tsp of product, and it is NOT pretty. But if you ignore the sunscreen component and apply just what you need, it’s lovely. The formula looks green, but also has that invisible pigment I’ll always associate with Almay: start blending to see the skin-coloured tint develop. Deducted two stars because as a sunscreen formula it’s a massive fail. Plus, I can’t put it near my eyes because it makes them STING – GAH! (The reason is a mystery; mineral sunscreen filters don’t usually bother my eyes.) Deducting another star for that. Relieved I bought the 15mL instead of the 50mL. If the brand releases a version without sunscreen in a 15mL size, I’d 100% buy it to try. As for the rest of this one, I’ll use it over my usual SPF 60 sunscreen and keep it far, FAR away from my eyes. WITHOUT SUNSCREEN WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER
