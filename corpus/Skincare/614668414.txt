I have been using this product for about four weeks. The texture is nice, and it absorbs quickly. I feel like it really quenches my skin. I usually Lee this jar on hand and apply several times throughout my night shift in front of a computer. It makes my skin feel refreshed, smells great, and my skin has been softer over the course of using it. I will definitely be purchasing when my jar runs out. Great addition to my skin care kit
