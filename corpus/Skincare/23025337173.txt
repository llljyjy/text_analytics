I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for something that actually works! As someone with aging skin, after use I was able to tell a difference in the softness/moisture of my skin and also noticed line/wrinkle reduction. It is a little pricy but definitely worth it! Excellent Results and Worth the Price!
