This was really good for dark circles, not sure if it was good for anything else. It is thicker and a little goes a very long way. The fragrance is light and doesn’t linger. Packaging for sample, I received for free for my honest review, didn’t say much in terms of instructions. Wasn’t a lot of info on the box, but if I could read French it probably wouldn’t be useful either. Good for dark circles
