While I usually love IT products, this one missed the mark.The good:The cream is rich, creamy and absorbed into my skin quickly.  I noticed improvements within a week in texture, and a reduction of some fine lines.  You get a ton of product, so the value is there.The bad:The product comes in a round glass container, which means I have to put my fingers in the container to get product out, which I hate as I feel contaminates the product.  I do have a work around; I use a fresh q-tip to get the product out.  The bigger issue is the scent. The product is so highly scented that it would be a no go for me.  The scent lasts forever, and in my situation, the moment I began to sweat, the scent was reactivated. If the product was not scented, it would be a 5 star, but I cannot get over the scent.If highly scented products do not bother you, then I recommend it.  If you donâ€™t, stay away. Great Cream but too highly scented for me
