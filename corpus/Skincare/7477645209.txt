I had high hopes for this product since I really like their other probiotic cream moisturizer, but I feel like this kinda fell flat for me. It doesn’t really do anything for my pores. I just use this as a regular moisturizer because that’s all it really does is add hydration but doesn’t do anything for acne or pores. I think they missed the mark with the advertisement because if it didn’t say it does all these extra things that it doesn’t do, this would be a great moisturizer because it feels nice. nan
