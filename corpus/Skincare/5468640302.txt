I love every It Cosmetics product I’ve used to date and Bye-Bye Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm isn’t any different. It effectively removes all types of makeup, including waterproof mascara. It melts on your skin as you start to rub in on and keeps your skin hydrated. It has a light floral scent and is very gentle. I personally don’t like floral scent so I would love if they came out with a tropical or fruit scented one. Then it would be absolute perfection for me. But I, like many people, have to work hard to have makeup not rub off and transfer on the face mask I have to wear all day at work so I wasn’t sure if this would be able to remove all my makeup on the first try, but surprisingly it did. It all melts away
