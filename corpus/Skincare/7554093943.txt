Recently Fresh gifted me the black tea advance age renewal cream and I instantly fell in love. The texture was very creamy and I love how it doesn’t feel sticky on your face because I absolutely can’t stand that. It was still able to leave my face moisturized and glowy. Ever since I started adding this one product to my skincare routine I’ve been getting so many compliments about how nice my skin is. I saw an improvement in my skin and it looks a lot healthier and glowy than before. The little wrinkles under my eyes are slowly fading away and looking more plumped. It also helped with my uneven skin tone and dullness which was great. Overall my skin looks a lot healthier, firmer, and more radiant. This cream really did the job. Love it
