Ok 3 stars bc I had gotten the birthday gift last year with the mini/ sample size of this and it was AMAZING. My lips were hydrated and felt so smooth putting on at night and then when I woke up they felt nice! Skip to- buying the full size. Big sad. I used this every night for two weeks and I felt like there was less of strawberry smell and it didn’t taste great/ not like it was awesome before but it was just different. And this was drying out my lips in the morning. I would wake up with actually ashy lips which didn’t happen before or with any other lip moisturizer/ mask/ chapstick I’ve every used. I had to return it. I may try a mini purchase again bc so many people swear by it. mini size was amazing but full-size was returned
