This is a very nice product, overall. The consistency is very liquidy, so it spreads out nicely across the skin. It does leave a slight white cast, but performs well underneath makeup. There isnâ€™t a very strong sunscreen-scent, which is nice. I was given this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Nice product
