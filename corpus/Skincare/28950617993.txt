I received a sample and then purchased my own after liking the feel and results. It feels soft and cool on the face and gets rid of the days oil and makeup. I use a microfiber towel and the only thing that comes off after I’m done is some left over mascara. So overall I’m pretty pleased. Clean and refreshing!
