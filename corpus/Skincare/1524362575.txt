Dry skin YTTP users rejoice! I have tried YTTP’s other moisturizers and found them to be nice but not hydrating enough. Not so with this new cream! Definitely very hydrating, but not heavy feeling on the skin. I have sensitive skin and didn’t have any issues with sensitivity with this product. Really lovely cream! nan
