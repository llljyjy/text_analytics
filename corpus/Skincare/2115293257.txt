This is expensive, but it is absolutely a holy grail skincare item.  I leave it on for just 5 minutes, and the immediate, very apparent affects are AMAZING.  It makes my skin bright, clears dark spots, clears scar spots, evens my skin tone, makes my makeup application FLAWLESS.  It makes me feel so sexy and confident!  I don’t even know if it is supposed to do all of those things, but it does them.  I couldn’t figure out what part of my routine was making my skin look so amazing, my skin started being really dull and spotty and I was disappointed - and I hadn’t used this in a few days.  I used it and realized it was this item that was doing the magic to my face.  This is something I will forever keep stocked. AMAZING
