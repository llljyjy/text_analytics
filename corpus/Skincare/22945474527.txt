I have been using this product for about two weeks now. The texture of the serum itself is so silky, it glides flawlessly onto my skin and absorbs almost instantly. It does not feel sticky or thick. Iâ€™ve noticed that my skin feels softer and the little wrinkles that have begun to form on my forehead and around my eyes are smoothing out a bit. I usually have fairly sensitive skin but have had no reactions or unusual breakouts since starting this. Added bonus - it smells terrific. Treat Yourself!
