I’ve spent my adult life on a quest for the best eye cream. I still haven’t found it, but like this one enough to purchase another tube. I saw a slight improvement to the dark circles under my eyes and love the feeling as the cream soaks in - a bit like you’ve had a little eye lift as it tightens your skin and gives it some bounce. My only complaint is that it’s a little sticky, so I was able to use every night, but could only use on days where I didn’t need to also apply make up. Decent eye cream
