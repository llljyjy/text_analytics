I love the tingle/burn of these. My skin is sensitive yet also extremely stubborn. These have the perfect amount of tingle. And the really get the job done. I’m one night they noticeably shrink the breakouts I get on my forehead. They reduce the texture on my nose. And they don’t make my skin red and painful the next day. Highly recommend. Note: I do use these in conjunction with the serum from the same line. GAME CHANGER!!!
