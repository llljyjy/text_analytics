I saw this product on tik tok and needed a sunscreen to reapply over my makeup since it’s super sunny in Florida. It’s a perfect compact size to toss in my purse without taking up space. It gives a glowy finish without the oily look. Love putting it over my face of makeup, neck, and cleavage ;) it does leave a little bit of residue on the stick from my makeup so I just have a little alcohol wipe to clean it :) nan
