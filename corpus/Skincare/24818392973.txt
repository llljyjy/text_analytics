I enjoyed the Fenty Cookies N Clean. It was easy to apply. I prefer dry skin to apply because easier to see change. There is no harsh smell or any smell. I felt firmness in my skin as I wore it. It made my skin cool. I had no irritations. The only part I didnâ€™t enjoy was rinsing. The rinsing was a little difficult. Cookies N Clean
