So impressive! I enjoy using clay masks daily and I think this product is innovative and different! It has a funny spongy texture. I was initially confused about the black beads; then I realized you work them into your skin and it dissolves. Overall, it was a pleasant and fun experience. I just keep falling in love with this brand. A new cookies and cream monster!!
