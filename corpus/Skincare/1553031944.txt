I’ve been in the skincare industry for a little over 30 years and I have tried a lot of different products during these years. Some good and some not so good. I have tried some of the cosmetics products from Kosas and I have liked them. But I have a completely different experience with this specific product, the Kosas plump and juicy spray-on serum. Usually, when. Product is meant to be sprayed on the skin, the aerosol part is like a mist, very minute particles that disperses evenly on the skin. You would think that a serum, which is meant to treat the skin would be created like that, but that’s not the case. When you spray the product on your skin, it comes out like a bunch of product on one area of the skin. I ended up spraying my hands and then applying on my skin. The smell was terrible. Plus vegan collagen does absolutely nothing for your skin. I’ve done extensive research on collagen and vegan collagen does nothing for the body or the skin. It’s a fad product
