Absolutely love this product. I’ve used it twice today after receiving and my lips are 100% better. I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews. The product is perfect if you have chapped lips and looking for hydration. I can never seem to keep enough lip balm to get rid of the peeling. This product makes my lips (I have injections) look so much healthier instantly. I followed another persons review and used a thick balm to put on over and I love it. Some of the reviews say there lips didn’t look fuller after using.. honestly there’s nothing you can buy to make your lips look fuller.. you need injections. But if you have chapped lips you can’t seem to get rid of this product does the trick! Chapped lips meet HYDRATION!
