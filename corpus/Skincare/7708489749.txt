I received this full sized product as a result of a promotion from Influenster. After using this for several weeks, I haven’t had any breakouts, but other than that no noticeable change that I’ve seen. I only used it once instead of the recommended twice daily use because my skin is sensitive to retinol, maybe that’s the reason. I love the moisturizing properties of it, and when makeup is applied overtop, there’s no resulting greasiness. The packing is luxe, but the only issue I have is that the dropper inside is flimsy and not secured well. Overall, the product is good quality, spreads easily and does not pill, thankfully. One issue is the price, it’s expensive for what you receive… that being said I will be purchasing from this brand in the future. Thoughts
