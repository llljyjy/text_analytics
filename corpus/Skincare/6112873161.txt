Still searching for my go-to eye cream, but this one is in my top three. I especially liked that it absorbs wonderfully for daytime, keeping my eye area moisturized without making my combo skin oily or greasy. Using it at night does make my undereye area look more smooth and rested in the morning, not as puffy or discolored. Does not clog pores. I would repurchase this and definitely recommend trying it, especially for summer and daytime use. Lightweight effective moisturizer
