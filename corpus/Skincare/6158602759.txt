This is an amazing product. It gives me a fresh dewey look. It goes on great with a foundation brush and it’s not incredible difficult to reapply and blend. I have the matte finish too and that has a slight white tint to it after applying. This goes perfect over my skin tone and I’ve applied it to my friend’s with no drastic change to face tone. start protecting you skin!
