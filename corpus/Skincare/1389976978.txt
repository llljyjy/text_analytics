I used this moisturizer happily for about 2 months. I loved how plump and soft it made my skin feel. Great under makeup and not too heavy. However, once I started retinoids this began to burn my skin. I don’t see any fragrance listed in the ingredients, but there definitely is a slightly “botanical” scent. I think it’s a good inexpensive option but just beware if you have sensitive skin or are on retinoids. Good moisturizer, bad for my sensitized skin
