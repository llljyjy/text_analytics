The reason why I don’t give it 5 stars because it’s a little TOO hydrating. When I use the product in the morning, it feels like the area is wet for hours on end. That’s bad if you like to put on make up because it doesn’t let it sit well on the area. Other than that, it helped with my bags and brightened the area. The texture is unbelievably smooth Terrible if you like to wear make up
