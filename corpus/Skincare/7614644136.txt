Honestly wanted to give this a 5 star but could not simply due to the product packaging and how much gets left inside. So first of all, I have been using this since last year along with most of the other products in this line and I love it. It keeps my acne managed and my face looks healthy. The reviews that mention the unappealing odour are true, but based on the quality of the product and the ingredients I would rather have the smell of a mouldy towel and know that I’m using 100% ingredients and not perfume. Peace out is my go to skincare for mostly everything now but I have 1 issue I want to bring to their attention. The product waste and packaging. All of their products in a pump form empty quickly forcing you to replenish after about a month or so. While the pump no longer dispenses, you can screw the whole thing open and smash the bottle into your hand getting ALOT more product from it. I wish the company would maybe switch to a container or squeeze tube because as a consumer I don’t want to feel like I’m not getting all of what I paid for. fabulous product, packaging needs some work
