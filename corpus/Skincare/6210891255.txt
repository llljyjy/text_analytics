This product left my skin feeling hydrated and glowy. And even though it says exfoliating, it is not rough on the skin. The consistency is very watery, and I have yet to master a technique to apply this without wasting some product. Otherwise, very good! I received this product complimentary from Influenster to try and review :) Good serum :)
