I received this product as a free sample and will have to say I probably would not have thought about buying it due to the price. I will say after having used it for 3 weeks it is true you get what you pay for. The serum is very soft and left my skin feeling very moisturized. After 3 weeks I can tell that my skin is softer and can even see it helping some of my fine lines. I only gave it 4 stars because I would have really liked to have seen some of my dark spots at least lighten up by now, but with continued use that may happen. Only time will tell. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family. The packaging is nice and so far the product has lasted quite a while. I would consider purchasing the product myself in the future. It has definitely helped my skin feel and look better in just 3 weeks.I have just gotten into my 40â€™s and skincare has become very important to me. I will say I was impressed with the product.
