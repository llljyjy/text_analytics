This product is truly magical. It offers a thick but blend-able product that lightens the under eye and does not burn. This product has fabulous packaging, but it is a bit bulky. I decided not to give this product five stars because of the hefty price tag; however, this product does has retinol and offer additional benefits later on. Iâ€™ve used this product for several evenings now and I look forward to seeing how I improve in a month or so. nan
