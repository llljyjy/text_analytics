I’m more of a body wash and foam type of girl so when I received this cleansing bar I was interested in giving it a try. I can say that it smells nice and the lather you get from this is good and really leaves your skin smooth as you’re washing your face. Unfortunately, the smell doesn’t linger after washing it off (I love to smell my face care products on me after using them). I always immediately moisturize after cleansing (and toning) - my face didn’t feel stripped of any moisture and my pores felt clean as well. I’m not big on bars because I feel like they harbor bacteria (just my personal opinion) and they dry out (which freaks me out) but I think this would be great for travel as you wouldn’t need to worry about any products spilling. Also, it’s really cute so a cute clear circle acrylic dish is the way to go for display. I rarely use beauty bars
