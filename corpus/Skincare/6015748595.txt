I took this with me everywhere when I was vacationing in Hawaii. Itâ€™s the perfect size that fit in my purse without being bulky and annoying. A little goes a long way! This product did a great job and retouching my makeup without looking super layered and cakey. Love that it was easy to use just about anywhere for a quick spf refresh while running around in the sun. With that said, it definitely does the job and protected me from getting any sunburn on my face as I reapplied. Does the job!
