I have combination skin and this serum has been amazing! I have not received any breakouts, or skin irritations. It’s not sticky either. It’s made my skin so soft, hydrated and I’ve even got a bit of brightness coming back to my skin. I use as part of my morning skincare routine. I highly recommend checking out this serum for yourself. Amazing!
