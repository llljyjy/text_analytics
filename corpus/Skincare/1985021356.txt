I have been using this spray for about a year now and it is by far the best facial spray on the market. I’ve struggled with acne and dry, sensitive skin for the majority of my life. Now at 26, my skin has never been clearer and I attribute a lot of that to this spray. I went away for a weekend with friends and didn’t pack this because of space, instantly regretted it. As soon as I got back home and reintroduced it into my skin care, my breakouts and dry patches from the weekend cleared up. Can’t say enough good things about this brand, JUST DO IT! if you’re considering it, just do it!
