I LOVE this product!! I layer it on top of Adapolene at night. I have KP on my cheeks, so this is like the only thing I can layer with retinoids that helps! One thing to mention: It goes on like a cream but quickly dries into a powder, so you have to move quick. I would recommend using at night when you don’t have to layer a lot on top of it. I haven’t tried, but I’d imagine it could pill under makeup, etc. Game-changer for facial KP
