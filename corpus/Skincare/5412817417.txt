I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder in return for my honest review. Firstly, the tiny bottle that I received was nowhere near enough to formulate a full review, as I only had enough product for 1-2 uses. My first impression was that this product has a strong smell that I am not a fan of. Though I did appreciate the fact that it did not leave any residue on my skin and dried nicely. Again, I did not receive enough product for a full review, so I can only add in my initial impression of the product instead of the actual benefits. I selected “no“ as a recommendation because I don’t know whether or not i’d actually recommend an item I used once. I recommend trying it for yourself. It's alright
