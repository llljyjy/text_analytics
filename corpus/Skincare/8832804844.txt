If I could rate this a zero I would. This is labeled as one ounce of product so I was really confused on why it only lasted a week. I cut it open and realized the outside packaging is covering a white bottle that is completely hallow. There is a centimeter at the top where the product was stored. This is outrageous. A brand that is promoted as “clean” uses unnecessary amounts of plastic. For $50 I was expecting an actual ounce not a waste of plastic. Very disappointed. Please don’t waste your money.
