Honestly ladies this was a miss for me. If you are looking for a “gradual” tan that works immediately this is for you! I barely felt hydrated after applying and the colour was too intense after a couple uses. I’d end up being able to blatantly see spots I missed which I’d expect with a mousse or gel. So if you purchase make sure you apply extremely evenly and wear a mit as the colour is noticeable on the palms of your hands almost immediately. I personally will stick to Jergens for gradual tan and st tropez when I want an overnight glow. :) She worked a little *too* well
