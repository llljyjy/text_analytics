After using this product for the past few weeks I have noticed a difference in my very noticeable black heads on my nose.The overall consistency of this product is more creamy and smooth sort of like melted ice cream. The product itself had no smell to it which is always a plus! Although the product says to do a swipe motion I may have massaged the product in slightly. You do not want to be so aggressive with it bcus it may leave slight redness and irritation but enough pressure to get into those pores and clean it out. I am highly satisfied with this product and I would recommend to someone who was textured skin. below are the before and after pictures. absolutely love this!
