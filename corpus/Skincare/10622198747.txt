I am a certified Cosmetologist and have been for about 20 years. Estee Lauder was #1 back then and the fact that this eye gel cream is out of stock while I’m writing this review shows you nothing has changed. I love the way this eye cream glides on my skin. Your skin immediately drinks it in and you can feel the moisturization! I don’t have any major skin issues, but I am using to prevent any future skin issues. Estee Lauder is simply the truth! Grab it now! (Well when it’s back in stock! Lol) Estee Lauder Is The Truth!
