I was excited to get this as I’m a big fan of IT cosmetics. Being a new and improved formula I had high hopes. I love the original but found this version to be too tacky. I don’t mind a heavy cream but the tackiness took away from the luxurious consistency. Also I found the scent to be a bit too old lady. I’m pleasantly surprised it didn’t pill though. good but not great
