This is the first time I have chance to try Beauty Balm BB cream from Dr. Jart+ . It’s lightweight and easy to spread out. I think you should use just pea size pump foreach side face. Its coverage is good enough for blackheads and redness on my cheeks. I love the dewy and natural finish. My shade is light-medium medium. It’s a little darker than my skin tone. Next time I should try lighter shade. I love the Dewy and natural finish.
