This is a good vitamin C serum, but the pump is absolutely horrible. The product will shoot out as youâ€™re trying to dispense some onto your finger. This results in wasting product, which I hate. I do love the smell of the serum, and I have noticed some of my sun spots have faded since I started using this. I can apply makeup over it and it will sit nicely, which is a bonus since other brand I previously tried would pill like crazy.If I see much more improvement I may repurchase, but otherwise, I may just go with another vit C next time. Nice serum, terrible pump
