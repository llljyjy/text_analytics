This truly made such a difference in my skin. I use it nightly with my prescription retinol and have noticed an improvement in the hydration, texture, and brightness of my skin. I have gotten several compliments on my skin recently and I think it is because of this serum. My only qualm is the scent as I prefer unscented skincare products! Wow!
