I hadn’t heard of Tula before so I was hesitant to put this one. I looked it up on EWG and it had great, clean ratings! So I tried it out with more confidence. The consistency is weird at first. Almost like there are little beads in there that dissolve immediately upon application. It leaves a shimmer on your skin. Lightweight but can be a bit oily, hence the docked star. No skin irritation so that’s a plus. Could keep this in my skincare lineup
