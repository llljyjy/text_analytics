I’ve recently started using a lineup of The Ordinary products and am enjoying them so far. Despite that, I did not have high hopes for this eye serum. I was mainly looking for a dark circle remedy and thought I’d give this a try on a whim even though it’s classified as a “depuffing” serum. Boy did it prove me wrong! Immediately after use I noticed my dark circles were less visible and my eye area was slightly brighter. In only a weeks time, the results have been even more significant. The dark circles that were once very purple toned in colour are now very faded and hardly even noticeable and my entire eye area is more even and brighter. I will continue to use this product and have already recommended it to people I know. For the price, you cannot go wrong! I have only deducted a star because I cannot speak to how it works as a depuffing serum. Happily surprised
