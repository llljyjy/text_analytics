I really did want to love this product but unfortunately it was just not good for my combo skin. It did have some pro’s which is why I gave it 3 stars! Overall the oil itself felt really good on my skin. It sunk in super well and instantly made my skin feel super smooth and moisturized without leaving me super shiny (note: I only used this at night). I loved the packaging it came in, the syringe was easy to use and I didn’t experience any issues with it like I have with some other products with this type of packaging. It also didn’t have too much of a scent which I liked as I tend to breakout more often with heavily scented products. As I said I really wanted this product to work but after using it for a few weeks I started to breakout and my pores seemed super clogged compared to before I was using this serum. I tried to decrease the frequency of how often I used it, but it still seemed to disagree with my skin, which is probably the only reason why I had to say no to this one. I ended up giving it to my friend who has dry and less sensitive skin than me and she loved it. She experienced no breakouts and her skin felt more moisturized, less textured and brighter! For the right skin I think this product would be great, just didn’t work out for me unfortunately. Swing and an unfortunate miss!
