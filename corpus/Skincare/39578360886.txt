Tbh love these misters all around. The peach/neroli scent is delicate and light, a nice medium for HABIT. Would give 5 stars for the product alone, have docked a star because I would prefer to refill my misters rather than getting a whole new bottle every month (not very eco friendly). 10/10 would recommend the product though! My favorite sunscreen to date. Lovely!!!
