First off, I love the packaging. The twist top is nice for travel, no caps getting lost and less likely to accidentally leak. The pump disperses the perfect amount. My face was noticeably smoother after the first use. I use a lot of skincare products, but this is one of the smoothest results I’ve had. It will take some time to see more results, but I feel pretty confident I’ll be happy with this after several weeks of usage. I will consider adding this as a staple to my routine. Super smooth skin
