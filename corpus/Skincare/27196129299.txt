I received this product from Influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review.Normally my skin is mixed and that makes it a bit difficult for me to take care of it, I had acne breakouts very often and I already felt bad because I didn’t know what was happening to my face and I realized that I wasn’t hydrating it properly, but I started with this cream without much faith and I have seen a very good change. I still have outbreaks but they are not so often anymore. My skin always feels soft, it is no longer scratchy or hard like before. I really recommend it because a little bit is enough for the whole face and it absorbs quickly. Amazing product
