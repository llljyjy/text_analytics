This has been my go-to SPF for years. I adore Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion and use it both AM and PM, and I use this Invisiblur product on top of it in the AM. I love how smoothly it goes on, and how it takes some of the shine off my face so that I typically don’t wear any other makeup or powder. It’s absolutely perfect for my oily, acne-prone, aging skin. nan
