I have dry sensitive skin but wanted to exfoliate so picked this up. Unfortunately it hasnâ€™t done much for me so I went with the good molecules exfoliating treatment which has glycolic salicylic acid and lactic acid which is so good. I would recommend this only if you have severely sensitive skin. I will say I only used this 1-2x per week nan
