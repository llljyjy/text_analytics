I love this product! At first I didn’t notice I was tanner, because once you use your foundation it’s hard to see. But tan or no tan my skin looked different. I had a couple different people comment that I looked “so pretty today”. At first I though the person was being polite, but an hour later someone else said the same thing. It gives a golden glow and evens out skin tone. Love it! Sun-kissed Glow!
