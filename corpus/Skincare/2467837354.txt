I am obsessed with this product!!! It is absolutely one of the best balms I have ever used, and the packaging just puts it over the top for me… it lasts a long time, the little applicator is awesome so I don’t have to put my finger in the bowl - especially when it gets low.  The price to me is worth it as it does last a long time and works great!  The smell is pleasant and there is no real “flavor” which I was looking for.  I use this during the day and the lip sleep mask at night and my lips have never been better! Favorite Lip Balm
