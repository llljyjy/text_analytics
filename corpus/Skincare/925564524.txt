I was so excited to get this Charlotte Tilbury eye cream for free to try out and to be able to give my honest opinion. I love her products but rarely splurge on them so have been happily using this daily for several weeks. I did have a little sensitivity in my eyes the first few times I used it but not on my skin and not every time. It is very light weight and all you need it a little dab so the container will last a really long time. It is not as smooth, creamy or moisturizing feeling as some eye creams I’ve tried and doesn’t sink into your skin as easily either. I haven’t noticed any results at all from this. It had no affect on my darkness under eyes or my fine lines and doesn’t really make them feel any different than the L’Oréal eye cream is been using prior. For me it seems like the hype is in the name and not the results so even though it is nice and I will continue using it, I wouldn’t splurge on this and would rather buy her makeup products that do work. I was just going it felt more luxurious and that it had some benefit to using it but maybe I need to give it more time since I know these kinds of products can take a while to show results, so I will continue to use it but there are definitely other eye creams I enjoy more. It’s nice but was hoping for it to be better
