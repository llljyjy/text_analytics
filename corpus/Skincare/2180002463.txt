I am always skeptical of skincare products that seem to overpromise what they can do. However, Lancome’s Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream does everything I had hoped it would do. After using this eye cream for about one week, I can literally see a difference in the fine lines and crow’s feet around my eyes. They are less noticeable; it’s almost as if they have been smoothed and softened. This eye cream absorbs very quickly, doesn’t sting or feel uncomfortable like some eye creams I have used in the past. My under-eye area is sensitive, and I have had no issues with it whatsoever. The cream itself is light, and the texture is smooth. My eye area seems firmer, and looks hydrated; these are two areas that I always have issues with when using an eye cream because they never seem to work, but this one does.I would not hesitate to buy this cream and I certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a really great eye cream that makes your eye area more youthful-looking. Defo a confidence booster for me! Hydrating & Firming!
