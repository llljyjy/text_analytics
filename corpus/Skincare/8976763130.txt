Living in Florida where the sun is always out 😁  I often forget to apply sunblock meaning, I have an area where my skin/face that gets very dry and tight, then the pealing begins ( this is on my nose) when I receive this I was a little skeptical, but it came just in time because my nose was feeling tight and ready for it’s next peel session. Well after one full use ( a morning & nighttime Application) I honestly could feel that the skin on my nose was not as tight and after 2 more days my face felt softer and moisturized I didn’t have any breakouts and what I liked the most was when I sweat it didn’t run into my eyes like other moisturizers have done. Will definitely purchase
