I use this as a top layer of my moisturizing routine.  Its a thick cream that somehow feels like water when it’s applied.  You need just the tiniest bit. It feels gentle. I appreciate the added spf and satin sheen it leaves.  I’m curious how long this will last because it’s been a month of daily use and I can barely tell its been opened.  Don’t get it too close to your eyes if you have sensitive eyes! Perfect Topper
