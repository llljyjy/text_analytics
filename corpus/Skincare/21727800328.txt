If your doing a whole look don’t just apply it before with not mixing it into something. I used most of it the wrong way and didn’t see much. But mix it into a product to light for you and it should be good. Might wanna add a color correcting thing to cuz if the undertones for it aswell. I would not buy again. Too much money. Check my tik tok @sarahgamiz you will see over hyped. will not buy again
