This is a good basic gel moisturizer.  It does what it says, moisturizes and hydrates your face. As far as the cost goes, is it better than other lower priced gel moisturizers? Not really . You could get something comparable elsewhere for lower cost and possibly vegan and cruelty free. Would I buy it myself? Probably not, but it is a good option for those looking to get a good hydration gel moisturizer. nan
