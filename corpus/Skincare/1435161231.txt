I am a ride or die for the YTTP airwhip moisturizer cream but i was very pleasantly surprised with this product. it is thick (thicker than the airwhip moisturizer) but also light & feels super high end. I love that there is no fragrance as well. My skin felt super soft & stayed that way all day. I highly recommend. YTTP has done it again!
