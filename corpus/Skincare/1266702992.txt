This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee after expressing a concern for redness and sensitivity on my face. I definitely LOVED this product; my face had been very red after using some peeling products and what a difference this made in calming my skin. For me, the scent is very light and clean so no problems there. I apply a think layer on my face right after my serum and eye cream and that is it. It is great for everyday use and my skin has been loving it. Would definitely recommend. GREAT FOR POST PEELING
