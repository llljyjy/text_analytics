As I looked through the reviews, I noticed that some people seem to have received material compensation in exchange of giving this product a good review... Others, who seem to be more honest, were saying how this moisturizer made them break out or was super sticky and non-hydrating. For myself, the first time I applied it, I noticed little breakouts on my forehead and on my chin. I used to break out a lot in the past, but now, I rarely do, so I was really disappointed. I really wanted to love this product, but it didn’t do anything for me,  except cause me pimples here & there... :(  I’m gonna stick to my Ultra Repair Moisturizer from FAB. Saddly, it's a no from me.
