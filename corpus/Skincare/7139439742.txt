I’ve been a fan of st tropez for years so I was excited to try this product! I’ve tried other similar tanning drops and love that it’s clear and can be applied with my other serums and moisturizers to get a good, even blend. I like to leave it on overnight to develop and wash my face in the morning and I looked like I went somewhere tropical overnight! Lol it really develops into a deep tan, so I’m loving this product! And the smell is great! It’s light but yummy Loving this! St tropez with another winner!
