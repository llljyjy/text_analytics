I got this set thinking I would love it because if the blue Hyaluronic but it was just okay. Maybe it’s because the cream left my skin needing more hydration. I loved the essence that came with it and the serum was wonderful. If  too. I think if your normal/combination skin it’s great but if your dry I wanted to love it
