Vitamin C products are a must have in my skincare routine as all the sun and pollution takes a toll on the skin. This product is fragrance free, which is nice although I do like lightly scented products. Overall, itâ€™s lightweight, absorbs fast, and does a great job at rejuvenating the skin. I use it in the am and have a retinol routine for night. nan
