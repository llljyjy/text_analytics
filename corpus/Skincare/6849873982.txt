This is a gentle yet effective exfoliant product. I have oily skin and constantly need to exfoliate, but it’s hard to balance between skin barrier protection and exfoliate uses, cuz a lot of products tend to be too strong, and this one works pretty well! It’s very gentle and doesn’t have any strong smells. Thanks to the complimentary from Dermalogica, I can exfoliate my skin on a daily basis. nan
