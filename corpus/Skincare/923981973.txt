Iâ€™m 67 years old with good skin and few wrinkles. I have been using this product for two months on my forehead wrinkles and have found them to be less noticeable. I have not experienced any adverse reaction to the retinol. My advice:  start using this product while you are young! Peace Out Retinol Face Stick is Terrific!
