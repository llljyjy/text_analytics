I really liked Lancome Renergie HCF Triple Serum and received it as a sample from Influenster. The consistency of the serum is somewhat thicker than other serums. It absorbs quickly, feels weightless on and not greasy. It smelled extremely well. This serum leaves my skin moisturized, soft and glowing. I would definitely recommend this product. Great Serum!
