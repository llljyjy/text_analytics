I received a sample size of this serum for my honest review. I used this drum at night after cleansing and before my eye cream and night cream. I’m no stranger to serums so I compared it to others I had previously used. I liked that it was not watery and had a thicker texture and that it absorbed quickly. There wasn’t any strong smell or weird feeling after applying it. I can’t say for sure if it will help with my wrinkles as it’s too soon but so far, it’s a good serum. #freeproduct A good serum
