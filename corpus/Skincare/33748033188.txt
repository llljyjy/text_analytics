I was actually hesitant about trying a new facial cream, but I’ve been needing a face cream that would moisture my skin. I’ve used body lotions, but my face is very sensitive to lotions. I tried this cream and I was surprised how well my face enjoyed it. It was gentle, had no strong perfume smell, and absorbed in my skin without any nasty residue.Would I buy again? Definitely!
