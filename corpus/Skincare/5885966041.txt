Really bummed this didn’t work for my very dry very sensitive skin. I started using this with the skin fix foaming oil cleanser and my face has never felt more stripped. This burned and made my face red the first time I put it on. Got slightly better over the month of use but didn’t hydrate me at all unfortunately. My skin also became so much drier that I’ve started breaking out more. Packaging is really great though love the pump. Very dry skin beware
