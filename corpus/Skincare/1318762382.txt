I tried this sunscreen both under makeup and on its own. Compared to other sunscreens I enjoy (both mineral and chemical) this did not hold up well under makeup. However, on its own it was just fine. It feels nice on the skin, and I love that it has a pump. It also held up well while swimming. You do have to really work this into the skin to not have a white cast, though, and I am fairly pale. I found it best to really rub it in and then wait about 10 minutes. I did not experience any pilling. Overall, I’d skip this if you plan to wear makeup, but if not, give it a go, especially if you have sensitive skin. Good, but not great…
