The Clarins double serum absorbs quickly and gives my skin a nice glow and doesn’t leave an oily or sticky residue to my face or neck area. It didn’t cause any breakouts. My skin feels so hydrated and smooth after each use. It has a nice pleasant scent to the serum too. I apply this serum in the morning and before bed. I noticed a improving effect to my neck and face. I’m glad I recieved this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. The anti-aging wonder
