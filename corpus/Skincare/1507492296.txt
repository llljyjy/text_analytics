I have to say, I really wanted to hate this. I wanted to join all the skincare communities and say, “this is over priced and isn’t any better than Nivea or Cera Ve”, but that just ISN’T TRUE.I’ve used Nivea, it does NOT moisturize my desert dry skin anywhere close to this cream. Of course, I still have to do my skincare routine, but my usual night time moisturizer wasn’t cutting it this winter in Toronto, and I used my Rouge Reward on this and have zero regrets.The best part is you need so little! I only use 1/8 of a my finger nail amount and it covers my whole face and neck! I mix in The Ordinary’s a 1/4 spoon niacinamide powder for an extra boost which works out great for me! NEW CONVERT!
