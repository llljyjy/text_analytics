I typical have oily acne prone skin and I can say I really love the way Inkey’s Omega Water Cream Moisturizer feels on my skin. It absorbs pretty well, its lightweight and definitely doesn’t clog my pores or cause my skin to breakout. My skin also feels just the right amount of hydration and the product itself is not too thick or thin so great for the am and pm routines. Another thing I enjoyed about this moisturizer is it doesn’t pill under my other skincare products or makeup. Definitely would recommend to others! Great Moisture for All Skin Types
