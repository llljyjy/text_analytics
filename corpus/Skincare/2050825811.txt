When I initially received this as a single-use sample, I fell in love. Most exfoliators are too soft and this once I could feel the scrub/exfoliators. When I bought the full-sized bottle, WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. Itâ€™s basically thick milk. Zero exfoliation. I would have done a return except I threw out the box it came in. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU LOVED THE SAMPLE. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU LOVED THE SAMPLE
