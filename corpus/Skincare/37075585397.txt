The Dior Off/On Foaming Cleanser is a surprisingly relaxing product. I use this product in the shower. I wash my face with a small amount of this cleanser with my hands. The smell is wonderful! It isnâ€™t too strong or too weak. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because it states that the moisturizer will last for six hours and that was not my experience. I will definitely buy this product again. Relaxing Face Cleanser
