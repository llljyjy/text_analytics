I received this product from BzzAgent for review and man was I so excited to be part of the campaign! My first impression was the trio was that the packaging was super cute, with the pastel colours, the forms, and the cute reusable zip bag.I’ve used all three products now and have been quite enjoying them. I like the main ingredients I’m each product and have noticed that each has a very subtle and lovely scent. The citrus clean balm and makeup melt works really well and is effective, although I would still double cleanse. The citrus C daily moisturizer is great for morning use but I find it weird that it can be used as an overnight mask. I limited my use to only in the morning. And the lemon aid detox and flow micro-peel is very fun to use! Overall a very fun and more-affordable-than-I-expected skincare trio! Super fun skincare set!
