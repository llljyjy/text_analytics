The packaging for this product is very cute and small. As for the lip oil itself, it does have a slight smell of cherry that isnâ€™t too strong. It is a little thick which makes it feel like a lip gloss but it is probably why it lasts so long. My lips do feel really moisturized after it dries so I would recommend it to people who have dry lips. cute & works well
