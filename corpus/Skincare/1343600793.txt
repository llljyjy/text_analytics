I’ve actually been using Moisture Surge on and off throughout many years and I always go back to it. It’s one of my favorite moisturizers and I’ve reintroduced it into my routine for the last two winters since it’s one of a few moisturizers that actually keep my skin from drying out. It’s also light enough for year round use and that’s why it’s a bit surprising it actually works for me in the winter. I have combo/normal skin most of the time and in winter it is dry the past 2-3 years and it has been working great. Great all around moisturizer even in winter
