i was looking for something new with spf and came across this it’s perfect it’s glossy like gloss but has staying power like lip balm it does well under the mask which was my concern I haven’t experienced any of that white build up also I doesn’t have a chemical scent to me and my product came full also the applicator is god sent I love the way it hugs the lips overall worth the money and good product LOVE
