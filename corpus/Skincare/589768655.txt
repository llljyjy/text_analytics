I was lucky enough to be gifted this by Guerlain & Influenster. This serum literally feels expensive lol First off, it smells delicious. But it actually works too! I’m 40 with crows feet & some texture, a lot more redness than I’d like. I have been using this faithfully now for about 2 weeks & I really see improvement. Smoother, less red, more glowy. Very nice product Worth the price
