I received this product free from Influenster and Clinique for my honest review. So this pot is little so I’m not sure about it’s wrinkle prevention yet, but it is very hydrating and easy to apply. This means a little goes a long way. Other competitors are less hydrating and even feel drying on the skin. My face stayed hydrated feeling all day. Aging skin needs more moisture. If I had to choose I would recommend this product over the others I have tried. The smell was a little off putting but not as strong as others. It went away quickly. I wish I had a larger sample to see if wrinkles were decreased but I have no other complaints. Hydrating
