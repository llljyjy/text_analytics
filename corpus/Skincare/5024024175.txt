This isn’t for me. At all. Supergoop’s daily dose vitamin c sunscreen is much heavier than your average serum, though not as heavy as a thick cream or pure oil. I bought this in hope I could get some for my mother, who hates skincare and would love an all-in-one product. But it feels like pure oil on my skin. When I wear it, I skip moisturizer all together. Despite this, it feels so heavy and boreline sticky on my skin. I hate it so much. I’ll be sticking with my og vitamins c serum and Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen. It’s the only way to go. yeah naw
