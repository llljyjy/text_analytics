This moisturizer pulls no punches with its peptides and ceramides! Love how buttery soft it makes my skin feel without any oiliness or shine. I have acne-prone, oily, scar-prone skin and this product is perfect for my morning routine. As a bonus, the packaging is beautiful and looks great on my bathroom countertop or on my nightstand. Love the light scent and itâ€™s a reasonable price point given the product size. nan
