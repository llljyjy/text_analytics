while the product itself is nice, not greasy or hard to rub in it does leave a noticeable white cast. I have medium brown skin so I look several shades lighter on my face and neck. I don’t usually wear makeup but with how it applies I would think it would wear well under makeup. not worth returning since the only issue is the white cast( I prefer mineral sunscreen so it’s to be expected from most spf I’ve tried). nan
