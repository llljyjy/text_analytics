I received this product as a free sample in exchange for an honest review. I’m super picky about moisturizers but this product impressed me a ton. It has a unique consistency. Not thick but also not thin and almost spreads like a gel. I have fairly dry skin and this surprisingly left my skin moisturized for a long time. There wasn’t a scent which is nice if you’re scent sensitive at all. A little of this product goes a long way!! Cut what you’d normally use in half at least! This moisturizer has the added bonus of playing nice under makeup which is not always the case with skin care. Overall really great product that I plan to purchase and would recommend. Impressive!
