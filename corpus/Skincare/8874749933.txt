POWERFULLY effective. This serum is legitimately effective. Three key ingredients to consider are the fermented roselle extract, reishi mushroom and iris root extract; between those three you’re getting an abundance of natural hydration, moisture retention, brightening, and antioxidants. I noticed a difference in the suppleness of my skin immediately, and within a week or so my skin looked brighter. I knocked off a star for the fragrance; whether natural or not my skin is super reactive and my cheeks become very red when I use a product with fragrance, so I did unfortunately experience some noticeable redness. Despite that, I’d consider buying this again! AMAZING Antioxidant Rich and Hydrating Serum
