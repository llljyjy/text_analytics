I tried this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox . I have used this Radian-C brightening treatment for about a week now. I have combination skin, an uneven skin tone and usually redness on my face. So far I have seen some improvement with the texture of my skin and hydration. I love how it has Vitamin C EAE as a key ingredient. The product smells great and after applying in the morning and evening, my skin feels softer and more radiant  already. Iâ€™m looking forward to using this everyday! Skin improvement
