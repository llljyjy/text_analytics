So I’m not completely sold on eye creams, but this is one of the best ones I have tried. I typically find that eye creams leave my eyes feeling foggy, and can lead to my eye skin feeling dryer, but I experienced neither of these things with this product. Aside from Génifique eye cream, I have never stuck with an eye cream product for very long.I tried this product daily for approx 2 weeks before leaving this review. It leaves the eye area feeling hydrated. It has no noticeable odor, and it goes on smoothly with no eye watering or stinging. All in all, this is a solid eye cream. This is one I may purchase in the future. If you are in the market for a nice, hydrating, affordable eye cream, this is for you. I recieved this item from Ole Henriksen and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
