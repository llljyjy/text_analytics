I have sensitive and acne prone skin and Iâ€™m always hesitant to use a new sunscreen. I tried this one first because I liked the smell and consistency but after 3 days it broke me out. I was very disappointed because I think this would be a great primer because it applied easily without a white cast. It broke me out!
