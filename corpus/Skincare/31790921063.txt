After doing research on Azelaic Acid and it’s benefits I decided to give it a try. I initially started using as apart of my morning routine. After I put it on my skin was itchy then very dry. I thought I probably used too much.  So the next few days I used half of the amount I initially used. On day 4 before applying the lotion I noticed small bumps appearing. I stopped using it for a week and the bumps are gone. I will say it did even my skin texture which is one of the benefits. But I’m not willing to breakout or have itchy skin just for even textured skin. I have sensitive combination skin so I should’ve did a patch test. Patch Test First
