I really enjoyed this product. It feels very light on and moisturizing. My skin feels hydrated without leaving an oily residue. I love the smell. I found that I had to use a lot more product to fully cover face and neck than other products I used in the past. Also I really wish this product had some sort of spf protection. My current moisturizer has SPF protection so I am finding that now I have to use two products to get the same effect of my previous one. Good product
