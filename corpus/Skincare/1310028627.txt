I purchased this product a few months ago and I just bought my second tube.  I really like how simple it is to get multiple important skincare treatments together in one (namely vitamin C and retinoids).  I have fairly sensitive skin, but I’ve built up to use between .5 and 1% retinol for a few years, as well as sometimes 15% vitamin C.  So this has simplified my routine without any irritation. I’m 51 and fighting fine lines.  This has been very effective in maintaining my skin and minimizing signs of aging (lines and dark spots).If you’ve not used retinol before, I can imagine this causing mild reaction, so start slowly.  It is granactive retinoid, so it’s less irritating than a pure retinol, but still a good concentration that is effective for anti aging.  Someone commented about feeling “moisturized“--this is not a moisturizer, it is a treatment that should be applied after cleansing and drying the face.  Let it soak in a few minutes, then follow up with a moisturizer. Great multi-benefit treatment by PTR!
