This is alright. Just alright. Nothing to write home about. Melts makeup off for the most part but definitely will see some makeup after I wash my face and I don’t wear heavy makeup. Also smells kind of weird but I’m not sensitive to smells so doesn’t affect me. Wouldn’t repurchase, the belief one is better or the farmacy one will do. Even ponds cold cream would work better. Meh
