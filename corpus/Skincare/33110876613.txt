I live in a pretty dry climate, and the lightweight hydration that Cloud Cushion’s provided has been incredible. It’s truly unlike any moisturizer I’ve ever used — in the best way. It has body and fullness, but never feels heavy on the face. And the texture is so smooth, airy and pillowy that you can truly apply day, afternoon, night, whenever. I’m obsessed! Pillowy perfection!
