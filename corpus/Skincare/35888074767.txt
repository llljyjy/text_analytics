Love this product and so does my husband! He tried it because his face gets chapped and red from working outside. It actually helped by about 60%! I love it cuz it’s lightweight and smells so yummy! After applying makeup, it doesn’t leave streaks like other moisturizers cause. i would definitely use this! love it and so does my husband! LOL
