I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my review. I’ve been using this Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream daily, morning and night on my eyes and lip contours. It’s a luxurious creamy smooth texture. I noticed quickly the metal applicator tip which, I really enjoyed and it helped with the lovely cooling sensation and helped provide a nice massage around my eyes that felt relaxing & soothing, and helped to depuff my eyes naturally. The hyaluronic acid really helped to give my skin the hydration it needs and to help plump my skin. The cream absorbs nicely and quickly into my skin and doesn’t leave any unwanted sticky or oily residues. I also noticed it doesn’t have any scent to irritate my skin. Overall, the cream really helps to conceal & brighten the contours of my eyes nicely and make my dark eye circles instantly brighter, which look amazing! This product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. I also like how I’m able to remove the metal applicator tip when it needs to be cleaned. My only critique would be this product contains mica in it to brighten under eyes & I would prefer a product that does not have that ingredient and just lightens and depuffs naturally versus a cover up. Nice Unique Applicator Design!
