Very good at correcting red! It’s good if you’re going to add makeup overtop to match the colour, or for spot treatment. LOVE that it’s SPF.  Not giving this 5 stars because product is a little too yellow for my skin tone and because for sanitary/anti-bacterial reasons it should come in a tube. Neutralizes Reds
