I’m so happy I found this product! Previously, I had only used all over tanning mouse and wasn’t sure if I would enjoy the tanning drops. Oh my goodness — I wish I had found these sooner! The process was so much easier than I expected! My favorite way to apply was to mix a few drops in with my moisturizer. The tan that was provided was a warm and healthy glow — it looks very natural and definitely makes me look more alive and vibrant (especially this cold time of year)! A Winter Must Have!
