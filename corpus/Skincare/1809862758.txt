Was able to snatch this for 30% off during a Sephora sale. Brightens my skin. No irritation. I have to shake well before using or else the product comes out very separated and a lot of oil leaks out, not sure if this is normal. After shaking, the product comes out fine. But because I need to shake it, I noticed a leakage in the back… so 2 stars off for that because for this price point I don’t want to waste any product due to the packaging. Pictured is 1 pump - I apply generously to my face and neck. Could improve on packaging
