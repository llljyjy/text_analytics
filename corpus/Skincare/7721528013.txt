I have tried a lot of physical exfoliants and this one was a lot rougher than others. While my face felt clean after use, it also made my skin feel really dry. As someone with dry skin to begin with, I would not use this on a daily basis. I don’t think it’s suited for dry/sensitive skin but would work for normal or oily skin. nan
