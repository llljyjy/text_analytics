I tried the BelifThe True Cream - Aqua Bomb Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 this week and my main concern was that it go on smoothly and not leave the dreaded white cast. I am happy to report it meets both criteria very well. This is an absolute so I wonâ€™t hesitate to put it on daily before I go out. I would definitely recommend it! I was sent this product for testing purposes! nan
