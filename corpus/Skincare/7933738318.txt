2nd time purchasing this & I love it! I have oily sensitive skin & Iâ€™ve noticed that this has helped me out sooo much when I get hormonal acne or my skin is irritated. My skin recently had a reaction to something and flared up and I used this product for 3 days straight and by the 4th day my skin was completely back to normal and the bumps were all gone! It has definitely made my skin smoother and reduced some of the acne scars I had. I put this on before my moisturizer, since my moisturizer is not water based, and it definitely helps with my face not looking or feeling too oily afterwards. A little goes a really long way so this will last you for a long time. Highly recommend!! Absolutely love this!
