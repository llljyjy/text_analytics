I have horrible, dry, sensitive skin, which makes my skin create bad oil that gives me acne. EVERYTHING makes me break out. I also have folliculitis which makes my hair follicles (on my face! boo!) get really easily infected (think slightly dirty pillowcases or cat fur on your face. Boo!). My skin is just a mess. Anyway, I’m 40 now and have tried SO many things. Dr. prescribed things, expensive things, pure and natural hippie things. This face lotion is one of zero other lotions and potions that does not make me break out or get irritated. I use it as my regular lotion day and night. If I don’t eat dairy or sugar, and nothing touches my face, I can use this, IT CC full coverage correcting cream, and Make Up Forever full cover for my under eyes, and I have PERFECT dewy skin that I actually get complimented on. That’s a huge accomplishment. Gives PERFECT dewy skin that I get compliments on
