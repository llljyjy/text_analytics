*I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review* I actually really enjoyed this product. The scent is refreshing and doesn’t linger too long on the face. I found that my skin looked glowy and healthy, however, I did feel that the product wasn’t as hydrating as I hoped. I am someone with very dry skin and although it did reduce the look of dryness on the face, I could still feel my skin being dry. Therefore, I usually use the product as an extra layer of moisture to the skin, especially if I want to add some Vitamin C to the face! I will continue adding the product to my skincare regimen as it is a great base for makeup and gives off a smooth appearance. Great base for makeup!
