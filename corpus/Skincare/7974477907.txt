i was excited to try this cleansing balm based on the description of the product, price, and some reviews but my skin did NOT like it. i have really good skin that doesnt really react or get irritated but this cleansing balm irritated my skin, my jawline ended up having dryness, and stings my eyes so bad when i try to remove mascara. my skin is so irritated that even when i put on my regular moisturizer, parts of my face stings. aside from that, its also a pain to remove the cleansing balm from your face. i feel like i have to go in twice with another cleanser to remove the residue/film it leaves behind. i wish i couldâ€™ve saved the box it came in so i could return irritated skin
