I am in awe of how incredible this product works for my skin. I’m not one to write reviews but this deserves the hype for sure. This products gives the perfect amount of moisture before makeup application. It’s super watery at first but once you massage it into the skin, you instantly feel how plump and bouncy your skin feels. It sinks into the skin reveals plush moisturized baby cheeks! I use this first and go in with the Glow Recipe Niacinamide drops. My absolutely go to combo right now, so happy I found this product :) Weightless Plump Hydration
