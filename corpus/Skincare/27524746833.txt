I bought the rose wipes to use when I’m out of town so I don’t have to pack my face wash and face cloths. The package says there is “No need to rinse.” 10 minutes later I’m still wondering if this sticky feeling is going to go away on its own. I’m thinking the no rinse claim is not true. It’s hard to feel like it did the job of cleaning my face when it’s still sticky. Next time I will try rinsing the cloth out to use as a regular face cloth at the end.The fragrance is alright. I would prefer no fragrance but I wanted the hydrating wipes. No rinse? Hah.
