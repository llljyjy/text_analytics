I highly recommend this product. I used for an event near a local amusement part. I didnâ€™t put makeup on while using this, as having my face fully protected all day was most important. I reapplied every few hours. The product container is small, and hits well in a Fanny pack without taking up much space! I was in the sun all day. I am fair skin and burn easily. I have to wear long sleeves to protect my body. This sunscreen held up nicely. I have no sunburn from my outing. It makes my skin soft. However, if it rains, this product will burn your eyes. Wonderful product.
