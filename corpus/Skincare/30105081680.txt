I was given the opportunity to try Clarins Double Serum and fell in love. Both the texture and scent were luxurious. The two serums blend easily and yield top notch results. I found my skin to be smoother and had more “glow” to it. Also very well nourished. It’s is a luxurious brand and pricey but after trying I would definitely consider purchasing. Truly remarkable product. nan
