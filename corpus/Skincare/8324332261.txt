I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this cleanser, it hasn’t broken my face out and seems to actually be clearing it up. The consistency is really nice too, it’s not really foamy but it lathers (hard to explain). My face feels clean and refreshed afterwards. I have oily skin and it seems to be helping that. I will continue to keep using this product and will likely purchase when I run out! Great cleanser
