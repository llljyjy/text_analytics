First off it made my skin tingle in the most uncomfortable way and it took a while for that to *kind of* settle, even then it still felt like toned down icy hot on my face. Fragrance being that high up on the ingredient list is worrying- even for someone like me, who isn’t usually bothered by it. I can’t help but feel like the consumer is mostly just paying for jasmine flower extract (expensive ingredient- great in perfume, useless- possibly even irritating here). Heavily and I mean HEAVILY scented product. Random but the scent reminds me of Omnia Green Jade by Bvlgari... Would not recommend. Glorified perfume
