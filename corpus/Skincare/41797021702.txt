I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. This product was hydrating but left my face oily and slightly sticky. The smell also resembled vinegar or something sour. I don’t think it did much for me and didn’t like the residue it left behind, so I wont be using anymore. Does okay
