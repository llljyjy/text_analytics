I loved the Pineapple Vitamin C by Glow Recipe that this product replaced. It made my skin absolutely glow! This serum feels nice, but doesn’t seem to do anything. I used it daily for several weeks, then switched to a different Vitamin C product that worked well. I hate to give any Glow Recipe product a less-than-five-star review, but this didn’t work for me. nan
