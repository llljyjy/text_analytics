This face cream is so luxurious. A teeny tiny bit goes a very long way. It is on the thicker end so if you live somewhere humid, you may want to use for night time only. Makes your skin feel really soft and hydrated, even after one use. I don’t really notice a smell like others are saying- if there is a smell it’s very very subtle. nan
