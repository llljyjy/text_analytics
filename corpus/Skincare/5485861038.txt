I have been a HUGE Kate Somerville fan for years now and  been using this eye cream every night for about a month and I absolutely see a difference! I am 27 so I didnâ€™t have wrinkles around my eyes, more like fine lines that became very prominent with makeup. Since using this firming eye cream I can absolutely see a difference! The fine lines are almost completely gone and are no longer particularly noticeable when I wear makeup during the day.I use the Shiseido wrinkle eye cream during the day and the two make the perfect combo for combatting the fine lines! nan
