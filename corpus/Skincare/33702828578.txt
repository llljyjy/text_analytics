I am happy I gave this product a chance! At first it seemed once a day use was causing some flaking in facial areas outside the T-zone, but I also realized there was salicylic acid in another product I was using so after discontinuing the other, & maybe skipping the exfoliant if my skin felt a little tight after cleansing, for a day here & there, I could really see a huge change in my complexion. In the summer when the humidity kicks in my oily T-zone kicks in as well, & Iâ€™ll bet this product will be wonderful then to keep clogged pores at bay. I really love it. Really works!
