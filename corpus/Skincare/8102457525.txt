This is such a rich balm! I love it! I use it at night during one of my recovery days for my skin cycle routine! It helps my skin feel supple and soft the next day! No scent which I love since I tend to get headaches from scented skincare. If it helps, I have combination skin, so now that we have entered the fall season, this is going to be a staple.
