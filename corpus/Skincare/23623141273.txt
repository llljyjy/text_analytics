Overall, this has been my favorite cleanser to date. I deal with dehydrated skin and I don’t feel like it strips my skin clean like some cleansers. 4 stars because the smell is a little weird, but if you can look past that, the results are awesome. My boyfriend actually started stealing this from me and he loves it way more than any drug store bought face cleanser he’s tried. nan
