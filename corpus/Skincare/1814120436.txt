This was an ok product. It gave a lil extra hydration to my skin but wasn’t anything wow amazing. It didn’t irritate my skin which is why I’m giving it 4 stars bc that’s huge plus for me. I would give it another try find a better moisturizer to use with it to see more of a glow bc I didn’t notice that. Decent serum
