I own other lip oils and I really like them so I was thrilled to try this Fenty lip oil, but this felt like something my mom used to buy me at the dollar store. There is nothing oily about this. It is a straight up super thick lip gloss. It’s probably the thickest lip product I’ve ever used. It’s very sticky. The cherry scent smells like those fruity bubble baths for kids. it’s a very nauseatingly sweet scent. The “oil“ also looks really red in the tube, but I don’t see any of that on my lips. I’m so disappointed in Fenty with this. I really wanted to love it, but this was a fail. Not what I expected
