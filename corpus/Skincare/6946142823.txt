*I received this product for free to test and reviewfrom Influenster and Shani Darden*I’ve gotten really into skin care throughout thecourse of the pandemic. I’ve experimented withserums and retinols and acids so I definitely havesome favorites. This lactic acidosis serum is reallynice to work with! Goes on easily after cleansingand absorbs quickly. It does tingle a little whenapplied but it’s an acid so that’s ok! My skin feelsfresh and glowy in the mornings after using! nan
