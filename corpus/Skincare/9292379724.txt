This is my 3rd product from Kora and it’s another 5/5. I struggled to find a product that makes my skin feel clean but not doesn’t strip all the moisture from it. This is great, it’s refreshing, cleansing and my skin doesn’t feel taught and uncomfortable after use. I’m in my 50’s, have dry skin and highly recommend it. Highly recommended
