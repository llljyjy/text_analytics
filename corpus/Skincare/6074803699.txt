I love the consistency of this eye serum. It feels very cooling. I used it during the day and night and it definitely keeps my eye areas hydrated. It didnâ€™t get rid of all my dark circles but it lightened it a little. I did see less wrinkles around the under eye. Because the bottle was so small, I finished it in less than a month. Great product
