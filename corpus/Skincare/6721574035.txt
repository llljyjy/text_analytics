This product is an eye brightener and claims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I will say that it definitely brightened under my eyes. I did not notice any firming or cooling sensation. I also didn’t notice any change in fine lines and wrinkles but that could be because I have only used it for a few days now. There is a very faint fragrance. Nothing overpowering. I do love that the glass container is refillable. I did not like that my eyes burned some if I got the cream too close. All in all, it’s an ok product but would not be my first choice for an eye cream. nan
