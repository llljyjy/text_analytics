Love this cream! I have very dry skin and itâ€™s changing as I get older. This is a superb cream that keeps my face and neck smooth and supple all day. Feels great and absolutely love how it feels on the skin. I use it during the day and at night because I need the extra nourishment for my skin. If you have more normal skin or oily skin, this might feel like a bit too much, but I have a couple of friends with normal and combination skin types and they love to use it as a night cream. A little goes a long way with this product. Amazing nourishing cream!
