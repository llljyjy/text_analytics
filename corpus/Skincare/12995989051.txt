I used this for about 2 weeks and developed milia under my eyes. Although I have had milia for years but this made it worse. Since it was pricey and I didnâ€™t want to throw it away, I use it on the rest of my face avoiding the under eye area. It leaves my face super soft the next morning and I need only a small amount to go on my face. Not great
