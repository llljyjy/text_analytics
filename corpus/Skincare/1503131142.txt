I don’t normally leave reviews but I had to for this. My skin has always been a problem. Super sensitive and SUPER dry( like flakes and cracks especially around my nose and mouth). I’ve seen dermatologists, tried prescription lotions, the hot new things, pretty much anything that said hydration I’ve tried. Nothings worked. Until THIS. This magical little tub has saved my skin. When I say I have no more dry skin, I mean NONE. My skin has never felt more hydrated and soft or looked so good either. I repurchased a new one even before I was halfway done with my original because it’s that good. I’m so happy I found this product. SKIN SAVER
