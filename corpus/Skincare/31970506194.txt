This oil is amazing! It is so easy to use and super convenient as an SPF. I use this under my other SPF moisturizer/day cream and the oil does not create a problem with it. It is also awesome that is it SPF 40! The product was gifted by Supergoop! but honestly, I would not spend $46 on it if I was to buy it myself.  It is a very hydrating product for my sensitive and dry skin, nevertheless! I also think the size of the product is very decent. Thank you Supergoop! super hydrating
