I received this product complimentary from Influenster and St. Tropez in exchange for my review. Pros: you get a nice glow, goes on easy, and smells great. Cons: didnâ€™t realize a tanner glove was needed. Not a fan of having to wash off the lotion from my hands and reapply another lotion in order to stay hydrated. Not Bad!
