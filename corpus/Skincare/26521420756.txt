I received a small sample packet of this primer within my birthday gift from Sephora, and let me tell you, I think this may be hands down the best primer Iâ€™ve ever used! I am for sure going to be buying the regular size now! I noticed it did seem to help blur the look of my pores and my pores are pretty bit so I was happy about this. this is some good primer!
