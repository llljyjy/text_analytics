I’ve been using this product for 2-3 weeks and was really liking it (other than the overwhelming smell) when I started to get small whiteheads where I was applying it. This is the only new product I have introduced into my routine. I am typically not an acne-prone person, but I would say my skin is slightly sensitive (I have rosacea). I will definitely be sticking with my fave for redness-reducing, Bioclarity’s floralux products. I wanted so badly to love this product, but it just wasn’t worth the hype. :/ Not worth the hype
