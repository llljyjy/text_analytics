After using this product for about a month, I noticed maybe minuscule changes. I have under eye bags / puffiness. It’s fragrance-free which I know is nice for other people, but I like a good smelling product. The cream was pretty thick so it’s good before bed. It helped maintain hydration. I don’t think it did anything better than other eye creams. I wouldn’t get it again. As expected
