Not sure how this product has so many amazing reviews. That’s what persuaded me to purchase this in the first place. I’ve tried a lot of eye creams in the past and this is by far the worst eye cream I’ve ever used. It not only made my dark circles and fine lines worse/ more prominent, but also really dried out my under eye area. I’ve used other Caudalie eye creams in the past and liked them, so I had high hopes for this one especially considering the price, but was left extremely dissatisfied. Definitely don’t rely on all the high rated reviews for this product. I feel pretty deceived by them. nan
