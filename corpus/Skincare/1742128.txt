I loved the way this made my skin feel after use.  I wasn’t sure at first how I felt about the fragrance because it reminded me of my grandmother’s rose water but it was pleasant and didn’t stick around for long so it grew on me.  This tub will last me a while -- a great deal for the price and the amount.  The ifrst time I used it, I had already washed my face and I could not believe what has cleaned off my skin that my soap left behind -- it was noticeable.  It really worked well.  The texture meant it didn’t dry out my skin - it moisturized and it did not cause my face to break out. Sometimes creamy cleansers cause my face to get new breakouts -- didn’t happen.  I really like this cleanser -- used it even to clean off my mascara and it didn’t bother my eyes.  A solid cleanser and I would buy it when this runs out. A solid cleaner
