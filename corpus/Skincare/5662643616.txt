I’ve been using this product for 2 months and it’s literally changed my skin game! It started off slow and I did have a small breakout at the beginning. My acne scars have decreased substantially and I have hyper pigmentation so anytime I have a breakout, it turns into a scar. I cannot recommend this product enough but you do need to be patient. For the price, this is worth it and there is a smell but the results outweighs the smell for me. BUY IT NOW. Life changing for acne scars
