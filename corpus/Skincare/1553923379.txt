I bought this mask because I have super sensitive and dry skin. Iâ€™ve only use the mask twice, but both times it worked like magic! The first time my face was super irritated after getting too aggressive with exfoliation, and this mask calmed it down and soothed the irritation. The second time was after two weeks of travel, and my skin was so dry and flaking off I looked like I was molting, and after using this the flakes were gone and my skin felt soft, after my normal moisturizing routine it was back to normal, if not better! Definitely will ALWAYS agave this on hand! magic?
