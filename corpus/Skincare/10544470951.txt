If you have oily prone skin do not buy!!! I don’t break out often/get acne but this product made me break out TWICE. My forehead was covered in acne. I haven’t had that type of breakout since high school. I tried to wait a week or so to try it again after the first break out and sure enough I tried it again and broke out bad. It’s not right for oily prone skin so don’t waste your time or $$$. not for oily skin - do not recommend
