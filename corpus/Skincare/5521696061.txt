The Caudalie brand is new to me and it was my first time trying the beauty elixir face mist. I really enjoyed usually this beauty elixir face mist. It spritz on nicely. I love the smell of it. The packaging is beautiful. I use the elixir everyday during the day. I use it to set my makeup. It minimizes my pores.. I canâ€™t get enough of this #freeproduct. Great face mist
