I have been using this cleanser for about 7 years and it’s the only thing I have ever found that doesn’t feel like it’s sucking the moisture out of my skin. I have quite dry skin on my face, and had tried many other gentle cleansers before finding this, and have also tried others since when I’ve tried to find less expensive cleansers or gotten free samples, including the Drunk Elephant, First Aid Beauty, Cerave, and Cetaphil ones, which I know work well for others but for me just almost instantly made my face feel tight before I could even get my face moisturized post-cleanse (and then like thirty minutes post-moisturizing it would start to feel tight and dry again). Not saying that those don’t work for a lot of people but just that if you’ve experienced issues with other gentle skin cleansers this could work for you!I especially love that I can use it over my eyes. I do a couple times a week use it after an exfoliator (Lush’s Let the Good Times Roll, sorry Sephora). Loved By My Super Dry Skin
