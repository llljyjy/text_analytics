Disclaimer: I don’t use this to remove my makeup. I like doing a double-cleanse as I find my skin takes it better than using a deep-cleanse or physical exfoliant product. I personally love this oil as it’s very light for my purposes, and it doesn’t leave any oily film after rinsing with water. I think if you’re wearing minimal makeup (foundation/skin tint with some eyeliner and light mascara), then this oil will do the trick. My primary use for it isn’t to remove makeup, but I have removed light makeup with it successfully. I enjoy the slight floral scent and the texture of the oil; it is on the runny side so it can be messy if you aren’t careful. One pump is good enough for my entire face and neck! I have difficult skin sometimes, and this oil has not caused any breakouts or irritability in the past month that I’ve been using it. Wonderful for double-cleansing
