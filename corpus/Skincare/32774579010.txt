This is the best facial product I’ve ever used. It glides on easily and absorbs quickly. It visibly reduces pores; I’ve used a lot of products that make this claim, but none that actually did. Although I’ll wasn’t expecting it to, it also lightened a prominent dark spot I’ve had. None of the products I’ve tried that were specially for this purpose have ever worked. Spot it still there, but much less noticeable now. It also helps reduce the appearance of fine lines. For me, this product is well worth the money, as it has replaced a few products I used to use daily. Best facial product I’ve ever used
