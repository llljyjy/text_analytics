I recieved this as a free gift, and I do have to say I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually really liked the this cream. It absorbs really well without leaving a greasy residue, and when dried I can apply my makeup on top of it. Which I’ve found to be a very rare trait among the many creams I’ve tried. I also like that my skin looked and felt notably hydrated throughout the day without looking oily like my skin tends to look around midday. I definitely think its something I would come back to and recommend to anyone who has combination skin who has to deal with the struggles of oily or scaly skin. Next level cream
