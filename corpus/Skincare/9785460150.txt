I did not like this at all. Way too balmy for a daytime moisturizer. It didnâ€™t particularly hydrate my skin and something in this line broke me out. I just hated how this felt. I would rinse my hands after applying and there would be a film left behind and the water would just roll off my hands. So weird, it was like washing my hands with Rain-x. nan
