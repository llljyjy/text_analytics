I really love how nicely moisturizing this cream feels when you apply it without feeling too heavy like other eye creams.  it also absorbs quickly and doesn’t pill up.  I’ve been using it daily, sometimes twice a day when I remember for about 2 weeks now and it seems very effective at reducing my fine lines and puffiness!  All around it’s a winner and I’ve already recommended it to my mom and friends! This feels so luxurious!
