This product is amazing! I have extremely dry skin and the dry Canadian winter is only making it worse, but this product has helped a lot. The only downside to this product is the price :( for that reason only I donâ€™t use it every night but my skin does feel amazing the next morning on the nights I do. I have used the biossance omega repair cream and the fab ultra repair cream, but neither compare to how hydrating this product is. nan
