I’ve been using glossier’s super Bounce for several years now but the $28 for a small bottle had me looking for an alternative.  At a very competitive price point I decided to give this particular product a try. Needless to say I will be going back to glossier‘s super Bounce ASAP. In fact I’m not even finishing the ordinary‘s bottle! It is simultaneously incredibly watery and incredibly sticky. My skin has broken out horribly! That was definitely not a problem I had with any other product including the glossier super Bounce. So one star for the product itself but I am adding an additional star because the ordinary has excellent moral standards in regards to it being vegan, cruelty free etc. Not what I was hoping for…
