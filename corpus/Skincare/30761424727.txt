The Dior Off/On Foaming cleanser works well and leaves my face feeling fresh. While its foaming and cleansing properties work great I would say that the cleanser may be a bit stripping. I enjoy how moisturized and clean my face feels at first but after drying it leaves my skin feeling a bit stripped and like I need to add extra moisturizer than I normally would. Aside from that issue do like how well it suds and cleans and the smell makes me feel like Iâ€™m at a spa. Its definitely fragrant but not overpoweringly so. Fresh after cleanse feel
