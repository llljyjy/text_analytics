This is one of the most unique moisturizers I’ve ever used and I have tested and used a lot. The formula itselfis extremely light weight and the gel absorbs extremely quickly leaving an almost nonexistent, yet hydrated feel to the skin. Because of this I do believe it would be best suited for oily/combo skin. I’m not sure it would be enough hydration for dry/parched skin. I love that it comes with a metal spoon to distribute the product and to state the obvious the texture is AMAZING. The little spheres are so fun to squish and you can actually feel them burst upon application. Def a super unique and innovative product that I’m excited to continue to use. Most unique award goes to….
