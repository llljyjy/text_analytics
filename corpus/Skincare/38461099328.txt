I have oily skin, so I’m always wary of any new face product. I received this for free from Influenster to review. Please spot test before you use this! My skin is sensitive so it did cause some pimples. But it also really hydrated my skin & delivered on the promise of plump skin. I couldn’t use it for a long time due to the breakout. But I imagine that prolonged use, if you can handle it, would help with fine lines due to how fast my skin was plump. The smell isn’t my first choice but it’s not unbearable. nan
