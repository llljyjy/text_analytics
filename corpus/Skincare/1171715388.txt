I’m on my 3rd, going on 4th bottle of this. I would say after the 2nd bottle I started seeing a noticeable difference in my skin and even nails. It’s dead of winter and my skin on my arms and legs are soft and not dry at all, I’m rarely putting moisturizer on. Even under my eyes where I usually see some dryness is gone, and I think I have less fine lines due to it. I really believe in the science behind oral hyaluronic acid and this combo of vitamin C and E and it does show. My cuticles were really dry and my nails usually broke all the time, but now they are long and strong, even my manicurist noticed and said they look very healthy now. Convinced it’s due to these gummies because I have changed nothing else in my routine or diet. I guess I have to eat these forever lol! on my 3rd bottle 10/10
