I have been using Kiehls for almost 3 weeks. The product has a great texture but it feels a little greasy and has no scent. To be very honest I have not noticed any improvement so far even though I apply everyday. Maybe I need to use a little longer. I will continue using the product and provide n updated review in a couple of weeks. Just ok so far
