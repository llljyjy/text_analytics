I received this complimentary from REN Skincare. This is the first product I’ve tried from REN skincare! It has such a light texture and makes my skin feel incredibly smooth! I even put it on my hands and I definitely saw the difference between the way it made the skin texture on my hand feel and look VS the hand I didn’t put it on. Will need continued use to speak to any results. Three stars because I don’t know how I feel about the scent it gives off and the price is a bit high. nan
