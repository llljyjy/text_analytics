I received a mini sample of this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream from #Influenster. It’s hard to say if this works as it says it does because I didn’t get a full-sized product so I didn’t get to try it for more than 3 weeks. So far, I like the texture of the cream as it glides on smoothly on my skin. It isn’t greasy at all; I have combination skin. After applying the cream, my face immediately felt hydrated. The smell of the cream is not overwhelming either, so that was great for me! Moisturizing Cream
