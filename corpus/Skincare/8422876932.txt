i have received a sample size of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting serum from topbox in exchange for my honest review. It is very rich, a little goes a long way which I really like.I felt my skin hydrated nicely. It smells great. I would like to use it more to see the long term benefits. Since my skin is very dry this serum would really help. great serum
