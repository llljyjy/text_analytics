So I’ve used this product in the past, but have been looking high and low for another vitamin c serum.   Not because I didnt like this one, but because I wanted to see what else was out there, possibly cheaper since this one is a bit pricey.   I must’ve tried at least 4 or 5 other serums and I just came back to this one.  The others didn’t do it for me, and even made me breakout.  This Tatcha formula is so gentle on your skin and won’t cause irritation.  It is pretty watery when you pump it into your hand but one pump goes a long way.  I only use this in the morning and use a retinol at night.  I just find this serum to give the most glowey skin without harsh ingredients and irritation.   The only downside is the price, but I would say it’s well worth it. I love this serum!
