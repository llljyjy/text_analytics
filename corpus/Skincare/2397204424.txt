This cream is light weight and easily absorbed by my dry and dehydrated skin. It reminded of me of the belif moisture bomb, but this cream is less heavy. My skin felt so soft after applying the cream. After 8 hours, my skin still feels soft and hydrated. Iâ€™m loving this cream for the winter time. Most have for dry/dehydrated skin
