I enjoy cleansing balms and I was excited to try this one. It does the job, but I won’t be repurchasing. It crumbles when you get it out of the jar. It doesn’t completely smooth/melt on your face. There’s still little clumps of product when I’m rubbing it on my face. There are better balms for my money. nan
