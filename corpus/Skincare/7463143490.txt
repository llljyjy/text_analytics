This is the only serum Iâ€™ve used in at least 5 years that did not break me out or dry me and it actually improved my skin. I break out easily or will get a pimple here and there with new products but this serum went straight to work with no purging, irritation or breakouts. I LOVE The Outset serum! Good Stuff
