My mom is has been loyal to Lancôme for as long as I can remember. I figured maybe I would like them is as well. As someone in their mid-thirties skincare is becoming a major priority. I tried this for a few weeks but saw improvement in the fine lines within a few days. After a month the results were noticeable enough my coworker asked me what I was doing different. I think the product is wonderful, it doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin, and application is easy. Only downside is after multiple weeks of use it’s hard to tell if all three products are coming out. It’s also a little tacky after application but dries normally for a serum. Finally a serum that works!
