I was sent a small sample of this product for review and as the packet was so small I cannot fully assess the efficacy of the product nor if it causes irritations.  While the scent is lovely, I am shocked to find it in a Clinique product as sent is a common irritant, so be weary. The texture is lovely and my skin felt fine after my two uses of the product, I didn’t notice any results (I wouldnt expect to after only two uses) but I didn’t noticed any irritation either. I applied this at night, after washing my face and before putting on my night moisturiser. I must add as aside, the packing on the full sized product is luscious, I am a sucker for purple. #freeproduct Unsure
