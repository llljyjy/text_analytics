It definitely leaves a bit of a glowy finish, especially when you first apply. I wanted to like this so much but by the end of the day the product migrates near my eyes and makes them sting pretty badly :( Not good if you’re sensitive. It also somehow gets in my mouth and tastes just like sunscreen, not in a good way lolAlso, not sure if I’m the only one but the packaging drives me crazy?? It’s a pump bottle so I have no idea why it’s upside down? It’s awkward to use and I feel like by the time you’re nearing the end it’ll be difficult to get any product out. Stings my eyes
