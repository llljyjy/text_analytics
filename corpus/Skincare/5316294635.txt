This product is really moisturizing and it feels really nice on the skin. It doesn’t feel greasy but it is still a thick facial oil. I really like how a small amount goes a long way and how it actually feels like it’s absorbing into the skin and not just sitting on top of it. The only thing I don’t like about it is the scent, it’s very strong and it lingers. nan
