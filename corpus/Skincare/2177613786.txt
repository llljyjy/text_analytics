Battled between purchasing this cream or Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream during the beauty insider event in hopes that I’d find a new Holy Grail after using Dr. Jart Ceramidin for years. Because it’s getting warmer I decided to go with this because the formula is lighter - plus it’s also less expensive. The positives I found are that the formula is lightweight and not greasy at all which means it’s awesome for the summer. I have extremely sensitive skin that will break out in rash or dry patches when trying most new things, this moisturizer has not irritated my skin at all. I found that makeup applies over this moisturizer great. No pilling or patchiness. It’s also less expensive than other top rated creams.Negatives would be that I don’t find it quite as moisturizing as I would like, even on top of the Plum Plump Serum. And I don’t find that it does much for my skin texture either - it’s not bad, just not the best. I’m curious how Tatcha Water Cream compares for summer moisture as I know it’s a lighter formula as well. Would probably purchase again! Good. Not ready to call it a Holy Grail product.
