I really like this cleanser. I have dry and sensitive skin and I felt like it was gentle yet effective. My skin looked visibly brighter afterwards. I like the texture and the scent, my only complaint is that the little white exfoliant beads are hard to wash off, and would tend to stay there even after drying my face. I didnâ€™t use this everyday but I think it would be gentle enough to do so. I tended to use it in the morning because I like how it brightened up my face nan
