I recently started adding some more expensive brands to my skincare routine, so I was excited to receive this and be able to try it before splurging on it. For reference, I have combination dry skin. I really enjoyed my experience with this cream. It absorbs really quick and feels luxurious when rubbing it in. It also feels cool when you first start using it. A little goes a long way, which is a huge plus! My skin looked brighter and stayed moisturized throughout the night. I think this would be really great for a nighttime routine. The only reason for 4 stars is the price. I’ve used a ton of different creams from cheap $20 moisturizers to $300 moisturizers, I don’t think there’s anything here that wants a $95 price tag! I regularly use a mid-range brand for half the price that works just as well. Decrease that price and I’ll consider making this a regular! Nice and luxurious!
