Multi-Protection Anti-Oxidant 24-H Moisture Creme was provided complimentary via Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin. Some days oily patches other days dry or in between. So I use the Clinique 3 step system with the daily moisturizer. I replaced my daily moisturizer with this creme and continued following my normal wash in am and pm for a few days and found that the Estée Lauder daywear creme is definitely a light and hydrating creme good for normal, dry, or combination skin. It was not irritating and once applied my skin felt so soft, lasting a couple hours before needing to reapply.  I immediately noticed the cucumber fragrance which was calming and relaxing. The creams texture was very creamy and smooth. I am also very happy about the spf 15, that is a must in a daily moisturizer for me. It left no greasy residue and was perfect under my makeup. As for the claims that it will help prevent and reduce signs of aging, I will continue use to see if it works in that regard. I can see it helping to prevent fine lines because it definitely works to keep my skin hydrated and protected from the sun. I would have liked a little more info on the packaging as to weather it is oil free but that is only critique I have for this item. I highly recommend adding Estée Lauder Daywear Multi-Protection Anti-Oxidant 24-H Moisture Creme to your daily routine. I will be buying more to use with my daily routine. Estée Lauder Daywear
