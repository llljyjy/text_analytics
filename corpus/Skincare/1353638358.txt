It’s only been about two weeks so I can’t tell yet if it will have any effect on my hyperpigmentation. It is very moisturizing and the overall quality of my skin has improved. But if you’re sensitive to smells, you may want to stay away from this one. Other reviewers claim it smells like grass, and it does have this plantlike, green smell but I can barely tolerate it. I’ve combined it with my other skin products to tamper down the smell, but it’s really strong. Scent too strong!
