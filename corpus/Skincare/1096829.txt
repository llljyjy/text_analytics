I received a sample of this Estee Lauder creme from Influenster.  The packaging was luxe, and the product felt thick and rich.  It went on smoothly, didn’t interact negatively with my serum, and had an old-fashioned, floral scent.  I didn’t notice any reduction in wrinkles or immediate lifting/firming but my skin did feel well moisturized. nan
