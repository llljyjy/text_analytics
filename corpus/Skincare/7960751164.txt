I have been searching for a good mineral sunscreen for ages. All of the ones i’ve tried have been either streaky, super greasy, or left a nasty white cast. That is not the case with this one! New holy grail for sure. It doesn’t suffocate my skin, no white cast, and i can reapply it comfortably. Sits nice under makeup too :) nan
