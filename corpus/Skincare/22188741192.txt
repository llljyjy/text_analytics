I used it everyday after my face wash and noticed that my dry skin felt smoother. Sometimes it left a film on my face that felt as if I was peeling. I tried to use less product but the sensation continued when I touched my face. Other than that, I think it definitely helps to tone the skin as the few acne scars I had seem to be reducing. Great for dry areas and to tone skin
