First off so glad I got to try this new spf product for free! I was sent this product from influencer. I have been a fan of the regular aqua bomb moisturizer so having a moisturizer with spf from the same brand is a plus! I will say this product is slightly thicker than the regular aqua bomb. Feels slightly tacky when you first put it on but goes away once it sets in. No white cast was left at all! Would definitely recommend this product. My skin feels moisturized, soft, and protected! Great moisturizer!!
