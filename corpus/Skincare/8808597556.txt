I absolutely LOVE this product. I will say it looks way better if you have someone to help you apply it. My boyfriend gets the spots I can’t. I typically sleep in it and wash it off the next day. The smell isn’t too bad and it can be sticky, but it’s totally worth the life it brings to my skin! It did take some practice to get it to look like this, but again, totally worth it. You have to keep in mind though you have to prep your skin (exfoliating & moisturizing) to achieve the look you’re going for. Also, my skin is super sensitive and this is one of the only self tanners I’ve tried that didn’t break me out in hives. Cant recommend it enough. love it!
