As an esthetician, YES. The ingredient deck is like a romance story for your face. Seriously. It’s rich and decadent with no overpowering scents. The price point makes this a luxury brand but worth every penny. My face was immediately more radiant and softer looking. My skin remains supple throughout the day and that helps tremendously with the texture of my skin. I have only been using it for 3 days and any good estie knows I’ll need at least 14 to make a true conclusion but out of the gate, this product is a GAME CHANGER. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for an honest review. Wonderful product!
