I could not be more pleased with this. Ever since I incorporated this into my routine, I’ve noticed an amazing change in my skin. My skin was fine before, my only concern was a light amount of texture around my cheeks caused by my pores. I didn’t realize how much improvement could be made. My skin is smoother, calmer, and holds hydration much longer. My skin is more on the oily side but this gives me a wonderful amount of hydration without any grease or shine. It feels rich but also lightweight at the same time. Nothing has made as big a difference in my skin as this. I’m impressed. Highly impressive
