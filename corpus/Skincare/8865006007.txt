The packing is elegant and lovely. love the bottleand pump. The scent is very subtle. I preferunscented products but the scent here is so subtle and pleasant it doesn’t bother me.My skin has felt incredibly moisturized. It lasts all day. I’ve not had any breakouts or dry patches since I started this. I’ve not had any reduction infine lines nor pore size.I don’t expect miracles, but I do think products should work as advertised. I will finish this bottle, as the moisture is amazing. However, I can get all day moisture from much more affordable products.The benefits of this item do not justify the pricetag. nan
