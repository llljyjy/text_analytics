It does reduce redness and irritation but there are issues:- the smell isn’t great (smells like pool water) but it fades quickly - the consistency is so weird - thick but doesn’t spread nicely so you need an unexpectedly large amount of product (4-5 pumps) to cover your face- the pumper sprays product out which sometimes causes me to miss my hand and waste itOverall it’s a good product. I had the spray first and love that there’s a serum now. It’s just not very pleasant to use. does what it says but needs work
