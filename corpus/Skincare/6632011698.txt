I swear by this face cleanser! I’ve been using this cleanser and the Kiehl’s line in general for 2 years now and my skin has never been better. I absolutely love the fresh, soft feeling my skin has after I wash it. I used to have acne, now it’s totally clear and I only get a few small pimples here and there. My skin has always been highly sensitive with a mixture of oily and dry and this has worked wonders. The difference it’s made is mind-blowing to me! Highly recommend to anyone with sensitive combination skin! Love love love it! My go-to for 2 years!
