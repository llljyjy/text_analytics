This is a pretty good moisturizer, though probably a little too light for my combo to dry skin.  It goes on well under makeup.  I layered it under my SPF 50 and I prefer a moisturizer with a higher SPF.  I also prefer products without added fragrance because it tends to irritate my skin. Not my favorite, but okay
