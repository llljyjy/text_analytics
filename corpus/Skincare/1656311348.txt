I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes. Been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and so far I like the brightening effect. The product is easy to use and just glides onto the skin with a cooling sensation which feels really nice in the mornings. Iâ€™ve been using it under my concealer, and throughout the day i can just reapply on top (if needed). It definitely gives your under eyes a little glow and shine to it, which help brighten the area and makes you look more awake. nan
