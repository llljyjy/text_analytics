I was on a search for a new mineral sunscreen for my sensitive skin that is matte, has no white cast, doesn’t pill, non sticky & non greasy. I tried a lot of different brands, affordable & pricey from Cerave to Biossance, the past few months & have finally found The One! Downside, it’s pricey! :( but other than that this sunscreen is everything that I’ve been looking for! Truly matte, non greasy, non sticky, no white cast & glides on so smooth & silky. This will be my holy grail sunscreen unless I find something better.... I have found..... THE ONE!!
