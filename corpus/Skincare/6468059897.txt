I received a sample of this very, very high end product called “Confidence in a Cream“ and it was truly magical in the way it made my face feel and look. 1. It is creamy and applies to the skin without dragging or pulling. It does not leave your skin feeling greasy or heavy.2. It has a clean smell.3. It has not caused irritation or break out - which is pretty impressive considering my skin is sensitive to new products.4. I feel like it holds moisture into my skin all day. I no longer have to reapply moisturizer mid-day because of my dry skin.5. Makes my skin feel soft and look fresh and dewy.I highly, recommend this moisturizer. I use it every day, and yes I see a difference!! My favorite moisturizer!
