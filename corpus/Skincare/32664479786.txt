I used this product for 2 weeks before review, noticing subtle changes in about 3 days of use. Overall I see an improvement in fine lines and elasticity, and it has noticeably evened out my skin tone from hyperpigmentation and scars (even a scar from a piercing 15 years ago). Application was smooth, absorbed quickly, and I never experienced any irritation. The fragrance is there, but I enjoy it. I recommend this Results seen :)
