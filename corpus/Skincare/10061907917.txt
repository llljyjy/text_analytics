I had really high hopes for this product and actually quite liked it after my first few applications. However I noticed that it started giving me breakouts in weird places, did nothing (absolutely nothing) for my pores, and even gave my skin a sort of grainy texture in some areas. Ive tried applying it with my hands, and with a cotton pad. I didn’t get any favorable results after using this product. I gave it a good chance too, I’ve used half the bottle. Unfortunately this product just doesn’t agree with my dry & sensitive skin. Did nothing for my pores and caused breakouts
