I received this product complimentary of Influenster. I really love this mask! Personally, I like clay masks more because they tend to be more effective, but sheet masks are easier to use. This Purifying Mud Mask combines what I like about each type into one product.The application process takes a little longer than a typical sheet mask because you have to peel off the outer layers first. But once it’s on your face, it’s easy to smooth out and get it to stick to all the nooks and crannies. It has a muddy cotton texture at first, and it slowly dries into a hard paper mache-esque consistency. When you’re done, you peel it off like a pore mask. This part left my skin pretty red for the next 30 minutes, but it didn’t aggravate my face. I wouldn’t recommend applying one of these masks if you’re planning to go somewhere right away.Results-wise, my face is less oily, my pores are less noticeable, my skin seems more smooth, and my face isn’t dried out. While the price point is a little higher on these masks, the results are better than cheaper ones. One of My Favorite Masks
