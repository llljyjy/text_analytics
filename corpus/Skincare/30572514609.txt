ive heard so many good things ab biossance and i was so sad that my skin didnt like it. i didnt feel like it was moisturizing my skin, it actually felt irritating and left a slight burning sensation. after days of continued use, it wouldnt get better and i started breaking out more. i really think it messed up my skin barrier a little. if you have sensitive skin, acne prone skin, combo skin, or all like me, i wouldnt suggest it. just do ur research!! all skin is different sad it didnt work
