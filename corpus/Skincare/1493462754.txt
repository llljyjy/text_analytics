After receiving this moisturizer as a promotion, I was nervous it would be too greasy. I was surprised that it absorbed so beautifully and had little to no smell. After using for a few weeks I have noticed the fine lines on my face diminishing. This will be a regular purchase of mine from now on. Great Moisturizer!
