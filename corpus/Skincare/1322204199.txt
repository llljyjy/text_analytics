I really wanted to like this product. I tried really hard to like it, even harder than I tried to get the product out of the bottle. Please believe all the BAD reviews about the dropper. I thought, even if I got a bad dropper, I could just use my mini spatula/spoon set to get the product out. Nope! I basically have to turn the bottle over and tap it on my hand 100 times til a tiny drop of this stuff comes out. What a joke. It’s frustrating and takes ages to get enough product out to cover even a small area, let alone my entire face/neck/decolletage. Save yourself the hassle. Especially at this price point.If it would be safe to just smash the bottle and scoop out the sunscreen, I would. Too bad that’s not an option. Believe the bad reviews. No one has time for all that, every morning. Believe the BAD reviews!! Dropper is just for show
