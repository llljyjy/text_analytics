Wonderful cleansing balm, comparable to Farmacy’s cleansing balm! A great, hydrating, gentle option for those with dry and or sensitive skin. This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Unlike other cleansing balms, I don’t have the issue of the product easily ending up in my eyes while removing eye makeup with this product. This is a reliable option for those looking to incorporate a hydrating balm into their routine and struggle to find options for dry and sensitive skin. nan
