I really wanted to be obsessed over this lip oil but it’s not what I expected. I agree that it doesn’t come with the best applicator. It’s a very thin oil that evaporates or something really fast, especially if you’re talking a lot. I don’t get any strange tastes from it but it is really small. It’s definitely 0.11 oz. After so many reapplications I don’t think it’ll last very long. If it wasn’t for the gold cap and pretty tube I’d probably return it. My Lips Are Still Looking For SPF
