This oil feels great on the skin but I don’t see that much of a difference compared to my rose hip oil from the Ordinary. My skin feels and looks incredibly hydrated but I don’t feel like the retinol shines through. HOWEVER, I use the Paula’s Choice AHA/BHA liquid exfoliant every other day, differin gel 1-2x/week on non-PC days, and COSRX AHA/BHA toner morning and night every day. My skin is very dry and can handle a lot of actives to slough off the layers of dead skin my face produces so the active in this may just be too gentle for me to see a difference. Good but not GREAT
