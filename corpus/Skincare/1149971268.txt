This is exactly what I’ve been looking for from YTTP- I LIKE their other moisturizers but this one is tops. It’s a creamy go on smooth texture, and leaves your skin incredibly supple and more firm. I used it at night the first time and I woke up and looked in the mirror and actually thought what did I do last night to do to my skin last night again?! So happy with this product.
