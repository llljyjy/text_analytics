I have the most sensitive pores on the planet and everything clogs them -  causing breakouts. I have not had clearer skin then I did after using this product morning and night. I have mo idea what typw of voodoo magic this jar is doing but it helped my skin a lot. It has a nice light scent to it and is very light weight - perfect for summer. Itâ€™s slightlt sticky as well so perfect as a base for foundation or your sunscreen.I highly highly recommend. I am returning my drunk elephant protini cream to replace it with this one. My sensitive pores & acne prone skin loves it
