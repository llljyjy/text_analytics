Ahhh, this was a major disappointment. Disappointment amplified by the price point. So I have dry, sensitive skin. And am dealing with some adult acne and pigmentation left by acne and the sun. This sort of just really sits on my skin. Which is weird, considering how dry my skin is! It feels oily. And looks oily. And not in a nice way. Which also makes it difficult to use/layer with other products. It did seem to cause a few tiny bumps/slightly inflame my acne initially, which is fair enough. Doesn’t really anymore. I had stopped using it when it did. But it did absolutely nothing to improve my pigmentation. Even with a bit of a longer period of trying it. Didn’t do anything noticeably good for my skin really. I’ve had better results with NeoStrata’s Resurface moisturizer (though, that’s not for all skin types - try and grab a sample before committing, I got a sample at Shopper’s and remembered it was good and bought the actual thing recently a year or so later). And depending on my skin’s breakout-sensitivity, also had better pigmentation and even-ness success with The Ordinary’s lactic and mandelic acids. Along with doctor-recommended dermatological creams. Really didn’t work for me. To the point where I wondered how at least a few others didn’t have similar complaints! I should have used this up on the body earlier. Will do now, though not sure how potent it still is. It does have a bit of an orange-cast too. So be aware of that. Did nothing for me, oily, just sits there...
