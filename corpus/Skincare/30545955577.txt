I received a complimentary sample to try in exchange for my honest review. I received a .17oz/5ml Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème to try. It smells really good and the moisturizer is a thick but silky consistency. It absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave a greasy feeling. The sample was really small so I wasn’t able to use it but more than a few days so I didn’t notice any change to my skin.  Overall, it’s a nice moisturizer but I don’t think I would purchase it.
