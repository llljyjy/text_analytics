I received this #freeproduct to review from #trywithtopbox.I was so excited to get this set of products! I have tested it for about a month now and I am seeing improvements to my skin. My fine lines are a bit diminished but I’m also impressed by the way it has made my skin look more plump and bouncy. It has improved mu textured skin and made my skin smooth and soft. I use the serum and cream at night. It does have fragrance but I find it to be a pleasant herbal like scent. I wish it were a little bit on the lighter side though. I haven’t had any sensitivity occur with my skin from this product.This cream is very light and silky. It applies over the serum easily. I have had some pilling here and there, I think it’s from applying a bit too much of the serum beforehand. Used on it’s own it would be great for a quick face massage as it’s super silky until it dries down. When it dries my skin feels velvety soft. I love this cream and the serum and will try to grab it on sale in the future. nan
