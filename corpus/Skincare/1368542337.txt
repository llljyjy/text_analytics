Wanted to love this product so bad. It has a nice consistency and feels nice when first applied. However, once it dries down holy cow was my face dry, like flaky uncomfortable dry. I have dry skin to begin with and am looking for products that keep my face hydrated throughout the day this was not it. For such an expensive product I wanted it to not dry my skin out. One plus is that it doesn’t seem to irritate my skin but just can’t get past how it makes my skin feel. Also there is no smell really if that’s a concern. So maybe if you’re oily to normal this would be a good option for you. not for dry skin
