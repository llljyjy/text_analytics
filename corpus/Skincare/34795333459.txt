I received a sample of this with my order.  The first time I used it I definitely used too much.  It never really absorbed and for the next hour I felt like I was peeling it off my face.  Since then I’ve used a roughly dime sized amount and it covers and absorbs perfectly.  It makes my skin feel wonderfully hydrated.  I have been using it before bed and on days when I don’t wear makeup.  I’m not sure I would use this under makeup but that is just my preference.  It also has a nice light scent to it.  I have had no issues with breakouts so far.  Im not willing to commit to this cream just yet…so many samples to try!  But I am impressed and will save it to my favorites for future reference Really hydrates…skin like velvet
