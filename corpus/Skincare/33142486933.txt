I’ve been using this for a month hoping it would help with post blemish marks since I heard azelaic helps with that, but honestly it hasn’t done anything for my skin. But I’ll probably continue using it until it’s finished as it hasn’t done anything bad for my skin either Doesn’t do anything for red marks
