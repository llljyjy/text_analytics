I have fallen in love with this moisturizer!! It is so lightweight and absorbs into my skin pretty quickly. It minimizes the look of my pores and I feel that it gives me a nice dewy look. I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of the scent at first, it reminded me of spf. However, after a couple uses, It does not bother me anymore. I will definitely be purchasing this to replace my daily moisturizer! Kind of amazing!!
