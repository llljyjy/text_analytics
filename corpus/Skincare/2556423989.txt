This was a complimentary gift from Influenster. First shiseido product so I don’t have anything to compare it to. My current moisturizer is cerave.  The shiseido is so nice!  Very light.  Absorbs great.  Leaves a dewy look but doesn’t feel greasy.  I honestly love it. Very grateful for the product because I will probably never purchase this irl.   But jeez,  it’s so nice. Fantastic if you can afford it.
