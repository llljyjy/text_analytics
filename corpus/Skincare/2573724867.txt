I’m always eager to try a new sunscreen since it’s hard to find one I love. I was excited to try and test out these new sunscreens and they did not disappoint. We all know that sunscreens can leave a white cast on the face but these do not have that problem at all! They are light weight hydrating, because they have hyaluronic acid which is amazing for the skin. Perfect for under makeup or just on their own. I like both of them I use them both I leave one in my purse and one at home. Definitely recommend this for anyone looking for new sunscreen nan
