I really loved this product just with the first use. Washed first then used the Cookies N Clean mask, massaging the charcoal beads in to blend with the rest of the mask. Let it dry and after washing it off, I could see how clean my pores weâ€™re after this mask was able to get all of the dirt and oil out. My face felt ultra smooth before I finished up my facial routine. I totally recommend that you add this to your regimen, you only have to use this twice a week! Love it!
