I received a sample of this from Est√©e Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a heavy and somewhat oily moisturizer for severely parched mature skin. It is highly concentrated and takes a while to absorb. It is a very soothing and calming formula that would be best suited for fall and winter months. Great for Mature Parched Skin
