Feels phenomenal! It felt thicker/more emollient at first but was surprisingly easily absorbed! I layered it on top of the Dr. Dennis Gross Texture Renewal Serum and my usual First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream. Woke up with soft, supple skin! It made a visible difference after just one night so Iâ€™m excited to continue using it! nan
