Ive only been using this for about a week so i havent noticed any major improvement but it does make my skin feel soft and feels like it has helped a little with elasticity. It is pricey but its fairly thick cream so i barely use any and get great coverage. I would caution against using too much at a time as it took forever for it to dry the first time i used it. A little goes a long way
