After using this product for a month or so, I realized this hadn’t changed my skin at all, stained my pillowcases because of the yellow color, and it was so expensive. I switched to the retinol serum I initially stuck to, which is a fraction of the cost and works wonders on my acne-prone skin. I wish it worked on me as it did on others, but maybe this just wasn’t the one for me. Honestly just opt for a cheaper alternative
