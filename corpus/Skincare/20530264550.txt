i’ve been using this for the past two weeks in the morning and at night. i feel a stinging/burning sensation when i initially put it on. it goes away after a minute but uhm, i don’t think products are supposed to feel that way. some info about my eyes: i have pretty dry under eyes and started noticing fine lines forming (30 yo now) without forcing them by smiling. bummed it doesn’t work for me cause of all the wonderful reviews. going to give this away. nan
