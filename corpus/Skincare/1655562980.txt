Love the consistency and how smooth it applies- it feels light, fabulous and provides an instant glow. Would recommending adding it to your skincare routine. It certainly has a smell of turmeric, which I donâ€™t mind because of how good it is for providing that natural, gooey skin. Provides a natural glow!
