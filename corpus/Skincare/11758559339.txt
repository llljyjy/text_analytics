I have forehead crease lines, so I was looking forward to trying this!  Itâ€™s nice on the skin and does appear to blur my lines a bit right away.  I will continue to use this under my regular moisturizer.  My skin is on the dry side right now, and it soaked up this product immediately.  I took away a star because I wish it was a bit more moisturizing. Good for wrinkles
