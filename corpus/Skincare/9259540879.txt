I received Tula skincare eye balm as a free sample from influenster for my honest review. I received the Tula eye balm almost a month ago but I wanted to use it more than a couple of times to see if it’s worth it. I have been using it exclusively at nighttime. I am not a fan of eye creams in general as I think any face cream can be used as an eye cream. But my personal preference aside I think I like the actual bullet shape and I think it’s very convenient. The balm itself is a little stiff (you are supposed to warm it up) but it is a little inconvenient. If you don’t warm it up you can feel a little tugging when you first apply but after it glides smoothly. Other than that I think it’s pretty good. I don’t have eye bags so I can’t say if it does or doesn’t work on them. Overall I like it. I am not sure if I would buy it but thats because I have too many eye creams. Hydrating eye balm
