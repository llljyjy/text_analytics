I received a free sample of this product for my honest review. This cleansing bar is soo moisturizing and smells really good. It lathers up really well and makes my skin feel amazing after use. Bar soaps usually make my skin dry so I have noticed the difference. I would not suggest using it if you have acne prone skin because the ingredients can be pore clogging. I have acne & avoid using it on places that flare up. But itâ€™s amazing for everywhere else. nan
