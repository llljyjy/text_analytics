Influenster sent me this product to try for free. I had actually been debating it for a while but wasn’t ready to pull the trigger yet. Having an “expressive” face, I have smile lines and forehead “crinkles” so I was excited to try this. I like the fact that it evened out my skin tone overall and it reduces the definition of the lines. The only thing I would have to critique is the product felt a little sticky after application. Overall I was quite pleased with the results. Overall great for reducing appearance lines
