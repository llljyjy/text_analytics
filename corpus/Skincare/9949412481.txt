I bought this directly from the YTTP website but they’ve deleted my review. The product had leaked all over the packaging by the time I received it. I’m afraid to use it since it’s been exposed to air and has probably gone bad because it was not sealed and packaged properly. I contacted the YTTP customer service for a refund/replacement and they ignored my messages. If you’re looking for a good retinal serum that is better packaged and more affordable, try the Geek & Gorgeous one. Dysfunctional Packaging & Leakage
