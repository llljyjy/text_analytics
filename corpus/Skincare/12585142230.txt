My skincare routine has never been consistent. Fortunately, I have never experienced acne before and typically have a clear face. However, after receiving this product as a free sample program, I knew that I needed to try it out. Needless to say, Fenty is Fabulous!I have been using this toner every day and night after I wash my face and let me tell you, this is game changer. I thought I had clear skin, but the way this product makes my skin look now, I am speechless. This Fenty Fat Water toner, replenished my skin, left my skin so so soft, gave a plump, hydrated look, and made my makeup look smooth when applied over it. I have used a moisturizer + toner-in-one in the past from a very well known brand but it definitely did not deliver the same results with that one. In a heartbeat, this Fenty Fat Water toner is something that compares to none. I would buy this over and over again.My only down-side, I donâ€™t like the concept of the packaging, because it does not have an easy pour and wish it like a normal cap, but that brings no fault to the product itself. As a social media influencer, I have tried to convince my friends, family, and everyone else around me that they NEED this product. Ms. Fenty came and left her mark. Another home-run for Fenty
