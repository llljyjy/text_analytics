I wanted to give this product a true testing by using for a period of time before coming to a decision. Did it instantly depuff my eye area? I’m not sure that it did. I honestly did not experience a marked difference in fine lines and wrinkles. I do like the texture and the fact that a little goes a long way but I don’t really see me buying this product in the future. It’s good, but not great. If I am going to pay a higher price, I expect more of a result. I Wanted to Love It
