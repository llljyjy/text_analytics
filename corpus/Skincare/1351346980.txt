Good summer moisturizer especially with SPF! Lightweight to not feel too heavy and this helps me skip an extra step in my skincare routine every morning. The moisturizer does help control oil and shine (a must for my summer skin). However, I don’t see myself using this in the colder months, which is 9/12 months. The moisturizer is not heavy enough and unfortunately 3 months of sun isn’t enough for me to use this product. This policy will be great for those in consistently sunny cities! nan
