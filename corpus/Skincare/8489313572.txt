I wore old make up one night under my eyes and since they I have dealt with contact dermatitis under my eyes - mainly on my left eye. I started using this product and it instantly makes the area not burn anymore. Within about a week or so I would say my eye got significantly better! Only downside to this product is that it costs $38 and the tube is soooo small! Also, I noticed that when I stopped using it (even after my eye was healed) the issue returned, so perhaps it’s something I’m using on my skin causing the issue. Also, it’s pretty oily so using it during the day isn’t my fav thing to do, but if it works then I’m fine to do that! Either way good product! good product!
