Overall this is a pretty good serum. It’s light but does feel hydrating on my skin. It has not caused any breakouts but I don’t see any major improvements either. One thing I dislike very much is the shape of the container. It’s a tube that is rounded at the bottom so it’s difficult and awkward to store. nan
