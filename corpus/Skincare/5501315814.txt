The PLANTSCRIPTION™ Multi-Powered Youth Serum is… interesting. As with any serum, I don’t expect results to happen within a few days, or even a week or 2. This is advertised, however, as being able to produce results in such a short amount of time. I did not see any noticeable different in the 2 weeks that I used this product. The texture of the serum is nice and smooth, and it absorbs well into the skin. The smell is pretty awful, though, and it doesn’t fade quickly. It’s hard to deceive, but it’s a strong sort of musty smell. I’m interested to see what will happen if I keep using it, but the smell is really off putting. I myself can only use it at night. I would suggest trying a sample at the store before purchasing to see if you like the scent. Nice Texture, Weird Smell
