I have been using this product for several weeks now and I was a bit skeptical at first. It is definitely expensive, but it really is amazing. I noticed a reduction in my dark spots on my forehead from sun damage and it made my face incredibly smooth. I’ve noticed my makeup is applying a bit easier since starting to use this product as it is also seems to clearing up the textured areas of my face as well.It does tingle a little when you first apply it but it spreads well over the skin and absorbs nicely. Also a little bit goes a long way with this product, I typically use 2 pumps and find that it covers my entire face and neck easily. I do recommend this product if you are able to splurge, you won’t be disappointed. Some kind of magic!
