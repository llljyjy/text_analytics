I was given this to sample for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not a makeup, skin care type person. But I did want something to help with under my eyes especially since I’ve started using a cpap machine and sometimes air escapes and dries out my eyes or keeps me awak.. I have also noticed darken skin more wrinkles etc as I get older. This is a light cream that blends smoothly into the skin you don’t need but a pea size amount. I did not see results right away but after a few weeks of using every so often I can see a bit of a difference. The area’s not so dark lines aren’t as prominent etc. I know that I would not have purchased this because of the price but giving it a try and how long it can last me makes me so to think a bit about it. Great thus far
