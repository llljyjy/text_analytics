No different than any other cleansing balm. I’ve been using it as the first step to my double cleanse at night to remove make up. It removes concealer, blush, and setting powder perfectly but I have a difficult time removing non waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It leaves my eyes stinging and blurry. I won’t buy again. it’s just okay
