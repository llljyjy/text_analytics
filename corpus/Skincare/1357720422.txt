OK I don’t know why this one’s getting so much flack but I tried it and it’s amazing I have fair skin that’s prone to red patches and this literally neutralized any red I actually bought it because I thought it was basically a sunscreen and I was shocked that it actually turns skin tone colour once rubbed in almost like a really nice foundation all I had to do was set this baby with powder and I had beautiful glowing skin all day and it gives you the perfect coverage I was really surprised at the amount of coverage it gave. This is way better then your regular sub screen. Also would be great for fair to med skin. Will be my summer go too! Glad I took the chance and tried it. You also don’t need a lot at all. So it should last me a few months. This totally meets the protection and gives you a beautiful not full on mat look. Skin looks completely flawless. Set with a powder and be done. amazing coverage and red is gone
