I was really excited to try this product but after using consistently at night for a few weeks, I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin. May not be best on sensitive skin or skin that reacts to fragrance as this has a perfume smell (smells good though). Overall, wouldn’t purchase for myself at this price. Not worth the expense
