This is a wonderful soothing cream. It is unscented and has a beautifully rich texture that isnâ€™t too heavy for my skin. I have combo skin and can sometimes get dry patches or touches of inflammation, but this moisturizer is like a nice comforting hug. I actually look forward to using it. I also really like that it is refillable. Comforting and Moisturizing
