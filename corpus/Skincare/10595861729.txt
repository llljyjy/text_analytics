I really loved using this product! I don’t have dark under eyes but yet when I used this it lightened up my eyes and I felt I looked more awake! Some lines have definitely lighted as well! I love there was no fragrance and it was very moisturizing yet not a thick when applying. I can say I love this product and I wish I could keep using it but it is so pricey for me I don’t think I can keep using it which really bums me out but maybe on good sales it will be something I will slurge on but for a amall container I can’t do it. If you have the money I say go for it! Perfect Eye Cream!
