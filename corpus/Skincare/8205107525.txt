Go to Sephora first and try this out!!! Youâ€™ll see its not THAT amazing. Lol very hyped in my opinion. I was looking for a quality lip balm with tint, or color. I have brown sugar, poppy and vanilla... There is very little color payoff. Color is barely noticeable, all you get is glossy lips. The colored liquid separates from the clear liquid balm, so the majority of what comes out of the tube is CLEAR. Also doesnt have any long-term benefits. It doesnt last long and after its been wiped away, it feels as if you never even put on any lip balm. Lips are not soft and more supply than before you put it on (compared to the maybelline lifter gloss). NO COLOR
