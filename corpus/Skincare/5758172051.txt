I got this product in the mail from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The smell is citrus like and exfoliated my skin really well. I did feel that it was a great product and made my skin very clean and glowing coming out the shower, which is what I look for in a cleanser. I’m not sure if I’d pick this as a first cleanser because the beads are probably too rough to use on a daily basis. It’ll be something good to have on days where I feel I need a good scrub to renew my skin. I’d prefer to buy a mini size of this right now. nan
