I received this eye cream from Influenster and Ole Henriksen for free in exchange for my honest review. It has a very thick light yellow texture, so even with a small amount it was very difficult to blend all the yellow shade away. Its very moisturizing though. My skin is dry sensitive and the product did not irritate or cause any rashes. It s supposed to help with dark circles but I think it will take time. If the product does help with my dark circles. It will definitely be a repurchase. Good for sensitive skin, thick texture
