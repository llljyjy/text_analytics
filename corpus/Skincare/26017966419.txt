It smells nice and the texture is cool. It moisturizes and hydrates but I wouldn’t spend $100 on this. There’s nothing even stand out about it.

I do like nice things and I will spend extra money on my face. I spent $100 on sunscreen yesterday and do it too frequently. There are better things to waste your money on
