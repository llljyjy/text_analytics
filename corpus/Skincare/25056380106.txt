This Dr. Zenovia’s Peptide and Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer is absolutely phenomenal!! I never though I’d find a face moisturizer that works this good. Usually they don’t moisturize enough, leave your face feeling wet or oily, leave a layer on your face that dries and flakes off or ends up causing you to break out. I had none of those issues which is awesome. This cream is so silky, goes on easy and soks into your skin. It left my face feeling so super soft. It made it look hydrated and even helps with the wrinkles which is definitely an added bonus. This cream rocks and it is now my new daily go to. I think you will also love it!! Super soft, hydrated face.
