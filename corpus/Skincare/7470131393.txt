I got this product for free for my honest review. First of, the product is great and gives added moisture, not sure if I would say bounce, I couldn’t tell there. However, it’s not has moisturizing and hydrating as I need it to be. I have super dry skin and live in a desert state and need moisture. This added some but I found myself layering it on itself or with other product, and that’s saying a lot as I have a 7 step skin routine. Not only that, my skin may not be use to it as I’ve only been using for a couple weeks, but I noticed having a lot more white heads. I think this is actually better for normal skin people. Good, but probably better for normal skin.
