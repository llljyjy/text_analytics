Finally!  I have rosacea and so limited as to what products I can use.  Everything seems to cause a flare up.  This is the ONLY product that I can use that is gentle enough for my sensitive skin yet potent enough to enjoy the benefits of the retinol.  My skin texture is so much better, more smooth.  And my makeup goes on better because of it!  Yay! A Retinol that Works AND is Gentle!
