Bought this with high hopes because the original cream was a little too heavy but was extremely disappointed. This gel cream made my skin extremely dry and flaky, which I didnâ€™t have a problem with before. I liked the consistency when I first put it on my face but as it dried, my face felt tight. Hopefully they correct the formula because this product has high potential. nan
