I used to love this product, but when they reformulated with the new shades it stopped working for me. Now instead of blending into my skin like it used to, it looks cakey, dry and heavy. There is zero glow (and their glow screen is too much shimmer for an office job.) I’ve tried using different primers and mixing with a moisturizer, but nothing works and I’m so sad. I even went in to a Sephora to get matched for the correct color. My hunt for a great SPF CC cream continues. The new formula is not for me.
