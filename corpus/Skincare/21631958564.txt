I received this complimentary to try. This is seriously one of the best serums I have ever used. Is the e price point high yes is it worth every penny yes. It literally feels like my face got a facial the appearance of my texture is amazing and my find lines and wrinkles absolutely diminished. There is a slight fragrance that I personally love and didnâ€™t break my skin out at all like I said worth every cent. I would recommend ten times over. Will continue to purchase forever
