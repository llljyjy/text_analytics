I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This feels more like a light weight gel more than a cream, I love the way my skin soaks it in so easily. I can’t tell if it brightens my skin as it says because I’ve always noticed my skin looks brighter after cleansing anyway. I love the smell, it smells just like the rest of their products which is more of a potent citrusy scent. If you don’t like fragrance skincare, it’s definitely not for you. This made my skin feel nice and hydrated, which I need during these summer times! Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream
