Didn’t love this charlotte tilbury serum. The scent is a little overpowering and it’s pretty expensive for its composition. I think there are cheaper, more effective serums out there that have better performance and are better for your skin. It’s also important to note this product has ingredients that aren’t great for acne prone skin. Not great for oily skin
