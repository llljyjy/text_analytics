I received this product complimentary for testing purposes in exchange for an honest review. I am so happy that I did! This product is all you need for under eyes. No more loading on the products and skincare hoping something will work, this is it! Personally, my eyes usually stay drier than other parts of my face along purple dark circles. I have been using this product at night for about 2 weeks I can actually see such an improvement and my concealer now applies so nicely on my moisturizer under eyes. Not only is that a plus that it actually work, the formula is amazing! Itâ€™s almost like a Vaseline/gel consistency but it absorbs into the under eye so quickly. Great product!! FINALLY!
