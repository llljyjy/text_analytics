I have brown skin so I’m very pleased that this leaves no white cast. I have the best results when I shake it well and work it quickly into the skin. I am oily and while this leaves me glowy, it isn’t greasy or overly shiny at all. Next test is under makeup, but so far so good! Good for oily skin & no white cast!
