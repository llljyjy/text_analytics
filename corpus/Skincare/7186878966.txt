A mom of 4 in her 30s that has very dry/combo, tired, acne-prone skin. It’s so hard to find simple products that do not break me out! I needed a product that moisturized, helped with overall skin texture, and helped wake me up! This is it! I can’t express how excited I am about this serum. Zero irritation, zero breakouts, just smooth soft skin. I am actually excited about my morning skin routine for the first time in a long time! I’m so happy with the results from only a 2-week trial so far. On top of much more moisturized skin, I am also experiencing fewer breakouts. I will never be without this serum. Finally, something I am excited to repurchase. Amazing!
