I was given this product for free by influenster and Tula in exchange for a review. This product is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel silky soft in the morning, with, so far, no breakouts that sometimes accompany heavy moisturizers. A little goes a long way and you will probably use less than you think you have to at first. I actually had a small patch of dry skin on my face when I started using this cream (allergy related) and after two nights it was all cleared up. I enjoyed the pump feature on the container as I feel as though it keeps the cr√®me in the container cleaner. The scent took a bit of getting used to, while not comp[letely unpleasant it is something to note. Once you take a moment to analyze the scent it appears to be a mixture of the florals and fruit from the ingredients, after a short while I did get used to it. nan
