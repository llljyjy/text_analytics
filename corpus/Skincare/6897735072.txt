I received this product from Influenster and so far after a few weeks of use, I definitely love it. It’s my new day cream which I needed and it’s thick with a light citrus scent. I thought it might make me break out because it’s slightly oily but it doesn’t. It has also done a wonderful job of keeping my skin moisturized in this cold NJ winter that we are having all day long. I highly recommend this product. It plumps and hydrates and smells pretty as well. Amazing! My new AM moisturizer!
