I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I originally bought this cream last winter because my skin gets so dry in Canadian winters. I ended up loving it and continued to use it throughout the year! It’s my new holy grail cream and I’ve tried to use a less expensive alternative and it just didn’t live up. This is worth every penny. Forever holy grail cream!
