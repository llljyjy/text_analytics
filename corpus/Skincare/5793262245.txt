I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review.Smells so good. That is the primary reason I love all Estee Lauder skincare products - they all smell soft, feminine and clean. The toner has some amazing ingredients such as amino acid15 complex and waterlily that keeps skin super hydrated and moisturized. My skin feels very soft and smooth on application. I use a soft cotton pad to pat it on my skin after my cleansing routine. I also wait for few minutes for my skin to absorb the essence completely. It glides and absorbs really well. I love that it’s not greasy or sticky rather very light texture. I haven’t used it long enough to talk about the long-term effects of applying the toner. But I can see my skin looking hydrated after each application. And again, the scent makes me love the product even more. hydrating and smooth
