I have been using this Daily Microfoliant from Dermalogica and I love how smooth and even my skin looks and feel. I enjoy the way I can just measure the amount of product needed and how relaxing the experience is. To my surprise only a small amount of product is needed to achieve a beautiful result and it never irritate my skin. Since it is not a liquid, it is great for traveling. I receive this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Beautiful skin!
