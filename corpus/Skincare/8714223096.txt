I usually break out a lot due to stress/hormonal , so I thought I’d try this out. Let me tell you my skin is doing pretty good haven’t got those big breakouts like I usually do. And I think I’m a little bit more calm when I’m studying. I have a bad habit of shaking my leg when studying due to anxiety but I don’t see myself doing it that often from talking this. So far I love it! nan
