This is my HG! I have gone through like two full sized and 3 travel size (8g) ones in the last year and a half. The Gummy Bear is my favorite by far, but I do like trying the new flavors. I’m so glad that they made the Gummy Bear a permanent flavor. I hear a lot of people say that this doesn’t work for them, but I think they may not be putting enough on. I put a healthy amount on before bed. When I wake up there is still a layer on my lips. I feel like this really helps exfoliate my lips and the dead skin comes off easily. When I shower in the morning when I dry off, I use my towel and gentle rub it on my lips and so much skin comes off. My lips are left soft and supple. I love this product and will continue to buy and use it as long as they don’t change the formulation. Holy Grail!
