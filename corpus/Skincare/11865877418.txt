Do not let the good reviews fool you. Marketed for “oily skin type” which is false. I do not feel like the moisturizer sunk into my skin but was more like a layer of grease. Used the product on dewy skin like it said in the instructions  however in a week after having the product my skin broke out really bad.the No No No!
