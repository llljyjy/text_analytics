I’ve recently discovered & fallen in love with Farmacy. I’m always on the lookout for clean brands & Farmacy products really deliver. I love this face wash! I have combination skin that tends to break especially in the t-zone. It’s gentle, not drying & smells awesome (but not overpowering or lingering). another Farmacy win
