I really am loving the St. Tropez Gradual Tan Daily Firming Watermelon Lotion. First off, the scent is so yummy and it smells like Fresh Sweet Watermelon. I suffer from dry skin and the formula is very hydrating, after applying it my skin was instantantly moisturized. I definitely noticed a golden glow to my skin without any tint transfer. I also love that it contains clean cruelty free ingredients. This is definitely a product to have in your skincare collection, and I would definitely recommend it for any skin tone. Hydrating Tan
