I have skin that is combination in some parts and very dry in others. I’ve been using this day cream every morning after morning routine. if you tend to have drier skin, I’d recommend putting on a serum first. It has a very light texture and doesn’t feel oily. Additionally, the ingredient list faired well when ingredient rating was researched. I love that this cream provided sun protection. Because, it’s a light feel, you can easily reapply as well. I saw some improvement with the dryness. l also noticed that I had much less breakouts and redness of skin than I used to. Light Day Cream
