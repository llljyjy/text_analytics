I tried this product along with the FAB regular moisturizer at night and I can definitely tell the difference in my skin texture! In the winter months, my skin gets really dry and bumpy and normally moisturizers just make my skin oily and make me break out but not this one! I have noticed that after awhile of wear, this will make my skin feel a bit oily but I still use it everyday. Definitely recommend for combination skin types
