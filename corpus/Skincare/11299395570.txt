I received these sunscreens free from Influenster andShiseidoin exchange for my honest review.The Urban Environment Sun Dual Care in both the Fresh Moisture and the Oil-Free versions are great! They have hyaluronic acid to keep skin hydrated without feeling greasy. They have broad spectrum SPF 42, and neither leaves a white cast or heavy sunscreen feeling. Both versions could be used as a daily morning SPF moisturizer and left my combination skin with a healthy lit from within effect. The Fresh Moisture felt like a light weight lotion, and the Oil Free has to be shaken, since itâ€™s a runny liquid, but once applied feels like a comfortable mattified velvet! They both have a light pleasant scent, but be careful if you have sensitive skin, since the bottom half of the ingredients list includes fragrance and plenty of fragrant essential oils. The packaging is cute, functional to use and protect the product from air and light, and has a slight pearlescent sheen to feel a bit more luxe. One of the only downsides is the very small size for the price. Overall I enjoy them both as a daily facial moisturizer with sunscreen!.#nofilter #gotitfree #complimentary  #free #influenstervoxbox @Influenster #contest #review #shiseidosuncare  @shiseido Great hydrating face sunscreen!
