I received this product free to try. I’ve used this for a couple weeks and I have combination/oily skin. I liked using this only at night because of it’s thick formula. By morning my face looked more plump and rejuvenated. The bottle looked pretty also the pump worked good dispensing all 3 ingredients at once. Would recommend to try! A Lancôme must have!
