After using this bar for a few days, it is not my favorite for myself. My skin felt dryer than normal (its been 115 degrees for the last week) and it made my skin feel weird, even with lotion applied after. It does smell really good, but if you have a drier skin type or even combo like me (my skins not dry except where i have eczema) this may not be the bar for you. I will keep trying to use it but I dont think this is a purchase i would make again. nan
