I received a sample of this moisturizer from Influenster complementary for testing purposes and used it on my face and neck as directed. I liked how gentle it was on my super sensitive skin and it was very moisturizing as well. The only thing is, you have to use A LOT of it. I would recommend it to others. Just the right amount of moisture
