I was looking for a gentle cleanser that did not dry out my skin, but also gave just a hint of moisture at the same time.  Plus, I needed something that did not have a lot of fragrance to it.  I already use their moisturizing cream, so thought I would try this. So glad I did!  This has not only helped with the cleansing, but gives just the right amount of moisture. I donâ€™t get the migraines from it, it smells good and cleans really well!  Definitely worth trying and I am glad I added it to my routine. A great addition to your skin care system!
