This eye cream has been great and shown some benefits even after just 2 weeks of use. I love the formula, which doesn’t seep into my eyes and burn them like other eye creams I’ve tried and it sits well under makeup. It’s too soon to tell if I have wrinkle reduction from it but it seems my under eyes appear more hydrated and lighter. I’ve also been using it on my husband who has dark, baggy under-eyes and it seems it has improved his overall look! I’m eager to see how well our under-eyes and crowed feet improve after further use! I received this product complementary from Influenster for review. Great formula!
