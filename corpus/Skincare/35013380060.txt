I received my product from Korres and Influenster for free for testing purposes. Literally love this product already. Only been using it for a week but my skin feels super soft and hydrated. The smell is as fresh as you can imagine. Not super strong either. The viscosity of the cream isn’t thick and isn’t watered down but a perfect balance in the middle. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven’t been using it that long, only a week. But I’m sure I’ll change it to 5 stars after I finish it and come back for more. In progress
