Received this eeste Lauder advance eye gel for free fromInfluenster in exchange of my honest review. I have been trying this for 3 weeks now since I got it and I have notice that my dark circle has lighten up a lot. It is a soft fel texture that feels so smooth on your skin. I will definitely repurchase for a bigger bottle so I can continuing using it. Love it!!!
