I’ve been using this for years - literally since it came out. I don’t like Clinique’s skincare, but this is THE BEST. I’m probably on my 20th bottle??? I see no reason to seek other options! I have really fair skin, so the SPF 50 is just amazing. I also love the subtle glow/tint this gives me; it really evens out my skin tone on no makeup days (no coverage though). The best part is that it’s actually moisturizing; as someone with dry skin, a lot of SPFs are super drying. This is not (I still use a moisturizer underneath)!!! And it does NOT break me out. I will die if this is every discontinued lol. It’s really the best!!! nan
