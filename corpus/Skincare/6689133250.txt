I received this eye cream to test complimentary abd I really enjoyed using it. I used it for over 30 days in the morning and the evening. The texture is so refreshing and a tiny bit was completely enough. Around week 2-3 I started noticing my under eye circles looked better but then after week 3 they started looking worse. I guess its mostly up to hydration levels and sleep so that might have contributed. Overall using the cream made me feel excited and refreshed each time. The texture and smell is great too. I also had problems with eye creams before making my eyes itch but I didnâ€™t have that problem with this one. Refreshing and luxurious
