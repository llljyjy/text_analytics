I got this product for free for my unbiased review from influenster and have been a Clinique fan since high school so I was super excited. Typically I give new products a week in order to review them in a timely manner but I used this eye cream twice a day for nine days. Unfortunately I didn’t notice much difference but you be the judge. The product was definitely pleasant enough in terms of smell and texture but I do have to admit it was a little tough to rub in as there was still some white residue so definitely better used at night. Although this product wasn’t a winner for me, I still ❤️ you Clinique! Hydrating but room for improvement
