I love this face wash.  I have pretty sensitive skin and some products are ok, and others I can’t use because my skin ends up with a burning feeling.  I do not get that from this product at all.  It is very gentle but strong enough to leave you feeling soft and clean at the same time.  I definitely will be repurchasing this when it is time.   The company also has a good mission of investing in education for children. (I honestly wasn’t aware of this until I purchased this product and opened the package).  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, especially if you have more sensitive skin. Yes -- Just buy it :)
