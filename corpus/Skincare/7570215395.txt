I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Iâ€™m glad I got to try because this peel is great and a new staple in my routine! It is gentle and did not irritate my skin. It has already improved my skin texture and I have noticed smoother skin. I get very small raised bumps and this has cleared them up quickly. It also gives my skin a nice glow instead of looking dull. I would recommend this product! Wow!
