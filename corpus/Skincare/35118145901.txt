i bought this lip scrub a few months ago and it’s truly just sugar and coconut butter. not rlly worth your money !! you can make your own at home with honey and sugar, for cheap. smells pretty good, but can be harsh on the lips. is pretty good at removing any dead skin on the lips ! it’s fine, not worth your money <3
