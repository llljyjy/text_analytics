Received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido. This is a good sunscreen for dry skin types. It wore nicely under my makeup and didn’t leave a white cast. Made my skin feel hydrated as well. Light-weight and did not break me out. Has the sunscreen scent but it does not bother me. I’d recommend this sunscreen for dry skin types. Good sunscreen
