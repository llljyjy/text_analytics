I’m in love! I have used this product for almost two weeks, and I am excited. Firstly, I have sensitive and allergic skin, so before using any product, I read all the ingredients and Tula’s serum; so far, so good. It’s a little itching initially, but I suggest that it might be my sensitivity. My face stays calm and so moisture in the morning Like it!
