After using this product for a few days I can say that I’m loving it. I’ve been using every night as part of my nighttime routine, and the next morning results are incredible. My skin look refreshed, like I slept for 8+hours (when I really don’t), plump,  and very soft. I person do like the thick consistency (it’s a little thicker than Vaseline) and what I also love it that Pillowgasm does not have a scent! I just know that this product will great for winter nan
