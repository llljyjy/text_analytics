I received a free sample of this from Influenster In exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve never tried any Korres products before this, but I am now truly a fan. This moisturizer does exactly what it claims. My face feels amazing after using, and I truly believe it did minimize the appearance of my pores. I also liked that it has salicylic acid. I have acne prone skin, and this has helped with a current acne episode to take out the redness and shrink my pimples. I will be purchasing this for full size, and I highly recommend. A Great Product
