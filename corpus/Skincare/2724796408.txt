I received this bundle complimentary from The Outset. I’m a huge fan of serums in general. I love that they’re multipurpose. This particular one is made to plump and prep. My skin feels instantly smoother, more hydrated and silky after I use this. It’s not tacky like some serums can be either. Great serum!
