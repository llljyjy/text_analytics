I’ve become a recent Josie Maran convert after discovering that I actually have quite sensitive skin and a lot of her products actually have great ingredients for sensitive skin. It’s hard to find a good sunscreen and I have tried many, rarely able to commit to continuing using the same one but this one is great! Will definitely rebuy even though I received this one complimentary from Josie Maran. nan
