I am in love with this toner.  I’ve always used a toner, usually one of Lancôme’s.  They didn’t seem to do much.  But after just a couple of weeks of daily use, I began noticing the texture of my skin was becoming firmer, s and smoother to the touch!  I’m actually excited about The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toning Solution!  It’s a keeper! Changed the texture of my skin over time!
