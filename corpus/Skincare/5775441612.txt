Thanks to Laneige and Topbox Circle for gifting me this Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence in exchange for my review!!!There’s no scent, and the consistency is like water. I either pour some on a cotton pad or splash into my hands and onto my face.In the 2 weeks time, my skin is a lot brighter and had an even tone.It’s also way softy than before.I will be purchasing and adding this to my routine. Love it!!!
