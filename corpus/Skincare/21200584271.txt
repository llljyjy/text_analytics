I received the poop cloudberry exfoliating jelly cleanser free from influencer for my honest opinion. I have oily skin with some breakouts occasionally. I did enjoy this exfoliating jelly cleanser ,it was not to hard on my skin like other exfoliating cleansers I have used in the past. My skin felt really clean afterwards.  I used it with my other night care skin products from the oridinary, and my skin didnâ€™t have a reaction from it. I would give this a try. Goop cloud berry exfoliating jelly cleanser
