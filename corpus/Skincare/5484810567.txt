Product seems good, doesn’t cause me to breakout. Price point is hard to beat! I wouldn’t call it a substitute for drunk elephant though. Unfortunately the pump absolutely sucks! Often have to pump it about 5 times to get any product out and sometimes I have to actually take the lid off to get to the product. good for the price point.
