Although it does take away any excess oil on my skin and doesn’t leave me greasy, I still prefer having that dewy glowy look and unfortunately this just doesn’t give me that. It feels nice when applying, but I have to put an oil anddd a hydrating facial spray to maintain the glow (and I’m combo skin) not enough glow to my face
