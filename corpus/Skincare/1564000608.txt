I’ve always loved Clinique moisturizers. I stopped buying them quite a few years ago (for no other reason than I found a less pricy drugstore equivalent) and this was my first time back with Clinique in awhile. I loved this moisturizer! It did a great job with the dry spot I can never get rid of by my nose, I didn’t see any flakiness throughout the day, and wore really well under makeup. Wonderful product! nan
