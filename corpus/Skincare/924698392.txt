Ok so I’ve been using it nightly for about 3 weeks now, and it has helped my texture. My skin feels smoother where it was once rough. As for acne marks… not so much. My acne marks have faded, but not any sooner than they would have normally (Again it’s been 3 weeks). I also am breaking out right now and it’s doing absolutely nothing to heal those pimples. Helped with texture, not with acne scars or acne
