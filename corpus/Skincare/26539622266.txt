I am not a big fan of using pads on my skin, and avoid using pads or and cleaning wipes onto my skin, though I have used these and like how they donâ€™t tingle or not harsh on my skin. So I do like using them 2-3 times a week After I have cleansed my skin. Definitely a great addition to my night routine nan
