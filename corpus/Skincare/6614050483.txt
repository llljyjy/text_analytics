Really helps with large inflamed pimples. I had a giant one on my cheek and applying this for 2 nights made it completely shrink down and heal! Usually my pimples can take up to a week to go away but this was a lifesaver! I found this helped much more than mighty patches which I heard can damage your skin barrier. The only thing is it can burn a little when you put it on but only for about a minute! Definitely would purchase but a little goes a really long way! Actually helps!
