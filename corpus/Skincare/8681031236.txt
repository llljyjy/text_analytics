I’m not sure what the reviews complaining about it being difficult are on about. It’s a clear spray, but when you spray it thoroughly and blend it out it’s quite easy to tell where you have and haven’t done. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling too oily, just make sure to let it dry down (I stand in front of a fan for a min and I’m good to go). It’s also buildable. I’m super pale, and this gave me enough color to look tan (for me) without looking orange Works perfectly for my pale-ness
