I’ve been loving this cleansing balm for months now! So much bang for your buck with this. I have dry/normal skin and this has been perfect. It’s the first step in my double cleanse, but I also use it as my only cleanser on days I don’t wear makeup and want something super gentle/nourishing. Only loses a star because sometimes it can be a tad too thick to squeeze out easily. nan
