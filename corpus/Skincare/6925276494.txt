It’s an ok moisturizer. Feels fairly lightweight and kept my face from feeling dry for a bit. The smell wasn’t too bad. It’s one of those “unscented” smells that kinda smells like something and nothing at the same time. Doesn’t smell bad but also doesn’t smell good. Overall, I would use this again if I had it with me as a travel moisturizer, but it is not my favorite. nan
