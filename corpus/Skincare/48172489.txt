I recieved this product free for my honest review. I wasnt quite sure what to expect from a recovery balm,  especially one that can be used for face AND body. I have oily skin so I was a bit worried about trying it. Well...its awesome!!  it feels rich but  absorbed into my skin perfectly.  My cheeksget a little rough in the winter ..especially Wisconsin winters, and this helped smooth them.  I used this on my neck and chest as well.. very nice! There is only a very very slight smell.  I will be buying this in the future!! nan
