I received this in exchange for my honest review and I can honestly say that I am liking this eye cream it has a thick and creamy formula and leaves your under eyes smooth I am loving this addition to my skincare routine. I like it more under my concealer like the brand suggests it makes my application smoother afterwards I am excited to see the long term results! I also love that its a clean product which is important to me in makeup products and especially in skincare products. Creamy smooth texture!
