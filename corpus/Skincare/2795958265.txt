I love this product. Having suffered from extremely reactive and hormonal skin since I was 18, it takes a lot for me to truly love something. This product makes my skin feel like it’s drinking a cool glass of water, and it’s so gooey and happy after. I use this morning, night and afternoon for a quick pick me up when I see my skin is looking stressed or extra oily. It swaps out the greasy look so a more subtle dew while who wouldn’t love. When I have an angry pimple I carry on my my routine as usual and give tray spot a few extra spritzes; works like a charm. The smell is definitely not great, but I am okay with it if it means there is no added fragrance (BAD FOR YOUR SKIN)! Overall, this is a must have in your Beaty cabinet and the travel size is a great addition to your purse! great staple product
