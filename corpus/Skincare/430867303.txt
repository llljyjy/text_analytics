This is my first time purchasing and I truly love it.  I’ve tried other gel moisturizers and they haven’t worked for me.  Something was off, too much silicone or my skin was too shiny or sticky afterwards but this is different.  I can use it under my sunscreen in the morning and beneath my retinol in the evening.
