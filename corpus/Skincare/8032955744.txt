This is my favorite sunscreen out of the 2021 sun safety kit! I love the dewy finish and high SPF. Initially I was worried it wouldn’t work for me because I have neutral/cool undertones and the tint is very yellow-toned, but it blends in PERFECTLY and just evens out my natural skin color. It doesn’t look like I’m wearing any sort of foundation/tint at all. Love this product! nan
