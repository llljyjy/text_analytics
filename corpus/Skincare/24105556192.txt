I tried this for 2 weeks to decide how I liked it, before writing a review. I have dry/combo skin, and I saw nice changes in my skin within the first week. The look of fine lines decreased, and the overall texture & tone increased! Firmer, brighter, youthful looking skin... I am so happy with the results I am seeing! This cream is medium thickness, and very luxurious feeling while applying. Super hydration, with a very light, pleasant scent. A small amount does the trick, which makes it a lot easier to go for the splurge because it will last a while! The packaging looks very upscale as well. This cream gives visible results, and is worth its value for sure! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Visible results!
