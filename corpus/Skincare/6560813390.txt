Got a sample of this in a recent order.  I thought I received a bad sample because it smelled horrible, but after reading reviews I can see that it’s just the way the product smells.  Grateful for the sample because if I had bought this I would have immediately returned it. It’s also not very moisturizing as my skin felt really dry after applying it. nan
