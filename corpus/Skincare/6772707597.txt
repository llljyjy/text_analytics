My favorite moisturizer by far! A little goes a very long way so it lasts for a really long time but as soon as I’m getting low on the product I have to make sure to go by another one so I don’t run out. It’s thick but light on the skin and has a pleasant smell. It’s literally my holy grail! Heaven on earth
