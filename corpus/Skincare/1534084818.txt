I had received this as a gift along time ago and loved it. Especially during the winter months when my skin needs the most TLC. I had completely forgot about it until someone mentioned it to me the other day. I repurchased it and safe ti say it is still as amazing as a remember it. I put this on as the last step in my night time routine to lock everything else in. A little goes a long way as it has great slip. When I wake up my skin looks and feels AMAZING nan
