My skin has been super dry and flakey since starting tretinoin, so I tried this product. I needed something to spray on my face throughout the day to help with the dryness but didn’t mess up my makeup. This seems to work pretty well, I like how it also makes my makeup look dewy. I would’ve given it 5 stars if it wasn’t overpriced. Good for spraying over makeup
