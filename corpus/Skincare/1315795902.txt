For all the people complaining about the smell, it smells like... you guessed it, Turmeric. The ingredient called out in the name. So you got what you bought, itâ€™s just not masked by some other added fragrance. I love this oil, and I think the smell is nice, it makes my dry winter face all glowy. Love!
