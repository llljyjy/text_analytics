Really sad to say that it made me break like nothing ever has!! I’ve never felt so insecure :(It took me a while to realize that the burning I was feeling was not good because my face usually burns a lot during the winter because of how dry it is. 20 days into use it the burning never stopped. That’s when I connected the dots to my recent abnormal breakout. I give it two stars because my worked wonders on my girlfriend face! She loves it and it is helping her dryness. :) sad and full of acne
