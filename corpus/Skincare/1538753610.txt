I bought this sunscreen after hearing all the hype around it, and unfortunately I’m not blown away. I was hoping for better.I’ll start with the positives: it leaves zero white cast on the skin. There is no noticeable odor to it. It’s a higher SPF with it being SPF 40. It truly is undetectable on the skin. People say its a great base for makeup with its silicone primer like texture. The negatives: the texture is not pleasant, its like a silicone primer, but greasy feeling. If you use a decent amount of product (which you need to in order to get proper coverage), it pills up. I’d say my skin is slightly sensitive, and this completely broke me out- white heads, clogged pores, really deep, red pimples too. I don’t see myself using/repurchasing this again, which is too bad considering how hyped it is and how many people seem to have success with it. Caused lots of breakouts- was hoping for better
