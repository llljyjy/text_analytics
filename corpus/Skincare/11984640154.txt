I really liked this eye serum! I found it very hydrating and it has a nice smell! The formula is not very light, it feels oil based but I felt it did help a bit with my dark circles. It contains turmeric which has great anti aging properties, However 7 days of product was not enough to notice any real difference. I received this product From influenster for honest review! Hydrating and brightening
