Wow I’m impressed! I tried this for 2 weeks and love it! It makes my skin feel super soft but also, I have dry skin that congests very easily. This didn’t break me out! A little goes a long way and it can feel greasy if you apply too much. But just a small amount and it sinks in and leaves my face feeling really soft! Smells a lot like the original confidence in a cream too. If your skin congests easily like mine, I highly recommend! Didn't congest my skin!
