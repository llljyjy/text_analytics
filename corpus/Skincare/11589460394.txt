ive been waiting for GR to create an SPF for a long time now and i can 100% say im very impressed!! its lightweight yet super hydrating, blends seamlessly into the skin leaving no whitecast in sight and it leaves behind the most beautiful non-greasy looking glow! i only wish it had a stronger watermelon scent like the rest of their watermelon line, but hey at least it doesnt have that gross sunscreen smell we all love to hate! love it!!
