I purchased this on QVC beauty buys & I had to post here! I love it. After using at night my skin feels clean and fresh. My skin looks better and although it’s expensive, I’m going to have buy it. It doesn’t irritate my eyes (this is my biggest problem w/ face cleansers)and takes off my make up!! Love this.. I had oily skin but now it’s gotten idk from normal to dry to a sweaty looking…lol I thought it was oily but I think it’s b/c I’m hot…lol  I would try a sample 1st. And on QVC they had sample sizes and it lasted for a month! Buy it if you want that feel clean, won’t irritate your eyes cleanser. So fresh & so clean! Does not irritate my eyes!
