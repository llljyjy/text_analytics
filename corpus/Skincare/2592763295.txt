I got this included as a sample in one of my recent purchases and I’m impressed! I noticed it was tinted and I typically don’t like tinted sunscreen but this leaves such a beautiful finish. It probably has to be the most lightweight suncreen I’ve used, I feel like I have nothing on. It gives me a radiant, lit from within glow. I prefer this Super Goop’s glow screen. Highly reccomend! Found my new favorite glowy sunscreen!
