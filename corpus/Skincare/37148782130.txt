I got Luna Sleeping Retinoid Night Oil as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and used it consecutively for more than a week. I know it should be at least 2-4 weeks to see a difference, but I canâ€™t seem to continue. I love the color and it made my skin moisturized, but I do not like the smell and made my face a bit itchy. nan
