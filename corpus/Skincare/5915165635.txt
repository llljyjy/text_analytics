At 28 years old, I have always had issues with texture bumps on my cheeks and jaw. I have tried many different acids and exfoliates, but nothing had worked as well as this. This product is a game changer. I started to see a noticeable results around 2 weeks. However, It has taken about 6 weeks of regular use to get amazing results. I did have to start slow with using 2-3x a week and now I have worked up to 4-5x a week. Also make sure you have a gentle daily cleanser, a good day time spf and moisturizer when using this. CHANGED MY SKIN. SO SMOOTH.
