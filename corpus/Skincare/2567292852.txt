I obtained a small bottle of this product through the reward bazaar and I have to say I love it! I used it as a primer while I was traveling to LA and Abu Dhabi in October.  I used the facial brew during my morning routines and it didnâ€™t cause any breakouts or redness and it helped my skin feel moisturized during the day.  I enjoyed the product so much that I will continue to use it and will purchase a larger bottle to use during the winter months. Great addition to routine!
