I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion through influenster. I love the packaging, I love the scent. I don’t love the product. The mist is so fine which is great but I don’t see a difference in my makeup when I use it. It is a fun product to have but I’m not sure that it works as well as other affordable brands nan
