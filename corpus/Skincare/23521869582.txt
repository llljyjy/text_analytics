This is a great product but it comes with extra steps you need to take in order to not ruin your skin - use this at night, way too strong to use while the sun is out even with sunscreen- use this after a HYDRATING cleanser, nothing for acne - don’t combine this with any other actives AT ALL- afterwards put on a ceramide cream -  then slug your face!!!! This is how to prevent dryness Yeah then your skin will be poppin :) great product, just need to be aware of the other steps so your skin doesn’t dry out! tips for usage!!!
