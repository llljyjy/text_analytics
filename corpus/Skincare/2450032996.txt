So far I’ve really liked this product, it is easy to use, lightweight, and smells good! I like how it feels and sits well under my makeup. My one complaint is that it is marketed as “clean” by Sephora but when I look up the ingredients on other apps there are concerns for ingredients being restricted in the European Union, and potentially harmful in pregnancy making me disinterested in continuing to use the product. nan
