I have been using this product for about a week and I have had no issues with skin sensitivity. I have very sensitive combination skin on my face. On my body my skin in very sensitive as well and Iâ€™m very prone to breaking out in hives depending on the products I use. This bar left my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy which is great because my skin is oiler in the summer. It also left my skin feeling very smooth I like it more for my body than my face especially because it calmed my skin down from a reaction that I was having from using another product before that. Works on my combination skin !
