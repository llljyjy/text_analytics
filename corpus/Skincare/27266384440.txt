So far this product has been working very well for my skin. I have combination skin, I’ve always used niacinamide is my skin care routine and it’s always worked for me. If we’re comparing to the ordinary serum, I find theinkey list product has a nicer texture and feels really nice and smooth on the skin. Love it!!
