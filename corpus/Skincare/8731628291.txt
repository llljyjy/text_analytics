I didnâ€™t expect to like this #freeproduct that I received from #trywithtopbox - but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought because it went on thick that my skin would be oily afterwards but instead my dry skin soaked It right up and it felt great. One of the odd things is that I liked its fresh smell (I usually hate strong fragrances) and I love that green tea is one of the main ingredients. Highly recommend!! Pleasantly surprised
