I’ve been using this for two years and love the results it continues to deliver, you don’t need a lot, just a light coating with the finger.  I do not have bags, dark circles or discoloration.  My under eye is smooth bright and no where near 45.  My dermatologist tells me the skin under my eyes and on my forehead are 30 year old skin, of course I never use botox or fillers. This cream helps, but not drinking coffee, or alcohol, smoking, or eating grains are all things to eliminate for beautiful skin, it’s not tatcha only obviously.  lol feed your body amazing clean food and your skin will reflect that.buy it if you want, it will only do so much, it’s not magic, no skin products are nice
