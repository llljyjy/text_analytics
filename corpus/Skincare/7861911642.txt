I tried this serum after switching from another retinol and I am pleasantly surprised by how much I love this. The serum itself has a very mild and clean smell, and it distributes over your skin very easily. I received this product complimentary from Murad. I’ve been using this every other night and although I haven’t experienced any purging like is cautioned with other retinols, my skin is glowing. I use one pump on my face and another pump on my neck and décolletage at night after cleansing and before moisturizer. I don’t have a ton of fine lines or wrinkles to tackle but this serum makes me glow! I have oily skin primarily and am now waking up with my skin feeling like a baby’s bottom instead of an oil slick.
