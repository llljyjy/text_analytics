The packaging is so cute and I like how everything for the routine is included! The only issue I had was with the last step. It took a lot of work to warm the product to have the color change to match my skin from the green. It did a pretty good job covering the red on my cheeks though. It did stay/feel a little greasy all day, but looked nice in person and in photos. I recovered this item for free, and was asked for an honest review Good but not great
