I’m in my mid 30’s and my skin is changing. I don’t really enjoy wearing makeup anymore. This cream has been a skin saver for me. I tend to have dryer skin especially in the summer months. My face drinks this up leaving me with plumper smooth skin. Like baby soft.  It isn’t sticky and absorbs well.  I haven’t noticed any breakouts. I will say this is a heavier cream and a little goes a long way and as the cream is titled I do feel more confident. It doesn’t erase your wrinkles but helps to hydrate and plump it and I’m happy with it. nan
