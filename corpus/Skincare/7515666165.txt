I received a full sized sample of La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser by Dior from Influenster, in exchange for my honest review of the product.  I have been using this product every morning for almost a month now. I love the gentle texture and smell of this cleanser, it felt great on my skin. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that it could be more hydrating. I did appreciate that this formula is gentle enough to maintain my skinâ€™s hydration barrier and not throw off my pH. I did notice more blackheads coming up to the surface of my skin and used a separate cleanser a few nights a week to exfoliate them away. I think the price point is fair and on par with the products I currently use. Great gentle cleanse
