I received a tiny #freeproduct sample of Cliniqueâ€™s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I was only given enough to use it for one day and a half so I was able to use it for two mornings and one evening. I really liked the texture and soft scent so that it felt comfortable on my skin and it felt pleasant. I would like to use it more to see it really makes a difference. Works so far
