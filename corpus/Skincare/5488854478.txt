while the results aren’t immediate/the spots haven’t totally disappeared, I can definitely tell it’s working on the spots I’ve been using it on. it also feels good on your skin; it’s not too oily or runny, so you can tell it’s good quality. happy to have tried this product! feels good and works well so far
