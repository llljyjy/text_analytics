When I first saw cloud cream, I assumed it would be light and airy feeling.  Boy was I wrong, it is a fantastic moisturizer!  It is nice and thick, and a little goes a long way.  The smell is also wonderful as I put it on just before bed, and the light lavender smell helps me relax for sleepy time.  This is the first product I have tried from Kiehl and I will be going back to try other products as it is perfect for my skin, doesnâ€™t smell too strong and is very moisturizing for my (ahem) old skin.  I am trying really hard to get as minimal fine lines and wrinkles as I can and this Kiehl Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is the perfect thing to help me on my journey. Wow Super Moisturizing!
