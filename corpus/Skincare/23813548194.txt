A complimentary from Josie Maran, the Get  Even Sun Milk is amazing! I love the feeling it gives my face. It’s dewy and moisturizes my face really well. I’m a big fan of it since it’s made with clean and conscious ingredients. It leaves a little bit of white cast but it’s definitely manageable compared to other brands. Will definitely keep this as my holy grail sunscreen for now! Dewy and Moisturizing
