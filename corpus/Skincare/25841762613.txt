This has tremendously helped with clearing up my acne scars and hyper-pigmentation. I had really bad acne in the summer - my whole face was super red and inflamed - which led to bad scars on my face, but this product helped speed up the clearing process! I first started using this in September, and it is now December, and my face has almost completely cleared! When I initially started using this, I used it every other morning, but after a week or so, when I found that my skin did not have any irritation with this, I began to use it every morning. I first wash my face, then apply this product with a cotton swab, and then wait 10-20 minutes to put my moisturizer on, so this product really sinks in to my face. I would recommend this for anybody who is struggling with acne scars or hyper-pigmentation! a skincare staple!!
