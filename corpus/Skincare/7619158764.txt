I received Lancôme Génifique Night Repair Cream from Bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. I have been using the night repair cream for the past few weeks and noticed significant differences in my skin. For one my face feels more hydrated and moisturized than before. The cream melts right into the skin and gets absorbed quickly. I have been really enjoying adding this cream to my night routine and will continue to use it. Amazing
