Such a fantastic product for a moisturizing , deeply hydrating cream. I haven’t used for long enough to be able to leave a testimonial on how the firming action works but my skin is SO glowy, I am oily so I usually only use this at night as a night cream. It is fragranced which I don’t love but it smells so nice and and is light enough  gifted by Fresh So moisturizing
