My favorite detail of this product is the fact that it doesn’t smell like an SPF lotion. It isn’t too light where it doesn’t feel like full coverage but not too heavy that it leaves a white residue. It’s a great balance that I apply once as a base and then makeup application. Its great as a moisturizer too but wouldn’t recommend for oily skin. I have combo and it works! Great spf + moisture combo!
