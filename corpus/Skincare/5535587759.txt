Bought one with high hopes….within a week the bottle clear plastic part cracked.  Had to exchange, no issues.  About 2 months into use, the brush head popped off.  Everytime I pushed up clear ‘sleeve’ brush came off and powder everywhere. It was past the exchange window, but they gave me merchandise credit.  Which was best, since I didn’t want it again.  There are better made mineral sunscreen brushes out there, I’d buy those instead. Poorly made
