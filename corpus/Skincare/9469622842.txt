Honestly, I saw no difference between using this or not. I generally use a vitamin c serum to reduce my dark circles and then a nice moisturizing collagen eye cream and that works just fine for me. I didn’t see a difference between my normal methods and this. Perhaps if I had been able to use it longer or control the amount of product a bit more than with the free sample I received in exchange for my review, I could give a more thorough review. But as it is, I wouldn’t recommend this nor spend my own money on it. nan
