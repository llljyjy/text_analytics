I like that this doubles as both a cleanser and makeup remover.  I have used it more so as a makeup remover than cleanser.  Just use a couple pumps on dry hands and massage it on dry face to break up all the makeup and then rinse off with warm water.  Works fairly well, although not 100% as I have to go back to get everything off.  Smell is very minimal and pleasant.  Used it as a cleanser as well, and it is gentle enough and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. nan
