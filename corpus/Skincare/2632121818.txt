I have been using this for almost two months now, right before getting this serum I had a breakout with hyperpigmentation scars. It usually takes 4-6 months for the hyperpigmentation scars to go away but I have seen a visible difference since using this product. The smell isnâ€™t strong and it goes away quickly. I did not break out when I started to use this. I still have more than half of the bottle after two months and I only use one pump for my whole face. I will purchase again! I love this product!
