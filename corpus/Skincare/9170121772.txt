I was expecting this product to be more like their cream, but I’m not disappointed! It’s a little grainy, but hardly noticeable. A lot of reviews talk about just how beige it gets, but I find a little goes a long way and if you use it sparingly you won’t get that orangey look. I love that it’s SPF and after a day of working in a mask, I can still see the product on my face. It doesn’t sink in light you might expect, but it doesn’t feel very heavy or noticeable. I honestly don’t wear nearly as much makeup with this on as it almost works as a bb cream because of the pigment. I don’t think I’d buy the full size but if you’re looking for an SPF that has an added boost of colour, this is for you. I will add that I’m very pale so the colour is gives me a nice tanned look, but I’m not sure how it looks on darker skin tones. maybe try it, maybe skip it
