I love Clinique, they have some great products. With that I wasn’t overly impressed with this product. It smells and feels good, but I didn’t see where it made a short term or long term difference. If using it strictly for moisture then definitely worth it. However, for the price point I am not  fully satisfied.Note: I did try this product for free and was only given a limited time to try it out. I will continue to use it and if my impression changes, I’ll update. Great Brand
