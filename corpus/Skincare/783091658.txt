This is a luxurious moisturizer. Thick and creamy consistency but amazingly lightweight once applied to your face. After two weeks of use the improvements were slight, but extremely encouraging.  My skin is softer, and the tone is becoming more radiant. I am excited to continue using this product. The smell of this cream is wonderful. It is not floral or medicinal, but a clean fresh scent.I have oily skin and this cream did not make me look any oilier.  This product did not irritate or breakout my skin. Impressive
