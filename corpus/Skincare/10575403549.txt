I’ve tried using them every two to three days. I have dark circles and I do feel the serum tingle and my eyes slightly less dark. I think it will require a lot of semi daily wearing and with the price that’s hard but if the cheaper eye masks I’ve tried I do feel some improvement for the 5-6 I’ve tried so far Feels tingly and slight improvement
