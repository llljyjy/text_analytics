I don’t usually write reviews, but this product is sooo good I had to. I have hormonal acne, and after two rounds of Accutane, it came back. I didn’t want to go back on the medication, but I felt super self-conscious about this problem. With that being said, I tried this mist after a friend recommended it to me, and it saved my skin. I think it did cause my acne to flare up at first, but after a couple of day my skin cleared up and it has been acne free since then. You really should give it a try ! Go buy it !!!
