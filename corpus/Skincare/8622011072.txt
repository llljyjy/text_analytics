This cream is very soft, silky and goes on like butter. It smells wonderful as well. I have been using this cream for a little over 2 weeks now, in the morning and at night, on my face, neck and chest. I honestly do not see much of a difference in my fine lines around my eyes much less the deep wrinkles I suffer with on my forehead. This cream does keep my skin extremely hydrated, especially all night, I wake up and my face is so smooth and silky. I would recommend this product for it’s wonderful hydrating qualities, however, I do not recommend this product for it’s claim to reduce wrinkles and fine lines unfortunately. Silky-smooth and Hydrating
