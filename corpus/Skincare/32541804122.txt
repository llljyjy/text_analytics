Thick cream that keeps the eye area hydrated throughout the day.  Did seem a bit heavy for this area though.  The application was more wiping than patting due to the consistency.  Due to its texture it did a great job of masking lines.  The cooling effect seemed to last a few minutes which is always nice in the morning. Eye luxury in a purple jar!
