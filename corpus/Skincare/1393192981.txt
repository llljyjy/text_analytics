I received this product from influenster to test and review. This is a nice hydrating gel eye cream. It’s lightweight and didn’t irritate my eyes. My under eyes were smooth and hydrated after using it for a couple of nights, but it didn’t improve the look of my dark circles. Overall, I would recommend this to you if your main concern is dryness. Meh
