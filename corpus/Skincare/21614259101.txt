I really enjoyed the product. It has a very creamy texture and definately heavy on the silicones. Which I find to be nice and hydrating. It also helps to fill in and plump up those fine lines around the eyes. I enjoy using this on my entire face as a small amount goes such a long way. I have just the start of aging and I think it works really great. Lovin it
