I was very excited when I received it for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.Honestly, I think it’s ok but not for me although I love Shiseido’ products so much.It has a lightweight, easy to apply, easy to absorb, the smell is nice but it’s so white for me. Beside that, it’s very watery, so need to be careful to get just little otherwise it will run all the way through your fingers. It’s good but not for me
