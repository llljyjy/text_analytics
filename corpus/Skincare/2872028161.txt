Was gifted by Cay Skin. Loved this product . I’ve used on a few different skin tones so far and it’s really got a great finish . The only area of opportunity I think is that it does take quite a bit of effort to work this product into the skin so it’s not a very efficient blend but once it’s in it’s a beautiful finish . I like it, but I don’t LOVE it
