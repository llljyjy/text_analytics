I received this #freeproduct from TopBox in return of my honest review.Due to only receiving a sample size I wasn’t really able to see much difference in my skin. It is a creamy serum that absorbs nicely into the skin leaving a nice subtle glow. My face looked great & felt moisturized after using it for just a few days & I love that it is scent free as I have sensitive skin. Will be purchasing this product soon! Love that it’s scent free!
