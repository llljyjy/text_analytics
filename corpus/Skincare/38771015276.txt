I started using this two days ago. So far Iâ€™ve really enjoyed how it has affected my skin. There is no burning or itching and it actually feels really nice around the eyes. I believe the dark circles under my eyes are getting better but I have to keep using it to tell more. I would totally recommend this to anyone give it a try! Pretty good so far!
