Title says it all!! I use it both day and night. It gives my skin a quick hydration without making it oily or feel heavy on the skin. In the morning I wear this before my makeup routine and gives me a subtle glow. Doesnâ€™t make the skin look shiny just looks like healthy skin. It does not affect how my foundation goes on top. Would definitely recommend! Healthy Skin Glow
