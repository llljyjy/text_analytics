I was skeptical about this at first because of the cost but after researching the ingredients I decided to give it a try. It’s not a staple in my skincare routine. I have combo/ oily skin and have been using this for 2 weeks now. I use it in the morning after I apply my vitamin C oil and it absorbs quickly into my skin. It’s not greasy at all but very hydrating and plumping. I wait about 10-15 minutes before applying any makeup and I have not had any issues with pilling. I follow up with an Spf sunscreen mist.
