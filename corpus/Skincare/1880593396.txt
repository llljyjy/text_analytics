I like that this cream is lightweight and feels soothing on my sensitive, dry skin. My cream spreads easily and feels like my face soaks it up. I donâ€™t mind that this product is fragrance free. My dry face skin could use a touch more moisture however, which is why I took away 1 star. Overall, this is a good face cream. Good face cream
