I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora for my honest review. I have a combo of dry and oily skin. The serum felt great when applied to my skin. However I was only able to use the product for two weeks because my skin became sensitive and itchy. This made me stop using the product after the second week. As a whole it was a nice product, the smell and how it applied to my skin was great. My honest review
