I wish I had before photos of my chest.  My acne was never horrible, but it was persistent and no matter what I used, it would always come back or not go away at all.  My chest was always red and had random breakouts all over it.  Since using this, it has been clear and has significantly reduced my breakouts to little to no acne.  I am so happy I tried this product and I will continue purchasing.  I use it maybe three times a week, right after a shower, a spritz or two all over my chest.  Miracle product, for sure! Yes Yes Yes!
