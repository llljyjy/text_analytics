Great product! I love the soft rose scent and it works like a charm. I believe it’s on or with the Glamglow bright eyes eye cream- just less pricy ;) My only issue is that for darker skin tones it leaves a bit of a pigment that I don’t like. But I usually use this at night and it’s virtually invisible I. Low light. But if you use it during the day I’m sure it’s easily blended out or covered by makeup. This is an incentivized review nan
