The texture is great! I did not see the blurring effect as much as I would have liked, but it was subtle. I also use powder foundation so that also may have had something to do with it. I would definitely try this with liquid foundation. There is no scent which is also nice, but I donâ€™t mind a little sometimes. It went on smoothly and made my skin feel hydrated and soft. Nice texture
