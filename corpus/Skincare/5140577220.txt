Please learn from my mistakes so you can enjoy this product. There was definitely trial and error with this sunscreen. First thing I learned: make sure you shake it really well before dispensing it. Next thing I learned it’s a serum. Not a normal sunscreen. What worked best for me was moisturizing first thing in the morning then when I went to put make up on I started with the serum. You can’t mix a moisturizer with this product. It pills.Lastly remember it will feel a little different on your face. That’s because it’s a mineral sunscreen. My skin has been so happy since I finally figured out how best to use this product. I hope you can too! There is a learning curve
