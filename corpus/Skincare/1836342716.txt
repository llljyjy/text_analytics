Great for removing vellous hair, leaves skin so smooth! I like to use this every 10 days or so to exfoliate and remove the peach fuzz from my face and neck as part of my nighttime routine. Iâ€™ll usually use nice nourishing actives and moisturizers afterwards to make sure my skin wont be irritated. The blades are very sharp so I recommend just being mindful and taking your time on areas of contour like the jaw and around the nose. Love that the blades are replaceable, so much less wasteful than the disposable plastic razors!! nan
