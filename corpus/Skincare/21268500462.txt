I’m kind of impressed with this product! I’ve had issues with lions around my eyes especially when I smile and still lasting even after I’ve stopped smiling. Along with that I’ve had problems with my skin being too dry all around my eye and puffiness as well so I was really eager and excited to try this product. After having used it on a daily basis for the last few weeks I’ve noticed a decrease in the visibility of the lines.  In addition to that I have also experienced a lot less puffiness and it seems to absorb really well really quick. The product is really creamy and it feels luxurious and not greasy which is what I appreciate. Also, it’s not heavily scented so I don’t have to worry about that irritating my skin or my eyes. Less puffiness, luxurious
