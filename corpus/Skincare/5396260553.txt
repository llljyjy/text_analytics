I was super excited to try this product and have been basically since I got it. I lost the before picture because I got a new phone but I feel like I lost so much of my texture and discoloration. The picture attached is in the morning before even washing my face and my skin looks great. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it took trial and error with my routine to add it in, with my usual moisturizer I was getting pilling of the product which was unfortunate. I found the a light gel moisturizer after the serum seemed to act as a barrier between my actual moisturizer and the serum and stopped the pilling. Overall I think itâ€™s very worth it and my skin looks great, it just takes some time to find the right products with it. Skin Looks Great But Can Pill
