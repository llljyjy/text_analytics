My new favorite daily moisturizer because it is super hydrating and refreshing, and it plumps up my skin. Liquid foundations can tend to look flakey when my skin is dry and this provides a great base of hydration. I will also use at night to layer over my serum for an added hydration boost. I love it! New Favorite!
