My first impressions of this product were that the scent is lovely (like creamsicle, but not over-powering), I love that it comes in a pump, and I’m a fan of the ingredients. After using it for a bit I wasn’t over the moon because it is a very light moisturizer, and sometimes my skin didn’t feel as dewy after use as I would have liked.HOWEVER, now that I’ve been using it for a little while I absolutely love what it does for my skin. I’ve seen a noticeable improvement in my skin tone and brightness. Like, I was looking in the mirror the other day and wondering why I looked so refreshed and realized it’s from this cream!So, while I wouldn’t recommend using it alone if you have very dry skin, I am pretty blown away with how it has improved my complexion. nan
