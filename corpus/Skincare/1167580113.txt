I soooo wanted to see great results with this product!  The first couple days I thought my skin looked great!  Within the next few days I started noticed small breakout areas which at first I didn’t even realize could be a result of this product because I haven’t had a breakout in years.  Well here I am - 44 years old waiting for a pimple in the middle of my cheek to go away.  Disappointed but I still love the brand. nan
