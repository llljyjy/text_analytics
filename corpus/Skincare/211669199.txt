I was iffy on this one but I’m such a Dior fan that I had to give it a fair try. I had several concerns going into this test:· Is it greasy (it’s not!)· It it heavily fragranced (not at all!)· Is it going to break me out (not even a little!)I am so, so happy with this balm that I expect to buy a second tube before this one is even gone. It’s that good! My skin adores it. It sinks in perfectly without being sticky or leaving my skin shiny or tacky. It immediately makes my skin feel soothed. I had a reaction to an enzyme scrub mask and was bright red after removing it. I immediately reached for the Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm and slathered it on several times that evening and one final time before going to bed. I woke up with to trace of the enzyme burn. The redness and heat were completely gone and my skin was soft and felt hydrated and happy.In my honest opinion, this is one product everyone should have. No question! Two thumbs way up!
