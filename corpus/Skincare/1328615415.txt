This is a good Vitamin C cream, with sunscreen.  It’s lightweight, not greasy, seems to have smoothed out my skin, softened even deep wrinkles, and doesn’t irritate my skin.  It has a light citrus scent which I personally like - the scent doesn’t last long. I am in my 60’s with aging skin.  This cream seems to actually be doing something good - I would definitely recommend it. Good Vitamin C cream with Sunscreen
