I was given this product complimentary from Clinique via Influenster for my honest review.  The product moisturizes , smoothe and decreases some lines or wrinkles. I can’t say how long it will take for you to see results but this way my pre-moisturized  and post application eye pics after one use. I cannot speak to ongoing affects or them being long lasting but this cream works depending on the causes of your creases. The cream has no fragrance and it applies easily. A littlenwill.go.a long way. If you get it in your eyes, it will blur your vision some and cause a light irritation but nothing like some other creams I’ve tried. I love Clinique products  overall and recommend  you give it a try to see how it works for you. The pics tell the story!
