Hands down best moisturizer I’ve ever used. The price point is pretty steep but it is so worth it. I have very dry skin and have used many MANY high end moisturizers, this one by far has been my favorite. Perfect for my dry skin especially during cold winters. I’ve never used a moisturizer than even on my dry skin leaves my face feeling Dewey and moisturized all day. It’s also great under foundation.Almost feels like a primer under my makeup. I get a rash under my nose from wearing a mask and I’ve noticed significant results from this. If you have dry skin or on the fence just try it you will not regret it. Holy Grail for Dry Skin!
