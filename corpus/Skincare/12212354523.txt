Have been using this as part of nightly routine for the past few weeks and am pleased with how instantly hydrated it makes my skin feel. Also pleasantly surprised that I’ve felt no irritation from the retinal. My only complaint is the smell which slightly resembles play dough? Not bad but not my fave. Overall I’m satisfied and plan to keep this in my routine! A great addition for nightly routine
