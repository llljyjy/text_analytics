I really liked the feel of this eye cream! I have been using it every day at least 1-2x per day but for only 2 weeks. I haven’t noticed much of a different in my wrinkles but I do love the moisturizing feel. I will keep using it in hopes it’ll work on my wrinkles and because I like the feel of it. Left pic is of the first time I tried it and right is two weeks later. Liked it but not confident it reduces wrinkles.
