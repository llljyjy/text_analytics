I can’t believe some of the unhappy reviews on this cream.  I have a very red chest due to broken blood vessels.  Went to the cosmetic spa where I get botox done and got a consult to repair it.  Got a quote of $1,000 and 3 laser treatments that only last 2 years and have to do it again.I saw this cream and thought it was worth a try.  I put it on my chest once and it instantly corrected the redness.  The next day I noticed the redness had reduced significantly without the cream being on it any longer.  I’ve now been using it for a week and my chest looks completely normal again. My 12-year-old stepson sits across from me at the dinner table and has made comments several times about my red chest this summer when I’ve been wearing summer tops that expose my chest, asking me why it is so read, and I began to feel very self-conscious about it.  After using this only for a couple of days he asked me what I did to my chest to make the red go away.  Out of the mouths of babes, as they say.  If he noticed it, I would say that is a rave review.  I’m so happy I found this cream.As a side note, I have extremely dark under eyes that take a lot of work to cover.  I decided to put this on there, and the darkness is instantly reduced.  I’m in my 50s and do not sleep well due to menopause so the darkness is real.  I’m telling you this stuff does what it claims.  This is not a paid or influenced endorsement.  This is just a regular woman telling you my extraordinary experience with this.  I’m amazed and so satisfied with the results.I’m not sure if these results will be long-term but even if I have to continue to use it I’m still happy about it.  Yes, it is on the expensive side for the size of the container but you barely need any of it so it really should last. Beyond Amazing!!
