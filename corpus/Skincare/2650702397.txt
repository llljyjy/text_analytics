I really liked this product. I used it at night time after my serum and with my wishful rose oil and my skin looked amazing. This product worked really well with my rose oil and didn’t make my face look greasy. When u woke up in the morning joy face looked plum and hydrated. It also made my skin feel smooth to the touch and silky. I have not been using it long enough to know if it’s working on my pores but my face looks great. I would recommend this product! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. nan
