This product is a great addition to your skincare routine! It also smells pleasant, which I enjoy too. It has helped with my skin’s uneven texture so far. I’ve been using this product for about a week now so of course no major has happened yet, but I am pleased with the results so far and hope it continues to help me. The reason I took off a star was due to the price and the fact it absorbs a bit too fast before I get the chance to evenly distribute it, leading me to apply a bit more. Overall, this product is worth a try! nan
