Really dissappointed. I was looking for a daily mositurizer + SPF and this claimed thats what it was. It also claims it’s great with make it which I highly doubt. Its extremely greasy. Like its been two hours since I applied and I didnt even bother with make up because I am still pulling oil off my face. It also does NOT smell good. Dont waste your money. Really bummed about this one. I was looking forward to protecting myself daily, not just at the beach, and this wont do. I’m also assuming here, but I doubt this would do well in water AT THE BEACH. Over all BAD purchase - SUPER GREASY
