I picked a Sephora promotion for both this and the yellow one(I forget the name) in a sample size.  Loved how this Moon Fruit felt, not so much the yellow. I then got the full-size. It’s the 1st product to diminish my random dark brown spots under each of my eyes (probably from over-tanning in the late 90’s- mid 00’s).  I experimented with this each night (missing a few, not going to lie),and wow it worked. Only took under 2wks to see the fading. Never had anything work to see results like this.I’m so cranky that I didn’t take a before photo to show you all the after. Overall, I am so happy with this, but the key word is “I”. Just b/c it happens to work for me, may not mean it works the same for you (but hope it does) Always take these reviews as suggestions not deciding factors. A skincare product that actually worked for me
