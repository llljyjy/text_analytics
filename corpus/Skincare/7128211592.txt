I was skeptical about adding an essence to my routine because it seemed like another product to waste money on but I love this! My skin feels fresh and hydrated. I love the whole vitamin C line from Ole and this is another winner for me. A little goes a long way and itâ€™s a big bottle too so definitely worth the price! nan
