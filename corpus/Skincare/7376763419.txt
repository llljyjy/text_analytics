Thank you to Influenster and Estée Lauder for this product sample. I love that this cream doesn’t feel heavy and it is light and airy. It also leaves my under eye feeling hydrated and tight. I like that you can feel it working right away. Yes, the cream doesn’t work magic as soon as you use it but overtime, I did notice the darkness under my eyes lightening. It doesn’t happen as soon as one week or even two, but constant use at night and it does help. Would definitely recommend and purchase. Moisturizing!
