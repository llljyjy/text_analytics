I have really dry lips and this usually results in the skin around my lips peeling too (sexy, I know). This product is a game changer. At first I thought the product would be hard, but it warms up as soon as you get a tiny bit on your finger and is super easy to apply. By the second morning my lips were completely healed and felt amazing. Bonus: it smells delicious and fruity. A must for dry lips
