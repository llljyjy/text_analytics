I really wanted to like this cleanser but didn’t feel it actually clean my face at all.  It was too creamy and ’soft’ for my liking and my face didn’t feel clean at all - I had to use my normal cleanser afterwards to get that face wash feeling.  While the scent was nice, It doesn’t do it for me unfortunately (have normal skin overall with some dryness during the winter months).  Perhaps it might be better suited for those with really sensitive skin. Pretty but....
