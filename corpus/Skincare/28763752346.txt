I found that this cleanser was very similar to Kiehl’s Since 1851 Ultra Facial Cleanser in that it does remove impurities such as dirt and oil from your skin very effectively, but it feels to me like my skin has been stripped of moisture after using it. If you like a very “squeaky clean“ feeling after using a cleanser, then I would recommend this one, but if you have skin that’s on the drier side, I would either find another cleanser or make sure that you tone and moisturize right after cleansing with this product. This cleanser has a little bit of fragrance in it (less than 1%, according to the ingredient list) but I really can’t smell any sort of discernible scent in it. I think that it shouldn’t be too irritating to anyone unless they are severely allergic to fragrance in skincare. One thing that I do really like about this product is that it’s half the price of the Kiehl’s cleanser, even though they’re about the same size. So if you’re trying to choose between those two options, then I would definitely go with this one, because they are so similar, but this one is such a better value. In the end, I would recommend this cleanser to people with oilier skin, or people wanting a “squeaky clean“ feeling after cleansing (perhaps after a workout or something like that, where impurities will have built up in the skin). I would just recommend toning and moisturizing almost right after applying this product. Fairly Priced Cleanser that Gets the Job Done
