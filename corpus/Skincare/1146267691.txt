I received this as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. I liked the serum, but I found it quite difficult to use in the little packets it was sent in. It was hard to make sure I got appropriate amounts of both serum squished out of the foil packs and th st was pretty annoying.  If this were in a pump that pumped out both s erums at the same time I might like it better. It did leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized, so I DO like it, I just wouldnâ€™t purchase again unless it was in a normal bottle.  #doubleserum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Nice product
