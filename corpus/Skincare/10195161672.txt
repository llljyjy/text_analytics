I received this product in exchange for my honest review. After a few days of use, I’m liking the moisturizing effect without leaving me greasy or oily. I haven’t noticed much difference in my pores but I only received a sample size. There is not much of a scent but the acid in the ingredients does cause a mild irritation in my skin. nan
