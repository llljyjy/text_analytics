This product is thick and cream so a little goes along way. The best application is to take your fingers and dab product on parts of face and then rub it into skin. I love how soft it makes my skin feel and natural glow I have after (see photo). It really makes my skin feel hydrated without the greasy feeling. The only issue I have is that it smells like baby poo in my opinion lol. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I would recommend. Great hydration, awful smell
