AMAZING IN LOVE!!!! For preface, I have been using YTTP Superfood cleanser day and night for months and love it, but wanted to up my skincare game. I can say my face feels EVEN MORE CLEAN than the YTTP, especially after my clearly clean cleansing balm from Farmacy!! I love that Tata packs as many potent ingredients into each product for maximum effects and results, use beautiful and recyclable packaging and is 100% natural. It really meets my values AND my maximalist skincare ideology so I can’t be more thrilled with this purchase. I also love that they offer refills for products to cut down on waste, al though the refills are in plastic so it’s a little green washed but still they’re making an effort and that’s more than most do!!!! 11/10 recommend i am going to try and use as much Tata as I can from here on out. Worth the price tag, better than YTTP superfood
