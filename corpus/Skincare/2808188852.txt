First the positives: It wasn’t greasy and absorbed quickly. The scent was very mild and not overwhelming. I liked that it had two different components that were mixed together right before application.The drawbacks: I didn’t notice any difference in my skin after the week treatment. Maybe if I had used it longer than a week, I would have seen results. nan
