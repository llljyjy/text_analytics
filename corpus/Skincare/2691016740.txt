Very expensive and.. I haven’t noticed any difference? It feels good, yeah, but so do creams that are way cheaper. Also the packaging make it seems like there is more product than there really is. I was very surprised when I realized I finished the bottle, usually eye creams last a long time for me, this was barely a couple of months? I don’t even use it twice a day... I did buy it on sale and still think it wasn’t worth it, and I wouldn’t pay full price for it for sure. Not sure it does anything...
