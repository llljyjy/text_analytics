ShiseidoBenefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Contour Retinol Serum is a luxe serum, formulated with retinol but none of the “bad” stuff.

I do see a difference in the fine lines around ny eyes and lips, and my skin overall does look fresher. The bottle looks gorgeous in my bathroom too. However, while this seems to work well, the price is a bit steep for me. Luxe Retinol Serum
