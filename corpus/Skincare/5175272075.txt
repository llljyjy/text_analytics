This oil is great and has been part of my skincare routine for the past few years now. Ever since I moved to the south, my once oily skin has turned dry and this oil has helped keep it hydrating without breaking me out and seems to keep it calm and even. It absorbs into the skin in a way I haven’t seen with other oils (though I haven’t tried that many). The only downside is the price, which is why I go back and forth between this one and The Ordinary’s version, which also works very nicely but is much more affordable. However, this one seems to add an extra glow to the skin that the other one lacks, which is why I always come back to this one. nan
