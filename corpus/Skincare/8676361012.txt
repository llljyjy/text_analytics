I received this product, complementary, in exchange for my honest review. It’s hard to know what the results would be long-term since I only received a travel size sample. I use Retin-A and found that the salicylic acid in this moisturizer, coupled with winter weather, was drying. That said, I have used several Korres products over the years and have really enjoyed them! This particular product just didn’t work for my skin. A bit drying
