This moisturizer has all the best active ingredients you could ever want in a skincare product! It is a perfect summertime face moisturizer for me because it’s light so I don’t feel like a grease ball as soon as I step outside and layers well with other products when I use at nighttime before bed. It mixes/layers perfectly with the supergoop matte sunscreen spf40, it’s really a perfect balance. Rich yet light
