First off I want to say as a MUA with over 7 yrs of experience I have very few lip treatments that I love and Kosas has become one of my new faves. I love the fact that this is not only a nighttime treatment. When applied it is very buttery and soft on the lips definitely improve the appearance of my lips. This product does have a subtle scent like the lip oil which I love is not overwhelming. I feel like it did smooth my lips hopefully with more wear overtime I’ll have more insight on the plumping aspect of this product. I love that is not sticky or tacky and didn’t leave any white residue behind which I appreciate as some in the market do. I have nothing but positive things to say I think this is a revolutionary product here to stay highly recommend 10/10! buttery and comfortable on the lips
