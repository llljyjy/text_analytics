I recently received the Shiseido Urban Environment sunscreen for free in exchange for my honest review and so far i really like it! It is a little heavy on my already slightly oily skin, so I did have some new breakouts on my chin area, but nothing horrible or cystic, which was my primary concern. I also had no issues with it pilling or looking too white on my skin, but my skin tone is generally a fair to medium tone. Works great!
