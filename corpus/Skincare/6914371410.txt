As s general rule, I don’t like masks like this. They never seem to really fit my under eyes.But my dark circles & bags are severe, and nothing I’ve tried has helped.Decided that I’d give this one a go-and it is fantastic! The serum that the little comma shaped patches are infused in is something that Sephora should bottle. The patches are large, and slippery & I had to keep adjusting them. But whatever is in this treatment really made my eyes look so much better! It felt soothing & seemed to brighten my under eyes a bit. Sephora needs to bottle this magic elixir!
