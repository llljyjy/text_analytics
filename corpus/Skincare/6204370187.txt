I was super hesitant to try something that was so hyped but after a few months of using it I understand why. if you do not like heavy moisturizers then this is not for you. she is thick! not overly thick though. you can use under makeup not just for bed. I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. this has actually replaced my biossance omega!! no irritation or clogged pores and it has brought back moisture to my skin! I dislike the packaging because you have to touch it every time but it is easy to clean with a alcohol wipe which is great. LOVE
