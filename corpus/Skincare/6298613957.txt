I bought this in dark over a week ago and I really dislike it. I’m fair skin so it initially made me orange. It didn’t make my dry areas darker which I did like, however, when it comes to the tan fading, it was difficult to get off in my dry areas. It gave a scaly like affect on my arms too. Not an even fade. Orange and drying
