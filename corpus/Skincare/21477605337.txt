I normally donâ€™t use eye balms because most products have very little effect. However, this really works! It glides on smoothly and instantly gives you a refreshing cooling sensation. Wakes up tired eyes especially during early mornings. It also leaves a very subtle glow-from-within effect and brightens up your under eye area. This is a must for makeup-free days. I personally use this everyday now and will be purchasing it again and again. Refreshing cooling sensation
