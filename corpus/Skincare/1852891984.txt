I’m super into the dewy, glowy look, so I really wanted to like this product.  Unfortunately, it just wasn’t for me.  It was difficult to smooth out on my face. It felt like it pulled my skin instead of gliding on easily.  It also seemed to really enhance my skin texture and it made any skincare I’d applied previously pill on my skin.  I ended up returning it. Not for me
