This product worked very well for my skin. I definitely noticed a difference in texture and fine lines were decreasing. I love this product so much that I am on the second bottle. One recommendation that I do have is to start using it every other day, and gradually build up to using it more frequently. At first, I didn’t read the instructions and therefore was left with sensitive skin and peeling. Since then I have followed instructions, and I’m left with this beautiful, soft, glowing skin. I highly recommend this product a little goes a long way. I received this Product complementary through Influenster, but the opinions are my own. Beautiful skin
