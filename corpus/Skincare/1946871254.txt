Good but not great. It’s easy to apply. I have dry skin and it usually applies smoothly and easily in hot or cold weather. Cons is that it’s a bit too orange. Also it easily stains the brows. I have darker brows so it doesn’t stain the hair but the skin around the brows looks patchy orange. Lasts about 3 days before I reapply but if you reapply too often it starts to look patchy. Good but not great.
