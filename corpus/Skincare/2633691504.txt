Mourad made mineral sunscreen fabulous. I love the texture of the sunscreen. It was almost like a serum and because it is so sheer it barely creates a white cast over the face. I have combination and dry skin so I really love this nourishing step to my everyday routine. My skin is also sensitive but this has not irritate my skin. Happily added to my daytime routine
