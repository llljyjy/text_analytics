One of my favorite things about the Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Mask is that the masks themselves are huge and cover a significant portion of the eye area. Another great thing about these masks is that they donâ€™t slip around on the face. They stayed put for the entire 15 minutes. Love how large these are.
