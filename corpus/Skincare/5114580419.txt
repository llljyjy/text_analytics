I am obsessed with the sunscreen. It goes on silky smooth and for me left no white casting or filling.  I used it on top of my moisturizer. The fact that it can work as a primer itâ€™s a bonus. I feel like my make up went on better with this underneath. It also works! I was at the beach all day and not one ounce of burn on my face. This will be added to my routine to prevent wrinkles and protect my skin! In love!
