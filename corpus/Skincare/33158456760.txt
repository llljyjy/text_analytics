I am loving this night repair treatment from Dr. Zenovia. I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and my face feels more hydrated and smooth. I am also seeing improvement with texture and redness, too! I have sensitive skin and working this new serum into my routine didn’t cause any problems for me. I love the packaging, simple and sleek. It does have a light fragrance, but doesn’t bother me. Awesome serum!
