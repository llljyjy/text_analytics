Yup same as the others - it got moldy. Something sketchy about such little instruction on how to store this product to preserve it’s effectiveness, especially at this price point. Does it hurt to specify that it needs to be refrigerated? I didn’t even notice the mold until way later because I didn’t think to look, there’s just so much to watch out for from finding the right product for you to figuring out the science behind applying and storing it for actual effectiveness. It would be nice for these over-priced beauty companies to be more transparent about all of this instead of leaving it to the fend for yourself wild west of wasting so much money (that we don’t all have) on things until you learn from trial and error.
