I’m in love. I got this mask as a part of a 4 piece set and it is amazing. You can feel the effects of the SA, and the mask formula isn’t drying at all.  I tend to have congested pores along my T zone, and hormonal acne along my jaw line (masks don’t help!). Using this once a week or so definitely helps! The first few times I used it I could actually see some of the sebaceous filaments coming out after the end of the wait. It was awesome! nan
