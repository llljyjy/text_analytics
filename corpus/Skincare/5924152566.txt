This ACTUALLY brightened my skin, and it’s very hydrating without breaking out the skin or clogging pores. I was having a terrible break out and dry skin and within a week my skin is the clearest it’s literally ever been. Idk what’s in this but I’ll never use anything else besides this and the night time mask by them as well. Literally saw a difference in one week.
