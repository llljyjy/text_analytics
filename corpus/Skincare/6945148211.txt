I was excited to try this product which I got from Influenster but haven’t noticed a significant difference. It does make my skin tingle but in the morning I don’t see any texture improvement and haven’t noticed any over time as well. Maybe it’s my skin but I feel like I’m getting red bumps after using this product, even when applying sparingly throughout the week! Not seeing a significant difference
