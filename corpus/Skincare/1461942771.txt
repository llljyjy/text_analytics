I want to start off by saying I am a consistent customer of Habit. I use N41 and N38 on a daily basis, interchangeably of course. I always ensure I also have extra on hand since I love love love these products so much. I have become a collector! The scent on N39 is light but very lovely! I cannot stress enough how gorgeous this makes my skin feel as well! So dewy and glowy, all while protecting me as well! Yes please! Must have product! Buy it right now! Everyday Staple! Love Habit! <3
