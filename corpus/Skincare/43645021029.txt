I got this as a free sample program and I would have to say it did not help me much. It’s very smooth and and a light scent which is nice but it didn’t help with my dry lips. In fact I feel like it did the opposite. I’m sad I wish it would have worked especially with all the other good reviews. Maybe it’s just not for me. Still worth a try if your up for it! Sadly did not work for me :(
