Bless this cleanser! It’s gel type and yet foams up quite well. Took me few days to get used to the odd gel texture, but now it’s my fav exfoliating cleanser! Didn’t expect it to also remove my waterproof makeup! I double cleanse and it doesn’t irritate my skin even as an acne prone skin type. Great exfoliating cleanser!
