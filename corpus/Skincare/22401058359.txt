Iâ€™ve used this for my face for over 5 years every single day; 365 days a year. Most sunscreens get into/burn my eyes. This will not. I have experimented with plenty of other brands and the only other close competitor is colorescience. But with how much you get for the price here, this is a better choice to make financially! Wonderful and even though it is not sold as a primer, I would use it as one back when I used to wear makeup beforenthe c.virus days. Everyone needs.
