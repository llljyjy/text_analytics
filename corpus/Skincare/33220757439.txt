I’ve suffered from acne for a long long time. One of my first major breakouts was actually caused by a face oil, so I was a bit hesitant to try this. Plus, its price point is intimidating. But, I really do recommend it. It’s so worth it. The acne marks on my skin are disappearing, and every spot I get (i still get pimples because now they usually come from internal reasons such as stress), this oil puts out overnight! Perfect for acne-prone skin!
