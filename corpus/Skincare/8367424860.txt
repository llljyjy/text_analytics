this is by far the BEST ’’vitamin C’’ i’ve ever used. i used to have a lot of acne and i was always picking at my face so my face was FULL of purple scars and THIS has definitely made 80% of it go away and it also really helps with texture.  i’ve been using it for maybe 2 months and it keeps improving.. i use it in the AM mixed with my SPF50 moisturizer (you HAVE to use sunscreen!!) it can be tingly when you start using it so start with a small amount of powder not the full little spoon ! your skin is gonna get used to it then you can start adding more , will def buy more !!
