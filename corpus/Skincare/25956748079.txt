I like how the mist sprays in tiniest drops and thus doesn’t ruin your make up. I don’t like the smell (too sweet, smells like something edible. I’m more into clean, expensive, “professional“ fragrances in face products. I like when they smell like if they just came from some high-tech skincare lab, rather than from your neighbor’s kitchen). When I use the spray all over my face, it kind of burns my eyes, even if I don’t directly spray at my eyes, the skin around my eyes still gets irritated. Also leaves This bitter sunscreen aftertaste even if you don’t spray on your lips either, it’s kind of really difficult to avoid. I don’t mind using this bottle that I ordered but I think I’ll still be on the lookout for a better sunscreen makeup setting spray option. I really liked the one by Coola but that bottle is unacceptably small for sunscreen that you apply every day multiple times, I constantly ran out. Decent product but irritates my eyes
