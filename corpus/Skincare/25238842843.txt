I received this product for free to review on Influenster. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this product at all. I tried using it a few times to see if results improved, but each time felt the same for me. For reference, I tend to have sensitive and oily skin. The first impression wasnâ€™t very positive, as the cleanser smells terrible. Upon using it, the texture felt very rough from the scrub, and it left a chemical reaction and feeling of tightness on my face. After rinsing off the cleanser from my face, it left behind globs of jelly, and left my face red and shiny. I made sure to follow the directions exactly, but to no avail. I would not recommend this product. Smells And Feels Terrible
