This product has great ingredients and I love the addition of Azelaic acid. It works well but with spot treatments, I like to see a more dramatic decrease in breakout size or severity overnight. This is more gentle and requires consistent use so I feel it’s almost more like a serum where I’d prefer to apply to the entire face. I like that this didn’t leave my skin peeling or flaking and would continue to use. nan
