I have always had decent skin but after baby #2 my skin was a disaster. I was breaking out like crazy and nothing was helping! I had used other products hoping it would help, but nothing. Until I started using the IT Cosmetics cream. It cleared up my skin in a week and I am so grateful for it! As someone who is not used to breakouts, I was worried it would be like that forever. I would definitely buy this to keep my skin in line. nan
