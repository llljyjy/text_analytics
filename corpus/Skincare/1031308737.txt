First, it’s very quick and easy to apply and very pleasant aroma. Dries quick too. I lay down towels on the floor because there will be spray that falls on the floor and can make a mess as well as make the floor slippery, so do your prep work and spray over towels or a rug you intend to throw away at the end of the summer. The oil spray is a fine mist and it’s quick and easy to apply. Use a mit to spread all over once you spritz. My biggest complaint is WHO THE HECK DESIGNED THIS BOTTLE?? It is so annoying not to be able to set the bottle down in the middle of spraying. The bottom is rounded and you have to lay the bottle on its side. It’s so dumb and not practical. The tan is good, the bottle sucks. Tan is good. Bottle design is bad.
