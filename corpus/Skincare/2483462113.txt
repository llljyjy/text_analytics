Well… I thought since I have every other flavor I’d love this one too. Nope! It was a miss for me. The scent is barely there and sweeter than mango. It almost smells like a weird bubblegum to me. It’s not offensive, just not what I’d imagined. The formula is still fantastic. If you want a subtle scent this is for you. If you want a more robust mango flavor, try the Fresh Sugar balm. Delish. mango is a disappointment
