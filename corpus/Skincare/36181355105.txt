My poor face feels like it’s alive again! I’ve been through the most intense trauma and constant stress and worry this past year, and it has taken a toll on my poor skin. My face was so dry with rough patches that hurt no matter what I put on them. My skin has never been worse in my entire life. I received the lovely gold leaf oil in a sample bag from a club I belong to by IPSY and soon as I put it on my face and neck and it started to settle in and I felt a BIG difference right away! It’s been a few hours now and my face hasn’t felt this soft and gentle in so long!I am 50 years old and my face feels like it did when I was early 30’s! It doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. I’m so happy to have my face feel so much better and not sore from dryness and stress..Will definitely treat myself by buying a full bottle, thank you Danessa Myricks for creating this lovely product!! Incredible change!
