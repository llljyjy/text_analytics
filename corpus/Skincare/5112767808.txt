This is the first ever Tula product I have ever tried.  I was lucky to receive it in exchange for an honest review. The package is designed in such a way that i use the right amount of product without overdoing it. As i have a tendency to be heavy handed when it comes to product. It has made my under eyes feel more hydrated and it has really made my eyes look less puffy I would recommended this! Worth it!
