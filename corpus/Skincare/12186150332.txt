After I used this product as directed overnight, I woke up and washed it off the following day. I wasn’t all sticky from the mask which I have had happen with several sleep masks. My skin felt super hydrated and plump. My makeup was applied and looked much better than it usually does. I also love that it doesn’t have a harsh scent like a lot of sleep masks do. I look forward to using this more and seeing how my skin improves. A little bit of this product goes a long way for for the price its a great deal! Highly Recommended!! Adding to my skincare regimen!
