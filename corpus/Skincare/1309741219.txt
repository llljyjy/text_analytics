I received Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer from PinchMe.  It really is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  I love how it makes my skin feel so soft, smooth and moisturized all day long.  It doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed into my skin quickly and it smells good too.  I will continue to use this everyday! Dr. Zenovia  - Best Moisturizer!
