More like a sticky lipgloss than a lipmask, very subtle flavor and scent, nothing too Strawberry-like, but shiny for a lil while. A bit pricey for the small size, considering my lipbalm is more like a lipmask for cheaper. The tube-end is not very lipfriendly, itâ€™s flat and a bit scratchy so one has to carefully dab the product onto lips.Recommend only as sticky gloss, but not mask. sticky gloss
