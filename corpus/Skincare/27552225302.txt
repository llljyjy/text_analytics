I damaged my moisturizer barrier last year by using a lot of active ingredients such as AHA BHA, retinoids, exfoliating masks and so on. I have been trying to maintain my moisture barrier so I started using this product few months ago and let me tell you this is the holy grail product, this has helped me a lot with moisture barrier, redness and it is safe for sensitive skin. I am already on the 4th bottle and yes I would definitely recommend this product to other. Holy Grail product
