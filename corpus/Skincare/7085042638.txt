I had added a sample with an order to try this out. It’s a thick texture and when I put it on my face, the texture is like when u put on a bubble face cleanser (but this cleanser doesn’t bubble up it lathers). It’s got an old rancid smell, and I was expecting it to perform like the rice polish enzyme powder but it’s nothing like it. Just a usual, thick face cleanser with a bad smell.. didn’t like. Maybe it has long term beneficial properties, but nope I can’t get past the smell and will stick to buying the rice polish enzyme powder instead. nan
