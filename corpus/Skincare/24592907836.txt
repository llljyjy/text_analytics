I love this moisturizer! I received this product for free from influenster, and I’m so glad I was able to try this out. I have very sensitive, dry skin with rosacea and I didn’t breakout with this product, or have any redness from it. It’s very light on your skin, and it doesn’t have a sticky residue after you put it on. If you have dry skin like me, I highly recommend. nan
