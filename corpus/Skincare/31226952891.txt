I received this for free from influenster for my honest review. Lovely hydrating day cream. I’m not the best at always remembering spf on my face before leaving the house so this is perfect. A little goes a long way. Does have a slight smell when putting on but it doesn’t linger. Has definitely helped my dry winter skin. Have been using this for a little over two weeks and I have sensitive with no reactions. Lovely hydrating day cream
