Incredible product. Better then the Laniege mask and clean formula too which is great. At first application I wasn’t actually crazy about it - slightly more sticky than Laniege. BUT you just have to figure out how to work with it and the results are 10x Laniege mask. Its’ beauty is in its ability to deliver more lasting results - even when the mask is off I can tell my lips have been plumped and are much healthier. It is the best lip mask I’ve tried and has helped my little lips loads <3 Better than Laneige for me
