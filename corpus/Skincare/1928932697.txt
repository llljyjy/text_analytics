I actually saw a difference in my face after using the CLINIQUE wrinkle-correcting serum, which is lovely and calming to the skin. a glowing, young radiance. I would use this product without a doubt if I could afford it on a routine basis. Highly recommend to ladies whose skin is beginning to age. LoVE it!
