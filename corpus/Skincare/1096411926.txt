I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.   I received a trial size sample.  The cream itself has a nice texture.  Goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. It has a fairly strong smell, typical of most Clinique creams.  Not completely off putting, but a bit too strong at times for me, especially at night before bed.  I used it routinely for two weeks once to twice a day and didnâ€™t see much change in my skin texture around my eyes.  Perhaps with continued use I would, but I received a small sample. nan
