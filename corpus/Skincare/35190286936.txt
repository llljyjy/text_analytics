I received a free sample for an honest review from Influenster. When I first opened this I realized that the smell was so subtle which I prefer for my skin lotions. The lotions is very smooth and goes on smooth as well. It feels nice and kept my skin hydrated but so do many other lotions that aren’t as expensive. This did not do anything for my pores which was a disappointment. It was a good lotion but because it didn’t reduce the size of my pores, I probably wouldn’t buy again. Works nice but doesn’t reduce pores
