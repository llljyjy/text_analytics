I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I saw I was receiving a foaming cleanser, I was a bit nervous about how my sensitive skin would react. However, this product works gently and leaves my skin feeling soft and still hydrated. It has a light, fresh fragrance, creamy application, and a little goes a long way. I do make sure to apply a deep moisturizer following use and recommend only using 1-2 times per week for those with more sensitive skin. A Great Foaming Cleanser
