I wanted to like this. The texture is lovely as it goes on and initially it does not get that super shiny sunscreen look that I hate but it just does not work for my oily skin. Within an hour I was so much more oily than usual and I tried it one more time using oil absorbing primer over it and even that didn’t help. I’m returning it. For the price it is also an extremely tiny bottle. I would imagine from the amount I had to use in two days that it would go extremely quickly compared to most sunscreens, and I’m even use to buying high end ones.. not for oily skin
