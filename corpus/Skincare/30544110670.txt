I started using this product as part of my night timeRoutine. It’s easy to apply. Goes on a little sticky but then when you use your normal face lotion you don’t notice and it feels super light. I love the feeling on my face when I wake up. I feel “tighter” and feel like my face is brighter and looks refreshed. As a mom of a toddler and pregnant, it’s important for me to feel like I am taking care of my skin! Brighter and Refreshed Mom
