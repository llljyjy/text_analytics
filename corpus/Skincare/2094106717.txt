I feel like I’ve tried so many different sunscreens from everywhere - sephora, drug store, overseas in korea.  I had to stop wearing all my go-to sunscreens once I became pregnant and started breastfeeding, as they were all chemical or a combination-chemical formulation.  So I was on the hunt for mineral only and of the 23 different sunscreens I tried, this is in my top three! It’s actually my every day favorite (MaeLove is my favorite to wear under makeup and ISClinical is my favorite waterproof).It doesn’t leave a white cast, goes on smooth and is hydrating! I have dry-combo skin and in the summer I do not need to put on moisturizer prior to applying (huge win)! I have yet to see what it’s like in the winter, but I think it might actually be hydrating enough for me to leave out moisturizer in the winter too! Great option for pregnant/breastfeeding mamas!
