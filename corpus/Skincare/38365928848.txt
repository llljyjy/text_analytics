Not only does this product have a significant amount of protection against the sun, (fighting against the sun creating damage and dark spots,) but this also doubles as a FACE PRIMER, as well!! Upon applying this to your skin, it comes out a little bit...watery? And at first, I immediately was hesitant about the actual quality of this product...However, upon actually rubbing in the product, I was left speachless! As you can see, my skin was left STUNNINGLY sheet, (yet not only what-so-ever!) I am just now utilizing it for the first time as a primer, and after applying my foundation over the spf/primer, my skin looks FLAWLESS! It almost has an airbrush finish, leaving your skin to look silky, soft, and radiant! I absolutely love this already, and highly recommend! Thank you Influenster for my free product!
