I received  this item to test out  , my face is very sensitive  to certain  products,  I loved that this eye cream felt light weight and it did not have any scent therefore it didn’t irritate my skin, it helped my eyes look more refreshed, I didn’t yet have any wrinkles so this to me just made my eyes look a little more refreshed , I am 35 so I hope It helped prevent wrinkles. Will definitely  keep using this though since it made my eyes look less tired. Feels great!
