Seriously, my skin has not felt better in a long time. I’ve been having issues with irritation and breakouts from dry skin behind rubbed and breathed on all day. This provides adequate hydration while also targeting skin concerns like aging and pigmentation from sun or acne. Make sure to wear spf after use due to the resurfacing of your skin, imagine it’s new baby skin! This will be a staple in my routine, and it’s not a bad price! Influenster did provide me with a free product to test this and review- this is one of my faves!!! Multitasker
