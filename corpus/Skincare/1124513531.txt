The Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer, can be used with your regular skin routine. This moisturizer provides your skin with hydration, while leaving your skin feeling soft. It glides on easily, and there is no sticky residue left behind. There is also a light scent, as this product is not fragrance free. I have noticed a change in my skin after using this product for two weeks. This moisturizer is great for all skin types! I got this #freeproduct in return for my honest review with #TopBox. nan
