I received this free in return for my honest opinion. I have a fairly normal skin type, which can always use a little oomph. I love the packaging of this product as well as the fact itâ€™s a woman owned company, I am all for women empowerment! There is a list of how the formula is made without the bad stuff and one of them is sulfate free which I love because it irritates my skin. After one application of this product, my face was so soft and smooth. If you are looking for a product that is good all around, I highly recommend! Really Does Make My Skin So Smooth
