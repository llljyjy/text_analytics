I am a huge fan of this product! I received through influenster. It fits into my skincare routine pretty sweetly. The product provides a nice dose of dewiness, very light oil that feels so pleasant on skin. The scent is so uplifting, I really enjoy that in particular as its own pick-me-up. The packaging is great, and the size is lasting me quite a while. I love layering this under my moisturizer, but it keeps me from drying out on its own. There’s such an element of “ritual“ when I use this, shaking it to combine the ingredients, dabbing it in just-so, it really feels like an event just to use it. It is just so breezy and gives me a boost! Oil Love it!
