I started off with a simple sample which I got from my sister and now I just bought this treatment lotion in a full-size bottle. This is a combination of normal to dry skin and I have dry skin. I am obsessed with it because normally I start feeling dry on my skin after some time of using any lotion. But boy this one is a miracle for me. I found it very soothing and hydrating on my skin and I am loving every drop of it. Loving every drop of this lotion
