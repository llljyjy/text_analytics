I used this for the first time the other night. I was really excited because a lot of the reviews looked promising. I usually use garnier micellar water but wanted to branch out. I sometimes only use micellar water on my face instead of my whole routine (cleansing balm/oil, facial cleanser, etc). But with this one I noticed that my cotton rounds weren’t coming back clean after a couple of rounds. Usually with my go-to garnier one after two rounds my face is clean. But with this one I was going over my face for the 5th time & I was still noticing makeup residue. I gave up & just washed my face instead, which you shouldn’t need to do. I will not be repurchasing after I finish the bottle. Very disappointed. Does not clean off makeup well
