I recieved this moisturizer as a gift. I have been using it for 7 days now. The texture is quickly-absorbed, soft, and creamy. It is very moisturizing if you have a very dry skin like me. It is not heavy at all on skin and doesnt give greasy feel. It has an earthy smell. Very good moisturizer overall Good moisturizer overall
