I received this complimentary of Influencer and Charlotte Tillbury.  My first impression was how pretty the packaging was and how expensive this jar looked.  The cream looked thick in the jar but once I put on my face I noticed how smooth and silky the lotion felt.   It did not feel greasy at all.  I thought the instructions on how to use it were a little far fetched but it really did make a difference.  I tried putting my make up with no primer to see the difference it would make. It worked just as well if not better.  There is a slight smell but it fades away once applied.  I only gave four stars because I would have liked to see SPF in itOh well you can not have everything.  I wil definitely consider buying again! Very Nice Cream
