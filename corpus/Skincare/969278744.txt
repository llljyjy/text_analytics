This is a very luxe cleanser. A little goes a long way. I don’t wear makeup. I can’t say how it takes that off. It did get my sunscreen off! It does have a scent to it. I loved this when my skin was drier or when it was super cold out. Left my skin very soft.If you have oily skin it might be a bit heavy for you. I would incorporate this into my routine.Overall it’s a very lovely product. nan
