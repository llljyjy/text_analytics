Hello  All....I received this product to test from my buzz agent. When I saw the product I was shocked at how big it was...60mls. A little goes a long way when you apply it to your face. It automatically feels silky and soft but absorbs fast !! For my experience with it, is that my skin went red and blotchy as soon as I applied the product. But it soon decipated and my skin went back to normal. Trying to find a good moisturizer in the Winter is hard but I think this was a home run in that department!! Moisturizer
