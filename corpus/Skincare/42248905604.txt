This serum is unlike any other serum I’ve tried before, the texture is nice and not too thick so it doesn’t feel heavy going on, and a little goes a long way! My skin instantly feels exceptionally smooth and hydrated after applying it. I have sensitive skin and had no reactions to incorporating this into my routine! I’ve only used it a couple of times since receiving it, so I haven’t noticed considerable changes in my skin, but my skin definitely feels smooth and hydrated after using it each time. While the packaging is beautiful, the pump isn’t that effective for me as lots pump out each time so I’d prefer a different type of application for such a lightweight serum. Great Serum and Texture!
