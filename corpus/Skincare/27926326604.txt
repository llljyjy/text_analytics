100% the best dark circle reducing product I’ve ever used. I got this product as a free testing opportunity from bzzagent and Im so impressed with the results. I used it every morning after cleansing and toning for 8 weeks and I’ve seen a huge difference in my dark circles. My eye area looks brighter, feels healthier and looks all around younger. The product goes on beautifully. It’s hydrating without being heavy or greasy feeling. It absorbed quickly and you really need the smallest amount to cover the whole eye area. I found it made a great base for my eye makeup as well. Amazing product
