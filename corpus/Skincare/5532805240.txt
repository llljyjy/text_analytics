Works really well and a great moisturizer for the winter months! Feels a little heavier so I donâ€™t know if I would use in the summer but it made the skin feel great and well moisturized. Gentle ingredients and fragrance free. It does have its own scent which is a little off putting the first few times you put it on but I got used to it and barely noticed it after the first couple of days. It goes away after a few minutes application as well. Great moisturizer
