I have been using this product for a little less than a week and it has left my skin feeling hydrated! A little goes a long way for sure and when I put this on in the morning it doesnâ€™t effect how my foundation goes on. I have sensitive dry skin and there have been no reactions so far! Loving it! Awesome hydration!
