I can tell this is a nice moisturizer overall, but it just doesn’t work for my skin type. It kind of reminded me of Cerave’s cream, which is also a good one, but since I have acne-prone skin, products that are free from oils work best from me, like water-based face lotions. I noticed some pores around my chin beginning to fill up, so I stopped using it. If you have dry skin that isn’t acne-prone, this could work well for you. Nice but not for my skin
