This is a nice cream - thick and moisturizing - but I didn’t see any discernible difference in my skin after use. Granted, I was sent a sample to rate and the jar was very small, but even so, I can usually tell when a moisturizer is really effective. I also found this to be extremely sticky/tacky. Great if you’re applying makeup directly on top but not as a final step in an evening skincare routine. (My face actually stuck to my pillowcase!) Final verdict? There are better moisturizers out there with more noticeable results. nan
