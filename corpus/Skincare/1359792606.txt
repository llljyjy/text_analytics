I was excited to try this when I received this in my vox box to test from Influenster. This serum is slightly viscous and goes on smoothly. After a week of wearing I had no adverse reaction.

All in all, I wouldnâ€™t repurchase at this hefty price tag as there are other effective and affordable chemical exfoliants on the market. Not a HG
