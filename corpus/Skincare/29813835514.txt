I received a free sample of this product from Pinchme to try out. The first time that I used it the product leak out from around the pump cap after shaking it up per the instructions. I cleaned it up and made sure that the cap was on tightly. Just for the same thing to happen again that next time. I did not see any tinting on my face after applying it. The pump cap sometimes works and the product doesn’t come out in the same every time. Sometimes it come out tint looking and other times no at all. The only thing going for it is that it has SPF 40 in it so that I don’t have to apply other sunscreen to my makeup. nan
