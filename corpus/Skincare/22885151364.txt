Absolutely loved it, I receive this product as a sample to try unfortunately around that time I was prescribed with tretinoin but I did use it on my neck and chest and I it so good I good neck wrinkles and I can see they have become more smooth I would probably try this on my face as an alternative for tretinoin I loved the texture and color and texture because Is easy to measure how much to apply. Highly recommend this to anyone struggling with stubborn neck wrinkles and acne. Perfect!
