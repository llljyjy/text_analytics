So far I see some results since using the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. I noticed that it smoothed out the bags and puffiness. It is moisturizing and even diminished dark circles as well. I’ve already recommended this product to several people and plan on recommending to many more. It is worth the price because of it’s effectiveness. I also like to store mine in the fridge for a cooling and soothing effect. Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm
