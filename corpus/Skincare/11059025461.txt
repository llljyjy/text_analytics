I’ve been using Lancôme’s Advanced Génifique Night Crème consistently for about roughly 3 weeks. I love the texture and consistency of the formula. It’s not thick at all but very moisturizing. I wake up with smooth, moist(not greasy),plump skin. I do believe with long term consistant use you would benefit even more in terms of fine lines and overall skin texture. The scent  isn’t overwhelming however I don’t care much for it. Worth it
