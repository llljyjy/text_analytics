These pads are very strong exfoliators! If your skin isn’t ready for them, it’ll react badly. Any open wounds, such as acne, are going to sting. That said, these pads do exactly what they set out to do. I personally don’t think this high a concentration of AHA plus a retinol is necessary, but there’s nothing wrong with the product if you’re interested in it. nan
