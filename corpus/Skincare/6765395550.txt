I have combination skin and get acne flare up fairly often. Normally breakouts do not go away quickly and I go through a ton of hydrocolloid patches, which helps but doesn’t do much ones there’s just redness and texture left. This stuff has totally fixed that! I had a stubborn breakout on my cheek, used this a few times a day for 2 days and it’s gone! I wish I had taken before photos. This is not drying so you can put makeup on top without texture issues which is also so amazing nan
