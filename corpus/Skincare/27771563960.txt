I tried it before I did my makeup in the morning and I found it didn’t sit right with foundation so I began using it before I slept prior to my night time moisturizer. Let me tell you, this stuff is amazing. My skins texture is improving, dark spots fading a lot faster than with other products and it doesn’t break me out and I wake up with the best skin I’ve had in the past two years. I had brutal breakouts due to two years wearing a mask at work 8 hours a day and have a lot of acne scars and dark spots. This stuff is already helping to fade them away and I am so happy about that. nan
