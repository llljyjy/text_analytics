Don’t believe the hype. Bought bc of review by Andreea Ali. I like her, and she is usually on point for me, but this was a bad pick for me. It does not work as described by being able to mix in with moisturizers or serums. I tried with my usual serums. Did not leave any tan except brown splotches on hands. Tried again with thin moisturizer. Left brown patches on face, followed by breakout. Glad I bought mini and hope I can return. Along with the mini I also bought a full size of what I had received a Sephora sample of before and liked- isle of paradise. Much cheaper, natural non patchy glow, no problems cooperating with serums or moisturizer and no breakout with isle of paradise. Disappointing “luxe” fail. Overhyped. Poor compared to cheaper product.
