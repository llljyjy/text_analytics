I’ve tried many a OTC serums and creams and masks (generic, name brand, in-between) for my adult acne but this slab of soap is the bees knees of acne eradication.

I wasted $$ on other products when I should’ve just purchased this (didn’t know until now). It’s now permanently in my favorites list. The Last Thing You’ll Use
