I got a free sample this month.  Iâ€™ve  only used it a couple days so I can not speak to results.  However it smells like an old ashtray.  When you apply it all I smell is a smoker.  So I have to apply something else on top to hide the smell.  Not sure if this normal or if I got a bad sample. terrible smell
