This is by far one of the best self tanners I have used. This is very similar to the Ashley Graham self tanner by the same company which happens to be my favorite. The only thing I wish about this one is that it was an express tan. I left it on for about 4 hours though and still got beautiful color and no streaking. I think if I would have left it the full 24 hours that I would have been too dark. Best Self Tanner!
