I’ve been testing this cleanser for about a week and so far, so good! It’s a 2% BHA (salicylic acid) cleanser that intends to target deeper within the pores. I don’t think it’s been long enough to see a difference in regards to black heads, enlarged pores, etc. however, what I can say is that it’s a gentle, creamy, frothy cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I haven’t had any reaction to the product, nor have I developed any new breakouts while using it. That’s pretty much all I can ask of a cleanser. Nice product
