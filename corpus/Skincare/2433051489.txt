I had previously tried tanning water from another brand and was disappointed by how smelly and streaky it was. I purchased this product hoping that a tanning oil mist would be different. It sure is! This tanning oil mist gives natural looking color and isn’t streaky as long as you prep your skin and apply it carefully. Although it has a slight smell, it doesn’t reek like other fake tan products. Here is what I do to ensure an even application:1. Shower and exfoliate using a sugar scrub.2. Lightly apply lotion to areas that are dry or tend to crease. I typically applied to my joints: ankles, knees, elbows, and wrists.3. Shake the bottle, then spray a few pumps onto a tanning mitt. 4. Blend in using a circular motion. Don’t start on dry patches or on your joints.5. Don’t forget your hands and feet! Only use the excess product that is left on your mitt.Pro tip: I’ve read a lot of reviews stating that it’s difficult to set the bottle down while applying product because the end is curved. You can set the cap upside down on a flat surface and easily balance the bottle on top. Problem solved! Tan for Scaredy Cats
