It removed the makeup really fast!! But, it made my skin VERYYY DRY and it started to peel under my eyes and chin. I know it was this because I get a facial after feeling this dryness and my skin felt perfect. I used it to remove my make up last night and I woke up today with my face peeling and dry again :( It worked but it made my skin VERY DRY
