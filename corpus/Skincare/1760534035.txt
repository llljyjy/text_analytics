This is a nice hydrating moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling instantly soft and smooth. It’s especially helpful right now during the winter when my skin has been more dry than usual. I like how environmentally friendly the packaging is but I think the packaging may be resulting in a slightly woody scent in the product. It isn’t a bad smell but it’s different. Nice product and environmentally friendly!
