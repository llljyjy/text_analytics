I have only tried this cream for a week and it makes my skin well hydrated and glowing. I can’t speak to the long term results weather it makes skin firm and lifted. I’m giving this 3 stars because I don’t like how thick the cream is and a little does not go a long way. It has a light scent and absorbs into the skin quickly. I have tried other creams that I like better than this one. I received a small sample of this cream from Influenster for my honest review. Decent Cream
