I seriously love this sunscreen. It checks all the boxes of the criteria I look for in a facial sunscreen. It has high SPF, it is purely mineral base, it is NOT tinted but it also does not give me a white chalky face, it isn’t greasy and is actually feels very light on my face, my face doesn’t feel sticky or greasy after applying, doesn’t make my face look shiny/greasy, price point is not over the top, and last, there is no chemical smell or any other heavy smells just a light citrus smell that disappears once the sunscreen is on my face. So basically, I give this sunscreen 5 stars, highly recommend it, putting this on my favorites list, will be reordering it, and pray to the marketing department gods of Dr Jart to not discontinue this item. LOVE IT
