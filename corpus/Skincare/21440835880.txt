I’m gonna preface this with: I have super sensitive (allergic to a lot of things and just general eczema and sensitivities) and very dry skin. I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer for spring and summer time. It’s hydrating and moisturizing, without feeling too light that it doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything like some other moisturizers. It does have some fragrance, so if you’re sensitive to that I wouldn’t recommend this one. It also is not enough hydration and moisture for anyone with dry skin in the winter. but as a summer moisturizer? it’s FANTASTIC nan
