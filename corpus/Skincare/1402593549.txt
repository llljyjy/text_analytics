This is an intense, thick moisturizer great to use in winter and when your face is especially dry or in need of care. I like to apply at night after cleansing so that it can soak in over night. It applies nicely without feeling greasy or too heavy. My skin instantly feels better and hydrated. It feels like there are healing properties that help prevent skin from becoming flaky or red. There is no stinging or irritation. The reason I dropped one star is that a few hours after application I noticed the product balled up slightly on my skin when I was rubbing my face and it came off between my fingers. At first I thought it was dry skin but upon inspection I noticed that it was in fact some product residue. Other than that, I do like this product due to itâ€™s deep and intense moisture and ability to make my skin feel so good. I would purchase this to use especially when my skin is in need of extra moisture and would recommend to others. It works better to penetrate below layers of skin, whereas other products seem to sit on top of the skin. Great for intense moisture
