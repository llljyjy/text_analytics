I used to use kiehls moisturizer and decided to try this one out since my skin was very dry this winter. I am acne prone and have very big pores and this did nothing but make my skin supple and hydrated, without being clogged. I am so thankful for this because my skin doesn’t flake anymore and my acne does not react to it! I usually have combo skin where my skin gets a bit more dry in the winter and this does not make me overly oily. I don’t usually write reviews, but this deserved it! the bomb!!!
