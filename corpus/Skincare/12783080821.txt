Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is next level. It’s one of the most refreshing serums I have ever used. It’s super hydrating and with the collagen and probiotics it lifts and plumps the skin for a healthier look. It has some of my favorite powerhouse ingredients from Flower Extract, Hibiscus, Fruit Extract as well as Pea Protein. It’s more unique than some other serums being that it’s a spray on serum and once, I sprayed this on my skin I instantly noticed a glow. Nowadays my skin is more radiant than before but using this product just put emphasis of radiant. I also noticed that it soothes my skin from any redness which is always a plus. It goes on well with most moisturizers, sunscreens and it even work under makeup giving it that extra glow. I would definitely recommend this spray-on vegan collagen + probiotic serum especially if you’re someone looking to regain your glow and get rid of dullness because this product will do just that. A must have
