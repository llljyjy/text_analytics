I was so excited to try this and literally the second I put it on my skin started burning and got red. I thought maybe my skin just needed to adjust to it so I left it on, it burned for hours. I really wanted to love this but after admitting defeat I scrubbed it off. Unfortunately my face still hurts hours after washing it off and I am praying I donâ€™t break out.  (Obvi I have learned now to wipe it off immediately) burns and hurts
