When Winter comes around, my lips become very flaky and dry no matter how much water I drink. This lip glowy balm is just so moisturizing that it stays there for a long time until you wipe it off yourself or from eating or drinking. Absolutely a good product I would love to get again in the future. Tinted Lip Glossâ€¦ (That I love for Winter)
