I absolutely loved how this product worked, and how it made my skin feel after. It also really helped with my pores. I was a little dissatisfied with how much work it takes to rub the charcoal into the mask as you have to really rub in the charcoal to break the patches of them. But I would definitely recommend this and keep purchasing it. nan
