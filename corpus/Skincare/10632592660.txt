I love this product, it’s officially a staple of my makeup bag. it’s very hydrating and light and doesnt irritate my skin at all. Tbh it smells a little odd--not necessarily bad but the smell fades after a while anyway so whatever. Overall though, I love the results it gives me and will continue to keep it in my arsenal of beauty supplies Love <3
