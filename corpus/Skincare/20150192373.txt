Holy smokes, this is such a great moisturizer! I have really sensitive skin and I thought this might be too heavy, but itâ€™s perfect for the summer. I needed something a little more robust than the moisture whip. My skin was instantly springy and was glowing but not tacky. I think it will make a great all-year round moisturizer. Great for sensitive skin!
