So I hate shaving because I have to do it so often. I see Hanni, tryyy it and I’m literally hooked. When I shave my lady parts I get no razor burn, when I shave my legs it feels like I’m 14 again and my legs feel soooo soft and smooth AND I don’t have to shave as often because of the closeness of the shave. Yes, you need to be careful on your ankles, knees, so you can’t go as fast, but you don’t have to shave as often + when you do it feels UNBELIEVABLE. I also feel like there’s an anti-aging component here so I’m about to start using it on my arms to help see if it can quell some of my arms wrinkles with its close exfoliation (will report back)...oh, and I’m not old, just have red hair so it means I wrinkle faster, HA! Closet most convenient shave...ever
