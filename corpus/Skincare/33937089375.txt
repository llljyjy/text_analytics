I’m currently on my second or third bottle. I’ve struggled with acne for many years and with consistent use, this has helped quite a lot with fading my scars and overall brightening my face. I would especially recommend if your skin is a bit sensitive and tends to be irritated by many exfoliating products. I can use this AM and PM with no irritation. nan
