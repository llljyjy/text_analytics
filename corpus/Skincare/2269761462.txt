You know I was skeptical about this sunscreen. I promise you sunscreen makes me break out. I bought this about a year ago and noticed I would break out when wearing it but then opted to try it again this summer. I wear it without any make up or I put on make up then put it on and then touch up to cover the sunscreen…. Without make up it can leave a glows finish but on make up it will ruin it a little bit and you have to fix it so you don’t look like a ghost… moral of the story it makes me break out still but I think my skin has adjusted so it doesn’t cause the worst break outs I just had to kind of push through. It does the job It does the job
