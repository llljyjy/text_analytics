This WORKS!  The cream is very smooth & creamy, doesn’t feel heavy or oily after applying - and most importantly, as I’ve already stated, it definitely works, the results are noticeable after only 2-3 days!  I wish I had taken before/after photos of my “crows feet”, which weren’t extreme - but after only a week of using this cream, I don’t see any fine lines or “crows feet” anymore whatsoever.  I’m very picky about eye or facial creams I use, because I have sensitive eyes, & I don’t like products that feel heavy or that cause my skin to look or feel oily.  I’m VERY happy with this eye cream, & have already been recommending it to all my family & friends. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
