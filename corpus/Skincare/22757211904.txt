I purchased a small bottle of this while on vacation since I left my Keihls vitamin c at home. To my surprise after about a week my fine lines on my forehead were diminished significantly, its great for sensitive skin. It does have a different smell but I think most vitamic c products do. It absorbs quickly and I apply my moisturizer over it. I ALWAYS use it before I apply makeup since I noticed it has helped so the powders donâ€™t settle into my fine lines. It is pricey but I think it is worth the price, other vitamin c products I have used feel thick and tacky, my skin completely absorbs this and quickly. Great for fine lines/wrinkles & under moisturizers
