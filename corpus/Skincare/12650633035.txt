This is a great makeup removing balm. It emulsifies nicely with the warmth of your hands to be able to really work into the skin. I did have to spend a few extra seconds removing some stubborn eye makeup, but I didn’t have to run my eyes excessively for the makeup to come off. I feel that this does remove a full face of makeup with minimal effort. It doesn’t seem to have added fragrance, which I really appreciate. So far, I’m really impressed with this product. nan
