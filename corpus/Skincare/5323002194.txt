Is this product expensive af? Yeah, it is. Is this product worth it? 100%! This is my second full-sized bottle. I use this product 2x a day; for my morning and night skincare routine. I give this product all the credit for my glowing and dewy skin. This product absorbs well and isnâ€™t sticky. Also, this product has a very clean and light scent. I tend to follow the Korean skincare routine, so I use this product after toner and before serum. Yes, yes, yes!
