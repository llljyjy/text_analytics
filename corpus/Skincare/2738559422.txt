I never write reviews but this product absolutely deserves one! I’ve been struggling with awful texture on my forehead for the past few months and no matter what I’ve tried I’ve been unable to get rid of it. I’ve been extremely self conscious of it. So after doing some research I decided to give UFO a try. After two days of using it the most noticeable of the bumps were gone! I feel so much better about my forehead now! I’m giving this product only 4 starts because I’ve only been using it for about a week but overall I’m so impressed with how quickly it’s worked for me. The only downside is the smell. It’s not terrible but it’s pretty strong. Confidence booster!
