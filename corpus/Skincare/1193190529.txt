1. Get a sample from Sephora2. Patch test3. Patch test with moisturizer4. Go nutsI saw someone with a great tan and asked what she used. She said she used these drops and I went to Sephora to get a sample. After a few weeks of use, I bought the full sized bottle. I am naturally quite tan but I also don’t like exposing my face to the sun, so these drops help me achieve a full body glow.I use 3 drops with my moisturizer (SISLEŸA ESSENTIAL SKIN CARE LOTION) and massage over my entire face, neck and decolletage. I also make sure to massage close to my ears and into my hairline. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap after - I have never had orange hands because I follow directions :)Within a few hours, I will notice a glow. By next day, it looks like I’ve had a day at the beach. Perfect color on me. I’m Asian with neutral undertones. Highly recommend sampling. Perfect glow for your face
