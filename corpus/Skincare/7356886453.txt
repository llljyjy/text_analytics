It does its job (fading hyperpigmented spots) but it PILLS!! Iâ€™m unsure when to apply this serum as it pills pretty much all on its own, let alone under or over other products. One day I applied it in the morning, and little later it made me look like I was shedding skin. I will keep using it for my dark spots but unsure if I would reorder without a new formulation because the pilling is unpleasant and uncomfortable. PILLS like nobody's business
