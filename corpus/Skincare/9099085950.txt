It is a good eye cream but for the price you can get cheaper ones that will do the same. It is also very small for the price, this lasted me about 4 months. I noticed it didn’t brighten my dark circles but it has made my eye area more soft, I barely see my fine lines. When applying it also has a cooling effect which is nice and the texture is creamy the perfect balance between not too hydrating but not too dry. If you don’t mind spending money then definitely worth buying. good eye cream but expensive
