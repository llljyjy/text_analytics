It’s okaaayy, defiantly not my fav, does leave your skin with a very pretty glow, but when first pumping it out it almost looks expired, it’s all separated until you rub your hands together, it does tend to pull over my moisturizer which I don’t love at all. 2 stars for the pretty glow will not be a re-purchase. nan
