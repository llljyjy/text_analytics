I received this product for free for an honest review. When I started using the product it felt a little tingly for the first couple of days, but after that my skin got used to the product. The combination of all the ingredients it makes it a little oily which I would think itâ€™s great for dry skin and also for cold weather. After using it for a while I noticed that my skin is more luminous and my skin tone is a bit even(I do have dark spots), also it smells really nice. Like the product
