I have been using this product since July 2022. I have always struggled finding a good moisturizer because of my oily skin. This is the best one I have tried so far. I wear it in the mornings, under makeup and before bed. It has a pleasant and clean scent. It is very lightweight and feels hydrating and sinks into the skin very well. I could not recommend more! Must have in my skin care routine
