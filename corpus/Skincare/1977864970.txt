So in store when I swatched it I was amazed, BUT when I got home it was nothing the same. My circles under my eyes were not covered. It was mattifying which caused it to be drying on my skin and I have combo oily skin so that’s weird. The color range is definitely lacking and it’s soo messy! When I opened the jar it just spilt everywhere. I gave it some time to see if I changed my mind but no this just isn’t it for me. Going to return. nan
