The product itself is actually great! It goes on evenly and develops to a nice color, not orange. And it doesn’t leave my skin dry and itchy like a lot of other self tanners. My issue is that the pump broke after the second use. It doesn’t pump anymore. And I discovered this as I had just gotten out of the shower to tan, so I had to pour it into my hands and apply, which was very messy. I am going to exchange for a new one. Unfortunately, this seems to be a common pattern with isle of paradise products, because I had this happen with one of their mousses as well and returned it. Hopefully they find a better manufacturer of their packaging. Pump broke after 2nd use
