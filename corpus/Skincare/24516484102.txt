Love this product thank you Glow Recipe!! Leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated in the morning, and goes on super light and refreshing. I use it every night after my nighttime skincare routine (cleanse, tone, retinol, moisturize). My only complaint is that I have other glow recipe watermelon glow products (the dew drops and lotion) and the watermelon scent for this product isnâ€™t as strong as the others. nan
