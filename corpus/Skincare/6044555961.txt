I have oily skin so I immediately thought this would make me look oily. And yes the cream is heavy and thick and it did make my face oily wearing it outside. So I opted to wear it to bed and I love the way my face feels when I wake up! My skin is nice and plump in the morning. Super moisturized, I was very impressed. I do used the serum dailyI have no problem with it, I will probably purchase a full size! All in all I am happy with all the products. Worth a try.
