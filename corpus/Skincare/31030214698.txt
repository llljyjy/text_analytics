I received this tanning lotion as a complimentary gift from Influenster in return for an honest review. Iâ€™m extremely happy with this product! I like the light watermelon scent! After just one application, my legs were visibly a darker shade than what they originally were. The tan looked natural and not orange like some other lotions! The St. Tropez Gradual tan lotion will definitely be my go to lotion to tan my legs for now on! Love!!!
