I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I saw the word “peel” I was worried this would be too harsh for my skin, but it wasn’t! I used it for one week as indicated in addition to my normal cleanser, but I didn’t do the other steps of my skincare routine because I wanted to see how it was by itself. Then I used it for a week with all of my other products. Honestly it was just as effective both ways! I think this product would be perfect for travel because it was like an all in one toner, exfoliation, serum to me. I’ll be using this from now on
