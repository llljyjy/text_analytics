I’ve been using this for almost a month and honestly my skin is so smooth now. I was so insecure because I had a bunch of tiny bumps but I’ve noticed a difference since using this. Only thing I don’t like is how the exfoliant feels oily on the skin but I can bear with it since I want smooth baby soft skin. I don’t know if the retinol is making a difference I’m still new to it but honestly I think it’s a great purchase! My new skin care routine
