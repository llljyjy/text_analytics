I adore serums ! This specific Lancôme serum has three different ingredients to target wrinkles, dark spots  and anti aging benefits. The serum is a bit thicker than others I’ve used but once you work it into your skin it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel greasy. There is a light scent that lingers after applying but its nothing too intense. My dark spots did fade while I was using this product and my skin felt plump and fresh every morning. The only downside for me was the packaging, I had some difficulty getting all three ingredients to pump out at the same time and I’d hate to waste product especially with the prize point. Thankfully I was able to follow a few easy steps before using the serum and was able to get it to work for me ny shaking it and storing it upside down. Definitely a luxurious feel on the skin. Great serum!
