I recieved this product as a part of a free sample, after using it for a week i did notice smoother skin but it too drying for my liking. it does have cocoa smell but thats not a big deal unless you care about fragrance free products other than that it does a good job cleansing i have really oily skin and i dont wake up oily in the morning i just dont like that after rinsing the soap off skin is tight and stiff i need moisturizer. This is why I gave this 4 stars A little dry
