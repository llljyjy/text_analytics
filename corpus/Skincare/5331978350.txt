I would not recommend for sensitive skin, even though it is clean at Sephora, I was surprised my skin still did not react well at all. The next morning it actually made my face red and blotchy. Although, I think I put too much on but I still wouldnâ€™t use it again. I received a free sample with Sephora purchase. Might not be good for all sensitive skin types
