The sunscreen didn’t burn my eyes when I put it on but when I washed my face after and did my normal skin routine I noticed my face was burning and had kind of a rash. I’m a redhead and I’ve worn every type of sunscreen under the sun and never had a bad reaction so I’m kind of shocked. I will be returning. Not redhead approved
