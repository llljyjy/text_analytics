This stuff is amazing. First of all, the smell is NOT that bad - it smells like sulfur and goes away so quickly do not let that deter you from trying this. I use this on my face, chest, & shoulders for breakouts and scarring and my skin has NEVER been smoother & brighter. It also lasts a long time so you donâ€™t need to repurchase constantly. AMAZING
