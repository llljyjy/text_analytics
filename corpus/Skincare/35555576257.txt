I really like Kora Organics products, especially this serum. I put it on after toner but before my moisturizer. It smells great, although the scent doesn’t last long. After I smooth it all over my face I’ll dab a bit more on discolouration spots or areas with sun damage. It really helps to keep my aging skin look youthful and glowing. nan
