I didn’t want to like this cleanser, but I quickly fell in love with it. It’s an exfoliating jelly cleanser with a lovely subtle citrus scent. I have normal to oily/normal, acne prone, very sensitive skin and I have had no irritation or breakouts.  It leaves my skin feeling clean—but not squeaky or stripped—smooth, and so soft. After I use it my skin is visibly clean, without makeup remnants, and pores look smaller and tighter.  I also really like the ingredient list. I’m very impressed! I didn’t want to like this, but I do!
