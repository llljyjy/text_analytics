I actually purchased this product and I really like it! It did not cause me to break out. It is very moisturizing and my favorite part is that it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my forehead looking shiny like some other moisturizers. The smell is a little weird but I can’t smell it after application. I can be sensitive to some products but I tried this and it was just fine. A new fave!
