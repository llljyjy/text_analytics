I love this product. The moisturizer is lightweight and goes great underneath foundation. The moisturizer went on smooth and had a nice light scent. On days when I didn’t wear makeup my skin felt smooth as if I wasn’t wearing any moisturizer . I love the packaging of this product it doesn’t take up a lot of space on the counter compared to a jar. I recommend this moisturizer if you want a lightweight feeling on your skin. Lightweight
