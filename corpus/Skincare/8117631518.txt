It took me a while to figure how how to use this product so i could see results. But it really works. I apply it all over my cheek area where i have the most hyperpigmentation and I have seen results! Using it as a spot treatment didnâ€™t work for me so I use it consistently everyday on the entire area. It will take time to see results, so I would say be consistent and patient! But overall such a good product, i really saw it working after a few weeks! It clears my skin so nicely!! It works!
