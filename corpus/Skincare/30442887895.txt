This is good stuff and it keeps your lips nice and moist. I usually put it on in the morning after I exfoliate my lips and it leaves them glossy. And then I just put it on as needed throughout the day. Laneige is a great brand. The lip sleeping mask is great too:) definitely worth the money totally awesome:)
