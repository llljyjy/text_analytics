It frustrates me that this product is expensive, because I literally have to have it- the one time I ran out was the worst! I’m lazy and hate using my hands to spread a lotion moisturizer on my face, so this product has saved my skin-  the mister is great, the texture is so milky and hydrating and dries down, and I swear makes my skin look smoother and plumper. Plus on a hot day it’s so nice to have a refreshing spritz Holy grail moisturizer
