I’ve seen an insane difference in my skin in just a matter of days. It looks like my pores are shrinking my face is producing less oils while being the hydration I needed in the winter. I purchased this to avoid foundation sticking to dry skin thinking it probably isn’t all that different to drugstore moisturizer but I’ll try it bc refund policy. I won’t be returning it and I’ll have to budget it in because it has worked like a miracle! I think some of the one star reviews had bad tubes because the texture smooth and more watery than oily if anything and it absorbs flawlessly into my skin. I have combination skin and it has improved my t-zone. nan
