Not heavy and more thin lotion than thick lotion. Description is accurate that it doesn’t leave any white cast. Pros: no sunscreen smell and can wash off clean at end of day without needing harsh cleaners to breakdown the sunscreen base. One star off for “moist” finish…product does not dry down to a matte or satin finish that my hair doesn’t stick to my face. I’ve tried this with moisturizer underneath and without (just HA and Vit C serum) and it moisturizes enough for the summer over my Retin-a sensitive skin. Note not water or sweat resistant. Not bad for everyday wear
