I did receive this product as a free sample. I would say that this product may have had better results if it did not cause me to get some pretty deep zits. I did try to stop using product and give some time to try it again and I had the same result. I guess that it is not just for anyone, but I do have sensitive skin. I would still recommend it because I feel that the product would have had good results if my sensitivity didnâ€™t kick in. The fact that there was no scent was great.  It was easy to apply and an ingenious way to bottle the product and show customers product ingredients. Too bad I have sensitive skin-wish I took a pic!
