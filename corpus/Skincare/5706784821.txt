I received this product from Influenster to try and provide a review. I wasn’t super impressed by it when I first received it since the packaging is a little bleh (you can hear and feel the product move, the component doesn’t seem all that sturdy), but I gave it a try. I normally like lightwieght, more gel eye creams for daytime, but it wore well under makeup (concealer and powder), didn’t make the makeup crease, and felt hydrating without feeling greasy, which is a great plus in my book. I’ve only been using it for 1 week, so I can’t speak to the skincare claims, but so far, it’s been great! Lightweight balm
