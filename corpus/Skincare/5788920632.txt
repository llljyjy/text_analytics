I don’t use eye creams for symptoms like wrinkles or discoloration, etc.. But I do use them as a preventative step in my skin care. While using this Algenist Triple Algae eye balm, I really liked how it felt and sat on my under eyes. Very soft and moisturized. I didn’t notice any stinging or irritation while using it either. nan
