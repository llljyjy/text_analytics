This product was a great one to test out for free through Influenster! It was really cool to get to use a product that I would never have outright purchased for myself, and the experience was a positive one. i enjoyed the way this looked and felt on my skin, and LOVE the packaging. But the small amount in the bottle makes this a prohibitively expensive option to work into my daily routine. I’ll keep using it until this is gone but I’m not sure I’ll rebuy it. Great but expensive.
