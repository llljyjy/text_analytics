I have been using this for 3 weeks 1/week at night and I see a noticeable improvement in the tone of my scars the morning after and my skin feels soft and supple. Less redness and also dries up some small little blemishes emerging. I have also been using the REN glow aha toner which I also use 1/ week like 2-3 days apart from this serum. I use cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser daily and dermalogica active moist over. Great for acne scars
