My skin is on the drier side so I have to layer on products for more moisture. After using this product for a few days I’ve noticed that my skin has looked more glowy and hydrated! Even though it is a lotion, it is similar in texture to essences and can be applied with your hands or a cotton pad. I like to pour a little bit in my hand and pat onto my face until it is absorbed into the skin. However, I dislike how when I try to squirt it out of the bottle sometimes I get a little too much product than desired. I’m also not fond of the earthy smell and is a tad too strong for me. nan
