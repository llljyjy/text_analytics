I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I must sayâ€¦ Iâ€™m a huge fan of this brand and I REALLY wanted to like this. To me, the only redeeming quality was that it was in fact moisturizing. Other than that, total 0/10 for me. I only used a little bit and yet the tone was still waaayy too orange for my skin tone, not at all something I could have worn by itself. Then, when I went to apply makeup over it, my go-to foundation looks cakey, splotchy, and genuinely the worst I have ever seen it look. I had to completely remove all product from face, wash my face again, and then reapply a different moisturizer before starting my makeup for the day again. I tried it again about a week later hoping maybe it was just an off day and applied with a sponge instead of my fingers and had the exact same result. Super disappointing ðŸ¥² This ainâ€™t it ðŸ˜…
