This product made me get weird breakouts around my eyes and my mouth, super dry cracked flaky skin too. It feels very hydrating and if it wasnâ€™t for the breakouts I would love this. They took a week to appear but it was the only new product I was using. Thought it was purging so I continued use for the month, after a month nothing was better so I stopped using it and after about a week the acne was starting to disappear. Great product besides that. weird breakout
