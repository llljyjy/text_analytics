I am writing this review after receiving a complimentary 2-ounce jar of Confidence in a Cream to try. I was truly surprised to see how a thick luxury anti-aging cream can be so light on the skin. There are 5 anti-aging ingredients, but what I feel is skin that feels soft and energized. The scent is very mild and pleasant. Finally, I love that it is in an open-mouth glass jar so that every drop can be used. I definitely will finish this jar and recommend it highly. How can an thick enriching cream feel so light?
