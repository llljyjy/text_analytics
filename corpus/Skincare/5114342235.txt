Idk if I just got a bad batch or what, but this stuff did not work for me. There was significant amounts of base makeup, mascara, and liquid liner left behind, even after cleansing twice. I was hoping this would be a dupe for higher priced makeup cleansing balms, but looks like Iâ€™ll be going back to more tried and true products. nan
