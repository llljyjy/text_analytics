I got a sample of this for my birthday gift and let me tell you this worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin. After just a few days my skin was started to feel better, was less sensitive, wasn’t flaky like it usually was and my skin also felt smoother. I would warn my oily skin queens that this version of the cream isn’t for you. And if you don’t like feeling a slight residue on your face after applying creams then you also probably wouldn’t like this either. For my oil skin girls I would recommend the water cream but if you’re a dry skin girl like me I apologize to your wallet and I say run don’t walk.wasmoother. Expensive but worth it for dry sensitive skin
