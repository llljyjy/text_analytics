I bought this to add an extra layer of moisture for pre makeup skin prep and it did well and did not pill or become patchy with the other products I used. Looks like a small bottle, but just a couple drops go a long way, I’m enjoying this oil for extra moisture. Not sure if I notice brightening or firming as I also use retinoids, but it doesn’t irritate me and I have sensitive, eczema-prone skin. I’m also using this on my neck and décolletage. Not sure if it’s a need, but it’s definitely a nice product and I would probably buy again during the sale. nan
