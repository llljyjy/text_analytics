I absolutely love the Dior La Mousse foaming cleanser. At first, it looked like moisturizer, but after you apply it to a moist face it foams up really well. A little goes a long way. I felt this cleanser truly removed all of my make up and dirt, and smelled so lovely. It was also  very hydrating. Absolutely recommend! nan
