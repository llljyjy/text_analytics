I have seen & heard the hype over this cream for so long now I wanted to try it so badly but didn’t want to spend so much money on a product. When Influenster notified me I was receiving the cream complimentary for my honest review I was beside myself excited.  Unfortunately I do not see what is so amazing about it. First off it has a very strong scent, not a bad one at all it smells like roses, however, I really don’t like strong scents in my skincare.  I don’t think it did anything to moisturize my skin at all. I’ve used both expensive and cheap products that work a million times better than this cream to moisturize my skin. After applying it at night my skin looked and felt dry in the morning. Even when applying it during the day I felt like I never put any moisturizer on.  Definitely a hard pass for me on repurchasing it even though I really wanted to love it :( I have normal to dry skin for reference. Don’t understand the hype
