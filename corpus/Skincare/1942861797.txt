I purchased this after trying it at the impulse counter while waiting in line and loved it immediately. I found it had a slight cooling effect and light refreshing natural scent. I typically do not like scented face mists, but I personally found this one light and pleasant. Of course this is difficult to review bc it is a matter of personal preferences. If you are sensitive to smells or really picky w scents, both of which I am, I would try it in store first. I don’t know if it truly “sets” my make-up bc I use primers and great skincare anyway and typically only use a setting spray for special events, but I found I love finishing my makeup with a few sprays of this to set my makeup. This purchase was made on 3/11 and on 4/16 I just used up my last sprays and plan on purchasing again in the full size. Refreshing Morning Mist
