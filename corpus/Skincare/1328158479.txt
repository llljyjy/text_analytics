About a week after I started using product I noticed that my eyelids were not as crepe as the had been. The eye makeup seems to go on better. After about 2 weeks I noticed the area under my eyes looked smoother as well. It did help my crows feet slightly too, but they werent super deep to begin with. I will definitely keep using as long as it works for me! Bye, bye crepe eyes
