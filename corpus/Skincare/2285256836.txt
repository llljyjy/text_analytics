I liked this cream. I thought it was light and felt good on my face. It smelled good and it didn’t feel sticky or clog my pores or irritate my skin.  I am not sure how active the vitamin c is in it but it was good and I’m glad I got to try it for free from Influenster for testing purposes. Not a bad product!!
