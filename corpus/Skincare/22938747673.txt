They’re better products than this. Can’t complain the oz and price is really good but it isn’t as effective. It doesn’t emulsify well. Does leave a petroleum film as if you are using Vaseline. Does not take off waterproof mascara and need to work in the product more to break down the makeup. Really cheap but not effective
