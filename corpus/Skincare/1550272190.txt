I really wanted to like this one. I like the texture and feel of this. But the next day, my dry spots felt drier, almost like a film had accumulated when the product dried?? I was really confused, thought perhaps I had something on me. Same result the next day! I might give it another try, but it unfortunately wasnâ€™t a winner for me. Nice texture, odd afterfeel
