I love that this is a female owned company that is conciliatory about the ingredients used. I find that there is a strong perfume smell with most of these products. I have try and sensitive skin so perhaps this isnâ€™t the best option for me, but the concept I like quite a bit. I would like to see more conscious/reusable/sustainable packaging for the price point though. Good
