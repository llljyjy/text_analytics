It works amazing when layered under a good moisturizer. I love using this in a YTTP routine especially on my minimal skincare days - Superfood cleanser - Oasis - Adaptogen cream. It diminishes the look of fine lines short term, and really keeps my skin hydrated and bouncy. Although it’s pricey, I think it’s definitely worth it especially for people who follow a short skincare routine. The glass bottle is so beautiful and fits so well in the YTTP collection. This is my favorite launch among their 2021 releases. Great for dehydrated skin - all skin types
