I really wanted to like it, the product itself is great. It hydrates my skin very well. The product isn’t too thick but a little goes a very long way. The only con is that it caused a burning feeling after a minute or so. I tried it a few times and each time I felt it. That’s the only thing that didn’t work for me nan
