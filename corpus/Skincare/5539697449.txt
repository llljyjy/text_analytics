I like this balm. For the price point it’s great. I use as a first cleanse in the evening. Removes makeup, sunscreen and washes off clean. No smell. Packaging could definitely be improved, it can be hard to squeeze out but not a dealbreaker. I have combination skin and it feels nice on my dry patches and isn’t too much for my oiler areas. Decent balm
