I am a big fan of finishing my cleansing portion of my night time routine with resurfacing pads. I was really excited to receive these and I think they are making a difference vs. the pads I was using prior. I would start slowly adding these in by using three times a week. They are soft and I love that they do not have a scent! Great resurfacing pads!
