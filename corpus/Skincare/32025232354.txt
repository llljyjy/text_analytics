I purchased this moisturizer after having a great experience with Kiehlâ€™s other product lines. The texture of the cream was thick (which I am a big fan), but when I placed some on my face during my skincare routine it felt like I had a film on my face. And I could feel the cream sitting on top of my skin instead on replenishing and hydrating. Also made me super greasy. I have combination with an oily T-zone Great Consistency but Falls Flat
