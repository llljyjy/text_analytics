I have had acne since I was 14 in high school and I have always been the friend with the acne and the breakouts. Obviously my skin changes from clearing up a little and breaking out but I have always had scars and breakouts no matter what. I have tried every brand you could think of. I have been deep on skin care YouTube, tiktok, products that have been personally recommended and absolutely nothing has worked. In the past month I decided to pick up this product because I saw it on tiktok and figured why not? I’ve heard great things about Paula’s choice and I have tried the Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid which I absolutely loved. It was good for acne scars and I could see an improvement. However, this product is a complete game changer. Not only does this help with scars it helps minimize breakouts. It is insane how much of a difference this has made in my skincare routine. My boyfriend and my family and friends have all noticed a great difference in my skin. My break outs are extremely minimal and my scars have greatly reduced. I remember constantly think, “Am I going to have acne for the rest of my life ? This is ridiculous I’m not a teenager anymore I’m a full blown adult”. However thanks to this my skin has completely changed and improved. I cannot recommend this product enough. I use it every single day sometimes twice a day in the morning and night but always at night. It’s important to be consistent with this. I believe I started noticing a little difference by the 1st week and saw a great difference by the 2nd and 3rd week. Most people want instant gratification but this once is worth sticking to. Seriously. Revolutionary Product
