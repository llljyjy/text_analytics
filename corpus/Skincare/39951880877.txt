OMG. These days are loooooong. As a working mom with 2 young kids, I can’t remember the last time I slept through the night. They say it gets better. Until then I am so happy to have found Moon Dew! It is the only thing that actually works to help the perpetual bags under my eyes! I love my kids but i might love this stuff more... don’t tell them, it’ll be our little secret! Shh... Shhh...it's our little secret!
