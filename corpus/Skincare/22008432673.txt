I already was a big fan of the day cream version of this cream with SPF in it so I was extra excited to try this version as well! The main difference seemed to be that the day cream had SPF in it so I’ve been using that in the morning and this at night after washing my face. This one worked just as well as the other one and I especially love that the packaging is thoughtful and re-fillable so you don’t constantly need to throw it away and purchase new ones. Would definitely recommend! Great for sensitive skin!
