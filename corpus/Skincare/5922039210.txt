I bought the mini set of belief aqua bomb products and they seemed to work well the first few days. I bought the full sized toner and within a couple more days my skin was dry, inflamed, and lightly burned whenever I would put this stuff on. I hadnâ€™t changed anything else in my skincare routine or lifestyle so it was evident I was having a bad reaction to the fragrance and alcohol content in this toner. I discontinued use and within 3-4 days my skin was back to normal. Not for sensitive skin!
