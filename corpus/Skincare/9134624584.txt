I was recommended this by a Sephora employee because of the vitamin C. It’s “supposed” to improve the look of dark circles and brighten the undereye. It does so by creating a gold sheen where it’s applied. I’ve worn this every day, at least once a day, for about a month and I haven’t seen any difference in my dark circles besides the sickly gold sheen. Since I’ve been using it, milia has appeared on my eyelids and undereye where I’ve been applying it. 10/10 would not recommend. Buy this is you want a sickly gold sheen
