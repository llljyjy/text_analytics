This moisturizer is super lightweight and glides on the skin beautifully. I have combo skin with dry patches on my cheeks and chin and am more oily on the t zone. This absorbs into skin quickly and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth and not oily or greasy at all and performs well under makeup. Great moisturizer
