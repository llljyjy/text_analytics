I’m sure this product is exactly what it states, at least it should be if I paid $73. Anyways, I wouldn’t recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. After two days of using, my skin became extremely irritated and red. It’s possible that my skin could be reacting to a new product and just be adjusting but I know I have sensitive skin. It does feel refreshing and has no particularly strong scents to it, thats what I liked about it. Not for sensitive skin types…
