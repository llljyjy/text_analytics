I’ve been using this eye cream for only about a week and so far, I like it. I’ve seen some bad reviews complaining about the consistency of the product, I don’t have any particular uses with it. As long as you follow the instructions, you’ll be fine. I use a pea size amount of eye cream and dab it. Works great with make up. Go get it
