I have included this product as the first step in my skincare routine and it has made all the difference. It does exactly what it claims to do and melts away all the skincare and makeup that I have on at the end of the day. As a part of my double-cleansing routine, it’s made my life so much easier when it comes to removal! It feels much gentler to use compared to a makeup wipe, since I am not rubbing at my face with a cloth to try and remove the products I have on my face. Another important note is that sunscreen does not always come off with a basic face wash or makeup remover. Sunscreen requires an oil-based product to fully remove it, and I feel more confident that I am completely removing the day’s sunscreen with this product. I love it and it will be a staple product in my rotation! Game-changer!
