Received this from Influenster to review honestly.I have very sensitive, rosacea acne skin and I thought this product worked while still being gentle. My sensitive skin did not become irritated when I used this on my breakouts repeatedly. It helped heal my breakouts quicker. My breakouts would still take a few days to go away but the product did seem to help with the process. Effective but gentle!
