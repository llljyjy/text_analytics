I have been using the Alpyn  Beauty Line-Filling Eye Cream with Bakuchiol and Caffeine for the past two weeks and am really noticing decreased under eye circles and puffiness. I have sensitive skin and have tried several “clean” eye creams over the past year and so far Alpyn Beauty has given me the best results with no irritation. The texture is “balmy” and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated after application. I plan to add this eye cream to my daily skincare routine! nan
