Iâ€™m 37 and have used this product for two years. I have combination skin and use it with my Foreo. It does an excellent job of cleansing and opening up my skin for following treatments and moisturizes as well. My other products are more effective because of this. Love it and definitely recommend. Also a little goes a long way with a Foreo so one pack usually lasts 2+ months which is great value. A must have for daily routine
