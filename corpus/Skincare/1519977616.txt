Got this product and I was just so surprised by how it melted in my skin. Usually tinted sunscreen products still look casty and ashy but this literally melted in and my face looked so nice and glowy. I will say this would be best for dry skin as it’s very luminous and most oily skin people won’t really appreciate that. I also will mention that if you do an active treatment the night before definitely skip a day before using this, due to the actives in this (vit c and niacinamide) else you will feel a slightly itchy and uncomfortable sensation. I really enjoy using this product, I will say the packaging make getting out the contents slower which is slightly frustrating as you need a decent amount for adequate protection so coming out slow takes some time to get the amount you need. Those things aside its a really lovely product that I especially like using when I dont wore makeup. I just put this one wait about 15 mins, add some eyeliner  and swipe of a blush stick along with some lip gloss and I’m good to go. Definitely recommend. Great Shade Match
