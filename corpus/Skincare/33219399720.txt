I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.. Great balm for sensitive skin. My forearms and shoulders are super sensitive, and this cream moisturized very well without reactions. Really feel soft and smooth. While it’s too oily for my face and neck,  it’s great for everywhere else. Recommend! Great balm for sensitive skin
