I took this to on a mini beach trip and was pleasantly surprised! It’s fairly thin and rubs in easily. I applied before going to the beach and didn’t reapply while there. One application and five hours later, I wasn’t burned! I did get a smidgen of color but definitely did not burn. Surprising for something that’s 50 spf! I’m not sure how moisturizing it is since I applied over my usual moisturizer. However, it didn’t feel drying. After being applied, it does leave your skin shiny. I have an oily T zone so being shiny wasn’t anything new to me. But this sunscreen did make me more oily than usual. Also wasn’t a fan of the odor. It smells a bit like bug spray, but the odor doesn’t linger. So other than being more oily than usual and temporarily smelling like bug spray, I was surprised how well it worked! Surprised!
