The Inkey List hyaluronic acid cleanser is great. It has little to no scent and doesn’t dry my skin out but it’s affective in cleansing my skin. I don’t necessarily notice any hydrating benefits, but it’s gentle enough on my sensitive skin and gets the job done- it’s a great price too! decent inexpensive cleanser
