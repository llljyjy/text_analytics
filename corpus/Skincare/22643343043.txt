This used to be my five star day time moisturizer under my makeup. I’ve used it for years. I got my latest jar. Immediately I noticed the texture was “off.” Not a gel any more.  More of a grainy cloudy thin lotion. It doesn’t absorb into my skin. Now my skin feels tight and has little dry flakey spots. I’m so sad. Back on the hunt again. New formula was a bad move
