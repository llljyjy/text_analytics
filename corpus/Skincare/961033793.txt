This used to be one of my favorite gel moisturizers. Farmacy has recently changed not only the packaging, but the formula, as well. It used to be a smooth, lightweight gel with a pleasant herbal fragrance. It is now a fragrance-free, semi-solid that does not moisturize or absorb as well as it used to. The packaging is also cheap feeling and ugly. nan
