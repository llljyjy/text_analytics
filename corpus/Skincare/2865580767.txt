This was my first time using a lactic acid serum and I am SO happy I was able to try this product! I do have sensitive skin, but have already used AHA / BHA and other harsh things before. I did feel some stinging when using this product at first, but I didn’t have any irritation or breakouts. I really felt like after using this for a week or two my skin looked overall healthier and I had less breakouts. I used it in the evening along with my other serums and I had no issues combining them! Definitely would recommend this, especially to those new to lactic acid since it didn’t cause any issues for me! nan
