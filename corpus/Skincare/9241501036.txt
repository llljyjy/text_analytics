Open this sunscreen CAREFULLY. It WILL spill everywhere, even if it’s facing up. You’re supposed to shake the bottle prior to each use in order to re-mix the sunscreen. However, even when I had the product faced up for a few seconds, the sunscreen still shoots out the nozzle WHILE spinning the cap off. After you gather everything that spills all over the place, the product has an odd type of playdough smell. My wife said it smelled like a grandma’s house. It didn’t leave a white cast on us, but… for $60, the packaging and smell are major turn offs the packaging sucks
