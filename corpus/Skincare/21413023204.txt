I love this product. I swipe it on with a cotton ball 3 days a week and it leaves my skin so soft and glowy. The texture of if is like a jelly cleanser, it feels really good. Although it did make the corners of my nose dry and itchy, i just stopped putting it there and all was fine. I 100% recommend this product! So hydrating
