I am a long time user of IT cosmetics products and I was thrilled to try this cream. Unfortunately though, this product did not do it for me. From the first time trying it I found it very thick on my skin and the bad smell of it lasted all day. I did try it several more times, but I couldn’t get over it. I wasn’t able to see any benefits and this one just isn’t for me. Disappointed
