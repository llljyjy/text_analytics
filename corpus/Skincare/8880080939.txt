I have combo skin. I wanted to love this wash because I love their YTPâ€™s moisturizers, but no. This is a really drying face wash. It made me break out (I thought it was a coincidence with my cycle) and kept using.. then it dried my skin so much that I even started having dandruff at the edge of my forehead where my hairline starts. I thought it was the fact that I was using a lot of new products, so I started eliminating one by one. Stopped using it and tried 4 other times, and EVERY time I started using, my skin would dry and breakout. Not s good fit for me. INCREDIBLY DRYING
