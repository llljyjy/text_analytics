I went into Sephora over a week ago and spoke to one of the experts there about skin issues I had been having. I have combination/sensitive skin that had been becoming very dry, rough, and irritated. This product was suggested to me and it has changed my skin within a week! Used it am and pm and my skin is soft, clear, and so smooth. My pores even look smaller and fine lines less noticeable. Plus, it is less expensive than other products. Please give this a try! Amazing!
