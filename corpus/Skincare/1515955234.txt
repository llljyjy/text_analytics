First off I am a fenty girl but I donâ€™t write reviews unless itâ€™s exceptional. Second, I am a mask fiend. I use all sorts of masks(even sometimes make my own) so I didnâ€™t know anything could surprise me I shouldâ€™ve known not to count fenty out. First off it cleaned my face like no other mask but surprisingly my face felt soft after using it. Most masks dry out my face and I have to add a ton of moisturizers to get it back in but this I couldâ€™ve gone without nothing else(of course I put on my moisturizer but still). Listen youâ€™ll better buy as much as you can cause as soon as I am out I am ordering like 29ðŸ¤£no wonder this mask was out of stock for so long! I will not let go of this mask! Beat mask ever!
