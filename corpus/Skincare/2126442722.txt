I really needed another hyaluronic acid. I’ve already been using the plum plump and I really love that for my skin. After I heard great things about the Watermelon Glow Niacinamide, I tried that. Didn’t love it as much. And really thought about re-purchasing the plum plump. But then I saw this new bad boy.I really didn’t have high expectations for this product. I didn’t even know how it was going to live up to what I already loved and tried (The Plum Plump). I knew I needed to switch it up. My skin was so dry and patchy after a week in Vegas. First try: How ligt and refreshing it felt. Was worried about the scent being an issue but its a very light faint luxurious smell. In 3 days my skin was looking so hydrated and I instantly became hooked. I’ve been using it and havent finished the bottle yet. Use a pump everyday and every night during the Canadian winter season and i have dry skin, sometimes even patchy with makeup. Since i’ve been using this, my skin is surprisingly glowy, dewy and hydrated with a foundation on. If you love the plum pump and want to try something new like I did. I def think you should. I think these two are great if you switch once you finish one or the other. This product made me reconsider trying Laneige...
