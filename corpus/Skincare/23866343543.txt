I really liked this product! For me I have sensitive skin and SPF somehow ALWAYS breaks me out. This one so far does not! Also a lot of mineral SPF sticks to my dry areas and active breakouts, if find if I apply this directly after moisturizing it rubs in and absorbs smoothly and doesn’t streak or pill. Doesn’t Cause Breakouts! Apply With Moisturizer!
