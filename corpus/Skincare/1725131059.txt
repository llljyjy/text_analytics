I am 37 years old and suffer from hormonal acne. I’ve used many acne kits throughout the years, some helping a small amount, while others actually made my acne worse. The Dr. Zenovia Clear Complexion Acne Solutions Systems has been a great addition to my skincare routine and has improved my skin texture and tone. It took a couple of weeks to see real benefit, but over time most of my acne went away. I could really tell a difference when the time of my month rolled around and I wasn’t breaking out as bad. The kit comes with 3 items:10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Cleanser - This cleanser is a great preventative measure when it came to my acne. It cleaned out my pores very well and got rid of extra oil. I massaged it onto my damp skin for 30 seconds to a minute to really penetrate into my pores. Then I thoroughly washed it off.Aloe Vera Blemish Soothing Moisturizer - Secondly, I applied this product. It helped to reduce redness, calm my skin, and combat any skin drying. My makeup actually looked better after using this moisturizer.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment - Lastly, I used this product on any stubborn spots (only at night) and found it to be an extra weapon in combatting existing blemishes. Since 2 of these items contain benzoyl peroxide they can dry your skin out. Since I have sensitive skin, I started off only using them a few times a week. And do not use this on your eyes, or the delicate skin surrounding them. Also benzoyl peroxide can bleach fabrics. I highly recommend these products for people with mild, hormonal acne. We need a travel sized kit with these items! Great solution for mild acne & sensitive skin!
