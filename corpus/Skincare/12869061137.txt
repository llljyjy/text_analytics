The first time I ordered this product, the bottom (where you turn it to get the product out/up), completely broke off. The product was thus unusable. I requested a new product be sent to me, as I used this product a few years ago and liked it. I received the replacement product, and the same part of it broke as I was taking it out of the packaging. Part of the bottom just cracked off, making it impossible to turn and get the product out. I am extremely disappointed and wonâ€™t be getting a replacement again, rather a complete refund. I am giving two stars as a result of this, even though I liked the actual product in the past. I hope milk makeup becomes aware of this and fixes the issue. For such an expensive product, this is unacceptable. Broken product...twice
