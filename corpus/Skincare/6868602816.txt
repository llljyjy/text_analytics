Great for hydration! I don’t use it everyday because I feel it gives enough of a boost after using it every other day. Like how it retains the moisture for my dry skin and it is not smelly or sticky.  Love this brand and have had success with all their products. Also love that it’s cruelty free!! A must for me! Great glow!
