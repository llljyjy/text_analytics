I received this #freeproduct from #Topboxcircle in exchange for an honest review of this item.  I found the product to be lightweight and not sticky at all.  It absorbed well and did not cause any skin irritation for me.  I have sensitive skin so this is a must.   Clinique skin products are generally my go to for this reason.I did not see any drastic results because the sample lasted only 2 days using both morning and night but it has potential and may be a new go to product for me in the future. Possibly a new must have..
