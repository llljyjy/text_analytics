I really line this soap. The fact that it contains baobab oil is very impressive. It’s what I use on my body, hair, and face regularly. The smell is nice and definitely will smell even throughout the bathroom. Your skin will be clean to the touch but not stripped after using it. I tried air drying without putting on a moisturizer and my skin was noticeably soft. If you like other beauty bar soaps, you’ll most likely like this one as well. Overall Good!
