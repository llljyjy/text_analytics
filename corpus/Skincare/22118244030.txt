OMG I love this. I’ve been looking for a good face oil ever since intelligent nutrients changed their green oil formula and doubled the price. This is the first I have tried that doesn’t give me blackheads. It feels amazing and my skin just drinks it up. I even use it in the morning. The smell kinda reminds me of tea tree oil - its very herbal and not at all perfume-y. I find it to be mild and pleasant. 10/10
