This cream has such a beautiful silky texture, it’s creamy but when you apply, it feels so silky and smooth. I love that it absorbs well, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky and feels very lightweight. It makes my skin hydrated and supple, so soft and smooth. I can’t really tell about long term results due to only having a trial size. But it definitely feels luxurious and a great moisturizer. Such a beautiful silky texture
