I’m always on the hunt for quality skin care that doesn’t break the bank. I love that this cream has hyaluronic acid and a peptide complex, as I near my mid-30’s I’m more conscious is skin hydration and collagen production. The smell is a little “medicine like” but to be expected with these ingredients. It didn’t upset my sensitive skin at all and a little bit went a long way. Affordable, quality skincare
