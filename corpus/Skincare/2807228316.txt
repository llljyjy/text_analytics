Although I appreciate having a guide colour to avoid streaks, I prefer drops so I don’t have to wash it off or worry about it staining anything! I have to say, these drops did not streak at all and I applied all over my body. I’m used to the isle of paradise drops where you can use about 3 drops per limb and mix with moisturizer. I did the same with these and although it made my skin look very smooth and healthy, it produced virtually no difference in colour. I’d say these are great for face drops but if you plan to use for your whole body tanning, it wouldn’t be worth it for the amount of product you’d have to use. I’m pretty fair skinned so the fact that it produced no colour is really surprising :( good for face but not body
