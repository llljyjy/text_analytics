I have oily/combination skin and this makes my face DRY. I’ve never had this issue with any other product. I’m sure this is a good product but it makes no sense how it is drying when it is a moisturizer and I don’t even have a dryness issue… Will discontinue use. Otherwise it’s gentle and it did not cause any breakouts or bad reactions. Drying
