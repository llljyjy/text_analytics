I have combo skin with texture, hyperpigmentation, and large pores on my cheeks/nose. This product is a MUST for me. She’s serving smoothness, she’s serving minimized pores, she’s serving results!! I’ve been using this for over 3 months and applying every second night to avoid irritation and redness, and have noticed a huge difference in the texture on my forehead especially. I used PC’s BHA in the past and it was too intense for my skin. This is gentle and not too stripping, and if I miss a few applications in a week I do notice an increase in texture and clogged pores. This is the perfect exfoliant for me. Will repurchase for sure :) she’s serving minimized pores
