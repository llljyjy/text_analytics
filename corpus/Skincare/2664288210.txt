I really like the coverage and consistency of this product. I do add sunscreen drops to give more SPF protection because I felt like the amount of product I would have to use to provide adequate sun protection would be too thick on my face. I often mix in bronzing drops to give a little color. The finish is natural and slightly dewy and seems to last most of the day! nan
