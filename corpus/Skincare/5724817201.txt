I really enjoyed this cream. The texture was super creamy, but not heavy or greasy. It didn’t cause me to breakout and it absorbed well. I used it in the mornings under my Sunblock and it never piled or looked funky. The sample was small so I didn’t feel like I could give it a fair trial. I used it twice a day for two weeks, but it wasn’t long enough to see any real changes in my skin. The pictures below are two weeks apart. Fast absorbing!!!
