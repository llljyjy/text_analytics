This moisturizer was a bit thick and felt heavy on my skin.  The fragrance was not overpowering.   I didnâ€™t notice much of a change in my skin but 1 week may not be enough time.  I did have a few breakouts after a week of using this but not quite sure if it was necessarily caused by this.  I feel that this may be better suited for someone with dry skin. Would be good for dry skin
