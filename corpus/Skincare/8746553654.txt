It is so bad I want to give it a zero but that’s not possible so I give it a one. In all seriousness this is the worst lip balm I have ever bought. It some how makes your lips even drier. The texture is so off putting too. It doesn’t glide over the lips at all. I made an account just to complain about of this product stinks. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this lip balm.
