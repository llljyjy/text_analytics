This is good at taking off make up and cleaning my skin as a first step of taking off make up but take note, you will have to do a double cleanse, so I use a gel cleanser after. Also, I noticed that when it comes to eye make up, it’s not the best at removing because 1.) It stings my eyes 2.) it leaves a residue so it blurs my eyes for hours and that’s the annoying part regardless of how much water i use to rinse them out. So i suggest avoiding the eyelash/eye area. Other than that, it’s a good product to melt off make up. nan
