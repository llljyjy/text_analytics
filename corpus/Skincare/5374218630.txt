The truth is, I have one particular sunspot that has been problematic for years now. I have tried just about every serum, cream, and treatment out there and nothing has worked for me. I was hopeful but doubtful that this product would work, and I wasn’t surprised by the outcome. After 12 weeks of using it twice daily, I see no improvements in my stubborn spot at all. Disappointing, but not surprising. Perhaps this will work better for someone else? I wouldn’t write it off completely for someone with different kinds of dark spots to treat. It might work great for other things. Just didn’t work on my sunspot. About what I expected...
