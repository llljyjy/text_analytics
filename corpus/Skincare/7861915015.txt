So far I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I think I’m already noticing a difference in how soft and smooth my skin is. It’s definitely an awesome addition to my daily skin care routine. I love the gel-like texture of the serum that just glides and on totally melts into the skin. It smells nice and feels great. The smell is just light and not heavy. The formula doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on the face either. I would buy it again once it’s empty. Makes my skin so soft and smooth!
