I wanted to love this because of all the ingredients but I don’t. It leaves a white cast and pills. I’ve seen the tips on how to make it not pill but, for the money, there are other sunscreens that perform beautifully that I don’t have to “talk dirty to” just to get them to work. I have normal/oily skin and am medium AA complexion. I’ll stick with black girl sunscreen or supergoop. Don’t love it
