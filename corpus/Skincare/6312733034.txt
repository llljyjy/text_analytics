Wow! I really enjoyed this spray! First off the packaging is gorgeous and feels heavy and luxury. The spray itself is very fine and has a rose scent (which personally I love but won’t be for everyone). The product itself though and how it works is amazing! You can wear it with no makeup or over makeup and to prep your skin before makeup and it looks amazing every time. I’ll definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a subtly glowy setting mist. Love this stuff!!
