I received this product for free through Shani Darden and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. My skin responded to the serum well and it did a really good job of lightening the dark circles around my eyes and smoothed out my complexion somewhat. I think itâ€™s still too early to tell how much it will improve my skin, but this is great so far. Pretty good!
