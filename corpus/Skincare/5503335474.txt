I’ll say this much, this cream does smell good and it does have a good consistency. It’s a light scent that feels very luxurious. The cream itself is on the thicker side, which is actually good for a night cream. The ingredients are everything you want in a night cream and it does leave you smooth. A little goes a long way. I will say, if you have the money, you should definitely buy this. That being said, man oh man is this expensive. I can’t say I’ll be switching permanently but this cream does its job. A wonderful cream, for all the doll-hairs
