First and foremost- I have tried everything for sensitive skin. Tata Harper has become my absolute go-to. But this mask soothes, hydrates, and leaves my skin feeling amazing! This mask goes on smooth and feels gentle and silky. There is no tightening or pulling and my skin feels gentle and plump under this mask. Although it is a small amount- I can’t say enough about how worthwhile this product is. And yes- even for the price tag. My mom sent me this after I moved from the east coast to Colorado. The deadly dry air was troubling my skin and as someone with super sensitive skin and Rosacea, I struggle to keep my skin moisturized because I always have a bad reaction to products - even ones I use daily. Because of this, I am super careful shelling out $$$. This mask has been a godsend. I am truly excited to share this product with friends because I’m 29, and I’ve always looked young- but the dry air was making my skin age quickly. This is the secret we have all been looking for!  I cannot stress this enough- try this product if you have sensitive skin or want clean beauty! this  mask is what we’ve been dreaming about!
