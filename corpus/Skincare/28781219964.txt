Very hydrating vitamin c serum. I LOVE that this is odorless- so many other products have too strong of scents, so this is a refreshing change. Took me a couple of uses, but I am now starting to see a difference in the texture and overall glow of my skin. Will def repurchase again when this first bottle runs out!
