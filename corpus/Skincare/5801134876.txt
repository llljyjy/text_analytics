Wanted to love this for my combination skin but I think it’s more of a winter sunscreen. It’s not sweat proof or water resistant and it makes me look like I just stepped out of the shower. I like that it provides 50 broad spectrum protection from the rays and no white cast. Blends perfectly, I will have to try it out in the winter. nan
