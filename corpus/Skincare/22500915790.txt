This product is amazing. The moisturizing properties are out of this world and it’s great even on my oiler areas of my face. A little goes a long way- mark my words. The only thing that’s slightly off putting is the scent. It’s not scented, but it has a slight funk for a minute after you apply it. It does fade quickly though which is why I wouldn’t give 4 stars. Overall, this face cream is freaking amazing. My face!
