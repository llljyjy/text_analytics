After testing this product out for the past few weeks, I’ve come to love it. My face feels softer, fuller and I am noticing less fine lines. The serum smells great and is the perfect addition to my nighttime face routine. The product couldn’t have performed better. It’s great for my combination skin type, providing moisture all over and locking it in. Great addition
