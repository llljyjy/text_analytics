The packaging of this product was really lovely. It feels heavy and substantial. The product feels very light in my hands and moisturizes well. However, oddly enough, it has a lemony or even an astringent smell!! The scent alone makes me feel like my skin isn’t being nourished. It’s great for summer coverage, I think, when it’s humid and you’re only looking for light coverage. Light moisturizer, astringent smell
