I’ve been using IT cosmetics Confidence in a Cream a little over two weeks and this has been the best face cream I have ever tried. I had to stop trying other products because they would leave my face oily and cause breakouts. I was nervous to try this product at first because of how sensitive my skin is but it hasn’t disappointed. You only need to use a small amount. My face drinks it right up and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. This product helps reduce redness on my face and it hasn’t caused any breakouts. I definitely recommend anyone that has combination skin to try this product, it’s amazing! Best Face Cream!
