I think Clarins is a great brand, definitely have been a fan for a long time. However, I wouldn’t recommend this eye cream, Its not terrible but theres not wow to it either. Especially for the price tag ($89 for 15 ml), its very overpriced. It does feel hydrating, but nothing like my belif aqua bomb which is $40. Now you do kinda feel the “lifting“ effect, but I think you will have better results with Dr Brandt No more baggage ($42). So this an overrated for me on this eye cream. Definitely not worth the hype
