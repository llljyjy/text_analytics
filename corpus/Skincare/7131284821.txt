I absolutely love this stuff! I will be buying it again and making it a staple in my skincare routine. I have had perioral dermatitis for years and was scared to use this because I didn’t want a flare up, but this stuff actually has helped reduce the inflammation around my nose from it! I love this stuff! It’s very light and a little goes a long way! It makes my skin bright and glowing. Has definitely increased my self confidence because perioral dermatitis has lowered it. Will keep as a staple in my routine!
