I really like this lip balm. I’m a huge lip balm freak, I always buy new ones that come out. It doesn’t feel sticky at all. Makes my lips soft, it’s pretty long lasting. I still wear my face mask out in public places while running errands and this balm stays on pretty well. I really like that it has SPF. Perfect for the summer heat. very comfortable lip balm
