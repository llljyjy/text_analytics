I am always trying new eye creams on a quest to find the best one. This is definitely a top contender. A little goes a long one, it goes on smooth and is meant to go on your eyelid as well. A lot of other products I’ve tried say not to so I was happy to see this wasn’t the case here. Definitely would recommend! nan
