BIT OILY! Usually serums isn’t that much oily. It comes out as a white serum not the typical transparent. Does do it job to keep hydrated. It’s a cute package and I love the colours. The dropper is awesome since I hate those squeezing ones. This is a big button you can press and it’s not a stiff one too. Would use again BIT ON THE OILY SIDE
