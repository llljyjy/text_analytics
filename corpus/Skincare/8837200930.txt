The light cleanser-like scent was really nice, price is good, I love the brand and packaging but my first impression wasn’t the best. I followed the instructions for how much cleanser to use and I felt that squeaky clean feeling on my face afterwards. Since I have sensitive skin I didn’t love that feeling. Overall it depends on your preference and skin concerns whether you’d like this or not. not my fave
