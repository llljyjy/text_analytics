I have been using this product for a couple weeks now. It is a nice cream that feels good on the face. I have used it in the morning with my make up routine as well as in the evening before bed. My skin feels soft and smooth. I prefer it in the evening instead of under my make up but it works well for either. Good Cream for Day or Night
