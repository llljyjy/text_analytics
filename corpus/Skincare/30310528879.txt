I have to say I’m quite surprised on this eye cream, it worked better than I thought it would. it smells good and it’s not so oily that it just stays shining. I will say it burned for a second the 1st time but it did not turn red, You can see quite a bit of significance on the difference of my eyes I will definitely continue to use this Quite surprising
