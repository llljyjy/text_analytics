i only use DG skincare products and i am SHOCKED with how this serum made me break out. it seems that this serum has retinol in it, not sure why since itâ€™s suppose to be moisturizing. i think DG changed most of their formulas because even the matching moisturizer smells different :( CAUSED ACNE & SKIN PURGING not the same formula
