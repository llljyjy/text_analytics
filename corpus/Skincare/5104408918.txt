I have dry, sensitive skin from living in a dry climate and using retin-a and this just is not hydrating enough for me. It didn’t break me out or make my skin irritated or anything, but it provides very little hydration. To be fair, I likely haven’t used it for long enough to see the wrinkle reduction it’s supposed to give, but my skin gets so dry through the day that I don’t think the benefits would be that great. I think it would work for people with normal or oily skin, but if you have super dry skin I would recommend the squalene + rose oil instead! Not Hydrating
