Seriously why the jar? I’m surprised this hasnt gotton more flack cause all of their other products besides the green mask are in hygienic pumps, droppers, or squeezes. Jars are gross when it comes to an everyday skincare regimen. I also think it’s ridiculous to put dimethicone a well known silicone in the very top of the ingredients list. That means theirs a lot in their which makes this more of a primer than an actual skincare moisturizer. Good luck getting any real skin care benefits from this. Your skin might feel smooth but thats what any primer does and primers dont offer significant skincare bennifts. Seriously innbeauty project your better than this. P.S. Bring Back The Toning Spray Wow still haven't changed packaging
