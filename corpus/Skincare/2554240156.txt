I would like to state that I received this product complimentary of Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. As my first high end moisturizing sunscreen, I can say I’m impressed. Not only does it protect the skin but it hydrates it as well. This makes sense to me because if your sweating during the warm weather, you wouldn’t want your skin to dry out. I also enjoy the very happy packaging and the minimal scent. nan
