For a higher end solution, this sunscreen is just okay. The container is fairly small for the price point. It also has a strong sunscreen scent and is not as “invisible” as something like Supergoop. It also can appear oily on the skin. Overall, I would rank it higher than drug store sunscreens but lower than other prestige brands. nan
