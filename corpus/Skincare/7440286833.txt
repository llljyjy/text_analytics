I love this product! As someone who doesn’t put on a lot of makeup, this product is great because it’s subtle but gives the perfect shine. I normally use it by itself when I’m feeling a little dull, and it looks super natural and dewy. I’ve also used it as highlighter before. The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it is pretty thick. But overall, I would recommend! Super dewy and natural!
