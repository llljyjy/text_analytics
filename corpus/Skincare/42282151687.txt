I had the opportunity to try Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser, and I have to say I am very impressed. I found this brand through my wife’s cabinets, and I would often get yelled at for using her products. Since most of this industry skews females, I’m happy to give a guys feedback on a facewash product.For starters - As someone with sensitive skin, I was reluctant to try a new face cleanser for fear of breakouts, but I did not experience any! The texture is very creamy and smooth. I didn’t feel the little exfoliating beads at all. The smell is very fresh, lightly floral, and pleasant. I have a powerful nose and HATE strong odors, the balance of this cleanser is perfect, and it doesn’t linger on your skin. I used this product with water. Applying it to dry skin and leaving it be creeped me out, but from what my wife told me, this is normal. I’ll stick with the water technique. She used it as a makeup remover and is pleased with the results. My face feels really clean and refreshed after use. As someone with naturally oily skin, it helps dissolve and wash away the oil and dirt. Ladies, if your husband, boyfriend, friend, or whomever, uses your products and wants to make a suggestion, tell ’em this is fantastic, and they’ll love the results. From the male perspective
