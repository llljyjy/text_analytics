I got the trial box as my birthday gift. I absolutely love the cleaner and the face cream! My skin has never looked better! This has changed the game for me and even though it’s expensive it’s worth it! I use the rice wash, the dewy skin cream, fenty fat water toner and vitamin c oil. If you’re like me and have normal skin but it’s sometimes dry and dull give this combo a try!! worth the price!!
