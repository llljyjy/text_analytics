I’ve been using the Midnight Recovery Cloud Cream for more than a couple of weeks now and it is simply amazing. My skin has changed. There’s no other way to put it. I wish I had taken before and after photos. But my skin is glowing. From a dry mess to a glow, and the only change I made in my routine was adding this amazing cream. I keep it in the fridge. nan
