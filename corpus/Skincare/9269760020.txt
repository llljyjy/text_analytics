This is a great moisturizer if you are not acne prone. I have extremely dry skin and it worked SO well for that, I loved it for moisturizing, but it did break me out. I had to stop using it, as it was clogging my pores. If you just have dry skin, you’ll love this! If you’re acne prone, it’s a gamble. Great for moisturizing
