Honestly the best facial sunscreen I’ve used! I recently found out that I’m allergic to avobenzone, which is an ingredient in many chemical sunscreens. So, I’ve been on the hunt for a good mineral sunscreen, and I found it! It blends into my skin so well (I’m pretty pale, so the blending could vary for you) and it doesn’t even feel like I’m wearing anything. nan
