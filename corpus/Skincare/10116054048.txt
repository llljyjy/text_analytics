I actually didn’t expect to like this.  I haven’t personally had much luck with Shisedo products. This one is perfection. I was using a more expensive product but this one works just as well for me (and the bottle isn’t flaking onto my hands like the other one).  If you’re concerned about white cast… this does leave one. But if you’re using it as a primer under makeup it’s great. My new daily go to!
