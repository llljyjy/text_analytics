I can’t say enough good things about this cleanser. It’s so soft and creamy that I end up massaging my face with it for a few minutes before I wash it off. It leaves my skin wonderfully soft and does a pretty good job with removing make up that isn’t waterproof. I also love that it’s Ayurvedic with non-toxic ingredients. Worth every penny! nan
