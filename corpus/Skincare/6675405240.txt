The product is great and I love the feel of the dry oil. However, the packaging completely fell apart after a few months. The bottle no longer seals, which resulted in my bottle spilling and now I’m completely out of product. Will not be repurchasing. At this price point, it should have a bottle that doesn’t deteriorate. Ordinary serums at $7 don’t fall apart. Super disappointed. Faulty Packaging
