I received this product from peace out skincare as a free sample fort my honest review from #Skeepers, so here it goes!This peace out retinol eye stick has done wonders for my dark circles! Coming from someone who struggles with sleep, and it’s in their middle age, I’m always looking for something that will hide those ugly dark circles. Viola! Although it is a tad greasy at first, this product soaks in quickly, and visibly reduces dark circles without the need for makeup to cover up! nan
