My daughter saw this in the store and begged me to get it for her as it got rave reviews from a social beauty influencer. Despite the price I got it for her as a birthday treat. One day I was feeling lazy and didnâ€™t want to do my whole nighttime beauty regime so I borrowed this dream mask and called it a night. It made a HUGE difference because my husband, who never says anything to me about my face before going to sleep, asked me what I had done. He said my face was glowing and looked radiant. After that I went back to Sephora and picked up another jar for myself. Absolutely LOVE!
