I have been using this product for just over a week, so I cannot rate the effectiveness of this product quite yet - stay tuned for an update in upcoming months. What I can say is this products packaging is top notch and I love the option for a refill to cut down on environmental waste. The serum itself applys smoothly with a nice consistency, neither tacky or watery like other brands I’ve tried. This is the first dark spot serum to not immediately dry out my face so I am excited for that change, although I am sure to follow up with moisturizer. So far a fan of Fenty Products for what I’ve experienced and can’t wait to branch out to other lines of their products. High hopes!
