I’ve honestly waited to review this so I can come up with a better way to describe why I love this moisturizer so much. But the major reason is that it really feels so good on my skin. It’s not too heavy, you don’t need very much of it at all, absorbs quickly and I feel like it gives a bouncy chopper without making me oily. The days I wear tretinoin at night, I apply a heavier layer of this in the morning and it does help to keep some flakiness at bay. Love this product. Perfect Balance
