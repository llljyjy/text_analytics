Great sunscreen for my sensitive skin. Does not give me a rash like others do. Slight white cast, but it seems to fade over time. Like many physical sunscreens, it can be difficult to completely remove with regular face wash. I use a cream/balm and double cleanse. I would give 5 stars, but it does feel heavier than other sunscreens and somehow often ends up in my eyes. nan
