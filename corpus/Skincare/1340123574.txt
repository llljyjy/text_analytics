I have used la mer and sisley. But this cream is the holy grail. Layer this on generously at bedtime and my skin feels moisturized and replenished in the morning. Even when I really don’t have the energy for skincare, I just wash my face and slap this on at night. I’ve been using this product for years and gone through quite a few jars. Finished 4+ jars
