Tried this out from a sample, and wow, this cleared up my skin!  Wish I had this years ago I would have a lot less acne scars today.  You only need 2 pumps into your palm, smash your palms together and rub, then apply to your face.  Add a little bit of water to create a foam and wash away those dirty, clogged pores!  The key is to shake up the bottle, rigourously!  I mean, shake the thing up hard.  Then, pump into your palm. When you shake it, the cleanser turns into a pearly texture vs. a watery one.  Got that tip from the bottle.  It says it right there.  Shake well.  I know this stuff is a high-end cleanser aka expensive, but it is so worth it.  I wonâ€™t use anything else.  Lasts me for about 6 weeks using 2x per day. FAB-U-LOUS!
