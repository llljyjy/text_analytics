I received a tube of Tulsa’s so polished scrub for free from Influenster in exchange for my review. I thought this scrub smelled really nice and tropical and left my skin feeling clean and soft. The only thing I didn’t like about it is that I find the gritty part dissolves quicker that I would like. Unless I used extra product, I found it dissolved before I could get a good scrubbing out of it. But otherwise I would recommend it. For the price though I think there are better scrubs out there. Good but scrub dissolves to quickly
