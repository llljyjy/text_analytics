I’ve been using Murad products for quite some time now and I absolutely love them. I recently fell in love with this daily clarifying peel. I started using it for about a month now. The texture of my skin has changed in the most positive way! My skin looks softer, plumper, and most of all my pores look smaller! I also noticed how my serums I use after using this product really absorb into my skin (I follow up with the rapid dark spot correcting serum on my face and the retinol youth renewal eye serum around my eyes). I know it’s not good to keep touching your face, but I can’t help but feel how amazing my skin feels. So happy I added this to my routine! I highly recommend giving it a try. My favorite peel!
