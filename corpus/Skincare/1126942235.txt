I have been using this for two years now. It is the only eye cream that has helped to reduce my dark circles. I use this in conjunction with The Ordinaryâ€™s caffeine eye cream and together they make my eyes look bright each morning. The cream is thick and takes a while to absorb into the skin, but is very hydrating. nan
