I’m going to second other people’s comments about this “pilling“ on the skin. I was recommended this product after taking The Inkey List quiz on their website. I have dry skin that needs more care in the winter so I was partial to trying this. My skin has significantly improved in hydration since I incorporated this into my routine, but every time I apply any kind of oil on top of it, it peels off in little balls and then it’s frustrating to get off my hands. It’s also a bit tacky to apply. I’m unlikely to purchase this again because of the pilling and instead, I’m going to look for another product that can provide the much-needed ceramides for my skin after I take this out. I would suggest this to other people who are in a similar situation when it comes to this product. I also think $15 for a small bottle is a bit absurd. nan
