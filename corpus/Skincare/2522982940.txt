Unfortunately I didn’t notice a difference in my pores or skin texture with this product. It definitely felt like it cleaned my face well without over cleaning and making my face feel tight or painful such as other toners have.. but no difference in pore size or helping to control breakouts. I ended up switching back over to my glycolic acid toner from the Ordinary which is A.) much cheaper and B.) makes much more of a difference in my skin texture by exfoliation. I also think the product itself could be designed a lot better, the way it’s made it’s very easy to lose much of the product when you’re pouring it out. Comparatively you can control how much toner you want to come out through a squeeze bottle with the Ordinary’s toner. Overall would not purchase again. nan
