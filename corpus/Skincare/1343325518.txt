This is not a paid review, this is a real purchase and I just came back and bought two refills. I purchased the medium, I returned from vacation and was not ready to give up my golden glow. I am ride or dying with this stuff. Holy wow is my tan gorgeous! Iâ€™ve been home for almost 3 weeks and I look like a bronzed goddess! Not orange, not fake tan looking, just brown. I have very pale skin normally, but olive undertones. No itchiness, no patchy spots, no dryness. I use a sugar scrub once a week and then spray myself thoroughly. I use a cosmetic sponge to do my face and ears, a tanning mitt for the body. If you put in the work this product works perfectly. gorgeous glow
