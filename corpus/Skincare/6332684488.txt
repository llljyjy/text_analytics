I have really sensitive skin so it can be hard to find skin products that work well for me without causing a reaction. I’ve really been enjoying this face mask! I haven’t had any reaction to it and it always leaves my skin feeling smooth. I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks but I do this its helping with the texture of my skin and making its look smoother. Great mask so far! nan
