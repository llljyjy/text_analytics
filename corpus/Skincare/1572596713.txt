A new holy grail product! I’ve been battling with the dark spots since turning 30 and have tried everything under the sun to lighten them to no avail. This product made such a huge difference in my skin in less than 3 weeks - even my husband noticed. The one thing I did not like about this product: it’s so heavily fragranced. The scent is very floral and takes a while to dissipate on the skin. Overall, it’s not something that would deter me from using again in the future! Wow!
