I received this product test for free in exchange for my review from Topbox Circle. I’ve been using this product as directed for almost a month now and I’m very happy with how my skin looks. In the morning it feels really nice and refreshing. My skin looks looks glowy and refreshed and I think it’s helped to even out my skin. I think it’s also helped to moisturize my skin and keep it hydrated. The bottle appears that it’s only supposed to last a month as it has day markings on the side of the bottle. I used it for 2 week straight and had not hit the 7 day mark even. I use one pump of the product which I personally find is a lot of liquid for my face and sometimes it spills out of my hands. I prefer to use this product with my hands instead of on a cotton round, but maybe with the cotton round it would be the perfect amount dispensed. It’s a tad expensive but I love the way my skin looks after using this and it seems to last way longer than expected so I would absolutely continue to purchase this. nan
