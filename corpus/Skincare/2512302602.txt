Very nice day cream. It is light weight, has a light refreshing scent like light cucumber, makes your skin soft, and protects your skin. I have used this several times to give an honest review, and have found it to be an excellent addition to my day routine. I out this on after my serums. I let it absorb into the skin and then I can either go on about my day, or I can add makeup on top with no altering effects to my makeup. I recommend this to all those also who may have acne prone as well as sensitive skins. nan
