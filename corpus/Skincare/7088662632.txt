I received this product for free from influenster and Dr. Jart in exchange for my honest review. This is good for someone who likes light makeup days. Nothing too heavy or full coverage. Definitely does hydrate & protect with spf 40. If you don’t like spf, beware it does have that heavy sunscreen smell. I personally wouldn’t repurchase because it only has 4 shades. I get that it’s a bb cream but the medium tan is dark for me. I’m sure the light medium would be light. You’d have to set it with powder because it’s tacky and transfers a bit. Medium tan
