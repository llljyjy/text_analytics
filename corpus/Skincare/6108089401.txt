Iâ€™m loving this! I use it as a moisturizer but also as a primer for my makeup. It has a sort of gripping feeling to it. I also love that the texture feels quite thick, but then you apply it and it just absorbs so well and so fast into the skin. I love this so much it has replaced my long time moisturizer obsession and has taken a permanent place in my daily skincare routine. nan
