Before this product, sunscreen was a chore. I work outside and re-apply sunscreen every two hours like clockwork. With this mousse I actually enjoy it. It takes 2 minutes to do my whole body. Dry time is ridiculously short.Cannot speak on a white cast because my skin is light-medium, so I don’t notice any cast. It is a stark white foam, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it left a slight cast on deeper skin than mine. #1 fan 5ever
