Good product overall, I purchased this because I like to switch up my cleanser until I find something I love and I love the oil cleanser from this same brand so I decided to try the two together.  It’s a good product, works well with their oil cleanser, I just preferred other products I’ve used with their oil cleaner better.  I’ll also state that the fragrance is way stronger than the oil cleanser and this is more irritating on my eyes (sensitive eyes).  Again good product in that it does what it claims and for a fair price and size, this just wasn’t what I preferred to go with the oil cleanser. Good Product - Just wasn't my Fav
