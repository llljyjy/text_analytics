Third in a row that is broken and won’t wind up, I’ve tried ordering online and buying in store and all broke.  Obviously a packaging flaw that is being ignored by the company. So sad because I live this product for gua sha! The oil itself is light and not greasy and stays slick enough for gua sha but absorbs nicely afterwards. Please address packaging flaws!!!
