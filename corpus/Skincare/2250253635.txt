I received this product from Tula and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like that you can use it under or over makeup, so it works for a pick-me-up later in the day. The cooling feature isn’t my favorite but I like how smooth this product goes on. I tried it on just one eye and asked my boyfriend which eye looked better and he picked the Tula eye. He said it looked brighter, so I guess it does what it’s supposed to! It brightens my under eye
