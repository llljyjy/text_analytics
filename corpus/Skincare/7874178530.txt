I really do like this serum.  It’s light weight--but I have more of dry skin, so it’s great to start with this serum after washing/toning but I have to follow up with a moisturizer (as directed).  It’s not an “on its own“ product, its a great in between for a deeper hydration.  You won’t get an instant hydration with it, think light weight, non greasy, serum! gifted by Dermalogica Not on its own!
