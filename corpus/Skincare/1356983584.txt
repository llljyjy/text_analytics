*I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review*I am super critical of eye creams. I find that most do not live up to their claims... and the ones that do are usually pretty pricey.This eye cream is really good. Although it looks rich, it goes on light and absorbs easily. It works really well under makeup and I do notice my fine lines reduced. I have always had textured under eyes with small wrinkles... but I noticed a difference immediately. I also see consistent improvement with am/pm usage. I also have no sensitivity issues. Definitely worth buying. It does what it says it does! Noticeable improvement in undereyes!
