Everything about this serum is impeccable. The smell alone made me run to their main website to look at their fragrances, it smells THAT good. But if you’re someone who is sensitive to smell or simply do not like heavily scented products, you might be put off. But I don’t see how since the smell is like some upper class posh refined NYC socialite. I personally love it. The packaging itself works. What I mean is, it has a double barrel that pumps equal amounts of products each time. This type of mechanism is usually risky as one side might pump or not pump or pump too much or too little. However, not in this case. Because of that, the serum is most effective and works as it should when the correct amount is dispensed. The serum itself leaves your skin looking soft and hydrated each time. I can’t wait to see what it does for my skin long term. Highly recommend. Will purchase again. Oh, and their fragrances too. Impeccable
