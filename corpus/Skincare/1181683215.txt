I was hesitant at first to get it because I thought the bristles were stiff like the Clarisonic brushes. I WAS WRONG. The bristles on this item are soft and flexible. It allows me to clean hard to reach places like the sides of nose near my eyes(keep eyes shut when doing this). I am reordering another one. better than Clarisonic
