Heavily fragranted and the smell lingers for a while. I’m not opposed to the smell but not so much on my face. A little goes along way and I’m not sure if it’s the cleaner or it’s reaction to my other products because my face felt sticky afterwards. So much so that I splashed water on my face to take that feeling away. I'm still on the fence
