I received this product for free from topbox circle. I was able to stretch the product to last for almost 6 days, i like the feel when applied, lightweight, easily absorbed by the skin. I wasnt able to use it for long to be able to know the difference it made on my skin, wouls probably try a full size product because i was amazed that this product didnt gave me a breakout at all. I am very sensitive and this product did its job. Good for sensitive skin
