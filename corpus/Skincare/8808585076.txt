I believe in investing in a good moisturizer. I enjoy products that are simple in design and simple to use. I love the minimalistic packaging and I love that itâ€™s fragrance free. The moisturizer is for those with dry skin or combination. I have combination skin and use heavy moisturizers at night however this did not clog my pores as a heavy moisturizer would for someone with an oily T-zone. Overall great experience! I would definitely buy again!
