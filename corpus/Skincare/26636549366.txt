That Fresh Take Eye Cream is by far the most effective eye cream I have ever used before. Within 3 days of using it as directed in the morning and in the evening after cleansing my face I noticed the dark circles under my eyes were getting lighter and less noticeable. Currently, after 3 weeks of using the eye cream the dark circles are almost completely unnoticeable. I also like the texture of this eye cream, it feels like a lotion and does not have an oily feel to it at all. It absorbs fairly quickly and absolutely produces remarkable results.I would recommend this to anyone experiencing dark circles under their eyes and even to ones trying to prevent them. Best eye cream I have ever tried!
