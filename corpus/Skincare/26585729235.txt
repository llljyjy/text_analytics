Love the other laneige products I use regularly (the cream toner/moisturizer, the cream moisture spray, the glowy lip balm, and the overnight lip mask). Was so hopeful for this. Itâ€™s a decent light moisturizer but I HATE scented face products. The other two fave products I use from them are unscented. Literally smell like nothing. This one clearly has added fragrance. Like flowers or something. Glad I bought the mini. Will try to use it up and then will not repurchase. hate the smell. will not repurchase.
