I received this product complimentary to review! The consistency is a gel like moisturizer and feels a bit weird applying on the face. The good thing is it dries really fast! Personally it my skin didnâ€™t feel hydrated after and I actually felt like I had to apply a different moisturizer after. Not a big fan Clinique 100H moisturizer review
