I absolutely love FAB products, and this is no excpetion. I love the formula and how easy it is to rub in! The reason I rated the product 4 stars is because of the packaging; since the formula is more liquid-like, some of the product leaks back into the packaging. I love the aesthetic and function of this type of packaging, but I think it could’ve been used better for a serum with a thicker consistency, or even a moisturizer! I’ve noticed a glowier look from using this product for a few days, but hope to utilize this product more in the future! Great product, packaging could be better
