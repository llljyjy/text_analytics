This lip oil is amazing! The most long lasting one I’ve used—it lasts for a couple hours (even after eating and drinking). It goes on clear and is thick and luxurious feeling, without being too sticky. It doesn’t dry out my lips like other glosses and oils I’ve tried. The smell is incredible too. I have nothing bad to say about it other than I wish it came in a bigger size. Best lip oil I’ve ever tried!
