I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I am very critical, I don’t like giving out 5 stars…it’s gotta wow me. All that to say…This eye cream is something special. I was so excited to use it each day and night because it really is unique. It’s a gel formula, but it creates a luxurious cushion around the eyes, making them feel hydrated and awake. I felt like I saw an immediate “plumping” of my fine lines and a slightly brighter undereye after 2 weeks of use. I just wish I had a bigger sample!! It’s worth it yall! Something special; a hug for your under eyes.
