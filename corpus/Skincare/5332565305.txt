I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review and I am honestly impressed. I’ve given this serum a try for at least 2 weeks and already notice my skin brighter and am loving the way its making my skin look in general. I don’t really have wrinkles yet but I can imagine it really helps with those too! I love the packaging on this item and the serum although made with honey doesn’t smell sweet but has a light floral fragrance. Serum also absorbs into the skin and doesn’t aggravate my acne. So luxurious!
