I have worked in the beauty industry for 5 years,  I have tried many spray serums and I have liked a few. This kosas spray serum is a love for me. I love how the spray is able to get my whole face in only a few pumps. It’s not a super fine mist however it doesn’t bother me. My one complaint about this is the smell, I can’t quite put my finger in this smell but it’s not my favorite. In terms of what this serum claims to do I do believe it works. I love how my skin feels after using this I love that even though the air is becoming more dry my skin isn’t. I sometimes experience redness and sensitivity on my cheeks but I have noticed that has subsided, I’m just left with super plump and hydrated skin which I’m always a fan of. This serum has vegan collagen which is great for firming the skin. It also has hyaluronic acid which hydrates the skin. I recommend this serum for anyone who is looking for a lightweight serum that plumps and firms the skin. Great Spray serum
