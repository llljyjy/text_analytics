I’ve been wanting to try an effective neck cream. This one is nice, not too heavy and absorbs easily. I’ve noticed my eye area is less puffy and firmer. As a side sleeper, I’ve noticed fine lines forming and this helps firm and soften them, plumping up my skin. The scent is light and pleasant. I’ve noticed a visible difference in my neck and chest skin area. Firming Neck Cream!
