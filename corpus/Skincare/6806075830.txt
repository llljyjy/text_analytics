I received a small sample that lasted me a few days so this review is based off only a few days use. Overall I felt it was really great for my dry skin. During the day I put my regular moisturizer on first and then the oil on top. My skin gets dry and flaky very easily even with moisturizer so I was pretty surprised when this kept my skin feeling moisturized for almost an entire day. It’s also very lightweight and smooth. Like other reviewers mentioned this has a comedogenic rating of 3-4 so it can clog your pores. I didn’t have this experience but it’s something to be mindful of if you have really acne prone skin. Overall I do recommend giving this a try if you have really dry skin that needs a little TLC. Feels nice on dry skin
