I didn’t see much of a difference in my skin. It is really exfoliating, so if you have dry or sensitive skin I wouldn’t recommend. Do not use twice a day or even everyday either, I would recommend using it once or twice a week. If anything, use it as an exfoliant every other day. Wouldn't recommend for dry or sensitive skin
