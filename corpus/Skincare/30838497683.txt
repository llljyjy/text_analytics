Do not buy! My skin can withstand a lot. I like to try a new product each time I run out of something and my skin tends to really like a variety of ingredients. But thisss product made me completely break out which never happens. I have no idea whatâ€™s in it but I would not buy this. It also has a very strong sour smell and burns/irritates the skin. nan
