I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This eye gel-crème has a really nice texture. It smelled the way I expected an eye crème to smell. I used it in place of my regular eye cream. It has a luxurious texture, I loved it!! After about 30 seconds of patting it in it turns into a sueded texture/ feel. It absorbs nicely. My skin feels nicely hydrated the next morning. I would buy this. Luxurious!
