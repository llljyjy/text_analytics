I’m OBSESSED with this eye cream from La Mer and I can’t get enough. Good thing it only takes a little bit of product to achieve the results I’m looking for! Love how moisturizing this product is and how it feels on the skin. It really made a difference in my dark circles, which is a must. I also adore how sleek the packaging is— I’m a sucker for good packaging and this feels expensive. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! A definite add to my regular routine!!
