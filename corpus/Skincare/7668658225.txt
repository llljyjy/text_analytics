I’m surprised no one’s talking about how delicious this smells. It’s so juicy and hydrating but it smells like honey green tea boba. I actually put it on in the morning and wear it all day under my makeup. It’s a great primer, I notice any foundation or concealer will usually look dry and crackly near the end of the day but this keeps it looking nice all day. nan
