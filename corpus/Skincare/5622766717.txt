I’ve had fairly good skin the past few years. But as someone who grew up with terrible acne in my younger years, I still get a bad breakout from time to time. I have to say, this product did absolutely nothing for my breakouts. My friend with different skin also said this product did nothing. I’d recommend the classics for spot treatment: my personal favorite, Persa Gel. Also Paula’s Choice BHA 9 spot treatment or the Mario Badescu spot treatment. nan
