I used it last night because I had a very dry facial skin due to cold weather.  My usual moisturizer didn’t really resolve the problem.  I’m glad I have this multi-balm.  I dabbed it on my face and left it on my skin overnight.  OMG.  When I woke up.  I noticed how my face feels so soft, moisturized and plump.  The scent doesn’t give me headaches.  I will definitely buy this and include in my skincare PM routine. Holy Grail
