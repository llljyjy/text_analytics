I’m so sad that this product did not perform well as I love so many Glow Recipe products! This spf pilled so badly every time I wore it. I wore it 5 different times and changed up the application process each time and found that the only time it didn’t pill was when I applied it to bare skin without other skincare products. Realistically, I have a solid skincare routine so I shouldn’t have to change it up in order to make a product work. I listened to their tips and tricks to apply it and still couldn’t make it work :/ Definitely going to be returning disappointed
