This is a great and moisturizing cream. It smells great, but light and did not irritate my sensitive skin. It made my skin feel very soft and hydrated  after wearing it each night for a week. I am able to wear this product under makeup without causing it to slide off faster, or making me look oily. It comes with a little spatula which I really liked to avoid contamination of the cream. It did not break out my skin, as many moisturizers do . I would recommend this cream those with dry or combination skin. nan
