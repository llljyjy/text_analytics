Disappointing. This product had me excited by it’s highlighted ingredients -salicylic and mandelic acid which are game changers in individual products but somehow the formulation in this product broke me out so badly. I am someone who has learnt to introduce new products into my routine, so I was concerned by the hives on my skin. I used it a second time then acne started popping in new areas on my face. I returned after a week. This is advice to anyone still interested in buying—-make sure you do a patch test and wait two days before adding to your routine. Horrible product
