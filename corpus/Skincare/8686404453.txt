I received this product in exchange for my honest review, I haven’t really used many exfoliating products like this because I have very sensitive skin, it gets very red and I break out easily so I have to be very careful with using products like this, I absolutely loved this product! It made my skin so soft and glowy, it didn’t break me out or cause any redness, I used it for a week so I could give my honest review and see how my skin would react to it.  I would definitely repurchase this product again! Love it!
