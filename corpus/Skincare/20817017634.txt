Love this moisturizer - I’ve struggled with hormonal acne for ages and using this finally helped. My skin is clear and feels bright and soft. I will likely switch my daily moisturizer to this one. I combine it with Ordinary niacinamide serum and yttp vitamin c serum in the mornings and just ordinary niacinamide serum at night, it’s done a great job clearing up my skin. 9/10 helped with hormonal acne
