First of all, y’all this serum is amazing and it does what it’s says BUT the container keeps breaking. It’s not happening to the vitamin C serum as well. I had to pull both apart and put the product into travel containers because the pumps they use just continue to break. Please, please, please Drunk Elephant rethink your packaging. I don’t mind paying top dollar for products that work but if I can’t get them out of the container it’s not worth the price. I usually have a personal rule of only posting positive reviews but this is getting nuts. AMAZING product but the containers keep breaking
