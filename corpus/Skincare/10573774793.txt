This product smelled amazing when I took it out of the package. Itâ€™s infused with vitamin c (which is something I need more of) and is beautifully packaged. You need to shake it a bit so that the product mixes, however when I put it on it went on very well. I felt like a glazed donut after! Made my skin feel nice although it did feel slimy while it was drying. Would have loved it to absorb faster. I have normal-dry skin and this was great for it Loved this product!
