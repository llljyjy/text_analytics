This product really surprised me. I’ve never heard of this brand and was excited to try it but skeptical. Well I’m no skeptic now. This product WORKS!  The heat in AZ is insane and this kept my makeup on all day.  It keeps my face matte and not greasy. It glides on smooth and has no scent to me. A little goes a long way which is great since this product is on the expensive side. However this is not something I would purchase for winter months but will definitely splurge for the summer to keep my makeup looking fresh all day. Works in AZ Heat!
