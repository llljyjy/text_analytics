First of all, this product made my face darker immediately because the shade is much darker than my skin tone (I have extra pale skin and always use the lightest shade). Second, I don’t like the smell and feel of the product, smells like sand, and after a few hours it touches like micro particles on skin so I really want to wash it off. Third, it would make my skin oily after a few hours. Fourth, the pump is hard to press because of its angle. I really like the idea of combining physical sunscreen with serum so I can use it in the morning especially when working from home, serum does good to the skin while sunscreen protects against occasional sun exposure. It’s liquidy thus easy to spread. I would buy the product again if it can have more shades and update the smell and feel. Good idea but need improvement
