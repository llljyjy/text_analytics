I received a FREE sample of Caudalie Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream from Topbox Circle. I use this cream at night before I go to bed.   It’s so silky smooth when I put it on.  Within a few days I noticed a difference in the darkness under my eyes.  I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now and all the dark circle are gone. It Works for Me!
