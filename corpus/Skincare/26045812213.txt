received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. When I first received this eye cream/gel,I was ready to try it out. With a fresh new baby. My eye bags/circles were coming out in full force. I used the entire package and do have to say, I think it works. The (advanced night repair eye gel-creme), was  silky smooth. Itâ€™s buttery soft consistency was ultra hydrating. I was looking forward to putting this on my skin every night. It was a welcome relief to my dry eyes. It is a beautiful product, however as a new mom, the price is just a little much. But maybe it will be on the list for Santa next year! Love it!
