I bought this cleanser as a boxing day deal at Sephora. I am so glad I did because it makes my skin feel so cleansed and refreshed. I always have a nice glow after washing and it doesn’t dry out my skin. I follow it up with my daily moisturizer and I’m so confident in my skin. I really enjoy the smell too which I know some have commented tone quite strong. To me it has a nice spa like smell to it. The gel goes a long way and the bottle itself is a great value for the price. Cleansed and Refreshed
