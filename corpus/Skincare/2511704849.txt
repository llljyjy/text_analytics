This is a nice product. There is a slight tingle as written on the label, but it isnâ€™t horrible. The serum works pretty well for tightening my skin and evening my skin tone. A complaint I feel is notable is the smell. It has a terrible smell and it lingers for a bit. I also need a moisturizer after because it does dry my skin out. (But that is also suggested on the bottle) Nice Serum for Evening Skin Tone
