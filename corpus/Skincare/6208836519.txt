I received this #freeproduct for review from #trywithtopbox. It was a small package sample that I could only use once. That being said i enjoyed the sample! It had that luxe serum smell and felt great when i applied it to my skin. I decided to use this at night after a shower so it did give a bit of a spa experience that i enjoyed. I also found it soaked into my skin very nicely! I paired it with the wrinkle correcting cream , i also got a sample of the wrinkle correcting eye cream so i used that too! Overall it was a great experience!!! Great Sample!!
