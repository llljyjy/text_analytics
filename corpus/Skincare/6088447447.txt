Yeah, I suppose you could say this is a hydrating face wash. Oily is another term. It doesn’t get all my eye make up off, which is annoying; I only wear mascara. I like the brand and wanted to like this face wash, but I’ve used half the tube and am still disappointed. I would never buy this again. Buy something else
