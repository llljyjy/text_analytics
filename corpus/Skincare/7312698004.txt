My all time favorite eye cream has been the Algenist Complete Eye Renewal Balm. It has made my eye area the best it can be compared to any other eye creams I have used. I was more than excited to try out the new ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM which seems to be the upgrade of my already loved eye cream. As soon as I put the creamy balm on, my skin felt incredible and my eyes area looks plump, smooth, and awake. This is my new favorite that I plan to continue with. This is the care my eyes need.
