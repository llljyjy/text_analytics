I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. I have my son using the EradiKate Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser for two weeks now and we have seen a decrease in the number of open and closed comedones. He suffers from moderate acne and due to the exfoliating benefits of this cleanser we are starting to see some improvement! The lightweight gel cleanses without drying his skin out. He says his skin feels less bumpy and smoother since using the EradiKate cleanser! nan
