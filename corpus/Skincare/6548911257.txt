This is my fave moisturizer, I switched from the Fresh Lotus and haven’t gone back. It is thick and it is borderline oily looking when you use too much BUT it does moisturize and leave a glow under make up. A lot of people say this pills but they’re simply not waiting long enough before applying face makeup. I don’t know how long I can pay 70$ for a moisturizer so I am on the hunt for an alternative but there is a reason why it’s a cult favorite. nan
