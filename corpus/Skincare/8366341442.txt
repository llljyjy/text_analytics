I got this after hearing so many great reviews about it, and after using most of the bottle I would say that it’s just okay. I think the thick, slimy consistency is my favorite part, as it’s very hydrating for my dry skin. And I can’t say for sure if it’s kept my pores tight, but it generally seems to do its job. However, I can’t get over the intense artificial fragrance. Most reviews describe it as fresh, fruity, & natural, but I think it smells far from it. Fruity, yes, but definitely more like a jolly rancher than an actual watermelon. For this reason I most likely wouldn’t buy it again, but if you’re into that kind of sickly sweet smell, I think you’d find it very enjoyable :) Watermelon Jolly Rancher
