Augustinus Bader The Light Cream is not a cream I had tried before so I was not sure what to expect.  I have been using this cream for 10 days now both morning and night.  This is a very lightweight cream, almost a serum texture.  It goes on smooth and drops into skin easily giving my skin a dewy finish.  I used this on top of my usual serum during the day as a moisturizer, at night I sometimes use a heavier moisturizer over the top of it.  I can not detect much scent which is great.  I will continue to use, itâ€™s a great summertime moisturizer. great summertime moisturizer
