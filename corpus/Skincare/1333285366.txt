I am truly not one to call ANYTHING a holy grail, but I will never not use this product again. I spray this on my face, inner thighs, and shoulders because when the weather gets warmer, I tend to get breakouts in these areas from sweating. Showering morning/night/immediately after workouts doesn’t even help (even when I use my facial cleanser in these areas), but this product being sprayed on after my showers is the only thing that stopped this.I think whether you agree that this is holy grail will depend on your skin concerns. I certainly would not be as over-the-moon about it if it weren’t for the acne issue), but I am truly so relieved to have found something that works for me. You really have no idea. Agree with the sentiment that this is holy grail…
