I agree with others that application is key! just get the continuous mister bottle, it’s a gamechanger. I’ve used dark for years but recently switched to the medium and I feel like it looks more natural on me, especially for the winter/spring then I’ll use up my dark only for summer. Like I said I’ve purchased this water for 3+ years, never had the white spots others mention but it literally looks like its the coconut oil separating from the water.. smh read the ingredients lol. It’s very hydrating for me I have dry eczema prone skin and this is the only tanner that hasn’t irritated or dried it out. This stuff also doesn’t have the worst tan smell in the morning, which I hate. Lotion up your dry spots prior and you should be good. hydrating & natural glow
