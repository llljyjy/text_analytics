I love this moisturizer. It is completely unscented, and so gentle on my sensitive skin. It’s very hydrating, but I love that my skin seems to soak it up quickly so that I can continue on with my makeup routine without delay. I can already tell that it’s starting to help with texture issues. My skin feels smooth, firm, and refreshed. I think it will work well for both summer and winter seasons, and I love the addition of ceramides. When my sample runs out, I will definitely purchase the full size. Wonderful moisturizer
