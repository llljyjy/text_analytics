If your buying a Nuface specifically for this attachment I would probably pass. Due to the small size it is very time consuming. It’s also defective, I’ve gone through two of these where it has cracked in the same place on it’s own. I’ve been very careful not to drop or bang this around. The heat it generates could be causing it to crack. Pass
