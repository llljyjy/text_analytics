Two days after using the sample I knew I had to get it. I bought the 50ml. It’s lightweight, smooth, super hydrating yet not greasy. I have oily/combination skin; this product gives me an amazing glow. I’m hooked!! Only wish it was lighter on the wallet too!! ($$$) Meet my newest holy grail facial moisturizer!
