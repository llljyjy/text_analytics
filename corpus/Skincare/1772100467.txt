It’s always great to find a serum with vitamin C that doesn’t break you out, and this is it! The serum is great for all skin types and gives you a dewy glow. I apply it morning and night under my moisturizer and it feels great on the skin. I also love how the serum is vegan and has natural vitamin C and E as well as natural peptides. The product absorbs nicely into the skin but it is a bit watery and can get all over the place if not careful. It’s a good product at a nice price point! Glow Serum
