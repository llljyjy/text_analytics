Not worth your money. This product does not clean well especially if you have a foundation on or any type of makeup and does not dissolve easily, itâ€™s like rubbing your face with a gooey substance. Not enjoyable. Also when you rinse your face guaranteed to have orange goo in your sink afterwards. Not worth it. Not worth the hype either.The only positive is that you smell oranges! So the smell is pleasant. Pass. Not worth the hype
