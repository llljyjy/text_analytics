For me this moisturizer is perfect. I have normal to dry skin. The smell isn’t as bad as most of these reviews make it out to be. It just doesn’t have a fake flowery fragrance to cover the scent of the ingredients. Also the smell doesn’t linger after putting it on, but the moisture stays all day for me. nan
