Ran out of Green Clean (Farmacy) and wanted to try another cleansing balm at a lower price point. This gets makeup and/or SPF off as a first cleanser but often comes out as a runny liquid before the balm dispenses. Will be taking it back as I just donâ€™t love it. If price is your limiting factor, would be worth it but I can afford a bit more for a relaxing cleanse after long days. Gets the job done
