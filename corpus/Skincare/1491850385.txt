Loving this so far!  Been using it for about two weeks.  Have been looking for a nice vitamin C moisturizer for daytime for a while now.  This seems to do the trick.  FYI, it IS bright yellow by design, it is not “oxidized“ as some other reviews have stated.  The smell IS strong, but I LOVE neroli and wear neroli based perfume, so this is heaven to me although the smell may not be for everyone.  Best part is I really like the consistency and texture.  It’s perfect for my 55 yo skin, may not be for younger skin.  It definitely brightens, has helped lighten dark spots and gives me a nice base for make-up.  As I said, may not be for everyone, but if you have mature skin, like a heavier neroli scent and need that extra bit of moisture under makeup during the day, this is a great product. Works for me!
