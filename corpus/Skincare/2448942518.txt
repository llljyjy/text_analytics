I use this after washing my face each morning and it helps to remove dull skin before I put on moisturizer. I think it has helped clear up my skin and I recommend it for anyone looking for a toner. It has never bothered my skin and the only time Iâ€™ve felt it tingle was when I had scrubbed my skin with a washcloth prior to use. a nice toner at a great price
