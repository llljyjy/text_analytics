Sooo excited to have recieved the LancômeAbsolute Rich Cream! It’s honestly AMAZING and my skin fell in love with it. My skin feels really plum after using it and the cream itself is infused with Grand Rose extracts, Shea Butter, and Coconut Oil. I’mdefinitely keeping this product in my regimen as it left me smooth and firm. It’s suggested for day and night use and I alternated and used it for both. I highly recommend this face cream especially if you love luxe skincare products! nan
