I really like this serum! I have dry sensitive skin, and my skin had no adverse reactions to this serum. There is a noticeable scent at first, but when it dries, you can’t smell the scent anymore. I’ve noticed that my skin feels more hydrated, and a bit firmer. It goes on very well, a bit watery in texture, but not so watery that it evaporates almost instantly. I only need 2 full pumps of product for my entire face, so a little can go a long way. A Great Addition To My Skincare Routine
