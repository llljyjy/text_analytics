The peel pads contain 20% glycolic acid complex and 1.5% time-released retinol. These come in a pre-moistened pad and are used after washing your face.  I used these twice a week at night and and allow the product to sink in. These are definitely potent but not irritating and also without a detectable fragrance. They left my skin slightly tingling (almost like an OxyClean pad) but not painful. I definitely feel like these made the biggest difference in improving my skin because the pad kind of penetrated more deeply into the skin. The results? WOW!!!!! And I mean wow. My skin looks good!!!! Incredibly brightened. Normally in winter my skin is exceptionally dull. My skin looks so good that I’ve been going without makeup!!!!! That’s unheard of for me. Important thing to remember is to wear sunscreen when using skin peels as you may be more inclined to burn. nan
