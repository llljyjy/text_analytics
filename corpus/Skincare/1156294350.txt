Very nice scent. Aloe doesn’t seem like it could hurt, either. I haven’t experienced a dramatic calming effect on the skin as I’d hoped with the addition of chamomile. I use these mists only occasionally, typically when I crave a fresh feeling rather than NYC hot and humid. If you like facial sprays, #MarioBadescu is a trusted brand, and it’s worth a try. Price point is perfect, too! nan
