I have been able to try a few things by Belief, including the original Aqua Bomb. It was a product I instantly loved! This version is even better. As someone with dry skin I love how plump my skin looks after just on use. This have to be my favorite vitamin C product I’ve tried in the last two years. My skin is hydrated, brighter, and soft. This cream has a very soft citrus scent, almost a combination of lemon and orange. It’s not at all overpowering. I’m going to have to buy a big one! I want a big one!
