i have combination, slightly sensitive skin.usually i use the AHA/BHA cleanser from SkinMedica, but for the price i decided to buy and try the mini version of this AHA/BHA cleanser from Murad.i was highly disappointed. my pores did not feel cleansed. after switched back to my SkinMedica AHA/BHA i can see a visible difference in just 2 days/night of use. i went through the entire (mini sized) tube of the Murad product and saw no results. disappointed
