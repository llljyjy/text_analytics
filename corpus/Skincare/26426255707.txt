I recieved this product free complimentary of Influenster for review purposes.Loved how hydrating this cream is.  A little goes a very long way. I’m young and with no wrinkles so I don’t need this on a daily basis, but if you need a good moisturiser that will help with age delay, I will recommend this. I use this cream mainly in the winter when I feel my skin is feeling dry and I start to notice my smile lines more. Definitely helps with my dry winter itch too. Overall I loved this cream! Loved it!
