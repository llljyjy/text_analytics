This product is amazing. Purchased the full size after I got a travel size. I love applying this serum on after essence and before any moisturizer. This leaves my skin feeling nourished and hydrated after. using it and decreases any skin flakes or dullness of my skin. It definitely has a tacky consistency so I can see how this could be a good makeup base. However, it does absorb well by morning time. I love the watermelon fragrance, but I know a few people who have complained about the strong scent. If you are sensitive to scents, maybe give it a smell in store before buying it. A must-try!
