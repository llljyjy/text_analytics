I use the rich cream and I really love it but this one, the cream, had such a gross smell to it I couldn’t keep it. It’s unfortunate because it’s lighter weight than the rich cream and looks beautiful on skin and under makeup but I couldn’t get past the smell - especially with this price tag. Bad scent
