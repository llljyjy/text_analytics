I bought this to reapply sunscreen without having to mess up my makeup.  I was hoping this would be better than any of the other sprays I use on my face but it isn’t.  The pump is terrible and doesn’t provide a must, so I had to spray it in my hands and then pat it over my face. It made my face feel greasy and it did burn my eyes and mess up my contacts.  This isn’t any better than the $10 sprays in the drugstore. Pump is Terrible
