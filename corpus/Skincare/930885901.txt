I received this product in return for my honest opinion. At first I wasn’t excited as I mainly use clean beauty products. However, after reading the ingredients list I was pleasantly surprised! I found this creme to be very smooth while moisturizing my skin and giving it a great glow. I also enjoyed the scent which is not perfume (a positive) but rather moringa and hibiscus flower which are great for your skin! I only used it in the morning as it was a tiny sample and only lasted a few days when using it on my face and neck. I typically use the Augustinus Bader rich cream and pretty picky about what I put on my skin but overall I would recommend this, I would recommend Estée Lauder provide a bigger sample in the future so you could at least use it for a few weeks to give a true tested review. Pleasantly surprised!
