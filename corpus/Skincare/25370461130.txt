So I’ve used this facial spray twice already, its become kind of like my go to just because the reputation of the brand, MARIO BADESCU products have been around for some time now i remember seeing my sisters use this product growing up; and I’m 29 by the way. I enjoy using this product. I use it right after I cleanse, this specific one; the Aloe, Chamomile, and Lavender infused one, is really soothing on the skin I definitely feel soothing properties of this facial spray. definitely recommend for daily use. MY GO TO.
