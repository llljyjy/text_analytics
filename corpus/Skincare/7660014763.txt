I have struggled in the past with moisturizers as Iâ€™ve felt they never truly did the job, it kinda felt like they were sitting on top of my skin not sinking in which sucks during cold weather. I tried this and wow! It feels so nice on the skin it sinks in nicely it leaves my skin with an amazing glow, definitely good for skin on the dry side. It fixed it up right away! Highly recommend! so good!
