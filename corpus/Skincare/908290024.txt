I was so excited to try this eye cream as I have been searching for one.  I am early 40s with the early signs of aging like hooding and some wrinkles, as well as dark under eyes.  Unfortunately over the two weeks I used this white bumps appeared on the skin below my eyes.  This usually happens when creams are too heavy for my skin.  I have dry but sensitive skin.  This apparently was too much for it.  Bummer since I wanted this to work. Received this for review from Estee Lauder and Influenster. Didn't work for my skin unfortunately
