I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really wanted to like this product more, but I just couldnâ€™t get past the white cast. When you squirt the sunscreen out, it almost looks like a skin tint for someone with fairer skin. When you rub the sunscreen into your face, their does not seem to be a tint but rather a white cast. I have fair skin with a more neutral/olive undertone, and you could notice the white cast on my face until I blended it with my fingers for a good few minutes. I can only imagine the white cast being more noticeable for someone with a darker skin color than I. However, there are some plus sides to this product. It is extremely lightweight and very hydrating. The sunscreen is easily to apply, as a little goes a long way. I can see this sunscreen lasting for a while because of that. Decent product, but bad white cast
