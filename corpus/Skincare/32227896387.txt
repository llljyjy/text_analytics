I am absolutely loving the hydration this is providing my skin. My face gets so dry in the winter time and nothing has been working. I have been using  this overnight mask and it was like giving my skin a huge glass of water. My skin appears to be more balanced and has a very nice glow to it. It soaks into the skin effortlessly leaving it feeling soft and smooth when I wake up in the morning. Hydration
