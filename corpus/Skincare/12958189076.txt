I received this product free to test for my honest review from Influenster. Beautiful bottle. Easy application. I have dark spots and I have noticed them getting lighter now that I’ve been using this product. I will say I’m not a fan of the smell. It’s giving me woodsy, old potpourri hints but fortunately moisturizer and spf go on top so it’s not noticeable when doing the complete skincare routine Works but dislike scent
