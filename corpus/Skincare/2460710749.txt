I have never written a review but I had a pimple that looked like Mount Fuji on my face yesterday. After I showered and washed my face, I put some of my Boscia toner and then added a dot to the pimple and kept it on overnight. Today it’s pretty much gone. It went down almost completely. There is still a red spot but I probably have to use it one more time for it to go away. I’m impressed. There was another bump on my nose that I used a dot for and it’s gone this morning. I will definitely keep these around It Works!
