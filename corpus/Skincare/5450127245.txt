I really like these. They suck everything out and the salicylic acid cleanses it. They look pretty gross after a while from pulling everything out so I’d say it’s more of an at-home product. They really help big pimples scab over, but I have had it remove the scab that it helped create sometimes so I removed a star for that. nan
