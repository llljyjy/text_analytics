I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve had a hard time coming up with something to say about this. I really don’t have strong feelings for it. It’s ok. It’s moisturizing and absorbs quickly. I don’t notice any odor. I do like it, but it’s pretty expensive for a moisturizer. I do t notice any other benefits. nan
