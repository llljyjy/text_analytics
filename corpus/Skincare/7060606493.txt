Holy cow, I got this to try on an offer or reward or something and I will never live without it. For as long as I can remember, I’ve had red skin and I’ve found products that help but never anything that’s neutralized it THIS well. I just need a small amount of this product and it 100% neutralizes the redness in my face. It does not feel like I’m wearing anything, it looks totally natural and lasts all day. I’m not even wearing bb cream anymore, just this stuff, and a small amount of primer and concealer. A life time of an insecurity, just gone. I’m so happy with this product. For clarity, I do have really light / fair skin. nan
