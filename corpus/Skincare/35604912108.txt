I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox (Top Box Circle) in exchange for my honest review. This product is divine. It contains glycolic acid and papaya enzymes but is safe for the most sensitive skin. It has no parabens or animal ingredients in it. I used this as my nighttime moisturizer before bed and whole it feels rich and luxurious it does not give you that heavy, “Vaseline-feel“ that some nighttime moisturizers do! The scent was a mild, floral scent that dissipated shortly after applying it to the skin. This product is supposed to minimize dark spots and give dull skin a radiant look. After using this for only a week, it absolutely did just that. I have replaced my normal nighttime moisturizer with this one because I loved it so much! Replaced my normal nighttime moisturizer FAST!
