I used this for a year and did not see any results. I used it in combination with the foaming cleanser from this same brand and this moisturizer barely re-hydrated my skin after the cleanser stripped it. It did nothing for my skin, though I didn’t really expect the bakuchiol to do anything because it doesn’t work for me, in any product. The moisturizing ingredient is just hydrogenated soybean oil, so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. There are better basic moisturizers out there. At least now I know I can’t skip my serum and moisturizer steps, this combo did not work. nan
