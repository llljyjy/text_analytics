I really like this product! The smell is refreshing and not over-scented. The bottle is the only thing I would chance. When I rinse my face with water, screwing off the bottom with wet hands is not ideal but I think the packing is really slick and looks really good with my other skincare products. Then again itâ€™s Dior! Luxurious Skincare!
