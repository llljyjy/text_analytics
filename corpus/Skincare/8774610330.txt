I received this product as a sample. I really liked the consistency of the moisturizer. I liked that it was more of a gel then a cream. My face felt hydrated and didn’t get oily during the day. I wish the sample had of been a bit bigger so I could of used it for a little longer, but I still think it’s worth a try. Nice Moisturizer
