After using this product for the past three weeks, I can really see a difference in my skin texture and how much my skin has started getting brighter. I use the actual treatment about once a week since my skin is super sensitive and I use prescription tretinoin cream. However, I do use the exfoliator about 4 times a week and it is so effective in taking off dead skin and encouraging new skin cell growth. The scent definitely irks me a little bit, but I’m just sensitive to scents in general, so I doubt it’s too big of a deal for most people. I would wash the applicator with face wash prior to using it though, as it smells more chemical-like than the actual treatment itself. A new must-have!
