My new holy grail moisturizer is finally here, and I can’t believe I have been living without it my whole life! My dry skin appreciates the fact that it absorbs right in and intensely moisturizes. The moisture lasts even after washing your face, so a small amount goes a long way and you can reap its benefits after only one application. I have tried several skincare products and they have all proved to be ineffective on my dry skin however this actually ends up moisturizing my skin even on days where its a little extra dry. I also love how this prevents my foundation from breaking up, which makes it look and feel gorgeous. Honestly, I hope the formula doesn’t change because this is basically a drink of water for the skin. Amazing moisturizer for dry skin!
