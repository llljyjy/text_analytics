I went into my local Sephora intending to buy a different moisturizer that I had used and liked previously. The sales lady talked me into trying this instead and I’m always open to new products. I swatched it on my hand and the gel consistency felt pretty nice. I also didn’t notice the fragrance so much in the store so I went for it. Once I started using it at home I realized the scent is pretty strong. It’s not a bad scent but it’s just stronger than I like and lingers for a while. My biggest complaint however is that I simply didn’t find this to be moisturizing at all. I used it everyday for about a week and halfway through the day my face would feel dry and like I didn’t put on anything, and was getting flaky around my nose. I also felt that for the price point I would like a glass container but it is cheap plastic. That’s probably me being nit picky but overall I felt for the high price of this item it wasn’t worth it. I returned and got the other moisturizer I was originally going for. Not Great
