Nicely weighted and razor itself is great quality. Probably the best razor I’ve ever tried before. You don’t need to shave many times bc it’s pretty sharp that helped me not get defeated skin and frictions by it. I recommend you to put some shaving cream or something similar to shave with to protect your skin! I always use aloe vera lotion to shave. It’s worth the price overall. This Does The Job
