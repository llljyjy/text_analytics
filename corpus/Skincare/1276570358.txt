This is a hydrating moisturizer for sensitive skin. Itâ€™s lightweight and it does not feel greasy on the skin. I like to use this day cream before applying makeup because it helps reduce the redness on my skin. Also, it has enough hydration for my dry skin too.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has redness and dry skin. Great Day Cream for sensitive skin
