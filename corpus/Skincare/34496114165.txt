This face cleanser is my first ever HG product. It’s gentle exfoliation that I can use every day. Leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. The scent is faint but pleasant. I honestly look forward towashing my face now, even when I don’t feel like doing it. You need very little product to get a good clean skin, so this bottle has lasted me Never using anything else
