I tried the doctor Jart daily peel pads in a sample and loves them, I can’t speak to how well they work long term but the price point on those is ridiculous for not much more in the way of better formulation. These are super gentle, do not sting even after I’ve shaved my face, and cleansed. I wipe these gently on my face until the pad is dry and then apply a serum over top. I wouldn’t recommend using any other exfoliating products after or before this but these are gentle and I use a gentle retinol afterwards some days and the way your skin glows after and is so smooth is crazy. I genuinely use mine every day and have had no issues. As always build up if you’re new to chemical exfoliants as they can be sensitizing. Best bang for your buck, gentle too
