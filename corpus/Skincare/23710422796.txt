When I received this product, I was so excited to use. It smells good and cleans very well, BUT after I used it for a few days, my skin became very sensitive. (I never had sensitive skin before) I stopped use for about a week. And used it two nights ago. It lathered up so nicely and my skin felt very clean. But unfortunately I can only use it once or twice a week or else my skin becomes overly sensitive. :( Mixed Emotions
