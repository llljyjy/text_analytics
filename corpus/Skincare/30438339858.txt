I love this night cream for the winter! It’s on the thicker end which is perfect for the dry, harsh weather — leaving your skin moisturized the next morning. I also appreciate the clean ingredients. No fragrance and is great for those with sensitive skin. If you’re looking for a solid night cream, I highly recommend this one. Great night cream for dry weather.
