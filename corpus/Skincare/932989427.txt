This cream is very rich but has not caused any breakouts on my somewhat sensitive skin.  I recently over-exfoliated my skin and it became irritated, so I used this cream at bedtime and by morning, my skin had calmed down and felt hydrated and super-soft.  I don’t ever want to be without Omega Repair now, especially in winter - it’s a must-have for cold, dry climates. Great cream - no clogged pores or breakouts.
