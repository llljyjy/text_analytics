I have hyperpigmentation from acne and so I was excited to try this out.  I have been using it in the evenings after cleansing/exfoliating and before moisturizer and I have been really impressed with the quick results.  The spots are not gone, but the fade is noticeable.  I have been happy with all of the Peace Out products so far! nan
