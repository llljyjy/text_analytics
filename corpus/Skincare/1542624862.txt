I have used this eye cream a couple of times in the past year and I always end up going back to it. It has a good consistency and absorbs quickly into the skin. There is a light orange/yellow color to the cream that helps with brightening the area around the eyes. This product is now unscented and is vegan. I highly recommend this and will continue to be using it as part of my skincare routine! Staple eye cream
