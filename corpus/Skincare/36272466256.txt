I’ll never use another sunscreen! Was recommended to switch to a mineral sunscreen, and this is one that has zinc as the first block ingredient (which my doc said was a must). I have used this all summer at altitude - we’re talking every single day along with outdoor hikes and camping and rafting. I’ve had no issues whatsoever, no sunburns, nothing. I didn’t even have to switch to a darker foundation for the summer. Not to mention, the tiniest bit goes a long way! One bottle has lasted me almost 6 months, and that’s with multiple applications most days. The smell is fantastic too! I have not noticed any white-ish residue like can happen with some mineral sunscreen. new favorite product
