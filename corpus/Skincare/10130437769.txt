I really like this moisturizer so far after about 5 days of use. It goes on so smoothly and effortlessly and absorbs well. Itâ€™s a little heavier for my combination skin, so I prefer to wear it at night, but the dry areas of my face feel amazing with it on, so if you have dry skin I would recommend this as a day cream too. Does the job
