I received this product as a sample for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have mila and sensitive skin around my eyes and this product did not irratate it! I felt some tightening and brightening in the week I used this product. It was lightweight. Smooth and silky and the smell was pleasant. If I had the money to spend on this product it would be a staple in my skin cate routine. One of the best eye serums I have used. Good product!
