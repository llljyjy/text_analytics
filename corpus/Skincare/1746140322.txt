I really wanted to love this. I’ve always wanted to try to brand so this was my first product from them. The formula and the scent were so nice which was promising, however, within a month of having it, the applicator ripped from the tube. This meant that when using the product half of it was lost. It also made it unusable after a while. I’ve never had a tube of product break before and for $30 I was very disappointed with this experience. Poor Packaging Quality :(
