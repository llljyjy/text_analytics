I unfortunately loved this product. Reason 1: It’s extremely lightweight and a little goes a LONG way. It delivered results, especially given the cold, dry weather where I live. My skin stays soft but not overly oily all day, but it also doesn’t give me that tacky, there’s-stuff-on-my-face feeling. Reason 2: it is fragranced but it’s not strong, I don’t find I can smell it after it’s applied. If you have sensitive skin keep that in mind. Reason 3: I used it under the IT cosmetics CC cream and also with a smashbox concealer and did not experience any pilling. I find you can also put supergoop unseen sunscreen on top of it and it won’t pill at all, so I think this moisturizer just doesn’t have much silicone/dimethicone if any. Overall, this is probably the best moisturizer I’ve tried so far, which is unfortunate because she is expensive expensive (imo). That said, a little does go a long way, so if you do invest in this cream, you shouldn’t need to rebuy every month; maybe every six months at most. Somehow Worth the Money and More
