I’ve been a longtime lover of the tiger grass line, the only thing that has ever calmed my “rosy cheeks” as a 27 year old who had tried just about everything under the Sun.I’m new to the camp drops- having originally tried abs loved the color correcting cream- but disliking how heavy it felt on the skin, and how pale it made me. (I range from medium to tan pending the season). So far loving these camp drops as a very very subtle concealer. My freckles still show through- but it dampens the redness to a much more natural looking flush then my usual hot pink face.I do still find it makes me a hair pale- but nothing wild.I definitely recommend moisturizing your skin first so that any dry patches don’t catch the formula in a weird way.And when you wipe your face- the formula is sheer enough that there aren’t any glaring “missed spots” when you do remove some product.Overall really like it, I’m not a face makeup gal (beyond daily eye makeup, and occasional lip products)- but this is something I could see myself using daily.Really impressed by this line overall, currently using the serum, gel/cream, and this. So far, perfect!
