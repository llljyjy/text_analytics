Iâ€™m in my 30s I have dry skin and have been hunting a replacement for the gloriousness that is the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream. I had to use at least 2 full applications of this to even feel moisturized and an hour later my skin feels itch and dry. So this goes into pile of things that were suppose to be a dupe that are not. Probably a bottom tier moisturizer for dry skin but nothing crazy happened to my face so it has that going for it. Not for someone with dry skin
