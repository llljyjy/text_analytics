I had a bad hormonal breakout about a year ago and began using tretinoin (.5%) as treatment. The tretinoin worked great for the acne but messed with my skin barrier so I bought this to help. Let me tell you, as a skincare fanatic, I am very weary of telling people that a certain product will change your life but this moisturizer has literally outdone every other product on the market. I ditched my nighttime routine and started slugging using just this product and the results I’ve seen in under a week are absurd. I was just hoping this would repair my skin barrier/calm irritation but I found that it has cleared up what little remaining acne I had and visibly reduced dark spots (which as a WOC I struggle with). As a bonus I even put a little extra under my eyes and the few fine lines I had completely disappeared after one night. I love this product so much I’m writing this review (which I’ve NEVER done before) on company time because I think I’ll actually get bad karma for not sharing this information with the rest of the world. This is the stuff dreams are made of. HOLY GRAIL
