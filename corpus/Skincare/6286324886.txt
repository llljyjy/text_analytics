I really wanted to love this product but it did not work for me. The consistency was very oily and as someone with dry skin this didn’t absorb well, it just sat on my face. For some reason, every time I put it on, my face always stung for a few minutes so I’m not sure if my skin was just reacting to some of the citrusy aspects of the serum. I do have sensitive skin so that can possibly be why. It’s okay
