I did receive this free to review but I assure you, it doesn’t sway my view of the product. In fact, I love it so much I’ll prob buy it myself when it runs out - or maybe try the cream since we’re going into winter where I live. Really great texture - lightweight and glides nice over skin. As someone who has an oily t zone I appreciate the light mattifying effect.  This is going to be TMI but I (stupidly) picked at a blemish on my 46 year old face but the mark was down to barely showing the next morning after applying this before bed; then gone by the next day. I swear this cream helped heal it up faster. Amazing. nan
