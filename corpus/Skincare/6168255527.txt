I was recommended this tatcha moisturizer by a lady in her late 60’s who had amazing smooth skin. I swear I saw no wrinkles on that lady. I bought the purple one since I have dry skin. It is not sticky at all. It leaves my skin feeling so good and I am starting to see a difference in my fine lines and overall look and feel of my skin. I use this after cleansing with Tatcha’s rice cleanser. worth the price
