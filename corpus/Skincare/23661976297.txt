When you search for oil free moisturizer on the Sephora app, this will come up. There is sunflower seed oil and essential oils like peppermint and rosemary. For super sensitive skin, essential oils are not great. That being said, I like this product. It’s unscented, but still the scent it does have is light and pleasing. I do feel that it leaves my skin matte but not dry. I had a little acne at first, but I don’t know if that was the moisturizers fault, or another product I started at the same time. This is not oil free.
