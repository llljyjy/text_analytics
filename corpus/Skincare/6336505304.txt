Honestly I haven’t noticed any difference since using this product, and the SMELL. Omg. I can’t! I’m sure some people don’t mind it, but I just can’t do it. The scent of turmeric is SO strong upon application. It goes away pretty fast once melted into your skin, but it is NOT ideal. Would not repurchase or recommend! Cannot get past the smell
