Terrible. The cream smells awful. When applied, it turns matte but doesnâ€™t fully absorb and sits as if in a separate layer on top of the skin. This layer peels off when liquid foundation is applied and leaves small clumps of foundation and cream on the skin. I cannot believe this product has received so many raving reviews. nan
