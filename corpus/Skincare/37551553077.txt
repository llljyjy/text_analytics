I got this to help with milia and general hydration/nutrition for my eyes. I have noticed an improvement in my under-eye texture! The milia appear smaller and less in number, and the skin is smoother. I have young-adult skin and have been using this for about three weeks. The cream itself is not too heavy, watery, or oily. It feels perfectly comforting. The packaging is what made me commit to purchasing - it shows me the brand cares enough to create something special to house an effective product. I also just like cute things. I love Sephora’s “clean“ category and that this was in it. Separately, I don’t really understand why sometimes the listing is an “eye cream“ and sometimes it is “sleeping mask.“ I have the eye cream, but maybe there’s not a difference? Helped With My Milia!
