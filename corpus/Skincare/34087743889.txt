I’ve been using this cream for the past 3 weeks almost every day and first of all, the packaging is adorable!The cream itself has a pastel pink coloration and has almost no smell. I normally use it at night and a few minutes after I apply I can feel the “tightness” around my eyes. It makes the area around my eyes glow, but not in a way that it seems oily. I would say it has the right amount of glow. My skin feels hydrated, but sticky. Just a very small amount is needed to cover the area!I have indeed been noticing that I look less tired after I started using this product. It brightens the dark circles under my eyes.I definitely would recommend it if you have dark under eyes like me! nan
