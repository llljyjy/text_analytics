Works pretty well -- I would say at least a well as pharmaceutical/prescribed Azelaic acid. My only problem with it is the packaging. It seems to be either very hard to get out of the tube, or way too much spills out of the tube as the bottle is being opened with no in-between, resulting in lots of wasted product which sucks since thereâ€™s not a lot in the bottle to begin with. great product, but the packaging needs improvement
