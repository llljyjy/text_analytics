This product did really well to remove/melt away my makeup. A little goes a long way. Has no smell and feels silky smooth when you rub it into the skin. A little messy when washing off since the water turns black around the sink, but nothing too terrible. My skin felt soft and smooth after rinsing off the product. Itâ€™s a great product for removing makeup. Great Cleansing Balm
