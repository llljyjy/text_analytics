I got a sample of this and a sample of the NuFace creams. They are quite different from each other, so not exactly comparing apples to apples. The Dior cream was much more intense. I felt sharp tingling to light burning sensations for a few minutes - but I will say the blemishes cleared up overnight with this product! A sample was not enough to confirm the firming/anti-aging claims. With the overnight results on blemishes, I was impressed. I ended up buying the full size NuFace instead for these reasons: much lower price mark (obviously) and far more gentle on the skin (no burning) with same blemish-clearing results. I’d like to try a couple full size bottles of the Dior since I’m really looking for firming (something NuFace didn’t live up to) but I don’t think the price mark is worth the disappointment expressed by others. An investment which may or may not be worth it
