I found this moisturizer to be particularly hydrating. I used it as a daily moisturizer and it worked well under makeup. I received a sample size which was used up in a few days, I didn’t notice any dramatic results in that time - but that could be attributable to the short span of usage. One thing to note, this moisturizer is highly fragrant. It’s a very pleasant scent and I found it enjoyable, but important to note as fragrance in skincare products isn’t something everyone loves.
