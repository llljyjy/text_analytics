I really like this moisturizer, the texture is great and I’m seeing small results in the two weeks I have used it. The only thing I noticed was my skin started to get a slight breakout when I initially started using it. My skin is very sensitive so it could just be because I was using a new product it wasn’t used to but that’s the only reason it received a 4 star from me. nan
