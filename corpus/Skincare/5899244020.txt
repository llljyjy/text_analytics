I am leaving my honest review after receiving a free 10 day sample of Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex from PinchME. I have tried it for the full 10 days and have noticed a considerable improvement in my dark circles. My eyes feel less tired and rejuvenated. The only thing I don’t like is the funky smell, but it’s worth the results. Funny smell but does the job
