I hated this product the first time I tried it. It was oily and sat on top of my skin and did not sink in or absorb. It also smells like hot bacon grease so I gave it to my Mom. A few weeks later I gave it another try after she said she loves it and she told me the secret is to only use ONE pump for your entire face and neck. Then the problem of it feeling too greasy and leaving an oil slick is non existent. I actually do like the product now and it has made a huge difference in the dullness and acne marks I used to have. Now I am glowy and even and bright after using most mornings for a few weeks. It does not pill at all and my makeup goes on beautifully on top. I will definitely re-purchase. The smell still bothers me a tiny bit but the results are worth it! Great if used correctly
