I love this moisturizing cream. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft. It absorbs very quickly and I feel like my face doesn’t get as oily with it. I’m not sure that I noticed any firming benefits from it, but I absolutely loved it. It does have a bit of a fragrance, but it didn’t last very long. I received this product free in exchange for a review. Makes Skin Do Soft
