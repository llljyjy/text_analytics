I really loved this when first applied but after a few hours it started to clump and pill on my face. no makeup or anything else mixed with it. Gross, especially when it happened at work and I had to wash my entire face to look presentable. Also, I have plenty of moisturizers that actually moisturize. This does not soak into my skin at all, it sits on top of it. Returned. Very Disappointed
