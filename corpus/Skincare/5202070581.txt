Disclaimer: I recieved this product complimentary from Supergoop in exchange for my honest review.I think this might be Supergoop’s best sunscreen yet, if you like a dewy finish! This sunscreen is liquidy and lightweight. It rubs in easily and doesn’t leave a white cast. On my dry skin it feels nice and moisturizing, but it is very dewy/shiny. I personally like that but it’s worth noting cuz that might not be everyone’s preference! Great addition to the Supergoop collection!
