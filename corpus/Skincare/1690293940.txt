Great alternative to tretinoin - seems to do just as good a job controlling acne. Has a very lightweight texture, and the silicone base doesnâ€™t feel too slick. No irritating fragrances either. Works fine on top of the niacinamide serum as long as you let the serum sink in for a minute first. lightweight and non-irritating
