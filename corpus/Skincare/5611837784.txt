This product is very lightweight and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling after applying like other products i’ve tried. It has definitely hydrated my skin. It is also very gentle on my sensitive skin and hasn’t caused irritation or breakouts like other products that i’ve used. It also has a nice smell to it. I definitely recommend it! nan
