Honestly, I didn’t have high hopes for this glow serum, but it turns out it’s actually very beautiful on the skin, and really does give you a beautiful, radiating glow without any make up on. I would give this a tries specially for its price point, its ingredients, and the fact that it is actually made in France, mine was obviously a sample size, but again you never know until you give it a shot Not bad!
