This face cream is a lifesaver for me . My face is so dry because of our water and heat in the house, espresso around my nose and forehead. This hydrated my skin immediately. It is a little heavy so you donâ€™t need a lot. It has made my skin so soft and supple. I barely wear foundation anymore, but when I do no primer needed. nan
