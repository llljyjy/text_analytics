I really love this product. The pump dispenser is such a nice feature and gives the perfect amount. It has a nice creamy texture and only a hint of citrus scent. I don’t like heavily scented products, so this was a plus for me. It didn’t make my combination skin break out either. I have been on the hunt for more clean products and I will definitely be adding this one to the list. nan
