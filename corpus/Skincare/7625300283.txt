So far so good! I have tried the cleanser for almost a week and it has been amazing. I have sensitive skin and my face feels hydrated after using it.  I have tried several cleansers before and this one removes my makeup completely and doesnâ€™t make my face feel greasy. Overall great cleanser and does the job! Love this cleanser!
