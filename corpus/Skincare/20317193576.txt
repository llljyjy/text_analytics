I really enjoy this serum. Just be mindful with it and conscious of what skin type you have. Maybe only do once every other day if you already have dryer skin. Because if u have some acne like me, the problem might be that you have a damaged moisture barrier, and this will not help with that. Sometimes when I donâ€™t feel like putting it all over my face I use it as a spot treatment for scarring maybe or hyperpigmentation from acne. This helps with scarring a lot but make sure u also have a good hyaluronic acid to keep ur moisture barrier. nan
