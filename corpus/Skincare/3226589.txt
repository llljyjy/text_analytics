I didnâ€™t receive free product like a lot of these fake reviews have. I love this lip oil. It smells good. It is thick but not sticky on and lasts for a while but not too long a time on. I took off 1 star because for the price, it needs to be the size of her glosses. Also not a fan of dimethicone in so many products. Would repurchase. Smells good-needs to be bigger for the price
