Tried this as a sample and really enjoyed it.  A single use makes it difficult to tell if my skin will react negatively, but so there has been no issues.  I liked how gentle it was and didn’t cause major discomfort when I accidentally got some in my eyes.  It didn’t leave my face feeling stripped and uncomfortably dry or tight like some other cleansers that I’ve tried before.  I’d definitely be willing to try this product again in a full size and will be adding it to my Wishlist for my next purchase. Tried the Sample Size
