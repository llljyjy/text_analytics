Ok so I absolutely loved this product. I have been giving my skin a break from so many products lately but received this and my skin DRANK it up. I can’t explain the texture , it’s like a smooth silky moisturizer gel. My face feels like absolute silk after application. I don’t have a ton of experience with Clinique but wow . I will be purchasing this . I have combo skin and never am sure whether my skin will love something or break out. A little goes a long way and I can’t wait to make this a staple. It is such a truly unique formula and I highly recommend it after 2 weeks of use my skin is clearer and smoother . Unlike anything else
