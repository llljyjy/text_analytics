I was expecting this to be a face sunscreen but it’s more like a primer with SPF. The texture reminds me of the smashbox primers (sort of a siliconized). This isn’t something I would use as an everyday Sunscreen since I prefer more a lotion for that (it doesn’t seem terribly hydrating). I tried using it under foundation and it works ok as a primer, so maybe this is a good option if you’re wanting to reduce the number of products you’re using, however for my dry skin type it wasn’t the best for me. Love the super cute packaging though. nan
