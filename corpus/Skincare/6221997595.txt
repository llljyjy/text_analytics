I loved the idea of a spray for easy re application of spf over makeup. I’ve tried two others that I wasn’t a fan of because of the smell and finish. Pros for this product : smells fresh and minty, easy to use. Cons : spits product, doesn’t mist; exaggeratedly dewy, almost oily. Shame. I was very excited for this one. Not what I was hoping for
