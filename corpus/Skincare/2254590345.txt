I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost two years and I keep going back to it bc it works great for my skin. I have combo skin and this product leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. A little goes a long way and it is expensive but for me worth it as it’s the only moisturizer that has worked for me. May not be everyone’s cup of tea but hey, no two skin is alike nan
