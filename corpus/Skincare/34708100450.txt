little disappointed, the sample covered my redness and left my skin very nice, that’s why I decided to buy it. but it didn’t work the same for me and it doesn’t cover my redness completely, my skin is sensitive and it doesn’t hydrate me and I use serum before hyaluronic, to avoid losing money I sometimes use it mixing it with my moisturizer... I didn’t like it and less with the price I expected more. At least have 30 sunblock Disappointed f
