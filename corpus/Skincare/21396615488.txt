This has been a skin saver for me. Lightweight enough that it doesn’t seem to cause me any breakouts (acne prone over here) but BIG on moisture and repair. I also really appreciate it’s simple scent. Whenever my skin feels dry or irritated this is my overnight application. I’ll use it at night after my other skin care (toner, serums, etc) a couple times per week when my skin feels at all dry or irritated. It’s so soothing for my skin after irritation or stress, like weather changes, waxing, or any kind of chemical peel. Gentle but giant. Gentle Giant
