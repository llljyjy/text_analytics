I received a Deluxe Sample of Isle Glow face moisturizer and I was impressed.  It left me with a dewy glow that was very hydrating.  I didnâ€™t notice much color from the tint, even though I have fair skin, and the sparkle was nice, and not super obvious.  The fact that it is a sunscreen is an added bonus!  Would definitely recommend. a definite win for me!
