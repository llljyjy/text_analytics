I have struggled all my life with finding skin care products that doesn’t take a layer of skin off. I have extremely sensitive combination skin. Even the products my dermatologist gave me burned my skin. When I mean burn I mean it feels like I have a sunburn on my face for over a week. I have rosacea so I get skin flare ups and acne. This toner soothes my skin instantly when I have a flare up. I started using it daily as a prevention. I haven’t had a flare up in over a month!!! finally!!!
