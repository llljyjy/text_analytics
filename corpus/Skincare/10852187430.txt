This serum is very light. I love the feel on my skin. Also the bottle and serum are very aesthetically pleasing and it smells like what I imagine heaven would smell like. I have combination skin and very sensitive to different moisturizers and serums (frequently breakout with products including Cosryx, neutrogena, cetaphil etc) . But this was heaven and super light weight. Highly recommend! nan
