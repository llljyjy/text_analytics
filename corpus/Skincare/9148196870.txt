So disappointed!!! This has been my go-to makeup remover for so long, used to take off everything so quickly and thoroughly, and just got my third jar in the mail and they definitely changed something. It was impossible to remove my makeup that wasn’t even that heavy, felt like i was rubbing olive oil all over my face and just smearing everything around. I read another review that said they felt like it left a greasy film on their face and that’s a perfect description. I had to wash my face 3 times and it still felt gross. I really hope they change the formula back because it really used to be great. :( They changed the formula!!
