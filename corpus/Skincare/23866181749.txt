SO SO GOOD. I never write reviews.. and I’m very picking with products but this is LIFE CHANGING. I have acne scars, dark spots, and dull skin.. after using this product for about a week I’m obsessed. It leaves the most beautiful finish without looking oily, it’s glowy, super goop sunscreen sits great in it. Absolutely no irritation and I have extremely sensitive skin. Just so happy to find something that works. It is expensive but you use about a dime size for full face, neck and remainder in hands and cuticles. Just so happy. Try it!!! Absolutely amazing!
