I bought this based on the reviews and because I needed something moisturizing for our dry winters, this product didn’t live up to the hype. It didn’t hydrate very well, in fact it left patchy dry spots for me and made my skin look so dull. It didn’t seem to mesh well with my serums either, so maybe if you’re using absolutely nothing else this gel might work for you. Lastly this is a personal preference but I hate lemony scented creams, and this one smelled like Lysol cleaner for your face. Gross. Eh..
