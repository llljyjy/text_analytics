I received this item from Summer Friday in return for my honest review. I have really dark eyebags and recently received this product. So far I really like it. Like most Sumer Friday products, this glides on smoothly with my skin. Itâ€™s hydrating and lightweight. So far this item has been doing wonders for my eye bag. The pricing is kind of high in my opinion, but I would give it a try if I was looking for a good Vitamin C eye cream. I like it!
