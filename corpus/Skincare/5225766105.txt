I have recently tried out the free sample of Clinique Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer. I didnâ€™t fine it quite enough to tell exactly how my face would feel but, I will say my face is quite sensitive and it was a tad harsh at first for my complex sensitive face. But, after about 2  days, it felt fairly good, moistured and soft. I would recommend to someone if they asked me how good it was, but likely not to someone with a sensitive face like mine. Not exactly for complex sensitive skin
