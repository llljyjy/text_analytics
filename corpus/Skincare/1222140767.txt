I love these foot masks! I will put them on about 1-2x a month after a shower. I usually keep them on for about 1-2 hours, not the 30 min. When I remove it, I take one off then rub the rest of the product into my foot. I always put socks on afterwards too... I have dogs and with feet still damp from the lotion, I would have furry feet! ;)   I would definitely recommend these. I get pedicures every couple of months and these help to keep my feet smooth between them. Works great!
