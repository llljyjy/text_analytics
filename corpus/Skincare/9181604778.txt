I love this product and use it so many different ways! Love it in my crazy curly but fine, easily weighted down hair, I use it before cleansing to help take my makeup off, rub it in drier areas like elbows, even my acne prone face doesnâ€™t mind a drop every now and then. For the price you can NOT go wrong. Buy 2 or 3 trust me
