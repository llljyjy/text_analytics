I am a 56 year old woman and spendan inordinate amount of money on beauty products. I also have three drawers full of sample products from being a part of at least three sample subscriptions. This baby came about a year ago. I was looking for a night time regimen that was hydrating for my combination t zone oily skin and I thought I would give this a try. My skin drank this lovely viscous fluid like it was custom made for me. I lost the tube once it was all gone and spent months trying to find it again like a lost Cinderella slipper. Cleaning out my nightstand drawer I came across the scraped clean tube carcass and oila!,  we are once again united and the full size of this baby now lives in my bed stand as a night time staple. Luscious loving for the skin
