I wanted to love this so bad. The smell is horrendous BUT it looked beautiful on my skin, make me glow. About two weeks into using it I started noticing red splotches all over my skin. I kept getting these splotches until I stopped using it and they went away. Sadly had to return! Bad for sensitive skin
