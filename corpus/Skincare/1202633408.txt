I received this eye cream for free to try. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. I have a mature skin since I just turned 40 years old. And I can see a little difference in my fine lines under eyes. This cream does what it supposed it. The formula definitely works. Love how smooth the cream is when I apply it and that it absorbed real quick. I use it twice a day and love that it’s doesn’t have a greasy feeling. My foundation and concealer goes on smooth. Love this eye cream! Great Eye Cream!
