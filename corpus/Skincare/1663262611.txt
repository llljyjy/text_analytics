I had the opportunity to try this product for free and was pretty impressed by it. I love the packaging, I think it’s awesome to have the pump dispenser because it’s much more sanitary and keeps the product clean from bacteria. The cream leaves my skin really smooth and hydrated and I love that it absorbs pretty quickly as I don’t like waiting forever for creams to soak into my skin. I mix it with my foundation to give me a sort of tinted moisturizer feel and it’s great. I will definitely continue to use the Evercalm day cream. I have noticed an improvement on my skin when I don’t wear makeup also, I have a tiny bit of rosacea and this has managed to control it enough that my skin looks pretty good even without any foundation on. I totally recommend it. hydrating and quick absorbing
