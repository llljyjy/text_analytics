I am actually obsessed with this! I have tried several hyaluronic acids at a much higher price point with just meh results. This stuff is so good it tamed a rosacea flair up with just one use! My combination skin feels buttery soft, not oily, and it wears super well under makeup! Itâ€™s like magic in a bottle-I have recommended it to everyone! But this now!
