I have noticed a change in my pores. No they aren’t so tiny that you can’t see them. But they are less visible than before. The biggest change is in the area around my nose. And this has improved that are. I haven’t had any negative changes such as extra breakouts or anything like that. My skin doesn’t look oily or grease after I use it. I would highly recommend. nan
