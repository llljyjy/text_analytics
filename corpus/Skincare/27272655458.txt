After using this product for about 3 months as skin Care I realize it works best as a makeup primer no matter how many moisturizers I put on top of it it still feels sticky under my skin so I think it should be marketed as a skin care primer. Not just skin care it does have a very nice smell I’m very sensitive to smells I usually get a headache but not from anything from this line at all. I basically own a mini of each product in this line and this is my least favorite because I wear makeup not everyday I work everyday as a nurse and my priority is not putting makeup on at 5:00 in the morning when I have to go wear a mask but if I was 20 years old again and my priority was partying this would be an absolutely great primer for makeup. I think calming the green one is my favorite forgot the name and the watermelon juice moisturizer is my favorite and if you look at the ingredients they all contain niacinamide so you’re basically putting niacinamide on top of niacinamide so just do your research pick and choose you do not need each product from this line like I did but I bought minis and I will buy full size of the ones I like but back to the watermelon sticky primer like I said it’s great for makeup but I don’t think it’s great for skin care Great as in makeup primer not so much as skincare
