By far my favorite skin care product, ever. I’ve started using more products with CBD and happened to select this serum as a sample product with a Sephora order. I instantly fell in love and ordered a full size. The serum is rich without being super oily and it absorbs into the skin well. I love how it makes my skin feel- soft, hydrated and beautiful. I use it before the Saint Jane petal moisturizer in the morning and also at night. Worth the price, a little goes a long way and I’ve got almost 3 months so far without running out. I love the boxes the products come in too. Can’t wait to try more Saint Jane Beauty products. Amazing CBD face serum
