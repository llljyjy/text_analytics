I wasn’t a fan at all. It smelled like baby barf (I’m not even kidding) and to smell that all day was just awful! I did like how it was a powder though that turned into a liquid when a little bit of water was added to your hand and it’s like a face mask. That was a very clever way for making it last a long time. If it wasn’t for the smell I would definitely get more. Unfortunately until they add something to it, I won’t be. Don't reccomend, smells awful
