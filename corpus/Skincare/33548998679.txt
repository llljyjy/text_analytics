I would highly recommend this Squalane oil to ANYONE looking for an affordable plant-derived Squalane. *While the listing for this product states it is appropriate for all Skin Types, I would have to caution those with oily skin (this is not for you). I’d say the limit on skin type would be combination. That being said, I have relatively “normal” skin (not too dry nor oily) and absolutely love this product. At the moment it is my top Squalane Oil. I have not tried the 100% oil from Biossance yet; however, it does not compare with The Ordinary’s pricing. This oil is ultra light leaving you refreshed yet without the oily feeling. Helpful Tip: A lot of people add it to their hair, but I just run my hands through my hair using the excess after facial application. Per Usual: High Quality at an Affordable Price
