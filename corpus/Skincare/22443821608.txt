I mean its a toner. I’ve had it maybe 2 weeks and it’s almost gone. I was using it twice a day but for the price it’s almost meh to me. I don’t see any changes in my skin but like I said it’s been 2 weeks of using this. I might try another bottle next month or wait and see if I keep coming back to use this. Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Cleaning Toner with Moringa
