I really like this moisturizer because I feel like I am getting a lot of vitamins all at once and not having to use separate products. Although it probably isn’t as effective as using the vitamins separately, my skin hasn’t had a bad reaction to it so why not. This is a thick moisturizer but I don’t know if I would use it as a night cream if I had dry skin, maybe normal. I use it only in the morning, and it melts into my skin nicely as long as I take the time to rub it in. This isn’t a moisturizer that just melts in right away. I wish this came with a pump because it is thick and when using a new tube air bubbles can get trapped and burp product out, so I have accidentally spilled a bunch of it. Wish it was a little bigger because if you’re using it day and night you will probably have to re-buy this roughly every month. Good moisturizer but not life changing
