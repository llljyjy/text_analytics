My skin is very sensitive. I have redness, dryness and my skin becomes itchy at times. I’ve been using this product consistently for a couple of weeks and I’ve gotta say, it has really helped my skin. The redness in my skin has reduced pretty significantly and my skin is not so itchy anymore! All in all, I liked this product for my skin. nan
