I thought this was just going to be your run of the millcleanser, nothing special. But I’ve never seen anythinglike it. From the bottle it truly just seems like gel but thenonce you apply it it’s truly like you’re rubbing oil on yourface. After rinsing, my face feels more hydrated thanwhen I started. I’m stunned. The scent is like the fresh soyface cleanser but way way more diluted. One drawbackis the packaging isn’t the most suitable for the productbut it’s fine. nan
