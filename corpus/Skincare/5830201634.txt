Wanted to love this and thought it was a fairly stable form of vitamin c but the product had already oxidized when I bought it. I noticed it right away but thought maybe that was the original colour of the formula until I looked again at the pictures and it is not. Be careful getting this product as vitamin c that is off has the potential risk of irritation. I had high hopes for this so may return and buy a new bottle to see if itâ€™s any better as I love the company and many of their products. Might try a different bottle
