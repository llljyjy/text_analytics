I was gifted the Supergroup glow screen as an exchange for an honest review. I can honestly say I love it. I am guilty of not always wearing sunscreen when I should because I donâ€™t want to ruin my makeup. Sad but true. Glow screen gave me a sense of face coverup that did camouflage my skin insecurities and also adding an overall highlight to my face. I would buy this with no hesitation! Love this
