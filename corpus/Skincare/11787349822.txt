This review is an incentive from Influenster. My review is honest based on experience using the Inkey List product. I have been using Inkey List cleanser for the last three weeks this winter. I notice my skin has cleared up a bit, but it was also dried. I had to add two moisturizing serum into my routine and use sleeping mask to stop my skin from flaking. And, for that matter, I deducted one star. This condition might not develop in the more humid weather though? I canâ€™t be sure until I get to try it in the summer... Good for problematic skin, but will dry skin out
