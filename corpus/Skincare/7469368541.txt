I’ve used tons of eye creams and things like this, but this one is top tier. It instantly brightens the under eye and it’s an amazing base for concealer. I am curious to see what it would look like when I’m more tan because it does have a peachy color to it. A little goes a long way, and makes a big difference! Great eye brightener!
