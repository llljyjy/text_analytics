Sephora ruined one of my staple products! I used to use these wipes every day but the new formula is just horrible. The wipes are now a scratchy, gauzy fabric that does not feel good on the skin. The wipes were also not saturated with enough liquid. They felt completely dry. On top of all that, they left a sticky residue on my face. Yuck! I went through the hassle of returning these, not for the sake of getting my $6 back, but to send a message to Sephora. PLEASE bring back the old formula. Ruined!
