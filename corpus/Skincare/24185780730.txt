This is a very interesting eye cream and the largest gripe I have about it (which isn’t a big one) is that I don’t consider it to be a “lightweight“ gel texture as described. When I think of a lightweight gel, I think of a water cream like texture that doesn’t have much occlusivity. This product carries far more weight to it and while its no where near as thick as Vaseline, it feels closer to that than the water cream texture I was envisioning (probably should have seen this coming given how high dimethicone is in the ingredients). I’d compare its texture to the Elemis eye mask. This is not necessarily a bad thing especially if you need a bit more protection for cold weather or like heavier eye creams, but I found it to be a bit heavier than what I prefer and can become a bit tacky if over applied.That one gripe aside, I think there are a lot of positives to this product. First although this is a thicker gel texture it melts right into the skin when using a small amount. It also, as described, does not appear to migrate into other areas once applied making it safer for people with sensitive eyes to apply to the area above the eye. I also like that the ingredients deck contains several active ingredients including niacinamide, peptides, caffeine and HA. While not as potent as something like retinol, these are actives I think most people will be able to tolerate well in the eye area that should improve appearance. One other note is that although Alcohol Denat is relatively high in the ingredients deck I did not find the product drying and with Glycerin/HA in the deck I doubt it will be much of an issue unless you’re particularly sensitive. There was also no noticeable sent. Nice Eye Cream With A Heavier Gel Texture
