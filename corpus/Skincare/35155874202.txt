I started using this vit c serum couple of weeks ago and noticed a significant difference and reduction in dullness. This is part of my morning and evening routine since i started. it is serum so it’s very light on the skin and not too thick or heavy. It has a great orange citrus fragrances that makes me feel clean. It also produces a bit of “glow”. I love this moisturizer and the whole vitamin C line!. well worth it! Fancy light vit C
