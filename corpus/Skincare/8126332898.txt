I use this product in my morning routine. However, the “lotion” is more of a watery substance. It resembles and smells very close to an aftershave according to my husband. He actually enjoys the scent and doesn’t mind using it himself. I love that this is ideal for all skin types since I have sensitive skin and it’s a combination of oily and dry depending on the time of year. I have noticed since using, my dehydrated appearance has looked flawless and more glowing like a sheer healthy shine. It appears and looks smoother too. My pores have diminished in size with continued use. I find that patting this into the skin works best with a cotton ball. Always shake before use! Some of the natural ingredients will settle to the bottom of the bottle. It is very soothing and doesn’t cause any irritation or redness. This product definitely has a gentle formula which I’m pleased with. It’s definitely a product I recommend to both men and women. You can use this in the am and pm but I only started using in the am to allow my skin to adjust to this new product. Overtime I will be adding it into my nightly routine as well. My skin feels so hydrated since I live in a warmer climate so taking care of my skin has always been of importance to me and I couldn’t do it alone without an amazing product like this one by Origins! The only con I have is the scent. Great benefits if you can get past the scent
