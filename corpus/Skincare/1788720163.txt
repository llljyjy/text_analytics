I have dry skin which I’ve been trying to remedy for years. I’ve tried a handful of hyaluronic serums, all of which have been sticky and unpleasant to use. This one is not sticky in the slightest, and absorbs instantly without leaving any tackiness behind. It has no detectable fragrance, is non irritating, comes in luxurious heavy glass packaging, and…bonus (?!) ACTUALLY WORKS! My skin has not looked this plump jn years. The lines on my forehead and between my brows are finally starting to soften. I was seriously considering injections, and I’m relieved that I may no longer need to do that. I received this product at no cost for my honest review. I about fell off my seat when I saw the price tag, but despite the crazy high cost, I will probably be repurchasing. At last! It works!!
