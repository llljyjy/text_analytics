This is the only luxury product in my skincare routine and is completely worth it. Keeps my skin hydrated all day without getting too oily. While it does have a scent, the scent was no longer noticeable after a week or so of use. Didnâ€™t cause any issues with my sensitive skin and the packaging is amazing! nan
