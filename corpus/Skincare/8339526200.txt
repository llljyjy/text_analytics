Really liking this so far! I have normal skin with a little bit of hyperpigmentation. I decided to use this at night because it’s thicker than my regular moisturizer and I already have a vitamin C serum I use in the morning. My skin still feels moisturized when I wake up after using this, and I’ve noticed my skin feeling softer and smoother since using this. Any hyperpigmentation I have has started to lighten. Would definitely repurchase! nan
