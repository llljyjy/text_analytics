WORTH IT. I have really oily skin and living in a humid state only makes it worse. I use dermatologist prescribed products but this is the only thing that has made my skin less oily and has cleared up my skin as well. I was worried it would completely dry out my skin but it keeps my skin moisturizer and gives a dewy glow. I use it during the day and use a regular moisturizer at night. 10/10!! YES. YES. YES!!
