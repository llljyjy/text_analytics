This product hydrated my face and made my upper cheeks hydrated so that the laugh lines around my eyes and upper cheeks less noticeable. Especially this fall season with our dry winds. There is a medium strength scent, but it fades after just a little while. I would recommend to family and friends. I would try to catch it on sale as it is expensive. Hydrating for Normal Skin
