Dare I say this may be the best lip balm I have ever used. I know, I know that is a very bold statement. But this product not only delivered on its claims, it exceeded!! The vanilla scent is absolutely beautiful, it’s not too overpowering, it’s sophisticated and playful and definitely does not smell like a cheap vanilla scent (you know what I’m talking about, we all remember The body shop vanilla lip butter in middle school I know I’m not the only one) This product instantly soothes my lips without feeling too heavy and it moisturizers and hydrates for hours and hours. This product has so much longevity that I don’t even need to apply it after a beverage or a meal, this really locks in the hydration for your lips. OK let’s talk about the applicator, because I’m obsessed. It’s so soft and it contour is to your lips allowing the product to glide so seamlessly. It doesn’t disperse too much product or too little it’s absolutely flawless. This product is now a staple in my bag, it’s a staple on my nightstand before I go to bed. I so if you’re looking for a beautiful lip butter or balm look now further because Summer Fridays nailed it and this is officially my favorite lip butter/balm. Holy grail lip balm
