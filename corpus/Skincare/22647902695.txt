I received this product to test for 12 weeks so I took photos & dedicated the next 3 months to see if it’d work to lighten sun damaged skin.  Every single day- twice a day w/o fail….often 3x a day, I used serum before rest of moisturizing routine.  It’s been about 4 months now and there is 0 difference in my before & after photos.  I’m very disappointed it hasn’t helped at all….therefore no need to include my 2 identical pictures. Sadly disappointed
