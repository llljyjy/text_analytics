One of my favorite moisturizers as it leaves the skin feeling soft and glowy. It’s super silky feeling on the skin, hydrating, and lightweight. Even though it’s light it leaves my skin fully moisturized overnight. The smell isn’t too strong either, definitely more scented than I like but still not too strong. Definitely recommend. Great for dry or mixed skin.
