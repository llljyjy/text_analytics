I really liked this product. It made my skin feel very soft and I woke up with a glow! It soaks right into the skin so when you wake up you don’t need to wash it off and it doesn’t get all over your pillow like some overnight treatments. I did break out when I started using it but my skin is very sensitive so I now only use it a few times a week. Overall I like this product! Great Product!
