I love this cream so much! It’s very dewy and hydrating and leaves your skin feeling amazing. It is a heavier cream but that is perfect for my mid/late 30s skin. One con is that it does leave your skin slightly tacky but in my opinion the benefits far outweigh this minor issue. A little goes a long way so as long as you use a pea sized amount it will dry down in a few minutes and the tackiness will be gone. I’ve been using this for about a month and I have also noticed a difference in my acne as well and this is the only new product I’ve been using. I hope they never stop selling this because I will use this forever!!! Thank you YTTP. My new holy grail!!
