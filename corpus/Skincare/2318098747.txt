Honestly, I don’t know how this product is so great. Leaves my skin feeling and looking so refreshed, hydrated, and dewey. I use this as a setting spray, and also as a base when I’m not wearing make up. Great to use as a face refresher during the day.Good size. I use it several times a day and don’t run through it (maybe one bottle per month).Brings my face make-up back to life. I own several bottles of this and will continue to buy several bottles!
