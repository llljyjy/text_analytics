I am a fan of clinique products. And that includes this new take the day off charcoal cleansing bomb makeup remover. It leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn’t leave behind an oily residue. It also doesn’t have an annoying clingy smell. I would definitely recommend it and will replenish my supply when this runs out. Top Notch Face Cleanser
