I received the pads with the serum to use together; definitely a bigger fan of the pads they have a lot of product for your face, neck, décolleté and even backs of hands.  They’re very strong and I can feel the tingle and my face feels clean after using, do just use a few times a week to avoid over drying.  My skin gets very dry in the winters of New England.  Would recommend! Effective
