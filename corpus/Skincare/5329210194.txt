Good for a bare face at the pool or on a hike, I would not suggest spraying this over makeup. The nozzle is so uneven and you’ll end up with large droplets on parts of your face. It seems to spray in more of a misting line across your face rather than a fine all over mist. For those who have gotten it to work for them I commend you and I genuinely wish I were one of you. I’ll continue to use this under makeup because I like a more hydrating base but I’m perplexed why this is advertised as something you could spray over makeup. not makeup friendly
