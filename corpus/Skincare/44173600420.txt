I have recently been introduced to Innisfree and the couple of products that I have tried, I fell in love with it and after receiving this full size #freeproduct from #topbox, I believe I have found a new favorite which will definitely be added to my skincare collection. I have dry skin and as winter approaches my skin will need that extra hydration and this came at the right time. This was used for the past 2 weeks with continued use and I have seen visible results. My face surely looked extra fresh, hydrated, moisturized and felt very soft and smooth. This was used at both AM and PM and I love the subtle scent of this cream. It has a gel-like texture that easily spreads on the face and definitely absorbs quickly. Will continue to use it for the winter time to see if there is further improvement to my skin but so far, it is a great addition and I am most certain that I may buy this again when it finishes.
