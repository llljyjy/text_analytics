This moisturizer is for those who truly want the best. Compared to others it has a richer texture and leaves your skin feeling perfectly hydrated. The winter can be tough on my skin and this helped keep my moisture levels even and prevented my skin from getting red and chapped. It has a pleasant scent and the texture is thick and luxurious.
