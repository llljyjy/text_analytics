I love face masks, and this one was no exception. This one is really unique because it combines the oil removing effectiveness of a traditional clay mask that you apply with a tool with the convenience and mess free application of a sheet mask. The fact that it comes as a two piece, top and bottom, also really helps make putting it on a breeze. After using it, my skin felt so clean and completely oil free. It made looking like I smeared mint ice cream all over my face worth it! Easy & Effective
