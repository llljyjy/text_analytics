This cleanser smelled absolutely amazing without breaking me out, and it was so fun to use. The packaging was pretty and crisp. The cleanser foamed really well and just felt super soft on my face. My skin felt squeaky clean after using it. Iâ€™m not sure how great it would be for someone with really dry skin because it did feel a little drying, but as someone with oily skin, it was perfect. Amazing Scent, Super Cleansing
