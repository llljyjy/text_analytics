This product is STRONG. I have combo skin and I get chin acne and also blackheads on my nose and very noticeable. I tend to have normal cheeks and this product sucked the life out of my cheeks. I used this product twice and I have 2 big dry patches on both my cheeks and my cheeks are bright red. I have never had dry skin UNTIL now. I may implement a couple of these in the kit on my routine but all together is too much for my skin. donâ€™t use unless you are SUPER oily
