Worst sunscreen I have ever tried.  The smell was very intense and atrocious.  The consistency is extremely oily.  It has the look of spray butter when it comes out of pump; thatâ€™s even after shaking it for 2 minutes prior to pumping it.  Not to mention just after one use it broke out my skin terribly. Absolutely Not!!
