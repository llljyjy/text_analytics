I recently received a complimentary sample from influenster for my honest review. I received a full size sample which really is whatâ€™s needed for a good review of the product any skin care you should atleast use for 30 days to work it into your routine to allow it time to start working. I immediately notices lighter blemishes and noticeably softer skin. I used it a full 30 days before I reviewed and it is a must have I used it with the Augustin bader cream and the cleanser and they really are wonderful and worth the money.  Pricey is my only not like but if you can afford this skin care routine you will get results. Love love love
