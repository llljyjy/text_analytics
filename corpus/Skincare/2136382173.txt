It smells heavy like BUG SPRAY or Citronella…two things I don’t want on my face or in my nose. It doesn’t smell like a Ginseng candy or anything sour it’s earthy and just as bitter—if not…worse than bug sprays. I put it on my sunburn instead and it was kinda soothing so I guess it deserves that one star. I would not purchase this. Bugaboo
