I was very surprised by how lightweight and airy this facial cream is. It does an excellent job of keeping my skin hydrated. It spreads on evenly and is quickly absorbed. I can wear it under my make up while locking moisture in throughout the day. After using this for  the last week I have noticed improvement with much smoother skin. This is exactly what I have been looking for in a facial cream to keep my skin looking its best. Kiehl's is Ultra Hydrating
