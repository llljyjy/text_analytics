I got this product because I recently got prescribed topical treatments from my dermatologist which dried my skin out really bad. This product didn’t help my dry skin at all and didn’t sink into the skin, it sat on top of my skin and left me looking and feeling greasy. It also worked terribly underneath makeup. It’s a no for my skin. Not good for my super dry skin
