I have been using self tanner for at least 15 years and consider myself to be pretty good at application (applied with a mitt) so I was very disappointed when this expensive mousse came out splotchy. It seems like the areas that I moisturized to keep less tan are the darkest parts not to mention the actual tan itself is barely visible. With all of the reviews/pictures I was worried about getting too dark but that was not even a possibility. (I kept it in 3+ hours) Will be returning :( Splotchy and barely tan
