I love this product, I tried the free sample an did not know it was something I needed. I have extremally textures skin, a lot of hidden white heads, and dark spots. I’ll say I most definitely seen a difference in my skin’s texture and tone. The only issue I had what that it has a more oil based texture and I would have to skip some days of use so that my skin is not oily. I would most definitely recommend and it does last a while. A great product
