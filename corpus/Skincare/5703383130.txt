The best thing about this serum is the brightening effect it has on my skin so Iâ€™ve found that I get the most out of the product by using it on no make up days for an extra glow or as a primer. My tip is to make sure it dries first before applying any product on top of it. I have sensitive acne prone skin and the vitamin C in this product has not caused any irritation. nan
