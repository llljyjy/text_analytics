I LOVE mud masks and this one didn’t disappoint. I will say that it was a tiny bit too big for my face and it was a little hard to separate the mask from the protective plastic but i loved how it felt on. And it washed off pretty easy. I’ve used a lot of mud masks that are difficult to wash off. I’d use it again. nan
