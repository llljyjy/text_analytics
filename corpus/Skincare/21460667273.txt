I’m really not sure how well this works, I could get past washing my hands with it - my first test for any face wash I buy. if I can’t stand it on my hands, it doesn’t go on my face. this did not pass the test. the sent in this is “soap“ but yelled through a megaphone - and it lingers. for hours. I couldn’t get my hands near my face without my eyes watering, and after 4 hours, had to wash my hands with something else just to try to dampen the effect. even doing a double cleanse didn’t remove the smell entirely. wish I could tell you more about the product, but I couldn’t get that far why would you put this much perfume in a cleanser?
