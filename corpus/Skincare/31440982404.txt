Wanted to love this product but I didn’t. I didn’t see any difference after using this product for 2 weeks. My skin is slightly oily. This product made my face feel extra oily, and it didn’t absorb into my face well. It seemed to take forever, especially in the A.M when I needed to apply makeup shortly after. Wasn’t a huge fan of the scent either. I also had trouble getting all 3 serums to come out at the same time, one was always lagging.Just wasn’t the product for me, especially with the $ tag. Felt it should’ve been better. Product wasn't for me
