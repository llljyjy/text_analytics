I really like this moisturizer. It goes on thick and creamy but absorbs well and helps make my skin feel moisturized. I do live in a dry climate so if you live in a humid area, it might be a better for a cooler season, but I could see using it year round where I live. It has a very light and pleasant scent (that doesn’t linger or over power) and feels like a quality product. My skin feels soft and less dry afterwards. For the price, I think it’s a good value because of the quality  and moisturizer usually goes a long way. I also like that it is in a container that I can get every last drop out of. Sometimes moisturizers that come in a pump or tube- it feels like there is some waste. I definitely recommend it! Thick and Creamy
