Pros: This product is very hydrating, the consistency is very gel like and it does help with my dark circles, the smell is also a plus!Cons: Unfortunately it made me break out near my application area every single time, since nothing else changed on my skin routine or daily life, I am pretty sure it was due to this cream, which is unfortunate, so I would definitely not recommend it to acne prone skin. Not for acne prone skin
