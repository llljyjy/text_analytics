This is a nice moisturizing cream. It delivered mild results for me and I feel I definitely got better results at night. I have been looking for a less expensive under eye treatment for fine lines etc. this has been nice but not sure it compares to some of the other retinol infused products I have used. I love itâ€™s texture and a little goes a long way but results for me were pretty mild. Good for Hydration Ok for Fine line correction
