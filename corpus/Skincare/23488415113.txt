I can confidently say this combo is the best self tanner routine I have tried. The brush blends the hands and feet sooooo well. Literally no patches anywhere no streaks. Their glove is super soft too and the thumb hole makes it so much easier to apply. I use the water everywhere and the foam on my legs and a little leftover on my arms. Such a nice dark color. The water is good when you want to touch up areas and stuff ughhh I love it. And any tanner I use accumulates on my dry patches always and this one exfoliates off of those patches easy thank god.
