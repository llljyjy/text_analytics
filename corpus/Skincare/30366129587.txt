I used to LOVE this. I’ve been using it for 2.5 years and never had a problem, back when it was in the tub. Now the packaging changed, the product has as well. It smells like MILDEW!  I ordered two and they both smell like laundry after sitting in the washing machine for a week! The packaging was dirty. And I don’t mean like ink or anything from manufacturing. It had clearly visible fingerprints of what looked like some kind of syrup! So GROSS!! Smells like mildew!!!
