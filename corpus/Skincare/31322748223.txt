Used this years ago when I had severe scarring from hormonal acne. Totally forgot about it until recently when I had an unusual breakout, subsequent scarring, and some general unevenness in tone across my face. Using it once daily, at night for the last week - Iâ€™ve already seen some improvements. Saved my skin more than once
