The DAMDAM Mochi Mochi Luminous Plumping Moisturizer is a new favorite of mine.  It is deeply moisturizing for my dry skin.  It comes with a little applicator, which is a cute touch.  I grab a little from the container and run it into my face.  It leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated without looking oily.  It absorbed really nicely and wore great under my makeup.  It doesnâ€™t have a scent and did not irritate my skin.  Definitely recommend this for those who have dry skin. deeply moisturizing
