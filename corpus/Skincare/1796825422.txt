If I have to describe this product in one word it is Silk! It is forsure the right word for this moisturizing cream. The smell is not so strong which makes my heart so happy. You don’t need a lot, it spreads very well. My skin feels so incredible after. I use it twice a day, once in the morning & once at night. I’ve been using it a lot on my neck, it’s never been so soft! Great for your Morning (or Night) Skincare Routine
