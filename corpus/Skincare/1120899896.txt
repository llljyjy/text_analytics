Not goodâ€¦ I had high hopes but the pilling is unreal.  I tried with moisturizer underneath and twice on bare skin and it just pilled like crazy.  Shame bc I like the skincare included and was looking for a way to simplify my routine.  Gives a nice dewy glow but with bits of product all over my face.  Sadly I had to return it. Pills like crazy
