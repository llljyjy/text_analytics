The smell of this mask is very relaxing. It came with a  small applicator to apply.  Dries down slightly on the skin.  We need to remove it in 3-5 minutes. If you are looking for a quick skin treatment to refresh your skin, I would recommend this.  Skin does feel healthy after using this. Its price is little on higher side not sure yet if I will buy this after using completely. I would also like to mention I got this complimentary from Tatcha. Nice but pricey mask
