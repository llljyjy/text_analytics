Intense moisturizer - not anti-aging for me! Great as a nighttime moisturizer bc it’s thick and doesn’t settle into your skin too quickly. It did even out my skin tone. I didn’t see a reduction in fine lines/wrinkles. Hydration was excellent. You could use it before makeup application but give yourself plenty of time for it to settle. moisturizing-not anti-aging
