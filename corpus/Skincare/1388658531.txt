I didn’t love the way this product mixes. I had a lot of trouble getting the powder to mix into the liquid evenly. A lot of it also got stuck in the pouch. But once it was mixed it was really easy to dispense. I love how easy it spreads on my skin and it absorbs really quickly. It didn’t irritate my skin. Not sure I saw a ton of difference in my skin but I have only used it for about a week so maybe with more time. nan
