I received this product to review and I must say it does what it says it will do . I’ve used it for three weeks before giving a review and I must say my pores are a lot smaller and it serves as the perfect base for my makeup . In terms of smell ,it doesn’t have one in my opinion. Overall a good product and I’ve now permanently added to my skincare routine and most importantly my make up routine. great product
