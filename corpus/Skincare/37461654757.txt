Received #freeproduct from#trywithtopbox to try and review. The sample was a 1ml amount of product so not enough to truly see a different. The serum did not leave my skin dry but I did  like the texture and it absorbed very smooth and quickly. Would really like to be able to try a full size product and give a honest review later!
