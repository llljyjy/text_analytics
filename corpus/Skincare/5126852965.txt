I wish this product worked for me. I love all the listed ingredients, but somehow the major issue for me is that it doesn’t absorb well into my skin. Rather, it sits on top of the skin for a long time before it gets absorbed. I’ve tried applying under various conditions - before toner/ damp skin/ dry skin, but it was all the same and it still sits on top of my skin. I think it’s moisturizing but could be better formulated for its application. I’ve used this for three months now from mild to very hot weather and it feels all the same. good but not yet there
