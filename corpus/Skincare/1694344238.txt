Ok first thing, I was so excited about trying this product! I’ve heard great things about the oil and my skin has been so dry during the winter season.  I wasn’t the biggest fan of the scent. It was a little too strong for me but I absolutely loved the results. My skin felt radiant and I have some uneven skin tone that I was hoping this would help with! So far so good. I don’t know if I’ll pick up again (i wish the scent was just a tad but fainter) but I’m hoping this will grow on me. If you don’t mind scents, I would check this out! nan
