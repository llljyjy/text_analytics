I bought mine from original website before Sephora and it’s AMAZEBALLS, it’s great to be able to use any type of water because let’s be honest buying filter water or distilled water is annoying and a waste of money imo , I love the white noise effect I thought it would be annoying and on the lowest setting you can’t tell it’s even on if white noise isn’t your thing12/10 recommend for healthy skin ✨✨✨✨ nan
