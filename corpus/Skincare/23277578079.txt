I have been using this product forever! It is a staple in my night time routine! It makes taking make up off so easy! I feel like it saves your lashes from being scrubbed. The product just melts your mascara and it washes away with water. I always follow up with a cleanser, but that’s my preference! I also don’t find it takes much, so it lasts a long time! I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to products, however this is worth every penny! nan
