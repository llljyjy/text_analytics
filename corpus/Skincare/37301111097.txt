Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty to me was this serum and as my first facial serum I think it went okay. I didn’t have any amazing results from this but as you can see from the pictures of my skin before and after from over a week of use my skin appeared less red, more even with tone and looks as much as it feels hydrating. However the product itself squirted out harsly out of the bottle, it made my skin a little more sensitive and even if it did slightly help it didn’t change my skin positively enough for me to buy again. could be better
