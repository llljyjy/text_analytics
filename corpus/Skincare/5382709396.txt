I was giving this product by tula and Influenster. I tried it every night for about 3 weeks, and I did see results. My skin is truly firmer and I could even say more radiant. The only down side is the smell. I like a scented moisturizer, but this one has a odd smell. Overall would recommend Good for firmness
