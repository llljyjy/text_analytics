I got this as a sample so I can’t speak to its long-term effectiveness.  In the short few weeks that I’ve used it, I haven’t seen a difference in my dark circles or fine lines.  I will however say this has the BEST texture out of all the eye creams I’ve tried.  It’s so so silky.  Price point is a bit steep, but you get what you pay for with this brand.  Estee Lauder has a good reputation and a great track record of quality products. Definitely nicer than most
