I really like this eye cream, from the luxurious packaging, to the application, how it easily blends into the skin. It is so light and feels so nice when applied. It has retinol but did not irritate my skin at all. My puffy eyes seem to appear less puffy even after a long day of work and biking around the city! I highly recommend and love that you can purchase the refill for it and not have to purchase the entire package again. Itâ€™s only been a couple of months but I will keep using it to see the long term results! nan
