I tried it at night the first time and noticed just as its name is a very light cream.  For nights, I prefer to use a richer and thicker moisturizer. Augustinus Bader The Light Cream is the perfect moisturizer to use under makeup. It dries quickly and is matte. It doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling and does not affect the foundation application. Is the Best moisturizer I had ever used for under makeup...excellent! Perfect under makeup
