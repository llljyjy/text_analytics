I’ve tried many primers, but this is by far the best I’ve used. It glides on easily, evenly, and never pills. I have combination skin with enlarged pores, and this primer really makes my skin feel comfortable. Even after 14 hrs of makeup, my pores and skin don’t feel uncomfortable and my pores don’t get clogged up. And of course my make up stays and looks great the whole time. Best primer ever
