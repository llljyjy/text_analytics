I use the Augustus Bader Rich Cream and I love it so I was SO excited to try this cream. It’s actually very lightweight and makes my skin look flawless and plump. I typically have combo/dry skin and it feels great on my dry areas but sometimes feels a little oily around the normal areas. I do really enjoy using it though. My only qualm would be the bottle - the bottom is round so I always have to lay it down or stand it upside down which gets my OCD going.. I can’t stand knowing that it should be right side up. Otherwise, it’s a great cream with many benefits! love the product, not the bottle
