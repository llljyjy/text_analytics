I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser it’s so good!! I’ve tried a ton of cleansers and this one is one of my new favorites. I love how foamy it gets, I have acne prone oily skin and my skin loves this! Don’t be alarmed it says exfoliating it’s very gentle not physical exfoliatants So good and affordable
