Beautiful serum. I love the scent and texture of it. Wasn’t too thick or too watery. My skin felt really hydrated and nourished in the morning. I usually have a night time routine but I decided to use this serum by itself so I can see it’s full effect. On the short amount of time I used it, I noticed my skin looking more bright and even. Would definitely purchase! Spring Glow
