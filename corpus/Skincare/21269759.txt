I received a complimentary full-size 30ml bottle of the Augustinus Bader The Light Cream from Influenster. As a woman with rosacea, I was thrilled to receive this! Over the past few weeks, I have noticed the redness on my face & chest subside as well as my dark spots fade and acne scars heal. The downside is the slight medicinal smell, but I think the benefits outweigh that detail. I did not really notice a lot of mattifying, but my makeup did last longer during the day. Lovely
