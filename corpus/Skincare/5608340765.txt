This is a strange product as it is a 3 step process unlike other cleansing balms which is just applying the balm then rinsing. This product requires that you apply it, then water to create the milkyness then rinse. While it does remove most of the makeup it’s not anymore than other balms I have tried (Farmacy, Clinique, Heimish, Wishful). I don’t believe I will be purchasing this again. Also as I saw mentioned in a previous review, it does not come with a small spoon or spatula. The balm is fairly stiff so it is difficult to scoop out and does crumble and make a mess if you’re not paying close attention. nan
