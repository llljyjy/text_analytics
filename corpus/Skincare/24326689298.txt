I have combination skin with some uneven tones and redness here and there. When I used this product the first thing I noticed was the scent. I’m not always fond of scented products but I don’t mind it. The scent was fruity/acidic so I was curious how my skin would react. After cleansing my face, I applied this and I felt a slight tingle maybe a little bit of a sting which is probably normal since this is an acid. I did however felt very moisturized and hydrated. I wouldn’t say it reduced fine lines but I will say my face looked more firm and smoother.  My least favorite part was still the scent and the sensation it gave my face. I’m gonna keep trying it but i don’t know if I can handle the scent. nan
