Shiseido products are without exception packages beautifully and have elegant formulations. This serum layers nicely under moisturizer and makeup with minimal pillling. I am interested to see how continuing to use reishii on my skin will impact long term. However in the short term (1 month) Iâ€™ve been using my skin is looking good with no breakouts. One concern is the alcohol listed as the second ingredient that can be drying or ageing for some skins. I was offered this in exchange for an honest review. nan
