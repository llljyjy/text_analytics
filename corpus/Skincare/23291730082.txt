It CONFIDENCE IN A CREAM is the best moisturizer I’ve used so far. I can tell already that my skin fells so much more hydrated and smooth. It also pumps it up a tad..Before using this cream,my face was so dry and dull. So I will continue to use this moisturizer. IT doesn’t really have a smell to it which is ok with me. The cream is thick so it doesn’t take very much of it to cover my face. I have a glow now that I didn’t have Before using this cream. I actually love it and I recommend it to ppl that need hydrated plumped skin.Im a woman of a certain age so alot has changed for me since I  was younger.  I’M happy to have this cream.It also has so many other benefits to it because of what it’s made with...No harsh chemicals which is a plus for me. I'm Glowing
