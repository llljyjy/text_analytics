I started using this serum a few weeks ago and have already noticed a difference in my skin.  Fine lines are not as noticeable and my skin looks more even and smoother.  This serum goes on easily and absorbs into your skin but is not greasy.  After applying it my skin feels tighter and smoother but doesn’t dry it out like other retinols.  There was no tingling or irritation from the retinol and I used it every night. My skin has improved so much that I have been using less foundation to cover the flaws.  I definitely recommend this serum and can’t wait to see what my skin looks like after continued use. nan
