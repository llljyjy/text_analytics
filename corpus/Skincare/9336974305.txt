The Strawberry Smooth BHA+AHA Serum is truly one of my current favorite serums due to how effectively exfoliating it’s ingredients are in evening out my skin tone as well as how gentle the formulation texture is. I haven’t had a bad breakout since the use of the product and see a direct improvement in my giant pores. It has a gel-like consistency that spreads evenly throughout my skin with one pump being enough. It has a subtle smell of strawberry that quickly disperses in case you are fragrance sensitive. Personally I have not experienced any irritation as a result from application and it plays well with other products in my routine. Great Formulation, Experience, & Results
