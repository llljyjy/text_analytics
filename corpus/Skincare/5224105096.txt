I’ve been using this daily in the AM for a few weeks and love how it makes my skin feel while also not breaking me out (my skin is sensitive, dry and acne-prone). This serum is light and absorbs quickly. There’s no strong scent which I appreciate, and the texture is smooth and spreads with ease. I knocked of one star because I haven’t noticed any brightening or anti-aging effects, so I can’t speak to long-term results. nan
