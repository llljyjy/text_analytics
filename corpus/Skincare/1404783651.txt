This is a very solid eye cream! I received this eye cream for review from Influenster. I used to use the previous version of this but it was heavily scented, so it made my eyes burn. I’m happy to report that I’ve been using this for five days, and it’s been great! I don’t think it has a scent at all, and it’s super moisturizing (I use Retinol daily, so my face is very dry, and I need something thick to protect my delicate eye area). It plays very well with makeup and I don’t find my concealer creases, and products apply smoothly over it. It also does not pill at all when in contact with other products. I can’t speak to whether or not it improves my dark circles, it’s only been a week, but I have very dark circles hereditarily, so I don’t expect it to fix that. In any case, I definitely recommend this product to anyone! Much better than the OG
