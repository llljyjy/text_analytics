A bit torn on this. I received it (& the oil free version to compare) complimentary in exchange for my honest review, and so I’ll review it as if I’d paid full price for it. Not sure why this is coming up under “mineral sunscreen” tag as it seems to be an organic/chemical filter. There is a sunscreen smell to this, but it’s less strong than the oil-free one. On both of them, it doesn’t bother me. I have very fair normal, sensitive skin and can easily break out but neither broke me out at all. The small size of this is nice to toss in a small bag to be able to reapply and I like the packaging. I get paranoid about my chest in the sun and this isn’t greasy at all so it’s perfect for having just in case. That being said, this is pretty spendy for the amount you get.I use a moisturizer under this too, so can’t speak to how truly moisturizing it is. I should probably try it without because this doesn’t perform the best under makeup and maybe not using another lotion would help.This leaves a shine, but (if you don’t add makeup over) it diminishes over time. With the oil free I feel the shininess increases over time on my face. It seems this one works better under makeup, if you let it fully soak in for awhile. With most foundations I’ve tried over it Ive realized I need to set with powder (which I don’t love doing in summer) or use a setting spray over, which works pretty nicely.All in all, I like this but do think there are just as nice or nicer face sunscreens at a lower price point. I would try another option before repurchasing this. Like, not love.
