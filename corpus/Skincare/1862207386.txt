can’t fully attest to results yet but beware that it’s pretty spicy (esp if you tend to have dry skin and live in a dry climate)! be smarter than me and work up to routine usage. I went straight to daily use as soon as I got it bc ive used another retinoid for years, and now a week later I am peelingggg. but excited to try again (and ramp up slowly) once the peeling stops, since now I know just how effective it is!also just fyi “purging“ (acne) is a normal response to retinoids and you have to get passed that stage (I believe ~1 month but could be mistaken) to start seeing results Spicy
