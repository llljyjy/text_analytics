This has to be the best Azelaic acid product on the market, I have minimal to little hyperpigmentation and post acne marks from picking and with this, my face has changed, now I have glowy/clear skin (a great tip pair this cleanser with a glycolic acid toner I like the brand olehenriksen one and top it off with a moisturizer at night, try to use my gentler products in the morning, I only use this combo at night 2x a week) BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET
