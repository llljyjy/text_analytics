This serum is super hydrating. It feels like water going on your skin. Itâ€™s not sticky at all and dries very quickly. I use it morning and night with the superfood cleanser and superfood moisturizer. It has worked wonders for improving the texture of my skin and keeping it hydrated in the winter! Super hydrating
