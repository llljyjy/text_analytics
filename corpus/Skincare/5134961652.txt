This is an incentivized post. I received the LancômeRènergie H.C.F. Triple Serum complimentary from Lancômeand Influenster in exchange for my honest review.About the Serum:This serum is marketed as a high-performance anti-agingconcentrate that improves skin quality, and reduceswrinkles, and lessens dark spots. It contains hyaluronicacid, vitamin c + niacinamide, and ferulic acid (this is wherethe H.C.F. comes in, in the name). The full sized product is50ml.Each of the three formulas are kept in separate chambersuntil you pump them out, which means that they don’t mixuntil you are ready to apply it to your face. The Ferulic Acidis clear. The vitamin c + Niacinimide is a creamy ecru color, and the hyaluronic acid is white. It felt smooth on my face and did not irritate my skin at all.When I woke up the next morning, my skin did appearmore plump, smooth, and hydrated. And it was sooo soft.My experience and thoughts:I have been using this serum once in the morning and once at night, as the directions advise, for three weeks Each time I apply it, I use one full pump, rub gently tomix, and then I apply to my face. Overall, my skin looks wonderful. Its so smooth, and I really like the results I am seeing on my forehead. I have been dealing with a deepening one in between my eyebrows, butthis has improved it so much! I plan to continue using andrepurchasing this serum. It’s completely worth the pricetag! Must Have Product in My Morning and Night Routine!
