I’ve been using it for a month now and like it although it’s too soon for a detailed review. I use it once daily at night. I’m 44 with combination Asian skin that has no major problems except those related to aging. This one is less drying than most exfoliating toners I’ve used which includes the Skinceucitcals Glycolic, Glossier and Obagi. In fact, the Ordinary leaves my skin slightly silky (if you know what I mean). I’m kind of hesitant to use it on very humid days when my skin is extra oily. On the other hand, this is a lot of toner for $10, does the job just as well as the other ones I’ve used and has caused no side effects even on first use. I’ll definitely repurchase once this bottle is done. Works on aging/combination skin
