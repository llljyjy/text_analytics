At first I was not expecting the product to be similar to an essence - practically liquid but using clean fingers I have been patting it into my face and itâ€™s definirley helping with dryness I have experienced from more traveling lately. It absorbs quickly and is very refreshing. I would keep this in my morning routine for increased moisture Great essence type lotion!
