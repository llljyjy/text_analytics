Love this serum. I’ve got anxiety so I pick at my skin a lot, this stuff has drastically reduced my breakouts and scarring. It does have an odor but once you apply and rub in the serum the smell goes away. I follow with a good intense moisturizer as the product warns it can dry your skin and haven’t had any issues with dry spots. I have super sensitive skin and this stuff doesn’t cause any issues Great for acne scars
