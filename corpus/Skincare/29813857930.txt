#freeproduct I received The Rich Cream. I like the scent of this moisturizer. It is like a perfume and soap mixed together. The texture is so creamy but it doesn’t make my skin greasy, feel heavy or sticky. My skin is not sensitive so I didn’t get any breakouts or got dependent on the moisturizer. The thing I don’t like about it is the hyaluronic acid. This ingredient is not good for the skin in the long run. So I cannot use it for a while because it makes my skin dry. Wish I could change this ingredient, it is everywhere. And it is not that hydrating or moisturizing like it is shown in the skincare market. Definitely a rich cream!!!
