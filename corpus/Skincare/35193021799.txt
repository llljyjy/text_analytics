Recieved as a sample and love it. HOWEVER I only use it as a highlighter for days without any makeup. I use the smallest amount after glo recipe plum plump moisturizer  on my cheek bones and around eyes and whatever other areas I want highlighted at that time. This is what I would suggest this for. It is very luminescent, and noticing this right away I knew I would not use this all over my face. Also, if you go to huda beautyâ€™s site, under auto ship the most common time frame is shipping this exact product every 12 months. Now, not sure if it is because of the price but if the company only expects the user to repurchase once a year then just a smidgen of this product can go a long way. This sample will last a month with the way I have been using it. Unless you have ultra dry skin I would not recommend for an all over face moisturizer because of the shine, but this product is very light weight. I did not notice any crazy smell of strong lavender but who knows how good my smell is anyways. I should also mention that as a kid I had terribly sensitive skin, like one of those kids who could not touch anything involving cheap metal, animals, perfumes...etc. I am not sure how skin changes over the years except for getting worse, but this did not and still had not irritated my skin. Just highlight with it
