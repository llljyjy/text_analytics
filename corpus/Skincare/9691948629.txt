While the sunscreen is beautiful, the packaging is horrible!! The bottle flakes and, like many other reviews have reflected, the flakes end up getting on your hands and, therefore, on your face on application. This is simply not ok, especially for a $60 sunscreen. Iâ€™m stuck with it, as I purchased using a Rouge reward. Horrible packaging that flakes!
