After 3 weeks of using this product I’ve learned some things. 1. It’s a great moisturizer! It’s thick but not sticky and has a light pleasant scent. And 2. It did absolutely nothing for my skin other than a normal moisturizer.  I am getting older and noticing small fine lines and was really hoping this would be THE product. I won’t be buying in the future however maybe with long continuous use one would notice a difference. nan
