I’m 25 and am starting to get crows feet along my eyes (I don’t like to wear sunglasses so I squint a lot!). I had been wondering about this product for a while and bought it for my birthday. First, the packaging is really cute but most importantly, makes application so easy and more hygienic. No dipping your fingers in a pot and spreading jazz. Over night there is a clear difference. A lot of the faint lines are gone and the skin looks more plump! Do follow the how to use instructions because you have the warm the product up a bit first or it’s a bit stiff to apply! Great!
