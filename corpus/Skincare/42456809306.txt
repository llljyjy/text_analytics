I received a full-size sample as a #freeproduct from Topbox and have been using it for the past 4 weeks. This cream feels really nice when applied to the skin. I love the gel-like texture, and the smell does not bother me, even though it is a bit strong. It gets absorbed into the skin quickly, and the scent does not linger. My skin feels hydrated and firmer. Great product for my 40 skin. Highly recommend
