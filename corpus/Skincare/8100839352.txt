I received this product for free to try through Influenster. I was so excited to get to try a Drunken Elephant product! The Drunken Elephant Bouncy Brightfacial works so well! The price is high around $70, but the results were worth it! First of all it comes in the cutest packaging. It has a lotion-like consistency and disappears right into the skin. It’s not greasy or heavy. For about 15 minutes after applying it does have a slight tingle to it, but it’s not bothersome. It made my skin feel powder soft and this morning when I woke up my skin actually looked brighter and clearer. Definitely recommend! Love this!
