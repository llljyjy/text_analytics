I have had this since July and started noticing the color and smell changing in August. Now in early October, it is light brown and smells like old play dough. There is alot of nice skincare out there that doesnâ€™t go bad in such a short amount of time for such a hefty price. buyer beware. rots in the bottle in the first 3 months
