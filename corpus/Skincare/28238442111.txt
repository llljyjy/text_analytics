This eye cream has a nice, pillowy yet light texture. It absorbs easily upon application and just a little tap with your fingertips is all you need to feel it moisturize the undereyes. The smell is very subtle to none and I also love that a little goes a long way with this cream. The sample bottle was quite small but I am curious about the long term results so I will purchase the full size when I use up the sample.Upon using consistently for a week, I also noticed that my eye bags brightened a bit and I alo looked more well rested and awake. Will continue using this cream and see how it goes. Easily absorbed and results after consistent use
