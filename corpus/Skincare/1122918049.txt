I was sent some delux samples to try. I really like this cleanser. It is perfect for the dry cold winter climate I live in. It’s not irritating or drying but I do feel like it’s getting my skin clean. I’m a big fan of glow recipe products, but I don’t regularly use their other cleansers, but I actually think this one will be in regular rotation for me. At least in winter! My one complaint (but bonus for some people) is the scent. I would call this unscented. I don’t really smell the fresh aloe scent. I miss the fruity scents. But if you generally shy away of some GR products due to scent, I say go for this one! I think if it was a nice scent, I’d give 5 stars. Lovely gentle cleanser
