I received this Tula eye balm for free from Influenster and I like it, it’s like a highlighter that is very shinny and has a cooling effect for tired under eyes and you can feel the caffeine tingling effect for a few minutes after application. I use it everyday and it’s quite nice but Im not sure I would pay full price for it as it seems pretty expensive for just a balm with glitter in it. Thanks for the opportunity! I like it
