I have combination skin but it definitely is dryer between seasons. This went on well, made my skin feel hydrated. I like gel moisturizers and this is a gel like cream so I liked that. It made my skin feel a bit tight, the only thing I wish it did that it didnâ€™t do is make my skin feel plumper. A little goes a long way which is appreciated! This is a great option for the summertime! nan
