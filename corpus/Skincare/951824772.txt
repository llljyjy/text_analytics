Happy with this purchase. Noticed improvement in the smoothness to my skin after one use. My skin feels soft and I’m able to use as directed even under makeup and my skin on the oily side. Can’t wait for it to continue decongesting and smoothing my skin. It’s a more moisturizing formulation since the salicylic acid is drying. Happy With My Purchase
