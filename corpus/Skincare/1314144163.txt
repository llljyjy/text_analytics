I have really started to enjoy this product. It is not as hydrating as I thought it would be, I find my skin absorbs it quite quickly; but it does a good job at making my skin quite smooth and glowy. The vitamin C, yuzu, and turmeric are all beneficial for my skin and it does have a nice light fresh smell to it. I have been using it day and night to get the most benefit. I would recommend and buy again! nan
