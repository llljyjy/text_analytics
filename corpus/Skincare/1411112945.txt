I recently received this #freeproduct to try out. The serum wasn’t watery and easy to apply. I love the feeling of it on my skin. I paired it at night with the under eye cream and my under eyes felt hydrated, a goal now being in my 40s. The product sting my under eyes  which a lot of products do these days. However I’m not sure that I would purchase it as I can’t speak to the benefits after only a couple of applications from the sample. Felt nice when paired with cream
