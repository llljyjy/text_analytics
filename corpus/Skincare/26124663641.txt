It’s a weird texture but it’s amazing!! I love that it dries and doesn’t get all over your pillow. It locks in all your serums and anti-aging products over night, and you can definitely tell.. In the morning I’m left with moisturized skin that isn’t greasy. I love this product! It’s weird, but it’s cool.
