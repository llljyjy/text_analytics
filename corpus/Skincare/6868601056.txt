I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and unfortunately I haven’t seen many results. I have a few dark spots on my face that I absolutely hate and I’m very self-conscious about them especially with only being 42 years old. I use this product as directed well unfortunately I don’t see them fading. I do like the way the product feels on the skin and a little goes a long way. I was super excited to try this for free and I’m really happy I did not spend the $60 on it with no results thus far. I will continue to use and see if I have any results. Still working?
