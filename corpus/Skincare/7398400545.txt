I got this as a sample for my honest feedback from influenster. All in all, it’s a good serum. It keeps my skin feeling smooth and full. I found that it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave skin greasy, but also it isn’t as hydrating as I had hoped. After about two weeks of daily use, I haven’t noticed much change in my skin, although I haven’t seen any negative changes that usually happen when I switch a serum or skincare product. I have combination skin and struggle with dullness and hydration in certain areas. This product works well with makeup and plays well with other moisturizers and serums. Keeps your skin supple and smooth
