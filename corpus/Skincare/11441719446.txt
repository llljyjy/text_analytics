Good product for dull and dehydrated skin. The texture is more like a thin cream rather than a serum so it feels moisturizing to the skin as a first step of skincare routine. The ingredients are clean and high quality including Glycerin and probiotics that hydrate and support skin cells. It helped my skin look more radiant and feel more moisturized. However it does contain fragrance which wish it did not have. Overall a good serum if you are looking for a new one. Hydrating and illuminating
