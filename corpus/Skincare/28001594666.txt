Loved using Skinfix in the past and I am really excited about this serum! It has a super thick texture that Iâ€™ve never seen in a serum before, it almost feels like a light moisturizer. It gave me a little bit of irritation and redness along my acne scars but that went away pretty quickly. I love how it plumped my skin and made it feel a bit tacky from hydration. Plus, it was fragrance-free which I really appreciate. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with normal to dry skin. Great serum for winter!
