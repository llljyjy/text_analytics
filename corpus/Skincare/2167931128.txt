I bought this to help refresh my spf as I’m trying to correct a dark spot problem and still be able to wear my make up. The pump on this product stopped working literally after one pump! My biggest issue aside from the packaging is that no matter how much or how long you shake the bottle for, it still leaves little globs of hardened product all over your face. I made the mistake on of using this as a finishing spray without double checking my fresh beat before stepping out. I had constant stares not only for being beautiful, but for the little spf globs that were akin to lint balls all over my face.The concept is amazing, but this product just doesn’t deliver. I gave it an extra star because I just love the brand and will continue to use unseen sunscreen when I go make up free Sprays out tiny globs of hardened product :(
