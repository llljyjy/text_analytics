If I could give it 4.75 stars, I would. My only issue is with the pump. It seems to get clogged easily? It is really difficult to explain! When I pump the product out, it resists at first, then all of a sudden ~shoots~ out in a random direction, often missing my hand or face. This serum might be better suited for dropper application. That is literally my only complaint. Feels super luxurious on the skin and I have noticed my dry patches getting smaller. Love the product, the applicator needs refinement. Love product & feels so good on the skin, but...
