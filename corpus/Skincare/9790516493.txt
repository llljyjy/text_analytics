this product feels AMAZING on my skin, especially on super hot days or when i’ve been really active and need a bit of a reset. i like to use it on days where i’ve moved around a lot and am visibly flushed, but i know i have somewhere to be and need to get my skin to calm down. the watermelon scent isn’t too overpowering and it’s definitely brightening— using it under makeup adds a lot of radiance and delivers a healthy, glowy, complexion! doesn’t feel sticky or invasive in my pores either. super refreshing
