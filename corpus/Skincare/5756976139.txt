After using this product for a few weeks, my skin’s moisture has significantly changed! It makes my skin feel moisturized, bouncier, and super soft in the mornings! Since this moisturizer is on the heavier side, it is a little thick so I suggest spreading it on your palms before applying to the face. This is also a great final occlusive layer in the routine, and I’d recommend this for combination and dry skin. A must-have for dry skin or wintertime!
