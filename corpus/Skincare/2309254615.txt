I’m not sure if I used (or am still using) this product correctly, but the way I did come up with seems to work well.  The scent is nice and I’ve noticed an improvement with the pores on my nose.  I’m a huge fan of the biodegradable and recyclable packaging!  I’m not sure if I’d buy this product on purpose, but I’ve enjoyed trying it out! nan
