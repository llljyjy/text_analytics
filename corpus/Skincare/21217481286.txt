This Shiseido Sun Dual Care Fresh Moisture SPF was terrible for me. While I understand that this was supposed to be moisturizing formula, it was a greasy disaster. It never dried down and made my face look like a nasty, sweaty, shiny mess. After 30 minutes, I couldnâ€™t take it anymore and used blotting sheets to soak up the excess. I know some people are into the whole glassy skin trend, but this was way beyond that imo. Maybe the dry-skinned ladies and gents would enjoy this, but it definitely was NOT for me. Greasy!
