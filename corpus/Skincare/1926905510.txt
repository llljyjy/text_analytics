I am super excited about this product! It’s meets all the requirements for me to write a review and recommendation. The brand itself is clean, sustainable and give back! At my age (52) it’s important that I find products that meet my needs which is that it doesn’t strip the moisture from my skin, yet it exfoliates well and leaves a shine. Perfection in a jar!
