After using the Lancôme Advanced Genefique Night Cream with Triple Ceramide Complex, I have been pleased with the results. I have some acne and sensitive skin but I still want to use an anti-aging night cream. I enjoyed how rich the moisturizer felt, but once I put it on my skin it felt very lightweight. It didn’t feel like “too much”, which many night creams tend to feel like. It provided the perfect amount of moisture to my face and my night time skincare routine isn’t complete without it now! I tend to be sensitive and I haven’t had a reaction so far! Rich and light
