This moisturizer is amazing. It is on the thicker side but it leaves my dry skin feeling hydrated. I am usually skeptical on trying new skincare products on my skin since dealing with acne but this doesnâ€™t affect my skin at all negatively. It has given me more moisture and makes my makeup look better! nan
