Extremely potent. I scrub for a few seconds gently and only leave it on for up to 60 seconds. My skin stays smooth for a whole week but I use my regular exfoliator also. Got a sample and am using about a pea size each time, it will last a long time. Did I mention it’s very potent if you’re not used to the strong exfoliators. nan
