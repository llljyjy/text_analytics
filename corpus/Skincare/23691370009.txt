I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. I received a sample size. I’m really surprised by how good this moisturizer is. I assumed it would be greasy like many others I’ve tried and this one was not greasy at all! It melted into my skin like butter but non greasy. My skin absorbed this quickly as well. My little jar lasted me a whole month asI really only needed a tiny amount for my whole face. I have oily skin and most creams make it worse but this one was nice. This has a nice light powder scent that’s not over powering at all. It’s smooth and rich but melts into the skin well. My skin feels much for hydrated after using. I’m looking forward to picking up a full size. If you have similar skin as me I highly recommend trying. Surprised but happy
