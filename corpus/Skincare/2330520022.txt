I have dry so Iâ€™m always on the hunt for a great creamy cleanser. I like this product because it is non-drying and you only need a small amount of the product. The product has a flip top so it is easy to use and store. I did notice a slight fragrance but nothing overbearing. I like this cleanser and would purchase it again!:) Great For Dry Skin:)
