I’ve gotten a lot of product in exchange for reviews, but this is the first one that I am 100% going to repurchase.  As someone who travels often for weeks at a time, I needed something that could make it through airport security and actually do a good job. I can’t believe that with this all I need is a sink (so I can run water over my razor to clear it out, so tbh not totally waterless) and this Hanni product. It leaves my skin so smooth. It’s incredible. I’m so in love. This product was gifted by hanni. Absoute repurchase!
