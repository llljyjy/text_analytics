I have combination skin and usually don’t have to worry too much about adding heavy moisturizers to my routine but it’s been really windy and dry this winter so my skin was not having it. I decided to give the Coconut +B3 a try and so far I’m incredibly happy with the results. My skin feels smoother/softer, it reduces the appearance of redness, and like everyone said… it smells amazing (if you like coconut). Glad I listened to y’all…
