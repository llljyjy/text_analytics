I have been using this product for about two weeks aftee I finished my fenty beauty mositurizer. This product  has caused my face to break out.  It does keep my face moisturized. The smell is a bit strong at first but you get use to it. Unfortunately, my skin is sensitive and this product does not personally work for me. Not for me
