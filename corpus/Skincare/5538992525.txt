In all honesty…I would continue to purchase this just because of the smell LOL overall it’s a good product but the smell just sells me on it! I do feel like my skin is pretty hydrated in the morning, so it definitely gets the job done. I love applying this when I feel I need to wind down and relax. It feels so nice when applying to the skin but the experience is taken to a whole new level with the lavender scent. The smell!!!
