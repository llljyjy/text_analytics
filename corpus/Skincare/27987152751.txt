Just like the lip sleeping mask, I find that I need to reapply this constantly and it leaves my lips drier than they started. It’s cute and makes my lips look juicy and plump, but once that fades it’s just sticky and drying. I’m on accutane though and this could be why, but if you’re someone who’s looking for hydration and not just a slight pink tint, I think there are better and more affordable options. Not moisturizing :(
