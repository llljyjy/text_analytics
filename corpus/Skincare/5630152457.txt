I love Plum Plump..this moisturizer is super hydrating and lightweight.  As someone who has dry skin the texture at first worried me because its like liquid-gel but my skin drank it all up.  It gives my skin a nice dewy glow that I love, if you are someone who had oily skin you may not like this because it can at first seems greasy but once your skin absorbs it the greasy feel goes away. Also love that I can buy refills instead of purchasing an entire new bottle. Plum & Dewy Skin
