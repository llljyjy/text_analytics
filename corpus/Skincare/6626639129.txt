Aside from it’s overall long term benefits of anti-aging and skin strengthening, I’ve noticed my overall complexion clear and brighten up! I usually have hyperpigmentation, and it’s become unnoticeable. I’m also faithful to the adaptogen cream because I enjoy thicker hydrating creams, so overall, I really like this cream. It absorbs into my face nicely and definitely hydrates well. Excited to incorporate it into my YTTP routine and continue to see it’s benefits. YTTP wizardary
