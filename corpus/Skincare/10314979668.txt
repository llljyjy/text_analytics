I received this product complimentary to review honestly. With that said, I like the consistency and texture of the product but unfortunately it didn’t seem to do anything for my hereditary dark circles. I also don’t have deep fine lines so it was hard to see any noticeable difference in terms of wrinkles. It also seemed to irritate the skin under my right eye. Not a product for me. Not for me
