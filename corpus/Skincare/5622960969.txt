I love this stuff! It does exactly what’s it’s supposed to, under the right conditions. I got it to tighten up my puffy eyes for my everyday, run around town, natural minimal makeup look, so I don’t look dead or tired with my puffy under eye circles lol. Sadly, you cannot use this under makeup (or on top of moisturizer; make sure eyes are clean and dry). It will dissipate or be wiped away with makeup. It will leave a slight white film but fortunately that works to my advantage; I need a little brightening for my dark circles. May not look good with some other skin tones. There is a sweet spot with the amount applied. Too little won’t get a good result, too much will leave excess white residue. With practice, you’ll figure out the correct amount. I took away a star for the fact it can’t be used under makeup, because I can use concealer for dark circles, but nothing can disguise the puffiness except for this tightener (or surgery or injectables which I’m not willing to try). Overall, it does do what I need it to do. Works great! (Under the right conditions)
