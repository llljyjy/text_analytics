These lip balms are divine. I bought this duo for my bf and once I tried his, I had to come back and get the duo for myself. It’s not too thick that it’s heavy and uncomfortable but it’s thick enough to leave a smooth pillowy layer that softens the lips so effectively. At the same time it’s not thin enough to spread away from where you place it. The SPF is a plus and it doesn’t make your lips look white. I won’t need anymore anytime soon but I definitely would not hesitate to repurchase balms from this brand. I am impressed!
