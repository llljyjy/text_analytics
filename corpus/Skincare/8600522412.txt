I was given @clarinscanada Double Serum from @thisisbutterly in exchange for my honest opinion.Mine came quite late in the mail so Iâ€™ve only used it for the last two nights, but I have to say Iâ€™m pretty impressed!You bend the pack in half and mix the 2 serums together, which is such a nest concept to keep the ingredients more potent! It feels so refreshing on the skin, and makes it feel so hydrated. My skin is only ever so slightly oily by the end of the day, but not enough to really care about. What surprised me the most was that some of my fine lines around my eyes have literally disappeared within 2 uses. Gone. I had to do a good investigation this morning because I almost couldnâ€™t believe it. ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m definitely going to keep using it for the full 7 days to see what else these magic little packs can do. So far, Iâ€™m definitely intrigued enough to buy this product!! Must!
