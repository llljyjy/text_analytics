So I received it via influenster to try and I have used it for about three weeks. I have mixed feelings about it. first the good, which is that it feels really really nice on the skin and can be used daily and so I plan to continue to use it at least for a while. It did not dry out my skin and didn’t immediately irritate even on shaved skin so it seems very gentle. Where it failed for me was that it broke me out. Sometimes purging can happen with some products which is unfortunate as I had quite a few bumps on my skin through the entire use time and did get better once I stopped for a few days. I have mixed feelings….
