I’ve been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I’ve got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We’ve bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. Welp. Over the last year that’s almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren’t staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn’t soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it’s rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. I can’t tell what they’ve done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it’s one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I’d still be willing to pay if it wasn’t worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I’m heartbroken. Don’t waste your money. Disastrous formula change.
