The creme itself feels thick and luxurious. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. Everyday my skin feels softer and firmer. But the scent. It has to go. It smells like a cheap Avon product. Not something you would expect from a high end product. The packaging is nice and the creme helped but the scent I canâ€™t get past Terrible scent
