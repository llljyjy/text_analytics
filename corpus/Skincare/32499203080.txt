This has a very nice, tame cherry scent. It smells like real cherries and not artificial. The oil really helped soothe and moisturize my lips. This lip oil is similar to a lip gloss due to its shine. When applying, the gloss shine lasts a very long time, which I have never seen before when it comes to any type of lip oil gloss. I really liked that feature. However, after a while of applying the product, the lip oil becomes very sticky on my lips. Awesome Lip Oil and Great Scent
