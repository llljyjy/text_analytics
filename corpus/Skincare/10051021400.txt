I really like this product. I’m trying to be a lot better about reapplying sunscreen throughout the day and this one is great! I would like to add that it is greasy/oily. I have very dry flaky skin so its perfect for me and soaks up very quickly. it is an oil based product so keep that in mind. If you have oily skin you will HATE it. I use it everywhere and it works great for me. I haven’t used it over makeup though because I use supergoop’s resetting spray for reapplication over makeup I love! (Not for oily skin)
