A Sephora employee recommended this, I normally protect my skin barrier with Cicaplast by La Roche Posay but it is super thick (love it for winter!).  This Khielâ€™s product is so soothing overnight but can also be used as a mask (thick layer for 15 minutes and remove excess). The price is great for the amount of product, too. Leaves my skin bouncy and dewy. Definitely would recommend if skin barrier is weakened. Pleasant surprise!
