This felt really nice on my skin and I enjoyed the fragrance. I have been using it in the morning before all other skincare. I received it complimentary for my review, but the price tag is very high! Not sure I would repurchase for this price. I did like it but overall not sure it did much. Essence is not exactly a product I feel is worth putting into my skincare routine. Nice but not for me
