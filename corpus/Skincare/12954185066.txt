I moved to a new city where the air is dry and the water is hard and only about a year after moving here, have I been able to find a moisturizer that has been helping heal my skin. My skin was turning into a scaley dry mess and no matter what I did, it was not improving. I was desperate as when I got this, I was 4 weeks out from my wedding. Now I’m 2 weeks away and my skin is much healthier!! This moisturizer has been a saving grace for my face. At this point the packaging doesn’t matter..yes it’s weird but the cream saved my face for my wedding.To note. I have a sensitive face. I believe I have a bit of rosacea on my cheeks. Saved my face for my wedding
