This is one of the only face washes with active ingredients that I am using for more than 2 years. It definitely helps to fight acne. I used this both for face and body. I would say it helps body acne much more than it does help face acne. But I have noticed that I get more acne on my face if I skip this face wash for a week. So it doesnâ€™t get rid of the acne completely, but I would probably have only one to two acne on my face if I am using this face wash every day. I only wash my face once a day with it to prevent dry skin. helps facial acne
