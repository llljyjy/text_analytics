I was really excited to try this as we didn’t have it in Canada for so long. Now that I’ve been using it consistently every evening for 2-3 months, I can say don’t love it, but I don’t hate it either! It does the job, it just didn’t wow me. I personally love the smell, and it lasts FOREVER, but the consistency isn’t my favorite. It feels like jelly almost. I’m used to something a bit creamier. Just ok…
