Bought this because my skin has been so dry this winter. Been using it for less than two weeks and haven’t had a dry patch since, so it’s doing exactly what I need! However, I read reviews before buying about the smell and decided to buy anyways. It literally smells so horrible upon application. I can’t even describe it but it is bad. Luckily it goes away after a few seconds, but truly stinks so bad when rubbing it in. dry skin savior!
