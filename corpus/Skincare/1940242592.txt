I love this so much! I’m obsessed with it. I am 37, have super sensitive skin and this hydrates and reduces redness. I spritz it on my face before and after hyleronic acid morning and night and also before and after moisturiser. I use it to set my makeup and throughout the day to keep my face hydrated and fresh. It’s the best I’ve used! Incredible price too. I use the aloe and rose water! I love this so much!
