As a fan of so many of Kiehl’s products and a lover of overnight moisturizers, I couldn’t wait to test this out! I have been using it as my primary nighttime moisturizer (occasionally as my only nighttime skincare product - aside from a cleanser) for over a week now and I have some initial thoughts. Since it’s summertime, my skin doesn’t get as dry as it does in the winter, so I went in thinking this could possibly be too moisturizing due to the texture (which is whipped, yes, but still feels slightly dense on the skin - something I don’t mind, but others may). Unfortunately, no matter how much I used (varying from the suggested pea-size to about four (4) times that amount), I never woke up overly impressed with how my skin looked. Was it hydrated? Yes. Did it smell nice and make me feel like, for 30 seconds, I was transported to a spa? Also yes. Did it hydrate leaps and bounds better than other, less expensive nighttime moisturizers I’ve tried? No. So, with that being said, I will happily use this jar up, but can’t recommend you spend your money adding it to your routine. Good moisturizer, but I wasn't wowed
