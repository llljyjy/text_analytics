so i’ve been struggling with chest and back acne from age 12/13 to today. this is the only method that i have used that works effectively. granted, everything takes some time but not only has my acne cleared up but my scars continue to fade each week. it is strong which is why i don’t use it on my face but works great with the rest of my body. great for body!
