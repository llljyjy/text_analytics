Worth it!  I used my first mask from a sample and immediately purchased a box of 10. Very hydrating and nourishes the skin.  I was surprised that this mask has given me better skin than after some facials.  Does not ’pill’ for those of you who want to use before a special night but I would recommend to let it settle in for a couple of hours to absorb all the goodness before putting make up on.  My skin can be temperamental to new products and prone to redness and breakouts and I can honestly say my skin loves this and hasn’t not been happier.  I use once a week with daily skin essence use. Great!
