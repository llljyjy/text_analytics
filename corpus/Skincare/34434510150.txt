I love it. It did not clog pores, does not irritate the skin, it’s pluming. So why 3 stars? It has identical ingredients from a discontinued SPF 50 Estee Lauder Advanced Day Wear Multi Protection. Upon trying La Mer SPF, it feels and smell the same as Estee Lauder, it has the same green color, same consistency. Guess what…turns put the ingredients….identical! Till last few ingredients. La Mer is an Estee Lauder Company. The Estee Lauder was $40. No comments. Same ingredients than EsteLauder discontinued SPF
