I would have given this product a 4 because I donâ€™t like propylene in my products... but their long list of great ingredients made me buy this. My cousin boasting about it helped as well. Let me tell you that I AM SO HAPPY I DID. This product is wonderful!! A tiny bit goes a long way, but most importantly, my face feels and looks great! I definitely recommend Yo Glow nan
