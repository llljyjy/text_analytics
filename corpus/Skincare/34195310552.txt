This lip mask comes in a little bottle. You twist the bottom and the product comes out of the top. You need just a little. I can tell that this is going to last me a while. It’s also okay if you twist up more product than you need because the top screws on and doesn’t come in contact with it. The lip mask is very soft, emollient and has a light sweet vanilla-ish scent. It has the feel of petroleum jelly but doesn’t just “sit“ on top of your lips. I highly recommend using a lip scrub to slough off dead skin first then put the lip mask on for the softest lips ever! It protects my lips from the cold, dry air. In my honest opinion, it works better than chapstick. It feels comfortable on my lips. It’s also perfect for travel because it’s secure and won’t get all over your purse.  Yes, it’s a little pricey but worth it because the product actually works. I probably wouldn’t have bought it because of the price but I’m happy to say that I would probably purchase it in the future. (I received this product free from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review) Good lip mask
