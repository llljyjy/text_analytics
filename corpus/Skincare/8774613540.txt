It is so hydrating and smooth on the skin. It gives my skin a perfect amount of moisture before applying my actual moisturizer. I am so thankful that I found this product and I will never stop using it. I am almost done with my second bottle and I will definitely be purchasing it soon because it is a staple in my skincare routine every day and night. The size of the bottle is pretty good and you just need a little in every use so it will last you for a good amount of time. I would recommend everyone to use it. I suffer from severe hormonal acne but this product do not make my acne worse rather I find it soothing and hydrating on my skin. My skin is very oily but the toner help me from getting too oily by keeping my skin hydrated and moisturized. Just buy it right now
