I really liked the way this serum felt on my skin during and afterwards. It didn’t make me look super oily but just gave me a dewy look. But.. it had a really weird smell to it and it caused me to get little bumps on my forehead. I probably won’t be using this in my routine anymore. okay serum but you can find better
