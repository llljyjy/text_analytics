I was disappointed in this product for many reasons:1. The ingredients were not blended well and every time I used it the product came out as a different consistency (clear liquid, beige creamy, white creamy, ect)2. It does not foam or get soapy as all, just remains the dull consistency mentioned above3. It always felt like there was a film left on my hands and face afterwards, did not feel like it totally got off my makeup.I never throw away products, always determined to finish every last drop, but this I could not even finish. Just threw it away after 1 week. Terrible product experience
