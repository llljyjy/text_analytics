This is a new anti-aging cream from IT Cosmetics that hits a *lot* of good notes for me.  It’s super thick and has a silky texture, it absorbs into my skin after about a minute and layers well under my sunscreen and makeup. Ingredients | 4% NIACINAMIDE: Helps even skin tone & reduce the look of fine lines/wrinkles2.5% PEPTIDE-LIPID COMPLEX: Helps improve elasticity, firmness & hydration; smooths the look of fine lines3% SQUALANE: Helps hydrate the skin & reinforce the skin moisture barrierResults | I’ve been using this for the month following my bachelorette party in Bermuda - so my skin was a bit sun damaged, dry and despite my sunscreen use a touch burnt. The cream really helped with hydrating and healing immediately, and after extended use I noticed an improvement in overall skin texture, fine lines, and plumpness/hydration. Takeaway | Perfect multitasking cream for all skin types but especially dry and aging skin. I’d absolutely repurchase this! Awesome Formula Multitasking Cream
