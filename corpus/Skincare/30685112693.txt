I received this sample from Influenster and Estee Lauder for an honest review. The scent was good.  This creme is very thick and creamy, so a little goes a long way. My skin was very greasy all day long and I couldn’t wait to wash my face. I had a tingling sensation around my nose after applying this. After using this for a few days, my face broke out. I don’t recommend nor would I purchase this. I have purchased many Estee Lauder products in the past and this is the first time that I’ve had any issues. Very greasy, caused breakouts
