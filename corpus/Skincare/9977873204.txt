I’ve been looking for a concealer to enable me to go mostly makeup free. My main issue is redness and irritation. I have a very fair complexion and sensitive skin. This product exceeded my expectations in neutralizing redness on my nose and cheeks. I’m so pleased and can already tell this is going to be my new favorite skin care product. I put it on after moisturizer and under primer then just follow up with the tiniest amount of under eye concealer and I’m good to go (as shown in photo). magical for fair complexion with annoying redness
