Just started using this product. My skin hasn’t reacted to it, which is great! I’m not sure if it has done much for my pores. It has a nice cooling effect and I like how it exfoliates when I wash it off. Downside is it is messy (you have to wash your sink after using this mask lol). Decent face mask! (with an awesome cooling effect)
