So far, I love this sunscreen! It is moisturizing with a light viscosity and the scent isn’t overpowering or too greasy on the skin. I have been looking for a new sunscreen after my old one got discontinued, and this one is perfect. I have a combination of oily & sensitive skin and it hasn’t broken me out. The only thing that was holding me back from buying it was the price, but if you are on the fence I really recommend at least trying this product as it’s worth it. Love it!
