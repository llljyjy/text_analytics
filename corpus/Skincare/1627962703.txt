I received the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ moisturizer sample from Influenster to review. I love this moisturizer,  the creme quite thick but easily absorb to my combination skin. I really wish that is not a sample size since I love how it make my skin supple, glowing and moist through out the day. It do have a light scent but it did not bother me at all. If you want a better moisturizer during winter month this is it. Youthfull glow moisturizer
