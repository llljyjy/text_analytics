I couldnt get past the consistency of this cleansing balm. Its very thick, almost waxy feel that doesnâ€™t melt into an oil upon contact with the skin. I still give it some stars as it did take my make up off but I wouldnt repurchase as I prefer a more thinner and easier melting cleansing balm. Thick Consistency
