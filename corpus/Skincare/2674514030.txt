I really, REALLY love this moisturizer, and it has become a staple in my routine. While I received a sample complimentary from Influenster, I’ve used it in the past and actually have 3 full size jars sitting in my vanity. It is super moisturizing but doesn’t clog my pores, soothes redness, and sits really well under makeup. It does have a bit of an “old lady smell” but honestly it’s convinced me to ditch light gel moisturizers and embrace something richer so I live with it. An absolute staple for me now! nan
