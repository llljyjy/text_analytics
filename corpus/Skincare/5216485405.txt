I like this serum for the most part! The packaging is amazing and I love that it has some weight to it. The serum itself sinks right into my skin and absorbs quickly. I like how it feels on my skin overall.  Only thing I’m not a fan of is alcohol being like the second ingredient, I don’t want it to dry out my skin. Love the packaging!
