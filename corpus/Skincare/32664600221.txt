My holy grail!! My under eyes and eyelids were so dry i could barely touch them,on top of that i had seasonal dryness from the winter. This product has completely cleared my dry skin ITS AMAZING!! the only downside is the product lasted me like 2 months, i think even less. which sucks cause the product is $50, i think itâ€™s due to the pump, but other than that the product is nearly perfect!! Absolutely LOVE
