I wanted to love this, as I do all of my The Ordinary products. However, this serum is so oily/greasy. It just sits on my skin like a mask, and I have to wait over an hour for it to soak in. I donâ€™t have that kind of time in the morning. My serums need to soak in quickly so I can put on my make up and get out of the house in the morning. Very Oily/Greasy
