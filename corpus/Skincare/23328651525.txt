I’ve been using this product since January of this year. Its been 4 months and I’ve purchased this product two times already. I love how it’s a gel consistency so it doesn’t feel heavy on my skin. It definitely keeps my dry skin hydrated and brings a glow to the skin. Will definitely repurchase once I’m done using my second bottle! Best moisturizer
