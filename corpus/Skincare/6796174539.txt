I had really high hopes for this and was thoroughly dissappointed. It’s sticky, leaves your face feeling heavy, and broke me out. I do have acne prone sensitive skin, but for the price point I was expecting it to work better for me. I used for a week and didn’t notice a difference and had to stop because of all the breakouts I developed. sensitive skin beware!!!!
