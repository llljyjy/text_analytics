I always struggle with dark spots and uneven skin tone. I feel like I never accomplish enough with all the products I’ve tried. Having the chance to try out this cream was honestly life changing. My spots have reduced in darkness & my skin tone is looking pretty good so far. I was worried about the scent, but it is surprisingly pleasant. It goes on very smoothly & doesn’t leave an oily feeling at all. nan
