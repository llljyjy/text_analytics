I really enjoy this product. At first the smell of the sunscreen was overwhelming and took my by surprise. I expected watermelon, after a few times of using it, I became used to the smell. I saw comments about pilling but I never experienced that. I donâ€™t find that this makes me oilier throughout the day. nan
