To start, this goes on the skin very nicely & feels very hydrating. I’ve been using it at night & after washing my face, so far really enjoying it. It’s light but moisturizes my skin nicely & provides a from within glow, my skin has been supply & soft since using! I would purchase again for sure, I like the aestethic of the packaging as well. Estée Lauder with another score! So far so good!
