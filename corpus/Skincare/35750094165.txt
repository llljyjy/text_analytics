Dior Cica Recovery and Repair Multi-Use Balm is a wonderful product. I used about two small peas worth on my finger, rubbed three fingertips (index, middle, ring) on both hands together and dotted on my forehead, cheek bones, jawline, and neck. I gently rubbed it in and noticed immediately it was smooth without feeling greasy or oily. I used it morning and evening, and within three days noticed a pleasant change in my skin’s texture. Dior Multi-Use Balm has a light chamomile scent without being overbearing or flowery. I have continued to use the Dior Balm during winter weather with favorable results. I workout daily and this does not cause my face to sweat more than usual. I am in my mid-50’s, have dry skin, live in a high desert climate (7,000 ft), and have my thermostat set at 68F. The only way this could be any better is if there were 50 SPF sunscreen added! Super Dior Cica Recovery Balm
