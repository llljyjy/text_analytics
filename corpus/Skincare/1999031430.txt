NEW PACKAGING IS TERRIBLE. i love this product, but the new packaging is terrible. Bring back the old style push jar. The plastic is too hard for a squeeze tube. I went to squeeze it out and the plastic seal popped right open. Basically a waste of money now because it will not close now and is exposed to air. nan
