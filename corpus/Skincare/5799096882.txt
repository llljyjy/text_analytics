I bought this sunscreen after reviews from influencers and have been using it for over a year. It works just fine as any sunscreen does, however it smells quite weird straight out of the tube and can leave my skin with bumps needing extra exfoliation at the end of the day. I wondered why that was considering I have no issue with zinc oxide. Well, itâ€™s because it contains Butyloctyl Salicylate, which is just the unregulated version of octisalate, a common chemical sunscreen. Because it is unregulated there is no dose limit so no way to know how much is in it. I do appreciate that there is a high % of zinc oxide, however this is in no way a 100% mineral sunscreen as advertised. NOT 100% mineral sunscreen
