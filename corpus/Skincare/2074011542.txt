I’m giving this five stars because it’s one of the only eye creams that doesn’t burn/irritate my eyes. I have extremely sensitive eyes and most eye creams or retinol eye creams especially are super irritating. So the fact that I can use this means I like it. In terms of effectiveness: hard to tell. I know retinol is not an overnight fix kind of ingredient, it’s more of a long haul/marathon thing you have to commit to. nan
