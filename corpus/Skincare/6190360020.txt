I received this through influenster to try. I do really enjoy this product. It feels really good on the skin, and it does make my skin feel soft and hydrated. The packaging is soo nice, too! It’s a bit pricey, but it’s good. It does about the same as the products I was using before I got this, but I would consider buying this in the future! nan
