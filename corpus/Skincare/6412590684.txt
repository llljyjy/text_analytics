I am in my middle 30s and have slowly noticed some fine lines and wrinkles along with some sunspots and more hyperpigmentation. I have used this product for over a month now and have noticed that all the things that Iâ€™ve listed above have improved and it is very hydrating and moisturizing. I have combination skin so sometimes my T-zone gets very very oily but this product has not made that worse. Love it
