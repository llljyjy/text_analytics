Gentle on skin yet effective and gives glowy results. First of all love the packaging, because when you’re washing your face your hands are wet and things can get messy pretty quickly. The product is in a plastic container which you can easily grab with wet hands without contaminating the rest of the product. It has an opening at the top that easily dispenses the right amount.It is super easy to incorporate into your daily routine. I use it every other day for exfoliation and that extra umph in my cleansing. It is smooth consistency but at the same time you can feel the tiny bit of grainy little particles scrubbing away on your face. It has a tiny smell like oats but not overpowering and I don’t mind it. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and radiant.  I was gifted by Dermalogica but this is my honest review. nan
