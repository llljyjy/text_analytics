I was really excited to try this product as it is displayed and described in this photo. When I got the bottle there was a sticker on it with a complete different formula description. This product is marketed to people who have severe skin concerns such as “folliculitis” so it’s strange for this company to send a product that is clearly different from the description. I’m unsure what’s actually in the bottle and why the bottle is punctured at the top. WHAT IS THIS??? tampered product- very suspicious
