This cream is AMAZING!  I am 58 and have combination skin.  I use it both morning and at bedtime.  You only need to use a very small amount, it goes a long way.  When I wake up in the morning my skin is so soft. During the day under my makeup it keeps my skin plump but not greasy at all!! Could not love this product any more! nan
