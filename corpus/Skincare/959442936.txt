I received this #freeproduct from TopBox but as the sample was vey small, I did not get to use it for long to see if there are any anti-aging or wrinkle correcting results.  The texture and consistency is pleasant and the scent mild and not cloying at all.  It felt nice going on and didnâ€™t bother my sensitive skin. A perfectly nice serum
