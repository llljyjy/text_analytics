First off: wow! I experienced a odd rash with some sensitivity, bumps, redness, and peeling. My guess is the sun is to blame. I tried many hydrating products and nothing really worked, it was all very temporary. When I used this mask my skin immediately felt soothed. After 15 mins the dryness was gone, the redness was gone. Iâ€™m going to continue to use this on a daily basis to help with the surface hydration! No flakiness or patching! Definitely incorporating to my nighttime regimen. sooooo soothing
