I finally picked this up about a week ago and have been applying day and night… it really hydrates my under eyes and they STAY hydrated. I’ve tried many many many eye creams o my for them to, yes absorb, but also NOT be hydrated. I will definitely repurchase this. The texture once applied reminds me a little of Huda’s jelly balm moisturizer but in a GOOD way! dry under eyes? Belief Eye bomb FTW!
