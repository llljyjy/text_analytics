Lately my skin has been wanting to break out every time I’ve tried using a new product and it was starting to get dry as a consequence of that but this moisturizer showed up at the perfect time. It doesn’t make me look or feel oily in the morning like other products so it’s just the perfect amount of moisture for me as well! I don’t know if I would pay 48$ for it again as I’m a student and have other places I need to spend money but I’m really enjoying it so never say never. The smell is really interesting yet pleasant and light as well! So I say if you can afford it go for it :) pleasantly surprised
