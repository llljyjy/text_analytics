I tried this as a free product through top box.  I was sceptical at first upon opening the jar the cream seemed very heavy and the scent was a bit stronger than I like but upon using it for a few days I noticed y skin was visibly softer and smoother. I put it on before bed and wake up to soft dewy morning skin.  It is gentle on my skin and caused no breakouts. It is a winner for me#freeproduct#trywithtopbox Soft and smooth
