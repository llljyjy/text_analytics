I was super excited to receive this product to test, but after using it for a little while I realized it’s not my favorite. I have combination skin and my face felt oilier than normal throughout the day. The product feels light when you apply it but doesn’t seem to absorb as well as other serums and sunscreens do. It also strangely started pilling after a couple weeks of use. I noticed some brightening and immediate light coverage of redness/pores which I appreciated. The photo I uploaded has slightly different lighting but I think this affect over time is apparent in it. If you’re looking for a one stop shop product then I think this ones for you. However I probably wouldn’t purchase a bottle once the one I received for testing purposes runs out. Great protection, mediocre product
