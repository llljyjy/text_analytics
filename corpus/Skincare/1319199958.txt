I received this product as a free sample for my honest review. I’m so glad I did! It has a creamy texture and goes on lightly to my skin. There’s no oily feeling or residue after use. My skin stays hydrated and soft all day long. After using it for a couple weeks, I’ll likely add it to my morning and evening routine! It’s hard to find products that don’t make my face look and feel dewy/oily to maintain moisture throughout the day. I think this is a great product and recommend trying to give you a youthful, healthy glow all day. Adding to my Skincare Routine
