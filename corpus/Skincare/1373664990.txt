I started using this last month and I’m pleasantly surprised at how well it performs. I have sensitive skin, so my skin can break out if I use products that are too heavy for it. This works well upon application. I did notice a bit of light burning, but I didn’t have much of a reaction to it beyond just a light red flush when I removed it. It firms the skin like a tight mask and then exfoliates upon removal to help the issues of dark pigmentation and a little bit of dry skin. I like this and I plan on purchasing once I am out.
