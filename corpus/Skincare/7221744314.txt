Love this product, but not good for oily skin. I have oily skin, but I can tell that this would work great on dry to normal skin. It is just too hydrating for my skin and it makes me oily. But otherwise I love this product. It feels amazing on the skin and it is a great texture. It sits great under makeup as well. The scent is not strong either which is a plus. Overall, great product but do not recommend for oily skin Great for dry to normal skin
