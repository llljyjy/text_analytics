I was using some facial razors from amazon for a few years but decided I wanted to spend a little more money and try these facial razors. And holy cow what a huge difference. It gets a closer shave, is easier to use and doesnâ€™t knick anywhere. They are small enough and thin enough to get into smaller spaces on your face and avoid making a mistake around your eyebrows. The only thing that was an adjustment was that since it is a better razor, it was harsh on my upper lip as opposed to my other dull razors. So my upper lip was a little painful to do but other than that I love these New Disposable Face Razor
