I am honestly a huge fan of this product! I’ve used a few of Dior’s products before and have really liked them, so when I found out i would be receiving this in an Influenster box in exchange for my opinion I was thrilled. The amount of product you get is a a LOT, 5 whole oz, and a little goes a long way, so i can expect to use this for a long time. it foams up beautifully without being too messy, and leaves your face feeling incredibly clean and soft. It does have a pretty strong “luxury’ fragrance, which I don’t totally love, but it doesn’t linger when you wash it off. I like using a cleansing oil or balm to remove my makeup and this is a perfect follow up in my double-cleansing routine. The best part to me is the price! I would habe expected it to be a LOT more expensive for the quality and longevity of this product, and I would definitely purchase is myself when i run out. Love! Amazing clean!
