This is an amazing moisturizer it is very thick and a little bit definitely goes a long way. After using it, it always makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It also makes my skin glow which I love. I received the sample size complimentary from  Influenster and I wish it would have been a bigger size so I would have gotten an even better idea of how this product works with my skin as I have very sensitive skin. However, I did not like the smell of this product it almost smelled like play-doh and wish it would have been a different scent. nan
