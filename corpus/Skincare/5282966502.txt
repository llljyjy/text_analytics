I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks and LOVE it. With autumn’s drier air comes a compromised moisture barrier for me, and this lovely cream helps to build it back up. Once applied, my skin goes from feeling burning and itching to soothed and calm. In the mornings, I wake up to find my skin looks and feels healthier. It has a solid place on my repurchase list. Lovely soothing and hydrating night cream
