I struggle with malassezia (fungal acne) and the occasional acne scarring as I canâ€™t resist picking at my face here and there. I have definitely noticed an improvement in texture, and you can really feel this product working almost immediately after applying. My fungal acne is all gone - I assume due tot he glycolic acid. And my skin does have a nice glow to it since using this. I would recommend definitely. Brighter, smoother skin
