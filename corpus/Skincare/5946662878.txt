I received this product complimentary. I’ve been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks. It’s actually very nice. I like the smell it’s not over powering at all. It almost smells sweet. The texture is nice especially if you’re a dryer skin type. I do have to let it soak in a bit before I put my make up on but make up applies nice. Pretty good!
