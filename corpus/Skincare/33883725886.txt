Amazing SPF50! GR has not let me down! Got this yesterday but I spent weeks researching this as I’ve seen so many reviews about “pilling”. After you cleanse, don’t apply any more products just go right in with this to avoid the pilling issue! I love the glow it gives me, and the amount of protection just blows me away! Thank you GR for making another beautiful product! SPF IS IMPORTANT! Minimum SPF30! But SPF50 way better!! AMAZING!
