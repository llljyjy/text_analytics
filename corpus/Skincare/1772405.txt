This SPF checks off all the boxes for my cold weather SPF  requirements: higher than a 30, water resistant,.hydrating, illuminating and anti-aging..  Itâ€™s very dewy and leaves a nice glow on my face.  I love that it also protects from pollution because I am in a city most every day for work. It does feel slightly greasy at first but that diminishes quickly.  I recently started looking for Ocean Friendly SPF and was happy to see that this is! nan
