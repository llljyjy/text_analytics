I’m already a huge fan of Peter Thomas Roth skincare so I was very excited to try these. I love that it comes with two different shapes patches. The face ones are perfect for my 11’s and smile lines and the eye patches are perfectly fitted to my under eye. First impressions were that I loved how it left my skin feeling after applying. It felt rejuvenated, hydrated, firmed and lifted. I think over time these will have incredible results. I love using these before bed or to awaken my skin when I start my day. Miracle Workers
