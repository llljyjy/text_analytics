The bottle is very small for the price, I paid 10$ for this in boxy charm charm add ons- if you are not part of boxy charm- join ! All these Sephora products are on there for literally like 5-10$. This peel is not the greatest, again it’s one of those gimmicks, it just pills when it goes onto your face it’s not actually taking off dead skin. I would never pay $40 for the small tube it comes in. Very small tube
