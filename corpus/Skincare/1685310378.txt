I use it daily, been using it for well over a year now. I’m not sure I see any results from this specific product. It’s not all that hydrating. I don’t find it irritating and I don’t get any milia around my eyes from this product which I have experienced with other vitamin c eye creams. I think I get more results from using the Drunk Elephant C-Firma serum near my eyes twice a day, specifically since they reformulated C-Firma. It is a cream, but maybe not worth the investment
