I was pretty excited about this product but after using it for a few days my skin started to breakout. I took a break from them and decided to alternate days assuming my skin was just sensitive and needed time to adjust to a new product. After almost two weeks, my skin did not improve and it continued to look more irritated each use. May give it another try without any other products to see if it’s a reaction with something else I’m using. Caused Skin Irritation
