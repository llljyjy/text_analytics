I’ve been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and overall I would say I like it so far. The texture is creamy and easy to spread out. It also has this scent but it’s really subtle and smells very natural. My skin feels very hydrated and glowy after using this. My husband actually use this too and he lovesssss it. I have normal to slightly sensitive skin and I don’t have any reaction using this (a good sign). I would continue to use it to see if it brightens my complexion or not. So far so good. Hydrating and creamy!
