I was super excited to get a chance to try the GLO Brilliant White Smile device! My dental hygienist reminds me every 6 months that I am a coffee drinker. Ha! I can’t wait to show off my new whiter smile when I go in for my next cleaning! It is hard to know how many shades it changed, but I am very happy with the results! It is very easy to use, but tends to make me slobber all over myself. Keep a napkin or paper towel nearby to catch your spit. The refills are reasonable, although I wish they were cheaper. It does take a long time to charge so make sure you time it out that it is fully charged before you use it. The last of the liquid is not bad and doesn’t leave me with the white film in my mouth like some whitening toothpastes tend to do. Very pleased with it! Finally White!
