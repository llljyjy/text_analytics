I have truly found a eye cream when I wasn’t a eye cream type of person!  I am 39 so I am started to see some signs of aging and was pleasantly suprised when I did start to see a difference. Im in love with the texture of this eye cream. It’s not too thick but not watery at all. I recieved this from Influenster a couple of weeks ago in exchange for my own personal & honest review and held of giving my review until I felt like I had ample time to use it and give a very honest opinion. Great moisturizer for gentle eye area.
