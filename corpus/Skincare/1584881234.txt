My skin was feeling dull and dry during the winter months. Incorporating this serum into my regime was a game changer. It’s extremely light weight and not sticky at all (which is why I avoid serums). It absorbs right away and doesn’t leave your skin feeling wet/greasy. It’s also amazing under makeup, it nicely primes the skin so my products go on smoothly. @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Great under Makeup
