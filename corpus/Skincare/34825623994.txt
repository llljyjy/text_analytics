I was initially intimidated by the fact that it said it was going to make my skin tingle, and I’m not sure why that made me so nervous, but I’m so glad I decided to go ahead and try it anyway! I had very few dark spots, but the ones I did have I’ve noticed have lightened, not quite significantly yet, but I’m sure with continued use they’ll get there. What I have noticed, is that my skin texture is evening out! My face is noticeably less dry, and my “scaly” patches have almost completely disappeared! With the weather getting colder it was always a struggle, and I felt like no matter what I did they’d be there, ugly and annoying. But no more!! So I’d say if you’re on the fence, definitely take the plunge! You’ll be pleasantly surprised! Helped normalize my skin texture!
