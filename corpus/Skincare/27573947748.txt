I have been looking for a product to help de puff and brighten my under eyes, and this is finally it! I wake up practically every morning with puffy eyes, and this product has helped so much. I use this product in the morning and nightâ€¦and I think using it at night is making the biggest difference for me. I no longer have to wear eye patches every day, and under my eyes are so bright I could prob get away without using concealer! The applicator is nice and cool when applying the product. With a few pats with a finger, the product is soooo smooth on your skin and ready for makeup for the day. nan
