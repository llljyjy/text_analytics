This makeup remover is super easy to use and it doesn’t take much to get the job done. It’s mild and smooth. It does a great job taking off even difficult eye makeup. I love that I don’t have to scrub the sensitive skin around my eyes and irritate it further. I do however find that sometimes it’s difficult to rinse off and not leave a slightly greasy feeling behind. I suppose that some people prefer to leave a little of that moisture behind.This is my honest and true opinion. I received this product for free to sample. nan
