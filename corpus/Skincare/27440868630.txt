I absolutely love this serum. Since using it for the past few days, it has made my skin appear more vibrant. It’s not one of those very thick serums. It’s lightweight and you don’t need to apply much. It is scented so if you aren’t a scented beauty product person it may not be for you. It does smell really good. This will for sure go along way. I can’t wait to see my results over the course of the weeks. Gave my skin a nice glow!!
