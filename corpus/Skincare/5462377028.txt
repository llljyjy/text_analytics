Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a screw top for easy access. I like the size and color of the bottle which makes in easy to locate quickly. I love how hydrating this cream is and that it contains vitamin C which helps to brighten your skin and reduce redness. The texture is very soft and creamy and rubs into my skin very well without leaving any oily or greasy residue. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and renewed. Itâ€™s an absolutely amazing base layer and the perfect way to start your skin care regimen. Soft & Creamy
