I Love the consistency of this product.  I love the way it made my skin feel all smooth and soft. The product in the jar had a pleasant aroma but it wasn’t overwhelming or load. I loved the suddle tones. I’m glad I got the opportunity to try it. It left not breakouts or any issues with my skin. At all. I was pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend to family and friends Smooth and Creamy
