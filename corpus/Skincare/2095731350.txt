I am GLOWING.I was so impressed by what Eadem created with Milk Marvel (purchased last autumn on a whim), I decided to join the tester group for their next launch. Cloud Cushion arrived at my door and I tested it alone without using Milk Marvel at the same time.At first glance, I was worried that I was stuck testing out a moisturizer that would be too rich for my oily acne-prone skin. Thankfully, I had nothing to worry about. This moisturizer has a rich pillowy soft feel and leaves a hydrated dewy finish. My skin loves this moisturizer day & night.From the packaging, the Fufu spoon, the ingredients and formulation — the client experience was so clearly well-thought-out. Milk Marvel and Cloud Cushion are beautifully executed products.If you ever meet me in real life, I will somehow work Eadem into the conversation encouraging you to try their products because I so believe in the results. Some days I am just in shock by the transformation and how healthy my skin looks. It’s been years of struggling with acne and PIH. Nowadays, I just use Eadem and rarely give my skin battles a second thought. It took years (decades) to curate a list of products that I can completely rely on to feel confident in my skin. What works for me: - Femmue’sExtraordinary BeautyCleansing Balm- Shani Darden Cleansing Serum- Dr. Barbara Sturm Enzyme Cleanser- Foreo Luna- Eadem Milk Marvel Dark Spot Serum- Eadem Cloud CushionPlush Moisturizer- Sleep <3On the hunt for my favorite SPF(s) and retinoid(s) to add to the above lineup. Best of luck to you all on your skin journey! I am GLOWING.
