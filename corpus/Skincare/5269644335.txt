I had high hopes for this product given the reviews on the Peace Out website but I believe those reviews are filtered given my lack of results. My nose and forehead are a problem area when it comes to pores and blackheads almost exactly like the before and after product photo on Sephora. After leaving on the product for the maximum amount of time (6hrs) the only thing it really did was pull out all the peach fuzz hairs on my face and leave my skin feeling tight rather than do anything to my pores. I wish there was more transparency with the product photo results since I did not notice any difference in my pores. Maybe with prolonged use it might get better, but the Peace Out advertises their results after 1 use. The 2 stars if for the possible potential with prolonged use, but currently it has 1 star from me. no difference after first use
