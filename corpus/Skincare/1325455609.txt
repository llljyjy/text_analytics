This is one of the best scrubs I’ve used and I’ve tried so many. I would suggest that you lightly dampen your face and then massage the product into your skin. If you use too much water it will dissolve and won’t give you a proper exfoliation. This makes my skin super soft and smooth and it smells heavenly! Definitely a must have skincare product! Must have!!!
