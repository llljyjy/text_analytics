Have very sensitive skin (thanks Accutane) a Sephora employee recommended this to me. My skin requires proper hydration or it gets very oily and flaky- at the same time. Feels refreshing on my skin, but need like 3 other moisturizers for my skin to feel hydrated. Also did not actually reduce redness. Gave 3 stars because it did not make my redness or dryness worse, but it did not make any better: especially for the price point. Will not repurchase, but will use to the last drop. nan
