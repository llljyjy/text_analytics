My hands have been like sandpaper the past few weeks. I’ve been trying several different  hand creams hoping to find relief. Then this recover balm came in the mail from Influenster. Wow! I don’t know what’s in this stuff, but it only took 3 uses for my hands to go back to normal.  I’m highly impressed. Wow!
