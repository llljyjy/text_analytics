This product was gifted to me by REN Skincare. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin so finding a vitamin C serum I like has been such a chore. most vitamin C serums have irritated my skin, especially ones with pure L-ascorbic acid. I had really low expectations for this serum, but I have been pleasant surprised. I use this in my PM routine, and I really wake up to skin that is smoother, brighter, and less red. A vitamin C serum that doesn’t make my skin red?! That’s unheard of. I haven’t had any breakouts from this serum at all, so I’ve really been liking this so far. Fungal acne sufferers beware, this serum has several ingredient that might trigger fungal acne so I haven’t been using this on my forehead. nan
