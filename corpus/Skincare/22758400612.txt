First off, I’m used to using the “supergoop” brand of sunscreen so I compared the Shiseido to the supergoop. It says that it’s supposed to be ocean friendly and that’s what I look for in sunscreens. I also like to make sure that it’s not oily and greasy along with leaving my skin looking cracked when it dries. For this to be almost a $40 sunscreen it shouldn’t leave my skin looking cracked but it did. The texture is like any other regular sunscreen and it’s a white thickish liquid that goes on smooth but does leave a little greasy bit of residue on your hands. It does have a soft pleasant smell though and it is actually water resistant for almost 2 hours. Another pro is that it does have hyaluronic acid in it which is great for keeping skin moisturized. I will finish what’s in my bottle, but as far as repurchasing when I run out I probably won’t. I would have to say it’s pretty decent and I like it but it’s not my new favorite. It’s okay
