This is my HG Lip Balm and the one that will be on re-purchase. I am almost hitting the pan on this because I use it every single night and love having this in my nighttime routine. It really works (even when I traveled to a place during the winter that was cold and dry.)I have tried SO many lip balms but this oneâ€™s by far my favorite because it actually works to moisturize your lips. I find many popular lip balms sit on top of the lips, but this one actually sinks in. MY HG Lip Balm
