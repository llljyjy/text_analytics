In my over six years in the beauty retail industry, one thing I’ve learned is products like this tend to be popular, especially since it is so user friendly. This product is great for so many things! It is a fragrance free serum option for people like me who have sensitivities to scented skincare. It’s super lightweight and absorbs into the skin easily. Looking for a refresher mid day, but can’t do a full skincare routine? Wanting on the go moisture for your gym bag, or for when you’re working in an office? This is a great solution for you. Pack this in your bag for easy on the go application. Key ingredients include: plant based collagen, niacinimides, and hyaluronic acid for helping your skin maintain moisture. I think it’s a great option for year round skincare, and if you feel you need a little extra moisture in the winter, it makes for a light first serum to apply before a thicker one (especially in the winter for people like me who have dry skin). It’s also lightweight enough that I think it’s also a great way for people with oily skin to still get hydration that their skin needs. And my dry sensitive skin really loved the formulation! A lovely fragrance free lightweight option
