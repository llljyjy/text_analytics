This serum applies smoothly to the skin and soaks in quickly, leaving no residue behind. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin either. As an oily skin girl, I was concerned about using a radiant serum, but I was pleasantly surprised! It leaves a subtle glow without looking oily and layers well with other skincare. I’m definitely going to reach for this as the weather gets cooler to give my skin an extra boost! Subtle Radiance
