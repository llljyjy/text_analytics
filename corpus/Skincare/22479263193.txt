I am in love with this cream.  I have a hard time finding creams that donâ€™t make my face greasy.  The moment I opened this jar up the lavender scent hit me.  Subtle and amazing.  The cream is silky and smooth on your skin.  It melts right in.  I live in CA in the dessert and my skin is always on the dryer side but this cream has dramatically helped.  I will be keeping this cream in my daily routine. Amazing Night Cream
