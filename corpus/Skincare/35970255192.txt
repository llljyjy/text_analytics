I received this product for free through the mail from Topbox in exchange for an honest review.I have to say I love the packaging, it’s so cute  My first impression of the product was that the packaging was so cute! As far as the mist itself  it has a great scent that isn’t overpoweringly strong scent, it’s very subtle after spraying and it fades quickly. It is non-sticky and the mint leaves my skin feeling fresh. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Great refreshing pick me up
