This sunscreen is great! Super lightweight and adds a hint of color to your face, my only complaint has to do with the packaging. The paint on the bottle flakes off and then the product just pours out of the top. Itâ€™s a game to get the cap off fast enough and make sure the product gets into your hand and not all down the side of the bottle. Please change the packaging!! nan
