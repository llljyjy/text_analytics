I got this trial size free from influenster. I was super excited to try this product! Let me start by saying this smells very heavenly, feels like a buttery cream, and it does work. For me, however, it does make my skin feel raw around the nose and chin. I cannot use this twice a day like is intended to do. I’ve used it in the day time and now just only every other day to keep my face from  burning. This has minimized the way my black heads look on my nose and gives me a smoothing effect. I would buy this if I didn’t feel sensitized. Smells heavenly
