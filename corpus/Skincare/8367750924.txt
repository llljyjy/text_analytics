I redeemed some of my points for a sample size of this and my only regret is not taking before and after pictures.  I had some sizeable dark spots on my face and this serum has reduced them by around 75% so far and I have only been using it for less than a week.  I have been spot treating my dark spots and have the results I wanted from such a little sample but you could do your whole face.  You only need to use a little at a time because it goes a long way.  I will be buying the full size when my sample runs out. Exactly the results I was hoping for!
