I have been using the inkey list retinol as a beginner for 3 months now. I decided to move on and I was recommended this kit to try out by a few people are sephora. This is definitely stronger than inkey lists and did sting my face a little the first night of use, but that is to be expected — its retinol. If you are not used to retinol your skin WILL be irritated. But Im fine with the irritation, only woke up with a tiny bit of flaky skin around my nose but that was it. I actually LOVE the smell. I wouldn’t say its “overpowering”. Its a light scent and it goes away. Maybe im not sensitive to smells but thats my opinion. Its only been about a week since I have been using this every night and I already feel and see a slight difference in texture of my skin. Im very prone to acne and so far so good! 5 star retinol
