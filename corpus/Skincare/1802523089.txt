I received this product as a free sample. WHAT A GIFT! I never thought I’d find an effective, quality moisturizer that wasn’t super greasy, with a vague, underlying stinky scent. Confidence in a Cream is the one that does it all: moisturizes, brightens, softens, all with SPF 50!!! Thank you, IT!!! A Perfect Non-Greasy Mosturizer WITH SPF!
