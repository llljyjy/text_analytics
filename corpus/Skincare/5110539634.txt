I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tillbury in exchange for my honest review. This is an awesome creamy eye cream. I didn’t notice anything different, but it’s extremely hydrating. In the long run I’m sure it will help with dry under eye skin and fine lines. It isn’t a lot of product for the price but most eye creams are kinda expensive. I would recommend! Hydrating eye cream
