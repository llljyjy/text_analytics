this product does the trick delivering the vitamin c because it stings a little bit when you apply it and rub it as vitamin c is known to do... What I didnt like about this product however is that it is a sort of liquidity viscosity and when you rub it into your skin it feel gritty.. Not overly gritty but there is some grit factor to it.... would be nice if it went on and rubbed in smoother and more elegantly GRITTY
