I received Dr. Z Repairing Moisturizer almost 2 weeks and have been using it every night. In 2 weeks I haven’t seen any real change in my skin appearance but my skin feels so hydrated and plumper. This moisturizer is light and my skin drank it up especially since I li e in a cold dry climate. I’ve always used drugstore moisturizers and my skin never felt fully hydrated but this moisturizer is incredible! My skin is so soft and even the price point is way more expensive than I’m used too but you don’t need to use as much product to get results. Highly recommend this if your skin is combination, dry & patchy or if it is just tired looking. Can’t wait to see if there is a difference in appearance over the next couple weeks. If your looking for a good quality moisturizer look no further, this is everything & more! Great for Combination to Dry tired looking skin!
