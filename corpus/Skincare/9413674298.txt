I love how light feeling the product is. I get worried having combination skin products will leave me feeling oily and heavy. But this was great. I didnâ€™t have wrinkle concerns but I do have extremely bad bags under my eyes and this helped the color not be as noticeable. I noticed I used less concealer and I looked less tired after waking up in the mornings. nan
