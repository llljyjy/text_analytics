Ive been using the Drunk Elephant protini peptide moisturizer and serum for a long time now and my skin is always glowing. When I received the drunk elephant eye cream I was so excited! The texture is so nice, it adds so much hydration to my skin without leaving a greasy or heavy feel. I will definitely add it as an ongoing part of my skincare routine! I love it! Definitely adding to my permanent skincare routine
