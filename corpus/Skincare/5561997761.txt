Huge fan of this cleanser! My skin was freaking out on me a while back. I had breakouts and redness, which I eventually figured out was rosacea. My dermatologist put me on medications to treat the rosacea, but my skin didnâ€™t start to improve until I started using this cleanser. I needed something clean and gentle and this did not disappoint! I bought the mini size initially, but have been buying 16 oz for over a year now. clean and gentle
