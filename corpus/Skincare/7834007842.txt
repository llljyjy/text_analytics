I never write reviews but my experience with this cleanser was pretty awful, and I only got it a few hours ago. The product itself isn’t my favorite-- it blurs sight and leaves a film on your skin. The tube also broke and product was left on the outside of my tube and on my countertop. I’d call this product a hard pass, sadly. tube broke after one use
