I’ve used it a couple times and I absolutely love this sunscreen! It’s very light weight and absorbs super quickly and easily into your skin, it doesn’t leave a white cast and it doesn’t have that “sunscreen scent” that everyone knows about lol! You also feel protected when using it and I don’t reapply it as much as I should when I’m outside. All in all, another great product by FAB Love it!
