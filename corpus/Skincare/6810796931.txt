I received a free sample of Dr. Zenovia Skincare in Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer from PINCHMe. The scent is very subtle, clean, and refreshing. The texture is creamy and can be applied easily. I was amazed at how soft my skin was after applying and using this product. I have sensitive dry skin and really benefited from this product. Subtle clean scent and smooth skin
