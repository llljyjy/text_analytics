I looked at many other retinol eye products before trying this one after an employee recommended The Inkey List ‘Retinol Eye Cream’. The price point is a no brainer if you are in the market for a good eye cream and I also love that it is a clean beauty brand. I waited about a month after trying this product to write this review and I can happily say that my under eye wrinkles and texture have already improved in the short time I’ve been using this product. The consistency is almost like a oily, liquid texture and I warm it up between my fingers and it creates a smooth cream that is easy to apply (doesn’t tug! So important!) I am so excited to see the results after a few months of using this product and am amazed at how fast I’ve seen results already. Remember to use a good SPF always in the day (don’t forget those eyelids!). Highly, highly recommend this product. P.S. My first post didn’t work so I rewrote this review. It’s THAT GOOD. LOVE! Price is amazing and great results so far
