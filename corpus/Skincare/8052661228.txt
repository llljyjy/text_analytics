I got this because I love the watermelon lotion, but this majorly sucks. The scent is pretty strong of sunscreen, it pills under makeup, and I got sunburnt after spending 50min in the sun. I’m not a fan of hybrid chemical and physical sunscreens, I find the ones with zinc don’t work as well. I won’t be buying this again, I’ll stick with my Korean ones that’s $13 on Amazon from now on. totally not worth it
