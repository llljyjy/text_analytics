This came in a boxy charm subscription. I started using it 2 months ago. I have been very consistent and I really love it. I had oily skin but with this product and a skin care routine change my face it’s now combination skin to normal skin. It is best to use with damp skin so it can really absorb all of the product. It hydrates the skin without it feeling oily. This serum is just right with my sensitive skin and you only need 1 pump for the whole face. I use it at morning and night. Then I follow up with another serum or just a moisturizer. got it on a boxy charm box…
