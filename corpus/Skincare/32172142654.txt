The Caudalie Vinergetic C+ Masque Instant Detox took all the oils and excess sebum out of my skin. The masque absorbed the toxins from my skin, especially around my T-zone and made my pores feel deeply cleaned. I could even notice a visible difference in the tightening of my pores after using this product for only 10 minutes. Overall it left my skin feeling smooth and gave it a nice glow. The reason for giving it 4 stars is because I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of the smell, probably because it is a clay mask, the smell was very earthy, and kind of reminded me of the smell of wet dirt.I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox Deeply cleans pores, not a huge fan of the smell
