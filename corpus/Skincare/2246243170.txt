I have very easy going skin - it’s usually blemish free. I got a sample of this and loved using it to “spot” bronze. I thought it would be a great way to not wear makeup, but still wear makeup. SOMEHOW it broke me out more than an actual bronzer. I don’t understand, because the ingredients are great and it’s basically skincare. I tried it 3 times to make sure it was the problem. 3 pimples after one night…exactly where I used this product. I love the other DE stuff, super disappointed. Will be returning. Loved it, but it broke me out!
