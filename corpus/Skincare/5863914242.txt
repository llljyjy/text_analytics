This product smells really good. As far as tanning, I’m not 100% sure if it really did anything. It did feel good on my skin. I really like the formula of the it. However if you are wanting a true tan, I’m not sure if this is the product. I am of darker complexion. While this product smells good and feels amazing! I will not buy this product in the future. I was sent this product to test and give my honest opinion. nan
