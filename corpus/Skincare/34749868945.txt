This facial cream is so nice! It’s thick and creamy, yet doesn’t feel heavy on my face, which I love about it! I also can still “feel“ the hydration it leaves on my face in the am, but yet it’s not greasy at all! I sleep with a C-pap and I can still get a snug seal with my machine immediatly after use which is very important to me! love this cream!!!
