I’ve been using the Kiehl’s retinol night serum for a couple of weeks now. Firstly, i love how innovative the product is, mixing the retinol in the capsule when your ready to start using the product is great because this ensures that it’s fresh since retinol will breakdown over time, especially when exposed to light. The product feels light on the skin and a little goes a long way, I haven’t noticed any pilling under my moisturizer with this or any irritation, but i will say that I am use to using retinoids. Those with sensitive skin might want to start out with 3 times a week use and go from there. I would say this retinol serum feels more advanced and hearty than some drugstore retinoids ive used in the past. Overall I have enjoyed using this product and would recommend it. innovative
