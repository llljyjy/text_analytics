I’m a fan of La Mer. Almost my entire regime is of the brand. I decided to try the lip gloss because I love the brand so much but was disappointed. It’s mediocre at best. The packaging is not luxurious and the gloss is unimpressive & does nothing really. Get the lip balm…. It works! GET THE LIP BALM INSTEAD
