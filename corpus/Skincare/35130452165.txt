I have extremely dry skin with some texture but I need something to cover my redness. Every tinted moisturizer, concealer & foundation I’ve tried is cakey on my skin until this product. Didn’t look cakey, didn’t emphasize my texture, covered my redness very well and a little goes a long way. I’m very happy with this purchase. new favourite product
