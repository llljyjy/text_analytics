I got this product as an offer with purchase, and I love it! it has a great uniform exfoliating particle size in a base that smells wonderful, goes on smooth, and doesn’t cause dehydration or comedones. I leave it on for 15 minutes and scrub in circular motions while rinsing. I don’t need to use toner afterwards, which is nice. further re the scent... I expected it to smell like oranges or at least citurus, but it doesn’t -- it’s a fresh ocean mist aftershave vibe, which I prefer over things that smell edible, and it doesn’t linger afterwards. awesome! nan
