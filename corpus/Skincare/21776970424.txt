This isn’t a product I would normally reach for but I liked it more than I thought I would. It’s hydrating without being heavy. I definitely think it would be good for someone with oil probe skin as it’s not oily. I also like the light clean slightly soap-like smell. I think this product is a pretty good price as well. Great product!
