I was lucky enough to be sent a 7 day luxury sample of the Clarins Double Serum Eye Firming and Hydrating Anti-Aging Concentrate. This sample was sent complimentary of Influenster for their Best of Beauty Vox Box. I loved this product. I felt like my skin looked more well-rested, with an even tone in the under eye area. My skin was smoother and my upper lids felt firmer. Everything from temple to temple was wonderfully hydrated. I think a little bit definitely goes a long way. I didnâ€™t have any reactions to the product, but the fragrance for an eye product was too strong, which is why I took off 1 star. Deeply effective 7 day eye serum sample
