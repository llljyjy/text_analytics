Stopped using cleansing wipes cold turkey when a plastic surgeon and an aesthetician promised me this was not even close to the best way to cleanse your skin. Aside from the potential harsh drying chemicals, the action of wiping your skin with a material can be like pulling at it and cause micro tears- what? Tears?? That was it for me. Since then I’ve tried 4,893 cleansing oils and balms I swear. And THIS, this is superior to them all. I didn’t mind the drunk elephant one but I found I was still using micellar water to take of the remnants of eye makeup and contour that I seem to  love to shellac on every morning. But not with this one! Gentle massage around each area of my face, and every smidge of makeup is gone. Amazing. LOVE it. Buy it! Please :) Eye makeup/contour junkie? U NEED THIS
