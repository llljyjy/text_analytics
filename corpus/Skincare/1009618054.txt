I’ve been testing out the new Willow & Sweet Agave Plumping Lip Mask that Alpyn Beauty recently launched. This contains agave, hyaluronic acid and willow bark to gently exfoliate for smooth lips. I have super thin and dry lips and am always looking for a thick, super moisturizing lip product. This really provides the hydration my poor lips need. Luis, I do think the moisture smooths out the lines on my lips and gives me a plumper look. It’s a bit expensive but work it in my opinion. Thin, super dry lips
