Horrible cast, zero blendability, filled my pores with white dots. Also pilled badly! For reference I have brown Asian, oily to combination skin with neutral to warm undertones that tans easily. You can see the cast on my face as compared to my neck where I applied no product. Dr. Jart is a Korean brand so this product is clearly made with very fair East Asian to Caucasian skin in mind. I’ll probably only use this at home. SKIP if you’re not a white or fair skinned person
