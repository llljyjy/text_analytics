I honestly thought there was a mistake when I opened my Sephora box. I thought it was a sample. I looked through the box and nope, that was it. I missed the part where it was .37 FL OZ.. I don’t even get a full ounce of product for $35? Are you kidding me? It is the size of a lip balm like in other photos shown here.That being said, I tried it this morning and used a little bit (since I don’t have very much to begin with). For context, my cheeks are VERY red. It did tone them down a little, but I would not say it was “bye bye redness“, you can still see it, I still had to use foundation on top of it. The product itself is creamy but it would not take place of a moisturizer. It feels like a very light foundation. If you cheeks get a little rosy from being in the cold, this product is for you. If you have full blown rosacea it is NOT for you unless you are looking for light coverage. You are better off getting Dr Jarts green cream, at least for $55 you’re getting a full big container of product, plus it gives you SPF coverage. It's too small! It's sample size!
