I havent used too many eye creams in the past, but I recieved this product to test complimentary from Influenster and I would highly recommend. This product was successful in reducing color and swelling from my under eyes on several occasions. It helped alleviate puffiness related to both tears as well as allergens after a single use, and I saw noticeable change in the firmness of my under eye skin after multiple uses. I have sensitive skin and did not have any redness or irritation after continued use of this product. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to treat their under eye areas. Say goodbye to puffy under eyes
