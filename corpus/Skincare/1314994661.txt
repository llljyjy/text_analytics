Really nice exfoliate.  Gentle and not as rough as some other brands but works really well.  Bit of a stronger scent but it doesnâ€™t bother me.  I kind of like it.  Price is great for the brand and there is a lot in the tube.  Works beautifully and my skin felt really soft and nice after. good exfoliator
