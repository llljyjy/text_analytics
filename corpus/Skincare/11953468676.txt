I do think that this product worked. In using it my dark undereyes did get a bit better. As I cover my undereye circled with concealer anyway, the difference wasn’t big enough for me to justify the price point.i would recommend to someone who doesn’t wear a lot of makeup and truly wants one of the best products out there, however for the price I would rather try to find other alternatives nan
