I love the look and feel of this sunscreen! The texture is a bit odd out of tube, kind of lumpy. But it instantly smooths out and blends into skin as soon as you apply it. I love the subtle glow it adds to skin and the texture is lightweight and non-sticky. There is a sunscreen scent, but it’s not noticeable after a few minutes. I’ll definitely be reaching for this sunscreen regularly! nan
