Great product and a little goes a long way. I have dry/sensitive skin and this does the job. After applying this I use my Pharmacy (Halo Moisturizer) it give me the GLOW I always wanted and it hydrates my skin. I use this oil day and night. I will say if you have oily skin be mindful that this product can be oily if you use a lot. I will definitely be repurchasing. nan
