I recieved this mask complimentary along with the Pore Refining Serum courtesy of Dr.Jart and Influenster. I used this mask when my skin needed a much recovery. The mask is a mud mask with the benefit of a traditional sheet mask. After cleaning the mask off you are left with a clean feeling as long as you donâ€™t leave the mask on for to long and let it dry completely as it can leave your skin feeling to dried out (which can happen with some mud masks). The mask has a pleasant smell to it and comes off pretty easy. recommend using luke warm water to rinse off as to cold it constricts the skin and to warm you could accidently irritate the skin. A great mud mask for some TLC
