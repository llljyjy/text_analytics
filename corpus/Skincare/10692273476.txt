In the winter I struggle a lot with keeping my skin radiant, and because I use my Glow screen so much, I wanted to give this product a try. Honestly I feel like it layers really well with my moisturizer without giving me a greasy film. I sits so well under the rest of my makeup and it doesnâ€™t leave me oily at all. I love it. NOT GREASY
