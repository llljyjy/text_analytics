This eye balm is the bomb! Itâ€™s Ceramighty Af with its 3% Ceramide Blend and 10% Plant Omega-Lipid Complex. Giving you tons of elasticity, firmness and hydration. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Drunk Elephant for my honest review! My new favorite part of my skincare routine already!I noticed a huge difference around my eye area right away with how soft the texture felt. Then after the first few days I could see my skins texture was changing overall. Softness improved and smoothness. My skins barrier around my eye area became firmer as well. The hydration has help strengthen and improve my skins suppleness in just a week! It my new favorite eye balm especially with its cute packaging!With just one little pump I get so much! I use this morning and night after I cleanse and tone of course. Gentle pat around the eye area. 100% free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.Vegan and cruelty-free. Eye Changing! I love this stuff!
