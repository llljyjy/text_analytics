Iâ€™ve been using the ordinary products (hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, retinol, lactic acid, salicylic mask, caffeine solution) for over a year now with a fairly strict routine. I just added this serum to my routine and use it every morning and about 2 nights a week if I feel my skin needs it. This is the only thing I have changed in my routine and WOW - I looked in the mirror the other day and could barely see the pores on my cheeks. Visible pores have always been a struggle for me and in about 4-5 weeks I have noticed a HUGE difference. I will be recommending this to all my friends with similar issues and will keep this in the routine. The only thing I have noticed is my skin feels slightly tacky for about 30 minutes after applying but the less I put on the less tacky my skin feels. Once it has fully absorbed, my skin feels so soft and supple. Great success, worth the hype
