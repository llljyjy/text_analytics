First off, I’d just like to say, this is not a cream - for those of you, like me, who might find neck creams too heavy or greasy (my neck gets oilier than my face), this is more like a creamy serum treatment that sinks right in with no oiliness. I use this at night and while with other neck products I would wake up with oily rings around my neck, this one is silky soft & actually feels like it’s improving my skin! I’m nearly 40 so I’ve been looking toward the future to keep my skin nice, & this product is wonderful - it feels nutritious for the skin, does not cause me any breakouts, & helps even the skin tone & texture so my neck feels more like my face than my chest, if you know what I mean. I’m going to continue using to see if it helps with my “tech neck” lines - the deeper creases I have from constantly looking down at a screen. I would highly recommend this to my middle-age pals who want to take better care of their neck & décolleté! More like a serum than a cream
