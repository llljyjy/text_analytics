Should probably pass if you have oily skin...it’s very moisturizing. There are a couple of things that are important (I found out the hard way) you have to SHAKE the bottle well before using, and you need to let it dry down for at least 15 min. before applying foundation. Blurs pores, soft and silky, I wish I didn’t love it, but I’m hooked. Hands down best facial sunscreen I have ever used!
