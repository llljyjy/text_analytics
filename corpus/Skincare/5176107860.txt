This is ok, but I can’t say I loved it. Firstly, I received foil samples to test and the packaging was super fiddle to use, so I was never sure I got a balanced mix (it was hard to squeeze both sides out). That aside, I found the serum fairly thin and quite stronglyScented for an eye product. I also didn’t notice any change at all after 7 days of use, good or bad. Might work for some other people but not for me to be honest. nan
