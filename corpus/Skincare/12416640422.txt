Favourite lip balm of all time, am a huge fan of the Bum Bum cream and this smells exactly like it. The two pair perfectly together after a fresh shower. If you want to smell and feel like it’s still summer you need to buy this. The larger size of the stick lends itself well to only needing one swipe to cover both lips, and your lips remain moisturized for hours. This is one of two products I have found that will last all day or night in this cold and dry Canadian winter air, and I’ve tried several luxury lip balms/masks from Sephora so that is no easy feat! I usually buy these a few at a time! Best lip balm ever.
