i didn’t understand what it did at first (i have the mini), but i realized it’s a multipurpose moisturizer in the form of a hydration stick. i use it frequently for instant cooling (rosacea, hot red skin), depuffing (after crying or late nights), massaging (it feels so good and lightweight), priming (before foundation) and of course hydrating (for dry spots on skin) under my eyes, my temple and honestly my entire face and neck! works amazing and i especially love it during summers :P multipurpose hydration stick!!
