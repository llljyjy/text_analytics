I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I normally am a big fan of exfoliating cleansers so I actually was looking forward to trying this. Sadly though, my expectations were not met with this one. The grit and exfoliation was good, but I felt like it left some sort of film behind after rinsing, as well as leaving my skin feeling a bit irritated which Ih was surprised about as my skin is definitely not sensitive in the least. Honestly, if not for that weird feeling of a film being left behind I may have continued using it, but I just couldnâ€™t get past that. nan
