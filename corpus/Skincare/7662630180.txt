I have been using this water mask since past 2 weeks and I really enjoy putting it on. It’s very lightweight formula with very subtle and pleasant fragrance.. .. I’ve been applying it every night after face oil, serum and moisturizer.I have very dry skin and I’m definitely noticing difference in my skin in the morning. My skin is softer and plumper.I feel it’s a nice addition to my skin routine. Only drawback with this product is that I don’t think it’s enough on its own for skin as dry as mine, it needs to be used with moisturizer.I received this mask as #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox Airy lightweight gel mask
