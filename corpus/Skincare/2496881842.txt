Im giving this product a rating of 4 only because of the design of the pump. The cleanser itself works beautifully, my skin is soft and supple and I can truly feel the difference after using. The pump on the other hand has a bit of design flaw, at times its hard to dispense the cleanser because its too thick for pump. Other than that flaw its a wonderful cleanser nan
