I use this serum pretty much every night. It keeps my skin hydrated and happy no matter which actives I am using. It also has a really great texture and absorbs super fast. My only issue with it is that it’s impossible to keep the bottle clean because of the design of the bottle top. It consistently has dried product that leaves a white residue even if I clean it. Even despite this design annoyance, it’s such a great product that I have repurchased it and plan to do so indefinitely. Amazing product!!!
