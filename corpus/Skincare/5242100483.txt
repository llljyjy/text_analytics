I live in the mountains & it is dry as a bone here. I was looking for something to help maintain & keep my skin looking young & healthy (not like a piece of dried mango) & after just a few weeks, both my husband & I’s skin (& breathing) is SOOOO much better. I would say that the only con is that because I live in such a dry climate, I have to refill the water tank everyday. not a big deal because it’s so easy to do though! no more dried-mango skin
