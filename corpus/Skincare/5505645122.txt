Love this product.  I received it as a sample to try.  The first few days it left my face feeling tight and I was a bit concerned.  After using it for over a week twice a day my skin feels moisturized and has a bit of a glow which I noticed the last few days.  I will definitely continue using.  I havenâ€™t noticed a difference in my deeper wrinkles but the fine lines seem to be improved. Great Serum All in One!
