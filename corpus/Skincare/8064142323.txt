I received this product for free from Influenster and Goop in exchange for my honest review. I was hesitant at first to use this everyday, but I did as directed. I used this every night but made sure to follow up with a toner. I gave it about three weeks before leaving a final review and I will say this product surprised me. I was expecting my skin to dry out since itâ€™s what exfoliating multiple times a week had done to my face in the past. My skin remained moisturized but not oily. I also noticed my acne has cleared up a bit, but not completely. The scent has a hint of citrus but reminds me of a strong bathroom cleaner but I got past that. I think this is a good product but just be a little cautious with everyday exfoliation. nan
