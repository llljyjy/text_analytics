I purchased this product after reading the ingredients list. No where did I see there are exfoliating granules. I have only used one other balm and prefer it over oils as I have oily skin. While it says exfoliating, I expected the exfoliation to be from the BHA. I decided to give it a go  and although I only use a dime sized amount twice a week, the granules proved too much for my sensitive, mature skin.  It is effective in removing dry skin flakes but it left my normal oily skin feeling dry the next day even after an overnight of hydrating ingredients. I would suggest this for only oily skin, combo skin may not like the exfoliation of the granules either. Beware of rough granules in the product
