I have been using this product morning and night for the last 3 weeks. I noticed immediately increased hydration of my skin. It became softer and smoother within 1 week. I enjoy the the texture of the serum as it isn’t sticky but occasionally it does feel a bit greasy and I am not sure if 1 of the serums dispenses a little more sometimes. My skin is very dry and this has helped tremendously. I have not noticed any changes in dark spots but I believe it takes months of use for that to happen. I took off 1 star because of the price, I love this product and it is much more convenient than buying 3 separate serums but it’s quite expensive for a single purchase. Amazing serum
