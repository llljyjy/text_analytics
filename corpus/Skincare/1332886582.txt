I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This sunscreen is great. It has a nice thin texture that’s easy to spread and has a slight tint. It is lighter than my skintone, so I was worried I’d get the dreaded white cast. But it rubs in and becomes sheer. It moisturized my dry skin nicely and didn’t cake in my fine lines. It also didn’t irritate my sensitive skin nicely, so that’s a win as well! I look forward to continuing to wear this sunscreen. #complimentary #shiseidosuncare @Influenster @Shiseido Really nice sunscreen
