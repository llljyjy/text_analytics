Not a lot of color options if you have a darker complexion. Iâ€™m fair-medium depending on the time of year and the medium is almost too light for me. Product is great if you have good skin to begin with and want some extra spf. I do this powder over my foundation for the spf in the summer. I also sometimes use this setting powder over tinted moisturizer for a no make up look. If you have acne, I could see this being cakey or creating dry patches on the skin. nan
