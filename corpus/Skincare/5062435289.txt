I recently started using this product. So far so good! I can see why it has great reviews and it rated highly! I get the occasionally monthly hormonal acne. I have used this a couple of DAYS already and I am incredibly impressed on how well it it reacting to my skin. I also have a problem area next to my temple going down about half way the face. This was the first area that I tried it on. The results were the reason I decided to use it all over my face. I canâ€™t wait to see how my skin improves as the time goes on. So far so good!
