This little Canopy humidifier has worked wonders for my skin. My apartment building is super drying because we only have built in wall A/C units since the complex was built in the 1900s or something. I recently moved in and my skin was not loving the new environment. I kept on getting breakouts no matter how much I took care with my night and morning skin routines. I’ve been using this humidifier for at least two weeks and I’ve actually noticed a positive difference in how my skin looks and feels. I keep it on my nightstand next to my bed so that my product can really soak in. I think it’s 100% worth the investment! The starter set also comes with an amazing bergamot scent and it’s such a wonderful scent. Would definitely recommend if you’re thinking of getting it. It also adds a cute pop of color, which I love since my room is mostly white + neutral themed. The best humidifier!
