Read a StyleCaster article on yahoo that included a before and after photo that convinced me to buy this product. Iâ€™m in my late 30s and have had milia on my under-eye area for as long as I can remember. Probably since I started wearing makeup in my teens. In the course of using this product over one week, the milia are gone. The area went through a phase where the milia were purging or the top layer was sloughing off. With some gentle scrubbing I am now past that phase. I do feel that the under eye area is a bit sensitive so I will reduce the frequency of use. So thankful to have the milia gone and I will be considering other products from this line. 20+ years of milia. . .gone.
