I feel like the description of the product says that it does a lot more than it really does. It smells kind of like baby shampoo. It lathers really well. It has the squeaky clean feeling like the laneige multi deep cleanser but not has much as the laneige one. It overall just feels like a gentle cleanser. I don’t feel any noticeable difference in my skin though or any pores being unclogged. I do notice that my skin is not as dry after washing as compared to the laneige one. It’s ok.
