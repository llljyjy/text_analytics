I’m in love with this product, it saved my skin! I started using a lot of K-beauty this year and this is the first Innisfree product I’ve used. I recently over exfoliated with a chemical exfoliant and my combo (normal/oily) skin became a desert. My skin was so dry, it was flaking off. I added this to my nighttime routine and in 3 weeks my skin was back to normal.  The scent is nice and light also. This serum saved my skin.
