It took my skin some time to get used to the Origins Clear Improvement Moisturizer. It feels nice on the skin, but the scent it has is a bit strong when I contrast it to the moisturizers Iâ€™ve used in the past. Although it does work well, it will not show any results within in the first few times it is used. Be patient with the product if you already have another skin care routine in place. nan
