this has been one of the best sunscreens i have tried, it does not leave white, and it is easy to apply, the best thing for me is that it is not greasy because my skin is oily and sensitive, and not all sunscreens work for me, some make my skin burn, but this NEW Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 from First Aid Beauty, is super good, it has become my favorite, I use it every day and it is very easy to reapply. I can only say that I love it.!!!! nan
