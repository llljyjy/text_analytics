This razor is high quality, the materials are heavy and solid. The blades are sharp. I’ve never used a razor like this before, especially not one meant for women. It takes some getting used to, as with other razor’s I’ve tried I’ve had to apply pressure to get a decent shave, this isn’t the case here. My legs were incredibly smooth with no pressure being added to the blades, just gentle small strokes. I didn’t have to continuously go over the same spots again, just once was more than enough. Love this. nan
