Just purchased this after I was not pleased with the old-school humidifier I bought at BB&B.  I can already tell the difference after a week!  My apartment gets so dry when the heat is on and my Canopy has made a big difference.  Whereas the old humidifier made the room damp, this makes it comfortable and clean and I haven’t woken up with a dry nose and mouth all week! The scent is also a great feature and added bonus.  Can’t wait to try more! Love It!
