I am not normally a fan of sheet masks (since they can be difficult to apply) but I enjoyed this one! Compared to other brands, it was easy to put on and stayed in place very well - it almost felt like paper mache-ing when applying. My skin felt clean and soft after use. For a sheet mask, this is definitely a good call. nan
