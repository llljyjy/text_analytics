I love all the Laneige products I have ever tried and this was no exception! I have been using the Laneige Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence twice a day for a week and I am really enjoying it. I use about 3-4 pumps and pat it directly onto my face instead of using cotton pads to be more sustainable. The essence absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave a residue. There is a light fresh scent that does not irritate my nose or skin at all. I notice that my skin feels hydrated and looks bright and glowy after just 1 week!I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and Laneige to try in exchange for my honest review. nan
