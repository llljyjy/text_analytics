After receiving this I used it for a week straight and loved it. It took all signs of fines and any texture away from around my eye area.  I loved the soft formula of this product.  Looks oily but glides on and feels powdery and absorbed quickly.  I then stopped use due to surgery then went back to use it 2 weeks later and had the worse rash I had ever seen that lasted a week. Thought it was a different product so I tried again and it was In fact this product  after using only this product.  Iâ€™m so heart broken because this works so amazing. Amazing product but had a reaction
