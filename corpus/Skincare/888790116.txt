If you’re buying it to moisture in the room so that your skin wouldn’t feel as dry, then maybe consider this purchase. I had a humidifier gauge in one of our rooms and with the humidifier running overnight, humidity is 47% vs 42% without it. So, it’s not a power humidifier by any means.More concerning, I’ve had it for 6 weeks before realizing that the filter had developed a good amount of mold in it. I’ve used it as instructed, leaving the unit on until it shuts off on its own and the filter change light never came on. I’ve since took the filter out to let it dry after the unit has turned off. I emailed the company about the mold and received a disappointing canned response with instructions on how to use the unit. No actual response to the mold in question and of concern. I left a review (although has not shown up on their site) and asked a question on their company site and crickets. Disappointing all-around. disappointed with moldy filter
