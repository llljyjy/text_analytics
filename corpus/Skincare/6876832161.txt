I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review.I really like this product and have begun to start incorporating it into my weekly face routine. I use this product during the serum phase of my weekly skin routine as opposed to my day to day one. I have combination and sensitive skin so I only go full out once a week. This product has a very light scent and is not heavy at all on the skin. It is so smooth and left my skin feeling silky and made my skin feel and appear less textured . It also was not greasy or oily at all for those who have oily skin. This product is definitely worth checking out nan
