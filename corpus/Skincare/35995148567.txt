This product is really great! It matched my skin tone perfectly and it felt light and wonderful on my skin. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just couldn’t get it to work for me. I have redness on my cheeks with a bit of rosacea. No matter what I did I couldn’t build this enough to cover it the way I would like. This is buildable but I guess not enough for me. When I got into direct sunlight, it was apparent that my cheeks were barely covered at all and it was darker around my nose and mouth. I had to return it. I absolutely didn’t want to and tried it a couple of different times with the same result. great product but just didn’t work for me
