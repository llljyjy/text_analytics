I purchased this be sure it was a Friday freebie and you just pay shipping. I am having a lot of skin issues due to meds and decided to give this a try. I have sensitive skin and never tried retinol before. I patch tested the first night then tried my entire face. My skin looks amazing and it’s only been 2 weeks. No issues with breaking out and I have combination skin. You don’t need a lot of product to see the difference. I will purchase a full size when I run out. I am dark skin with some skin discoloration and some laugh lines and issues around my. eyes. This has  helped with my acne too. It works!
