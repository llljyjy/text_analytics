This is the BEST, most gentle cleanser I’ve ever used. I finally started to slow down and weed out ingredients that were making my skin sensitive and red. I realized how many products - face washes, moisturizers, everything! - have chemical exfoliants. This product even has it printed on the bottle “no AHAs”. The thyme, aloe, and cucumber have soothed and relaxed my skin so much. I really hope this formula never changes and Sephora sells it forever (I wish it were in stores but I won’t split hairs here). Incredible product. My first review, truly an incredible product!!
