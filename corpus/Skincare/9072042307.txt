I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. If you’re looking for a toner that’ll give you that glowy and hydrated look, this is probably what looking for. I used this to do the Korean 7 skin layering method and found this was giving me little bumps because of the coconut oil. Despite this, my skin did feel hydrated and bouncy. Packaging kinda sucks too so will end up repurposing for my body. I also think there’s better toners out there that will give a similar effect for a much better price. nan
