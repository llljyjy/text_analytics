Shiseido Urban Environment oil-free mineral sunscreen is a must! Most mineral sunscreen leaves a decent film behind making it not as pleasing to wear for many reasons. It’s light, watery and smooth to spread. Has a very light subtle mineral veil to it but it’s very subtle by comparison to other products I’ve tried. It also holds up well while wearing; as with any reapplying is always important after a few hours. Great product! Does the job and looks far more appealing on your skin than others. Highly recommended!Disclaimer: product was received complimentary for reviewing purposes Good mineral sunscreen for your face
