I received the free trial size and I substituted both my day and night creams for this one. Using it twice daily, the trial size was enough to last me 4 days. The moisturizer felt good on my skin, felt like a dense formula but my skin was able to absorb it well and it didn’t get oily throughout the day. The reason for two stars is that my sensitive skin definitely reacted to this formula. It started having several breakouts starting on day 3 and I didn’t notice my skin softer or more moisturized vs. when I use my normal day and night creams. That’s the only reason I can’t recommend it. So if you have sensitive skin like mine, try gradually incorporating it into your skincare Not for me
