Absolutely love this I’ve gotten my sisters hooked on it too!! I will definitely be repurchasing once I run out which seems like never because a little bit goes a long way and there is so much product in the package. Definitely worth the money. I use it as a mask at night and then as a lip balm  when it’s cold or my lips are chapped because it works so well at hydrating them. I would definitely recommend the Original over the Gummy Bear one, my sister ended up exchanging due to the smell of the Gummy Bear one. nan
