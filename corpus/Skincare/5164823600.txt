Yeah, this works. I received it yesterday and immediately tried it out on a spot that was deep underneath the skin, you know the ones. Used it 4x in one session as per directions. Within a few hours, it was was nearly coming to a head. Used a BHA mask, extracted, treated it again with this bad boy for any inflammation and today the spot is totally flat, a little bit red but that is to be expected. It’s not a photoshop blemish erase tool so as long as you manage your expectations, this is a handy tool to have. I’m sold. nan
