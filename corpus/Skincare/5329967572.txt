At first I didn’t really like this product. It stung and left my face really dry when I used it before moisturizer. I’ve been using this as my final step in my night routine and I’m noticing a huge difference in my skin. The product doesn’t have their usually fragrance to it which I love. I just wish the bottle had a stopper on it since I’ve spilled it already once. nan
