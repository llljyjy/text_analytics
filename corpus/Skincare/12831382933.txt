The algenist toner is an exfoliate toner with 2% BHA, which is good for clarifying pores and smoother skin. I use it in my evening skin routine, after cleansing, soak cotton pad with this toner and wipe face as a second cleansing. After one week , I could see my pores become smaller and my skin looks smooth and bright. Also, it’s gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin.gifted by algenist nan
