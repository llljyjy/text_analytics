I’d give 4.5 stars if I could. I do find this product helps with redness, and it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft, but the water sleeping mask seems much more moisturizing and I prefer its gel texture over this one’s creamy feel. I find my cheeks feel sticky against my pillow using this one.However, it does noticeably tone down my red cheeks, so it’s worth feeling a little sticky. :) Really does help with redness!
