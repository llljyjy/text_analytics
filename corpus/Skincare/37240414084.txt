Vitamin C really needs to be fresh when used for best result, and after using Drunk Elephants vitamin C I looked around for what else was out there. The Clinique boosters are great because you mix them right away, and I’ve been able to use one capsule for ~2 weeks on my face and neck before seeing and significant oxidation/yellowing of the product. But for something that’s really only vitamin C and water, and at a 10% concentration, I can find more effective product at a better price. Not worth the price
