After just the first few days of using this, I noticed a difference in my dark circles in the morning. I’m looking forward to what continued use will bring and if results are cumulative (ie get better over time) then I’ll be hooked as a repeat buyer. The formula goes on velvety smooth and smells neither good nor bad. A little goes a long way- she thicc!As someone who has had dark circles from a very young age (complexion plus genetics), I have yet to find something that has given noticeable results. If short term use has me recognizing a small improvement in color and surface area of my dark circles, I’m looking forward to what prolonged use will bring. nan
