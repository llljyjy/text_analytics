Love this cleanser! The smell is pretty, it washed off a FULL face of makeup and didn’t leave a squeaky soap residue feel that other cleansers do (like Laneige and Clarins). Docked one star because of the way this dispenses. It’s bizarre and so unhygienic. I can’t stand it up otherwise the moisture in my shower might build mold in the little hole, so I have to balance it upside down. The packaging design is so dumb. Great product, though. Great cleanser, bizarre packaging.
