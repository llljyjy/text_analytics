This works better for me as a day and night moisturizer than Squalane oil, which I didnâ€™t think anything could be better! No breakouts, leaves my skin plump, soft and no more dry patches. I absolutely love it.  Even though I barely use much of it, I wish they made it in a larger container! Best face dry skin winner!!
