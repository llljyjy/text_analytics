I started using this at night after applying my retinol treatment (Kiehl’s daily microdose). It pairs really nicely with that and never irritates my sensitive skin. The texture is creamy without being heavy, and leaves my face feeling extremely hydrated. I have oily skin, and I probably couldn’t get away with wearing this in the morning, because it is pretty heavy... but at night after retinol, it’s the perfect product. Love it and will continue to buy. AMAZING STUFF!
