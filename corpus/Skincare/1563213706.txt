I was excited to receive this product! It’s mostly natural, creamy, but foams up nicely. It’s perfect after a long day at the beach, a workout, or being outside all day, especially where I live (urban). Some reviewers said the scent was too strong, but I don’t mind it. It’s fresh with floral notes.   I love using it in the evenings, completely cleans it my face, no clogged pores, and left it feeling moisturized and fresh. I applied it then used my Clarisonic for a deep clean. It  worked better than most of the cleansers I’ve used. A little goes a long way, and the tube is much larger in person. I will absolutely be purchasing this in the future! New go to!
