I loved how hydrated my skin felt after applying the serum and I am excited for the Vitamin C benefits. My only concern is that the full size packaging is exposing an active ingredient to light but I was using the travel size so I wasn’t originally concerned about that. Maybe the future release will have a protective cover packaging. It’s hydrating!
