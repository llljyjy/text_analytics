I noticed the other week that the fine lines in my face were noticeably less, I definitely think it is because of this product!!  It is very reasonably priced and I see results! The only reason for the 4 stars and not five is the packaging.  The cap does not stay closed so I do not bring this with me on travel. You have to use the dropper several times to get product out and the bottle is so dark you donâ€™t know how much product you have left.  The smell is also just OK. Helps fine lines!
