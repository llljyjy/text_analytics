This eye cream didn’t help me with one thing- circles, pigmentation, lines, dryness, anything. In fact, it made my undereyes darker and I needed to use more concealer to cover them up and spend more time on my makeup routine. The worsst part was that it made them swollen and puffy (which could have contributed to the dark shadows). I thought I had an environmental allergy until I stopped using the product and my eyes swelled down right away. The feel of the cream is super light weight, it’s almost like water. The scent is strong and I didn’t like it- it doesn’t smell like La Mer, just something else (more herbal, and I feel it gave me an allergic reaction). For any La Mer product, I recommend getting a sample or a mini size (I got mine in a Holts Beauty Bag that I purchased) as you want to make sure that it works for you before you spend that much on an item. I would honestly give it negative stars as it gave me a worse outcome. I’ve purchased numerous eye creams that all offer some benefit, even if it is just hydration and a better base for your eye makeup. Allergic
