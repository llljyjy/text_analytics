I tried this in two very sunny situations. Once while riding my horse outside on an 80° sunny day and another time while mowing the lawn on a 84° sunny day. I did not burn, it didn’t get into my eyes and sting, it stayed put through all the sweat, and it didn’t break me out! I love that it has Hyaluronic Acid in it because that is big in my skin care routine ! It passed the test!
