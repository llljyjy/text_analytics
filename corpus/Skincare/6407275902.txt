Really not trying to hate on Dr. Jart, but this one also didn’t impress. $9 for a single use mask is pretty pricey so I’d hoped the results would be worth the cost. It just, didn’t do anything and left a HORRIBLE scent that lingered forever. Am I the only one that noticed??? Anyhow, definitely opt for far more practical and economical mud/clay masks that offer many uses. This wasn’t even super easy to apply so it’s not saving you any time. Plus you still gotta rinse off the residue after so in all honesty, what’s the point of this product?! lol Gimmick
