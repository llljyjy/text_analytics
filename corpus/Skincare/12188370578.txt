Overall really liked this product. I have had troubles with retinol drying out my face before but this one has a touch of mineral oil so it keeps it more moisturized. It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so nice with the added bonus of preventing fine lines!! If you are new to retinols, this is a good first one Great retinol
