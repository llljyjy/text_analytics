I really wanted to enjoy using this but I can’t say that I did. I liked the serum well enough in it’s usage, but there was nothing to love about it. My skin did feel soft after using it, but aside from that one aspect, I haven’t noticed any other results. Because of the cost, and the meh results, I won’t be investing in this product for daily usage. Okay...but that's it.
