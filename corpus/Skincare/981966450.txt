I haven’t had any peeling, as I followed the suggested instructions. This product should NOT be used with water based products such moisturizers and serums. It’s suggested that you use an oil based moisturizer if extra hydration is desired. To apply do NOT rub the product in your hands or on your face. Instead I find dipping my fingers in product and swiping in a paintbrush stroke motion works well and doesn’t cause pilling. Rubbing the product in a circular motion in hands or on face will cause it to become grainy. I like that this one product replaces three; and there’s no white cast on my dark African American skin. This product is extremely expensive for the amount you get, so I gave it 4 stars. Please Read Instructions for Use
