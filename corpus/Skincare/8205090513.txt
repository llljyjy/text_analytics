really wanted this to work. i have dry/combo skin with hormonal acne. my bottle is almost empty and i’ve been super consistent with this product, applying every night. didn’t really do anything to reduce my acne scars. if you’re looking to target hyperpigmentation/scarring with this product, i’d say spend your money on something else.
