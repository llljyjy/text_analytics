I bought the unseen and glow screens during the spring sale. I thought I would prefer the unseen version as something to wear under my other foundations and moisturizers, but the glow screen is perfect as is and is my new go to! This with some finishing powder is perect for me. It is also worth noting that the two feel completely different. The unseen sunscreen feels thicker and more oily, but the glow screen has a more silky feel to it. nan
