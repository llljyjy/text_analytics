I have been using this product for several weeks and I plan to continue using it in my routine. For reference, I am in my early 30’s, showing some fine lines around my eyes, and because I’m very fair-skinned with hereditary dark circles, I was really excited to try this. The texture is gel-like but not sticky, and it absorbs into the skin well. I noticed after a few days of use that my eye area seems more plump and I look less tired. It’s not a miracle for dark circles, but mine are pretty dark and it did seem to lighten them slightly. I like that the fragrance is minimal and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. While it’s not a cure for my lines and dark circles, it  does make me feel like I can get away with less under eye concealer. Great for early signs of aging!
