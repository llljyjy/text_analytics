It makes my skin looks radiant and smooth, but it did have me a few pimples. I stop using it that often because of the pimples in the areas of my face that are oily, I guess it happens because I have mixed skin type. I wouldnâ€™t buy it for me but maybe for someone with dry skin type; I kept it because I got it as a complementary gift from influenster. Smooth and Youthful Skin
