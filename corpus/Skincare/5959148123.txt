I received this product for free for my honest review from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury. My first impressions of this serum is that the packaging is very pretty. The bottle is glass so that’s always a plus when it comes to serums and oils. The dropper has a rubber top that makes it easy to obtain and eject the product. The consistency of the serum is a bit milky in color and a little thicker than just an oil or liquid. It moves slowly through your fingers if that helps. It does have a smell but not a bad or fragrance like smell, I can’t really describe it. Overall, I’ve been using this product morning and night and haven’t seen too much of a difference. I have noticed that my complexion just looks refreshed and awake when I do wake up after putting it on at night. I will continue to use. Luxurious feeling serum
