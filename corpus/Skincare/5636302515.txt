I love this cleanser a lot! I have sensitive and dry skin, and this cleanser gave me no irritation whatsoever and left my face feeling smooth and refreshed. I liked the white consistency of the cleanser and how it foamed when you used it. I found the scent of it to be pleasant and mild. I use it at nighttime since the cleanser also removes makeup. I normally use drug store makeup removers and cleansers; however, I do see myself repurchasing this cleanser instead. I like Dior makeup products a lot, and this cleanser performed even better than expected. Although Dior products can be pricey, they noticeably are higher quality than other comparable options. Would definitely recommend! nan
