I was beyond thrilled to receive this complimentary gift from Laneige. It’s the first I’ve ever gotten from them and I really love it. I enjoyed everything from the texture, to the nice moisturized feeling it gives my skin, even to the packaging. It was nicely put together just as well as the product. I loved that this is a cream moisturizer because it’s not heavy at all, but yet it provides great hydration. Great product!
