This sunscreen really is a hit for me! I experience none of the issues I’ve had with previous sunscreens. No pilling, no white cast, no oily residue, it doesn’t sting my eyes, no unpleasant smell. It ticks all of the boxes of what I have been wishing for when it comes to sunscreen. Sinks in so quick and easy, I could put it on without a mirror, that’s how much I trust it. I am just in awe at its performance and I can’t. I will be purchasing my next bottle with my own money that’s how good this is. nan
