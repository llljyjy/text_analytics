after going to college my skin totally changed idk if it was a different climate, drinking or working out more but i got a trial size to fix my uneven skin texture on my forehead. instantly my skin appeared smoother, the bumps went away and my pores were practically invisible. the effects are long lasting iâ€™ve been using this product for a little over a week however not everyday. my skin had completely cleared and looks better than it did before i left for college. worth every penny seriously buy this if you specifically struggle with uneven texture, large pores or breakouts on the skin.
