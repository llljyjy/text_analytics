A staple!! I’ve been using this toner for years — I’ve tried other toners a long the way but I always come back to this as its very effective in hydrating your skin and its a great value for its price. I have very dry and sensitive skin (and sometimes get eczema on my face). I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin and feels very hydrating. Great Value and Good for Eczema prone skin!!
