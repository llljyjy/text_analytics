This is a very nice glow spf and does not leave a white cast. I found it to be hydrating and improves overall look of my skin with extended use. I normally hate spf as it tends to leave a white flashback but this did not. If you don’t like strong smells might not be for you but seems to be similar to my other spf’s. Excellent
