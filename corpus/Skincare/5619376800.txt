This cream is so good just like any Lancôme product I’ve tried. I have oily skin so I’m always concerned about the greasiness of my creams. This one melts into the skin just fine and it doesn’t feel greasy/heavy at all. You apply it and leave it overnight to wake up to an amazingly moisturized skin. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and the difference on my skin appearance is well noticeable. Highly recommended Amazing results
