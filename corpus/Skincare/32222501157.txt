I really like how this sunscreen feels on my face, it’s hydrating, smells good and doesn’t leave my face looking oily or white. I took a star away because I’m paying 15 dollars for this so I would expect it to be more full. For that reason I might not but it again but it is a really great sunscreen :/ nan
