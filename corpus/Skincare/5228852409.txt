I love everything about this sunless tanner. It applies super easily and smells amazing. I love that I donâ€™t need to worry about the product staining my hands like most tanners do and this also left my skin feeling super smooth and soft. I applied daily for about a week and noticed a very nice and subtle/natural looking tan that was pretty effortless. Smells amazing!
