It took a bit of trial and error for me to get the perfect application for my skin - I was initially mixing it in to my protini moisturizer but that didn’t seem to absorb correctly into my skin and left it feeling a bit oily (I have combo skin). Then I tried 3 drops before my moisturizer and that also was a bit too much for my liking, so I downed it to 2 drops before moisturizer and that’s seemed to be the perfect amount. My skin would look glowy in ther morning as I would only put this on at night. I did have some breakouts while using this, but obviously retinol does this so it was expected. After continued use, I didn’t get any breakouts from this (only the occasional hormonal breakout). I would say I have sensitive skin and some products don’t work for me but I think this one is a great segway into retinol products since it’s “gentle” and mixed with an oil. Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with the product and likely will purchase after I finish this bottle as I love Drunk Elephant products to begin with. Gentle and glowy
