I love this brand……but after 3 weeks i still don’t see any changes.  2 years ago I got Bells Palsy in the left side of my face.  Most of the movement come back but left my cheek with wrinkles when I smile,  not the normal type either.  I was hoping this would fix the problem.  They aren’t deep lines either.  I’m going to continue using this product hoping I see results! nan
