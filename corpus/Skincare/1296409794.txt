Dr Dennis Gross products never disappoint me. I have some dark spots right under my eye and I’ve been searching for vitamin C eye cream that will lighten that up but also help my skin in that area look more radiant. And this has delivered, it absorbs 100% so you don’t get a greasy feel. Which means you can wear this under make up! so far I am very pleased with this product! I love the fact that this is a combination of vitamin C and lactic acid which are two amazing skin care products you can use alone but combine together I am really excited to see the final result after I use the bottle up. If you have tried vitamin C and it helps with the dark spots under your eyes but they’re not gone yet give this one a try for sure! It’s been a few days but I can already see the spot lightening. Amazing combination of lactic acid and vitamin C
