I bought this during the 50% off deal. I have dry/combination skin and it was way too light for me. I used it at night after my serum and woke up with tight and dry feeling skin. Also, it pilled terribly. I love all the other products by this line. Sadly, this did not work for me. Lightweight and pilling
