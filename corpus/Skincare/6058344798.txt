For a 9% salicylic acid this product is extremely gentle! Doesn’t dry out my skin but rather gently exfoliates it little by little. It helps me clear my skin of blemishes and blackheads and even out my skin tone overall. I don’t use it more often than 3 times a week, though, and I don’t have very sensitive skin. The product doesn’t really have any smell, and the texture is very gel-like, a little sticky. It makes my skin soft and  velvet-like when I touch it in the morning. nan
