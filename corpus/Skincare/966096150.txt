I received this product free from Influenster for purposes of a review. This hydrating oil free gel moisturizer is very different from my usual moisturizer.  Overall I like it and found it to layer well with makeup.  It does take a bit of time to absorb into my skin. I use it with the same brandâ€™s eye cream and together they work well.  There is no noticeable fragrance from this product and I have not had any negative reactions to it. It does a decent job at keeping my skin hydrated through the day. They one thing missing from it is SPF protection. I personally prefer to use a daily moisturizer that includes a SPF 30 ingredient, preferably a mineral based one. Light gel moisturizer
