I liked this stuff a lot! It’s more like just an exfoliator than a cleanser because you can’t use it to take your eye makeup off but it made my skin feel soft. It’s not sugar crystals so they don’t dissolve in 2 seconds. It smells pretty good. Like oranges kinda. Maybe like an orange rind. Overall I really like it and would recommend it as an exfoliator. I received this free for testing purposes. Great exfoliator!
