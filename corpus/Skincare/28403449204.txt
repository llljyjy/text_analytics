I got this complimentary from Habit in exchange for my honest review.I have been wanting to try this spf mist for a while now and was super excited when I got it. Here are my thoughts:What I liked:1. It is easy to apply and reapply through out the day. If you have kids who shy away from rubbing spf on their face, this will be a god send.2. It is easy to carry in your bag.3. It is broad spectrum and SPF 41 4. It is cruelty free and free of synthetic fragrances5. Leaves a beautiful glowy finish.6. it is priced at $30 for 0.9fl oz which I felt is a fair price.What I didn’t like:1. It has a bunch of essential oils which give it a strong fragrance and because I have sensitive skin, I try to stay away from fragrances and essential oils. I hope Habit considers making the same formula without essential oils in the future.Overall, I like this spf and would recommend trying it if your skin doesn’t react negatively to essential oils. For me, I will use it for reapplication once in a while, but mostly use it for my kids who don’t like rubbing sunscreen on their face but think mists are cool.. SPF Reapplication made easy
