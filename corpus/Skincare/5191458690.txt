At first I really liked this product because of how soft and moisturized my skin felt after cleansing! Iâ€™ve used this for about two weeks and I can say confidently this doesnâ€™t remove makeup well! After two double cleanses I would still find makeup on my cotton pad with toner on it. It broke my skin out pretty bad too. Definitely wonâ€™t be using anymore. First itâ€™s sweet, than itâ€™s sour ðŸ˜‚
