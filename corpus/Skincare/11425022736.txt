This moisturizer is awesome. I was a little skeptical about this product but it turned out to be amazing. I have combination skin and my concerns were it’ll make my face look ashy because I gave a deeper complexion. It actually helped the oil stay at bay. I recommend this to anyone. Great texture Great it..you’ll love it
