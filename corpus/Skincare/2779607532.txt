I love this! It’s a great refresher spray and it feels amazing when you put it in the refrigerator and use it when it cool. It’s not a make up fresher, as it would make your make up move around. But if your doing a light BB Cream n powder or bare face it’s great. I wouldn’t recommend for oily skin nan
