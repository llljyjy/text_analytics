I definitely think this is a super easy and quick way to chemically exfoliate. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin either. I do make sure to only use this about every week and a half to make sure my skin doesn’t end up irritated because this is a stronger formulation. I think the price point is perfect seeing as this will last me a long while! It doesn’t dry my skin out and helps to make it super soft. Its helped to slowly start to lighten up some pih as well. Great product and I would absolutely recommend. Great product
