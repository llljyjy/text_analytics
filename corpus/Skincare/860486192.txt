At 48, I still have oily skin most of my face. And most of the time, I avoid anything that has the name “cream“ in it (unless it is “gel cream“). But I had to give it a try given its over 2k glowing reviews.  I only used it at night time after washing and applying serum (usually a retinol) and then this. I love the scent. It’s very delicate and makes me feel pretty (not sure how to describe that?). And to my surprise, it does not feel greasy at all. It actually feels quite refreshing on the skin. A little bit goes a long way. The only complain I have is that it does feel a bit sticky afterwards. But as long as I don’t touch my face (and I shouldn’t have), I’m okay with it. Overall, I love it and will continue to use it. Amazing
