Bought the starter set to see how the products perform since I actually like the brand’s positioning around being no frills products. Cleanser: definitely a unique texture. Didn’t suds up and cleansed pretty well. Skin felt a little tight afterwards so a little detergent based. Serum: overall a solid hydrating/plumping serum. I went through this the quickest out of all of the products in the set. Moisturizer: I did not get to use this one much. Read the ingredients and found out that there’s coconut oil in the formula (skin is pretty reactive to coconut oil). Pretty much stopped using it after that because the cream does like to sit on top of the skin. Overall — not bad but not great! Didn’t excite me
