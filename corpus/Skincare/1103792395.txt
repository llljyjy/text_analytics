I received this brush in a gratis box in exchange for my honest review. It’s been several years since I moved on from using a cleansing brush for my face as I found them to be a bit too aggressive on my skin. In all honesty when I saw this product in the box, I didn’t immediately realize it was for facial cleansing. The silicone nubs made me assume it was to be paired with the salt hair scrub that was also included.That said, I think it works alright, but I do have a few caveats. With the way the silicone bristles are packed, you really need to use some kind of disinfecting product for it to stay clean in the long term. It also isn’t the best if you like to use a looser cleanser like an oil cleanse or drippy liquid soap; it’s much better suited to thicker, creamier products that you can lay on the brush head or apply to your face first. In all, it’s not something I would reach for, nor would I purchase it again. nan
