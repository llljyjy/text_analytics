This cream is thick and creamy but weightless once rubbed in. I liked that it had no scent as fragrance near my eyes causes a tear reaction.  I definitely feel like it refreshes my eye area, which is perfect first thing in the morning and at bedtime.  Even after just 1 week I feel like it has smoothed out some of the fine lines in the eye area. Refreshing
