The Clarins Double serum sample that I received was very easy to open mix and apply.  I loved the feeling of the serum and hope that after a week of use I will notice a difference on face.  This is a product that I would want to see how it actually comes packaged as the only downside to the seven day sample is it was a hard to make sure all of the product came out of the package for each use. I will be buying this in the future thanks for the sample #butterly Easy to use wonderful product
