Make sure to follow the directions for all 3 serums to come out. It did take a couple pumps for me to get all three of them out. I have been using this for a month, morning and night. I have severe scarring and dark spots from acne. I didn’t expect any miracles as my skin is so bad, but to say that I see an improvement is a big win for me!! The after pic is showing a light bib cream and blush for coverage. I usually have to use heavy foundation to cover the uneven tone. I’m feeling a little more confident without foundation. This serum has a thick consistency, it moisturizes and hydrates amazing! I followed with Pond’s Dark spot cream. I will be implementing this into my skin care routine. It is worth the price! Adding to my routine.
