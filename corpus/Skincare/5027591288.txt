[gifted serum] I was gifted the serum and when I’m sent a product for a review I’m pretty thorough on using it day and night. After ~2 weeks and I can’t say I’m blown away. Does the bi-phase serum allow for a solid amount of hydration, sure. Does it measure up to the hydration I get from say other reputable brand HA serums, no. Also, I feel 2% niacinamide isn’t effective enough for my skin. I love a good 5 or 10% serum, so the ones from Paual’s Choice, Maelove or a large number of Korean brands give me better results in terms of hyperpigmentation in the short and long run. Overall is the serum terrible, absolutely not! In fact, it’s a nice hydrating, gentle serum. I just think there are better options out there for the price point. Decent, but really doesn't knock my socks off
