I have tried so many diy acne treatments because I didn’t have the money for expensive skincare products. I’m very happy at the results but my face has not cleared everything up because of lack of remembering to use it. Oily texture but no burning or itching, it soaks in very fast and I haven’t used half the bottle yet and it’s working well. :) impressive
