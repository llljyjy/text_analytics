I wanted to love this product after reading so many high reviews. Unfortunately, it is sticky upon appliance and has a heavy lemon scent. I used it one time and it has caused several bumps on my skin even on my forehead where I rarely ever have a breakout. It has been a week since Iâ€™ve used it and I am still dealing with a very weird texture on my skin + minor breakouts. I have combination skin and a decent tolerance to products with retinol or acids but this was not it for me. Avoid
