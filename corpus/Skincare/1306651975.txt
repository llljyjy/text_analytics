I got a sample size of this product to review, and while it’s not my favourite, it’s pretty good. I’m generally not a fan of the gel water moisturizers, but this definitely feels nicer than other gel ones I’ve used. It immediately dried on my face without drying my face, and doesn’t have a strong scent or oily lingering residue (on my face or fingers). nan
