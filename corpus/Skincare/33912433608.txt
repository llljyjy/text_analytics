I received a free sample from Pinchme in exchange for my honest review. I usually don’t use eye cream. I did however use this. I did notice how nice it feels after applying. It does help with puffiness. I’m not sure that I would purchase it, it’s a bit pricey. I would recommend if you’re willing to pay. Algenist Triple Eye Algae Balm
