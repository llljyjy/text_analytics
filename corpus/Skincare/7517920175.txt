I received this serum as a free sample to try for 7 days in exchange for my honest opinion it. At first I was intrigued by the idea of combining the two, however it’s a simple process and easy to navigate. It felt like silky satin in my hands and went on my face super smooth and easily. It had a noticeable scent however I don’t mind scents so it did not bother me. After using continuously for 7 days I do see a positive improvement in smoothness and firmness of my skin as well as elasticity. I would be very interested to see how my skin would react after continuous usage however at it’s price point I’m not sure if that will be possible. I did really like it & would definitely recommend it. nan
