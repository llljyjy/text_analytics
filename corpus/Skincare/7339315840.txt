I love this starter set and how easy it is to make a routine out of it. I love that it is vegan and cruelty free as thatâ€™s important to me. The products are very hydrating & lightweight on the skin. The cleanser worked well enough to remove my make up with 2 washes. It is hydrating however I need some more hydration as I have very dry skin esp during the winter. I would prefer to use these for the summer. Lightweight and Hydrating
