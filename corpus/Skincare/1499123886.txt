It’s a glowy finish, like you just had a facial. I put it on when I feel my skin looks good today and I want to accentuate it (I have lots of sunscreens to choose from.) The normal tinted sunscreen has more coverage but less glowy (sometimes it has a sheen but not the glowy facial finish). The coverage is a beigey pinky touch. Very natural. Probably won’t work for darker skin tones but I don’t know. nan
