I wasn’t sure what to expect from this exfoliant since I haven’t used anything similar. I’m so glad that Dermalogica sent me this to try out. It’s very simple to use but so effective. It only uses a small amount of powder, which I just mix with water in my hand. It feels smooth to the skin, not harsh or abrasive at all. I love that it washes away quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or stripped. I surprisingly noticed a difference in the redness of my skin within days. I have pretty good skin already, but have suffering with some redness. My skin looks much calmer, smoother and healthier. I’m very impressed. #giftedbydermalogica Such a gentle, calming exfoliant
