I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It feels so good on my skin and my skin feels so soft.  The ingredients are natural and clean including hyaluronic acid. The smell is amazing. It helps my skin with moisturizing especially during summer.  Main idea behind this moisturizer is to reverse, restore and defends.  Iâ€™ve been putting this on my skin morning and night. It really feels great. Amazing
