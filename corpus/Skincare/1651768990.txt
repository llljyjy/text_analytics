This product has helped a lot with my wrinkles on my forehead in the past month. They are not totally gone but they have decreased in the size and are less noticeable. The packaging is attractive and comes in a mess free tube with an applicator tip. This is a cream that is lightweight and doesnâ€™t clog my pores. Very happy with the product. The only thing is, I wish a little went a long way but you need quite a bit to cover the entire face. I feel that this product would be good for more sensitive faces as well, because the scent is light. It has a very, very mild floral scent. I received this for free for testing purposes and I am glad for that! #freeproduct A daily wrinkle fighter!
