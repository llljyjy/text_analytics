This is the only product that has made a difference on my skin. Surprisingly I don’t get break outs as much anymore or at all. My acne goes away super fast like in 3 days vs before where it would take 2 weeks for a pimple to finally go down. My hyperpigmentation is finally starting to fade, and my skin feels so smooth in the morning. All I do is wash my face, put this on, and a moisturizer and my skin doesn’t get irritated by it. It does smell but that goes away after you rub it in, nothing unbearable. Love it!
