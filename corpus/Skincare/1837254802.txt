I use this once a week with daily use of retinol serum. The formula is pretty strong which is why it stings and tingles when you first put it on. It does cause some itchiness but it goes away after applying moisturizer. Not totally how I feel about this product but my skin does look pretty amazing after using it. Use 1-2 times a week only
