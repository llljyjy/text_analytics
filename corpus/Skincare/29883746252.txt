I was very excited to receive this #freeproduct. I easily incorporated it into my daily skincare routine. Very large bottle although I found 2 pumps was the perfect amount for me. I would recommend using a cotton swap to apply. I liked how it applied so easily and didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. My skin feels hydrated and im excited to continue to use this product to see further results. Loved it!
