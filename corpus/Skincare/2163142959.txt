This eye cream didn’t do much for me except moisturize, didn’t make a difference in lines or dark circles, so for at this price point, wouldn’t be worth it. However, it was extremely moisturizing, it’s a nice medium thickness and a little goes a very long way. I could see myself reaching for those at season change but it will not be a staple in my cabinet. Could leave it
