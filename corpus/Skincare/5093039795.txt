I love this gel cream. A little goes a long way, when I first started this it made me break out but thats because I was using to much. I started to use less about 1-2 pumps and my skin has never felt better. it leaves my skin soft and hydrated. The smell is a little weird (slight yeast smell) but not too strong. a little is all you need
