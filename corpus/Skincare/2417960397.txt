I love how it has two separate forum ales that are mixed perfectly with each pump. I love the bottles elegant design and especially love how it doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or super oily after applying. It is a higher end product that’s available at places like Sephora. I would recommend trying this serum for truly ageless skin! Ok, where has this been.
