At one of the Sephora stores, the skincare advisor recommended me this product. Being honest It looks pleasant on my lips and gives nourishment too, but i have to reapply as it dries pretty normal. I was expecting more, As she told me much more about this. If you’re person applies lip balm so often, SURE! go for it. Nice, but doesn’t stay longer
