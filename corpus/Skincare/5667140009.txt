I liked that this unscented cleanser was very gentle and didn’t leave my face feeling tight and dried out. That being said, I didn’t find the cleansing power effective enough for my skin type, and ended up getting small clusters of acne. Probably a good product for combination-dry skin, but less effective for those with blemish-prone skin. It might work well in conjunction with a good spot-treatment or weekly purifying mask.
