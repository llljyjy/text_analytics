I really love how this serum feels. It’s very light weight. Absorbs so quickly with no sticky or greasy feeling after application. I can’t feel any heaviness on my face. I love that the texture is almost gel like. It feels hydrating and refreshing to apply. The scent is nice, Not over bearing kind of earthy. The packaging is also really pretty.  This serum makes my skin plump and rejuvenated. Absorbs so nice! Lightweight, and plumps skin.
