The packaging is absolutely gorgeous & both feels and looks luscious. The cream is extremely thick and a little goes a very long way. I like that it has sunscreen it in, however you do smell it just a big. Thankfully it doesnâ€™t leave that white cast like similar products with sunscreen in them. Thick and luscious!
