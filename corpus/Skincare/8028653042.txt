I wouldn’t have thought to buy a product like this in the past, but I received a small tester with an order and figured I’d give it a try. I’ve had fine lines develop on my forehead in the last year or so that I had all but given up hope of getting rid of completely. After one night of using this mask, which I applied after my night cream, the fine lines were virtually gone! It also didn’t cause me to breakout, which was a concern for me with products like this. I don’t think I could give this product up now that I’ve tried it! Incredible difference for my skin!
