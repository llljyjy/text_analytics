I’ve used this product for probably at least two years now. It’s the first and only Vitamin C serum I’ve used. I am actually restocking today, so I read reviews for other products to see if there’s something I’m missing, but nothing else seems worth trying. In the first couple of weeks of consistent use, I definitely noticed an improvement - my dark spots faded fairly quickly and my skin was definitely brighter. I remember actually being somewhat surprised. I only use one pump daily and the bottle lasts me 5-6 months. I’ve never had problems with the formula oxidizing or anything else mentioned in other reviews, so I hope it hasn’t changed since April. To this day, I can’t find a dark spot on my face and my skin always looks healthy and bright. I’ll keep coming back! I get the results I came for!
