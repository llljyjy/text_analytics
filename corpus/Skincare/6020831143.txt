I received this for free through Influenster and I loveeeee it. Would I buy it again for $60? Not sure just because of the price. If you have that kinda money though, this is definitely a good product. Super thick so a little goes a long way. Also I have sensitive skin so it has been nice to not have to worry that my moisturizer is going to cause me to break out somehow. In sum, great product, I just donâ€™t know if I will be able to sustain buying a $60 moisturizer every few months. Quality Sensitive Skin Product (but not cheap)
