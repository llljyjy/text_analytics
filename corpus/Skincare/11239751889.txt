Starting off the packaging of this product is so luxe and feels super rich. It seemed to boost my skin hydration, but I did find that it felt a bit sticky. It also has a super strong citrus scent, if you can’t handle such strong scents this won’t work for you. Personally, I don’t love the scent and I find it hard to use because of that. nan
