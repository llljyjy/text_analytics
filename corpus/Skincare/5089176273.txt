I received this complimentary through Influenster, and I am a former employee at Sephora… With that said I have tried a lot of retinols and many don’t play nice with my skin. I am not super sensitive but I am prone to dryness in the winter months and this has been wonderful. I’ve been using it for months to make sure I have seen full effects and I definitely have. I have seen an improvement in my skins texture and overall radiance, and surprisingly to me it helped a lot with my breakouts! Cant recommend this enough! Great for winter
