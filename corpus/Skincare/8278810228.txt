I’m new to retinol products and I’m in love with this so far! I’m 30, have moderate texture and fine lines. I’ve used this once a week for two weeks now and can already see a big difference in texture. I use the sandwich method of applying the serum in between layers of moisturizer, and put a layer of Vaseline as a last step to lock in moisture. I feel like this method will keep away irritation or flakiness as my skin gets use to retinol. For the price, you can’t beat this serum! It’s Awesome!
