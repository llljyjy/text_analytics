I like this product. I like another brand better but this thick cream like consistency is nice for winter weather and seems to hydrate slightly better. Other reviewers mentioned a warming or burning sensation but I did not experience that at all. Nice vitamin c serum but the thickness makes me feel like I use more of it and it doesnâ€™t last as long as my other brands. nan
