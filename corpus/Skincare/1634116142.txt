I’ve been using this serum for a month and it is by far my favorite serum of all time. I got it for Xmas as it’s generally out of my price range but I’m not sure if I can live without it. It leaves my skin glowing and radiant. I’ve tried a million serums but this one is just way more lux than anything else I’ve used. I take very good care of my skin so I was surprised to see such a difference with this product. My pores are less visible and I love the dewy look I get when I use it before make up application. I also purchased the Kansa wand and it works really well in conjunction with this serum. The packaging is very luxurious. Highly recommend! holy grail
