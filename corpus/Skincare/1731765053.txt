Over the last few months I’ve tried out some lower-cost moisturizers (Inkey List, Cerave). But nothing compares to this beauty, I’m now hooked. I’m not typically a fan of products in a pot because of potential bacteria building up, but this one comes with a little spoon to scoop it out, (but I would still prefer it in a pump bottle). It feels silky smooth when applying. My skin has been dryer than usual with our Canadian winter this year and this has kept my skin hydrated and plump. I haven’t been wearing foundation or concealer so I can’t speak to how it performs under full-face makeup, but on its own it’s lovely. A new staple for me!
