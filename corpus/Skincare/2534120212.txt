This stings the eyes. It is also tacky and a bit greasy. It never fully absorbs into the skin. Korean sunscreens like Isn Tree are superior. For reference-  I like Supergoop Unseen—although that one stings a little— Mattescreen is great. Glowscreen stings just like this one. Finally, even if you don’t have sensitive eyes like I do, the gimmicky packaging is going to make it very difficult to use the last bit of product. It’s a rigid plastic with not much give. stings eyes
