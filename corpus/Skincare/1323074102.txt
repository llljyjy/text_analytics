Does what it says it will do. I have rosacea and almost always have redness going on. This doesn’t totally fix the issue, but I do notice I wake up with calmer skin and less irritation/redness. It also dries pretty quickly so I don’t have to worry about sleeping on it and getting it everywhere. If you have rosacea, give this product line a try. I’ve had good results from most of the Dr. Jart cicapair products. nan
