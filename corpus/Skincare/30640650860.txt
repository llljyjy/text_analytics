I love how convenient this product is!! I use it throughout the day to reapply spf without disrupting my makeup. It has a strong floral smell, but I only smell it when I’m spraying it, not when it’s been on my face. I would be wary of this if you have oily skin, since it does leave a lowly finish. nan
