I’ve been using this eyecream for about 2 weeks now...It has an almost gluey-texture but quite spreadable around my eyes.I used it both AM and PM, noticing that my normal puffy eyes look better when I turn my camera on for meetings...especially before bedtime, some massage around my brow bone & under eyes can really give a “lift“ feeling for my eyes.Kiehl’s midnight recovery eye cream used to be my favorite, now I think this is even better! Works for AM puffy eyes!
