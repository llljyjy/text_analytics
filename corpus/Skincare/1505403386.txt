Mixed feelings about this product, partly due to packaging. Texture is a mid-weight lotion and feels hydrating. It’s not too thick or heavy which I prefer and absorbs into the skin nicely. First downside is I don’t know that I see major results for anti-again as I have textured skin under my eyes. Second, I started using this product at the same time as the double serum and I have to constantly pump the top to get product out to where it feels like I’m running out. Not sure if the product is towards bottom or it’s packaging defect? But this is expensive product to be running out this quickly/not seeing major results so unlikely that I’d purchase. Feels nice but results?
