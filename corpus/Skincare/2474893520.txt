This eye cream has a nice, thick texture to it. My undereye area definitely felt more hydrated after using this which always makes me feel more refreshed. I didnâ€™t notice any results with this necessarily, but from my experience that is true of any eye cream that does not have retinol in it. While it feels nice on the skin, I think you can achieve that at a lower price point (like at about half the cost). Feels Nice and Hydrating But Overpriced
