ROBYN FENTY HAS DONE IT AGAIN! I absolutely adore this product. I love how much thicker it is than toners that I’ve used in the past. I don’t particularly like using cotton pads on my face and this was the perfect consistency to apply by hand. It left my face feeling firm and fresh, I even feel like I had a slight glow afterwards. Not even mad Rihanna isn’t in the studio as long as she keeps giving us the best of the best. RIHANNA?!
