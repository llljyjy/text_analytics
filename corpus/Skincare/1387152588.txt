I tend to have redness in the T-zone but there are days when you just don’t need a full face of makeup. This product matches your color tone, smooths it out and gives it a natural glow that is downright amazing. I’ve basically stopped wearing classic makeup and use this daily. It feels light going one and lasts all day. Other than the very slight menthol smell when you first apply, which dissipates quickly, I love this product . Great makeup substitute!
