I love the other Ilia complexion products, so Iâ€™m sad to say this was a huge miss for me. This product pilled up on my face no matter what - I tried with and without skincare underneath and got this same result. I also tried patting into my skin instead of rubbing it in, but I needed to use a lot of product in order to do so, and even then got similar results. Not a fan of this formula. Pilling was an issue
