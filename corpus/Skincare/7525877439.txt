In general this product deserves 5 stars, although I received an exaggeratedly small amount to test, which in reality was only enough for 3 applications, from the first one I noticed its effects, my skin is super dry and when I applied this cream it was as if a absorbent cotton absorbed water, I noticed almost immediately my skin more moisturized, I definitely recommend for dry skin. Perfect for dry skin
