Wow! First off, for someone that is transitioning from oily skin to combination, yet sensitive skin, this is very hydrating. Not only that, it is affordable if you are looking for a serum that is not so overly expensive. I definitely recommend because the quality is great on my skin. I apply this after moisturizing my face at night because my skin has been real dry from the winter weather! Phenomenal Serum
