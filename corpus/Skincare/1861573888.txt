I had high hopes for this product. It’s not terrible. The purpose of it is still great but this is def not like their super serum. This was thin like, watery, not much coverage so def more on the skin care side my thing was that doesn’t really dry down and I have dry AF skin. This is VERY sheer— so I tried putting makeup over it but piling occurred. I used it on its own with the Kosas powder to help set and then it looked like my skin but better BUT the color was too dark for me (undertone was off- used tone 2) and tone 1 would be too light. (I’m 9.5 in their super serum, which I LOVE btw) unfortunately it had to go back- if more shades are introduced in the future I might give it a go again for days I just want a little tint with skin care benefits. Not a bad product but it’s def not makeup, if you get this expecting such then you’ll be disappointed. If you want some spf with skin care benefits this might work for you. Hoping Ilia brings more tones soon! Mixed Feelings
