This is the worst smelling skincare product I have ever trued, and I have a quite a few. It smells like household cleaner and is so pungent I don’t care if it works well or not. I’m never letting it touch my face again. I’m really disappointed since I adore my Huda makeup and I really wanted to love her skincare as well since it’s all cruelty-free (a must for me) but I disliked this product so much I’m going to stick to the makeup only. nan
