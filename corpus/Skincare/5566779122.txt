I was so excited to try this-especially because of the fun color. Turns out it’s a very sheer pale color! Very off throwing. It’s def a moisturizing cleanser but it does not remove my Makeup all the way. Regardless I always double cleanse if I wear makeup, but normally my first step will remove all my makeup! This leaves so much eye Makeup behind. Also I don’t like how once you add water, it barely lathers. It 5% lathers out of a 100%. doesn’t remove makeup & pale color
