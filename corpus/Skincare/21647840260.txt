I love the way my skin feels after using this product. I am 41 years old with very oily, bumpy textured skin on my face but since using Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer, my face feels smoother and more youthful. I like the light floral fragrance this cream has. It is not too thick or thin. I use it morning and night and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling or looking oily. I have nothing bad to say about this product. I’m loving my soft and youthful feeling skin!
