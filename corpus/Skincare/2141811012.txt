I have been using this product for about 2 weeks or so and wow!! This makes my skin look so bright and it even glows a little. There is a silvery tint to the balm which is what I think helps the skin appear to glow! There are no harsh odors from the balm and it really does make my skin feel cool! This product literally does what itâ€™s suppose to. It cools the skin, brightens it and makes it appear to be glowing. The product goes on easily and does not feel oily or too thick on the skin. Definitely a must have skin care product!! I have no complaints for this product!! Everyone needs this!!
