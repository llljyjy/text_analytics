The scent of botanical flowers in this mist is lovely. As the product makes contact with the skin, the skin feels cool and refreshing. I like this mist is an SPF product that I donâ€™t have to rub on my skin. I also like itgoes well over makeup. But as a mist, some of it gets lost in the application. The product is easy to use and small enough to fit in my purse. I can apply it when needed. The formulation is clean and that is important to me. I like that it protects my skin. Everyday SPF Mist
