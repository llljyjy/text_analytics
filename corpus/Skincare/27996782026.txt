i typically love yttp products & some of their latest launches have been really great. however in my opinion, the future cream is a dud. i love the texture, it’s lightweight but somehow still feels rich (until it just magically evaporates off your face???) & it leaves you with a nice non-greasy lit from within glow. but my biggest issue with this moisturizer is the false advertisement from the brand, they claim this is a barrier supporting cream for dehydrated skin. while it’s definitely not a gel cream & certainly contains barrier supportive ingredients, any moisture that this cream may provide is completely gone about 5 minutes after applying (for context i have dry/dehydrated skin & just recently started using tret so i need alllll the moisture i can get). i was super excited to try this moisturizer bc i enjoyed their adaptogen cream but i also found it wasn’t enough for my skin. imo the superberry dream mask still remains the best moisturizer for dry skin from yttp but if you’re looking for something similar to this that is actually suitable for dehydrated skin try dieux’s instant angel! it also has peptides, hydrating ingredients, and is a bit more occlusive than this cream. i purchased this product with my own money and while i’m ultimately left underwhelmed by my experience, it doesn’t mean that other people won’t enjoy it! i think this cream would be wonderful for oily-combo skin looking for a barrier supportive cream! not all hope is lost for me as i still have my yttp faves but this is something i sadly won’t be repurchasing. underwhelming :/
