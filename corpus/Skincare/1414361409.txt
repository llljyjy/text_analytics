This product is ok but doesn’t provide everything it claims. I’ve been using this product well over a month and don’t see any real results.  It is a light and moisturizing cream and it provides moisture all day and removes the puffiness but that’s about it.Overall, it’s just a good moisturizer and not worth the added expense on top of your daily mface cream Good moisturizer
