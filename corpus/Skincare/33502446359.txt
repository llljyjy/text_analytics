Twice a day!!! That part was probably the catch for me, but even with missing the 2nd time often, I see an improvement in my sunspots on the sides of my forehead & cheeks.This serum is so light, & doesn’t leave any film beind. Living with these spots for so many years, it’s amazing to see an improvement. I’m confident that continuing use it after this first 3 months will yield even better improvement. It Works If You Work It!!!
