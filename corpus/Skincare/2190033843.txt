Nice, not overpowering smell. Same can be said for the scrub texture itself, not super abrasive and not strong enough that you couldnâ€™t use it with a lot of frequency. Enjoy washing my face when I use this product and would def recommend this product to a friend looking for a gentle physical exfoliator Pleasant scrub
