Smell, texture, functionality… terrible :( I wanted to try something different than my go-to Farmacy. I wanted a pump or a bottle for easy dispensing in the shower and hoped this was the solution.. nvm. It smelled horrible, felt horrible— didn’t rinse off like Farmacy or Biossance. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Idk how it has positive reviews? nan
