This lotion isn’t very indicative of a lotion in consistency. Reminds me more of micellar water. It does however make your skin feel very soft. It does not last long though and needs a more heavy duty moisturizer to do the job. Overall I think this is a good option if you need some moisture for oiler skin, if you’re very dry I wouldn’t recommend since you will need another moisturizer to go with it. It’s okay. For oiler skin
