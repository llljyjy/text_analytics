I usually suffer from mild acne because I used the wrong product for my face. But this works well with the Sephora collection clear skin gel PBT. I already used this for more than few weeks and it shows a great improvement. I havent had mild acne since. Sometimes I use a bit of moisturizer after washing my face, but I do not moisturizer my face if is normal because over moisturizering my skin when is not dry, it can cause breakout for me. nan
