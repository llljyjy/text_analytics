This stuff though!! I’ve read so many reviews (good and bad) and I wondered if it was worth the $$ but it was! I have three Laneige lip sleeping masks, sweet candy and gummy bear is my favorite. I also have their glowly lip balm. I highly recommend. I’ve been using this since January and my lips have not been chaped since. I will be purchasing more! nan
