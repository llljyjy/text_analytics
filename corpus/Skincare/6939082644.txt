I have this only 3 stars mainly because when I apply in the morning before doing makeup I didnâ€™t feel like it absorbed into my skin well enough and then when applying makeup my skin would start bearing and peeling off everything I had just put on.  Other than that when applied only at night my skin felt great! So so
