Worth every penny. I use this as my daytime lotion. Lightly scented, not as heavily fragranced as the original cream. Excellent moisturizer, gives my skin a nice plump glow. Absorbs quickly, I still use a primer after this and it doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. Love love love!! I’m on my second bottle. nan
