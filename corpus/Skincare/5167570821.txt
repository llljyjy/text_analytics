This is definitely an expensive product. Especially for an eye cream in such a small quantity, however this is La Mer. Having never tried anything from La Mer other than the eye cream, I wasn’t sure what this product would be like. Upon application, I found the formula to extremely hydrating, cooling any smoothing. It felt wonderful on the skin and wasn’t tacky. A little goes a long way as well which I love. But not sure if it it worth the price. nan
