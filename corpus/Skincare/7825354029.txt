In my opinion it’s drying. I tried it a few times to give it a fair chance and I did not like the dry/stripping feeling I felt every time I washed it off. I have dry skin and dry patches, this made it feel worse. I think it is good for individuals who have combo skin or a bit more oily but I wouldn’t recommend it to my fellow dry skin people. It’s drying…
