Really love this mask, and it’s become a staple in my skin care routine. I use this after days of exfoliation or retinol. I don’t use a moisturizer with this - it’s the only thing I wear after cleansing my face. The next day, my face feels hydrated, nourished, and soft. I only get the mini size because it’s so expensive! Soft face
