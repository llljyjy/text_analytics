I really wanted to love this product but it just didnâ€™t work for me. I have pretty dry and sensitive skin. After a week or two of use I developed a rash on my face (t zone area). It was not painful but it consisted of red spots and itchiness. Really disappointing that this did not work out for me because I love the Summer Fridays brand. Wanted to love but did not like my skin!
