I’m glad I got to try the Goop Jelly Cleanser. I have dry to combo skin so I like to exfoliate once or twice a week. This is a gentle exfoliater that leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry after using it. My skin feels smoother as well. The scent is not my favorite but it doesn’t linger. It’s a sizable amount of product for the price. I recommend it. Good exfoliator
