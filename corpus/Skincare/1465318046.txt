I really liked this product, but I have a few qualms with it. 1. It felt moisturizing and calming on my sensitive eyes, and allowed me to layer a stronger product on top that would have irritated my eyes alone. However adding an additional product (eye serum that still needs to use an eye cream on top of it) isnâ€™t something I see in my routine long term.2. The applicator feels great. I love the cooling sensation, but I wish it had a softer side to make it easier to use. It can be hard to squeeze out without the product getting sucked back Feels great on sensitive skin
