I think I’ve tried about every mineral sunscreen out there and this one wins. It’s lightweight and does not irritate my dry, eczema prone skin. It seems to even out my competition a bit with no white cast. I lightly moisturizer first, finish getting ready and then apply this about 15 minute later. I feel protected and don’t walk around feeling like I have a mask on my face. Yeah! Also, it doesn’t travel and end up in my eyes or neck lines like others I’ve tried. It’s a bit pricey but my skin is worth it! perfectly light and smooth
