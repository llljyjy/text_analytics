Absolutely love the Kiehlâ€™s Ultra Facial advanced repair Barrier Cream. It worked immediately, I noticed the difference on my face as soon as I started using the cream. My face was pretty dry and wind burnt from the cold snap we are having here and Florida. So it was pretty painful. As soon as started using the cream I noticed my skin was feeling softer and not as sore .Definitely recommend this product. Definitely added to my routine.
