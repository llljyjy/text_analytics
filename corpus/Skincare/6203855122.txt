I got to try Clarins Double Serum as part of Butterly’s sampling program. I received a week’s worth of samples to try. The product spreads nicely on the skin and has a mild floral scent that I didn’t find overpowering. It absorbed nicely into my skin and didn’t leave it feeling oily or dry. My skin looked very smooth, had a glow and felt soft. I have oily skin with enlarged pores and my face seemed to look smoother with less visible pores. The product can firm the skin but I would need to try the product for a longer time to comment on this. I feel this is a good quality product but it’s very pricey at almost $100 for 30mLs. Quality Product
