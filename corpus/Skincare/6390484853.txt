I git this product for free thanks to @thisisbutterly @clarinscanada @chickadvisor in exchange of an honest review.  The serum seems oily when taken out, but it mixes well and it doesn’t  feel greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly.  The reason I don’t give it a 5 stars is because the scent is very strong, like roses, and it last a bit.  The skin feels nice though. #freeproduct Good serum
