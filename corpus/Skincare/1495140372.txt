The smell— not the greatest and takes some getting used to (a bit like wet cat and sulphur?). However, if a product delivers results and does what it says it does, I don’t care what it smells like! I will bathe in it!I live in FL and was a sun bunny in my teens, so I have some sun damage across my cheeks, bridge of my nose and upper lip, including some melasma brought on by hormones- so pretty much all over- all of which has been there for the last 20 years (for reference Im fair-skinned and mid 30’s). And let me tell you— ALL of that is nearly gone and this is the most even skin tone I have had in the last two decades. My stubborn melasma is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter and shrinking. I am shocked at how well this works! I had a solid routine before, but when I added this serum into the rotation, it was a game changer. I have been using this consistently for the last 4 months at night 2x/wk alongside Tretinoin 2x/wk, and Vitamin C or Caudalie’s vinoperfect serum in the mornings (and a good SPF, of course). The sun damage on my nose and upper lip is completely gone and the areas on my cheeks have shrunk and lightened by 70%. I know this is marketed more towards acne and PIH sufferers, but if you have deep, long-standing hyperpigmentation issues, this one is for you too! Hope this helps. Have melasma? This witchcraft is for you!
