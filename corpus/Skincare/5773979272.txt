Had high hopes and thought it could replace my drunk elephant protini since I like yttp and itâ€™s slightly better in value.used it for about a week and a half and got 6 or so breakouts. And I normally only get a breakout every 3 months or so. I have combo oil skin. It doesnt have fragrance in the ingredient list but it does have a scent to it.maybe from the plant extracts. Gonna go back to my beloved drunk elephant protini. Made me breakout
