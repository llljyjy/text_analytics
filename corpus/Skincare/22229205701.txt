I don’t know where to begin with this product. It doesn’t seem like a super serious skincare product, the first thing you’ll probably notice is that it has a substantial fragrance which I usually try to stay away from. However, this hasn’t been irritating at all yet. I purchased it once in 2020, used it up and was having really good success with it, but I didn’t re-order because I wanted to find something that would do the job without fragrance. I’ve come back to it because my skin did really well, and has started doing well again using it.I absolutely love the texture and feeling of this serum going on, it is quite watery feeling at first, but it does work into your skin well and has a decent amount of time to work it in before drying. It feels quite weightless on the skin.Only reason I can’t give it  stars is because of the fragrance, and if you have sensitive skin or are someone who cannot handle fragrance at all I wouldn’t recommend this serum, but for anyone else I think it would be ok. Amazing serum - Wish it didn't have fragrance
