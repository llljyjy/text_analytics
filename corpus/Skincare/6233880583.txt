I was expecting this to be a slightly better cleanser than a plain one, not expecting much punch from the salicylic acid - and boy was I wrong! My skin started purging like crazy. I think the worst of it is finally over, but I wonâ€™t be able to stop using this cleanser now lol I have used other salicylic acid products and felt as though they did nothing. This definitely works. heavy duty
