Gorgeous moisturizer! First of all, the texture is amazing. It’s hydrating yet so soft and cushiony. My skin is soft, smooth, and glowy all day after I use this and it sits wonderfully under my makeup. The rose fragrance is light enough where it’s not overpowering. My new favorite daytime product!!! Soft, glow, beautiful skin!
