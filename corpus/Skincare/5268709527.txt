I received this mask from Clarins in exchange for a review.Alright, I’ve seen this mask on IG and and was skeptical that it would actually help with puffiness.I applied it very lightly around my eyes, lower half of half and neck. It does light fragrance and leave in on anywhere from 10-15 minutes. Y’all, it does depuff! The clay in mask isn’t drying either.I’ve been using it before going out for a refreshed look or after a night of cocktails. Refreshed and taut skin!
