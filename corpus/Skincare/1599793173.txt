Love this from Kiehl! This is a good product that delivers benefits that you can see within a few weeks. After 3 weeks I saw fine lines smoothing over. I didn’t see a big difference in deeper wrinkles, which i would expect after a short time. but hope for results over time. A pea size amount is all you need for your whole face. This wasn’t overly drying as with some retinols. As a rule of thumb, if always apply a ceremide moisturizer after using retinol to protect the skin barrier. Overall, I would recommend! Great new product!
