I was so excited when I found this! I love my skin having a nice glowing tan. This product applies easily and you can definitely see the tan/glow you begin to have about just an hour of using! The smell of watermelon is great. It is more of a sweet candy watermelon. The only thing I do wish is that it came with an applicator glove because you can definitely see the color on your palms if you donâ€™t wash it off quick and fully. Love to love!
