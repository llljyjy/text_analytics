IT does IT again! I wear IT bye bye foundation religiously, so I had high expectations for this product. I was not disappointed.  I love how this has changed my skin in just two weeks. The redness especially. It’s really hydrating without being greasy or heavy feeling. Perfect for under makeup during the day and intense enough to hydrate in the PM. Try it, you’ll probably love it. do IT!
