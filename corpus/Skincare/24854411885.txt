The serum was easy to mix with no clean up required. I especially love that you have to push the button on the bottom for the serum to come out , my 4 year old son can’t just grab it and squirt it all over himself. No scent and absorbs quickly.  I can definitely tell there is a difference in my skin , it’s firmer and my skin texture is smoother. Amazing retinol serum
