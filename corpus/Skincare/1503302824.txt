It has a very strong scent of powdery perfume and it will not go away with time. It doesn’t absorb well if you use the amount of sunscreen you should use, but it’s not the greasiest sunscreen I’ve used. It will sting your eyes BADLY when you sweat, then again when you go to wash your face. I did a triple cleanse and my eyes are still irritated. If you like powdery perfume scent and don’t hand sensitive skin, you’ll probably like it. Powdery perfume scent and burns your eyes
