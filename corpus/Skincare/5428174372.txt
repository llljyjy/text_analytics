I was really excited to get this in the mail and give it a try - it’s only my second day using this product, but so far I love it! No white cast, goes on nice and easy, seems like good protection so far. The sunscreen I was using prior wouldn’t leave a white cast but would kind of pill or flake on top of my moisturizer and this one doesn’t do that. I haven’t worn with makeup yet so not sure how it will hold up under foundation but I’m not worried about it. nan
