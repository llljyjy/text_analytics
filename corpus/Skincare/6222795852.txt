I received a sample from Topbox in exchange for an honest review. #freeproduct #tryitwithtopboxThis serum was smooth to apply and felt very light. It was a bit more runny/watery than I would have liked though. Since a lot of the product ended up on my hands and not my face when applying. However, it still felt really hydrating and silky on my face when applied. I wish I had more of the product to be able to fully test out whether it made a difference to my wrinkles. A bit runny but feels silky on the face
