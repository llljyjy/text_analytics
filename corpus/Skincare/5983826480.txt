I, like other reviewers, am so disappointed in the packaging. I lost a LOT of the product when I opened it and even after holding it a different way, still lost a ton of it, all over my hands and my clothing. For something this expensive not being able to actually use what I pay for is extremely maddening. The sunscreen itself is wonderful, and I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but only if it came in more thoughtful packaging. Waste of money. Wasted product....
