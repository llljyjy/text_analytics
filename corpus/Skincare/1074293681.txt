The Shiseido Urban Environment Sun Dual-Care Fresh Moisture SPF 42 was an awesome face sunscreen. The formula was very much like a white cream sunscreen that’s typical across several brands, but I loved how it acted like a moisturizer as well. It absorbed into my skin very much like a moisturizer & didn’t make me feel greasy like many cream-based ones, but gave me the sun protection I need. I like how it’s not just a “go to the beach/pool to protect my face from the harsh rays“ kind, too. It’s truly an easy to use everyday formula where you can easily replace your moisturizer & sunscreen with one product or make you remember to put on sunscreen, which even I regularly forget to, because it can be a moisturizer/sunscreen combo. I also haven’t broken out and the scent (smells like flowers & sunscreen) isn’t offensive & dissipates after application.I recommend this if you’re looking to make your daytime skincare routine easy & looking to try out a new sunscreen.*I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.* Lovely & moisturizing
