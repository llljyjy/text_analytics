I was pleasantly surprised with this detox mask. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that it didn’t actually smell like cookies & cream! I prefer to put it on while my face is wet; however you can also apply if your face is dry. I felt this was gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin. The texture was airy & soft and it didn’t dry out my face at all. I felt like it was really easy to rinse off after it was done working its magic. Totally Worth It!
