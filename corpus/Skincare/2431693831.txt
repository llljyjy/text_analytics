Overall this was a letdown for me and mine is going back. It’s frustrating that you can’t see these in store because this Cherie color is NOTHING like pictured. I had to double check that I wasn’t accidentally sent the wrong color. Pictures show a soft nude pink, but this is DARK red. I tried it on hoping that it applied much lighter and looked somewhat like the picture but nope, it’s just red. I was also disappointed that it didn’t feel more hydrating. This is just less pigmented lipstick in my opinion and not the color OR formula I thought I was getting. I also felt like it faded away to nothing rather quickly and my lips felt dryer after. The pluses are the luxurious case and nice dior smell. Beware of colors & not very hydrating for a balm
