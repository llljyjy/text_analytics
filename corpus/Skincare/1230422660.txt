I loved that the consistency of this product of so much thinner than the rich cream and allows for a lot more flexibility with other products. I’m not sure what kind of sorcery is in this bottle but upon immediate use, my skin looks better. It’s only been a couple of weeks, but, I am noticing subtle balancing with continued use. It certainly will be missed once it’s gone, but, for $175/oz I’m not sold that it’s worth it. nan
