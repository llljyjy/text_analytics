I received this product as complimentary.I have a dry skin and so far i have tried multiple different moisturizer. I can say Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask is definitely one of the best moisturizer I have ever tried! It has a very light weight, sit very well on skin and doesn’t make your skin feel heavy or oily. It has smooth texture and almost neutral smell. The price and the size are also other factors I look at when I purchase skincare which was great for this moisturizer. I used it up to 3 times for 2 weeks and feel my skin is plumbed and more refreshed now. Has minimal packaging. I definitely will buy it again. nan
