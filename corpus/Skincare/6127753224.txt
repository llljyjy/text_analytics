This product came at the perfect time coming out of winter into spring. All winter long I’ve suffered dry itchy skin, I’ve tried various creams and balms and nothing lasts all day. I was skeptical of this product being able to hold up to my active lifestyle and keep my skin hydrated but it did just that. It helped repair and protect my skin by keeping it soft and moisturized. I was able to pull out my spring wardrobe sooner than I normally would. It is pricey but coming out of winter into spring might be a once in a year splurge on myself I indulge in. Hydration that keeps going!
