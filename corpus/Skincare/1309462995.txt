This cleanser is gentle and very easy to use.  I did not experience a big foaming action but I did enjoy messaging this cleanser onto my face.  My skin felt hydrated and soft after each use. It worked well to take off makeup, which I seldom wear, and sunscreen at the end of the day.   The formula is gentle and non-stripping.  I would recommend this cleanser to those who are new to skincare and do not wish to have a multiple-step routine. Great product for the skincare novice
