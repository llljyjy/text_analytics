I got this as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I was super excited! I have very sensitive skin and many night masks either dry it out or cause major redness. With this sleeping mask, my skin feels smooth, no redness, and it doesn’t feel dry by morning. In fact, when I wash my face in the AM, it usually feels like there’s a barrier of this mask still on my skin. I’ve seen other reviewers suggest that you should follow this with a moisturizer... that’s up to you. I didn’t find that necessary at all. I was also pleased that the smell is not overbearing and doesn’t make me sneeze. Lastly, the product goes on smoothly, as it’s a gel-like texture, and you don’t need a ton of it to cover your entire face. I’m super pleased and will definitely buy it when my free sample runs out.
