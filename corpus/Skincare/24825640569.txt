I got this product free to try in exchange for my honest opinion. I have tobsay, as with all the Tula products I have tried, I really like this Vitamin C  Moisturizer. I am glad I recieved it because it is a miracle under masks. It really helps keep the Maskne (mask acne) to a minimum and helps brighten skin tone, and dare I say cuts down on concealer use! Itâ€™s great under foundation as well, as it helps to smooth textured skin and helps take the dryness away from make up looks. I would definitely recommend this product #GotItFree #Tryitwithinfluenster Amazing results
