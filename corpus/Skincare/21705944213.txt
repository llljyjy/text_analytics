Bought this product bc it kept showing up on my tiktok and when I tell you IT BROKE ME OUT SO BAD. I saw that it could cause you to purge bc it contains exfoliating ingredients so I did give it a chance and decided to use it for a month. After a month it was still breaking me out so SO bad (ur only supposed to purge for 3-4 weeks MAX) thats when I decided to finally stop and do my research. Found out that it contains so many pore clogging ingredients. I will say that it does (ever so lightly) reduce appearance of acne marks BUT will cause you to have more pimples…its all very counterproductive. You’re trying to lighten an acne mark and when ur finally able to at least make it less noticeable here you are stuck with a bunch MORE of new pimples that you’re now gonna have to heal and lighten again!! DO NOT BUY! WILL BREAK YOU OUT!!
