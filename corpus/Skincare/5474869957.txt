Was a little skeptical at first but it was love at first use for me! This stuff is creamy, goes on smoothly, not greasy and doesn’t leave a white cast. I think it’s awesome that it’s a multitasking product too; moisturizes, refines pores as well as protects from the sun. Goes very well under my make up. 100% recommend! Love this stuff!
