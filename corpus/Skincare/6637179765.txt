Equally as amazing as the previous balms Vanilla & Vanilla Beige. Very moisturizing, leaving lips look & feel juicy. Yummy citrus scent/flavour with a warm summery tint of coral. I was nervous to try on my warm pale skin but I love it. Summer Fridays has the best lip butter balms ever. Iâ€™ve tried A LOT of balms, but I always find myself reaching for the butter balms over other brands carried at Sephora. BIG fan (flash & no flash pics :)
