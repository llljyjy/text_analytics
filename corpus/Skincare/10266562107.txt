I want to begin by clarifying that my skin is EXTREMELY dry. My skin is flaky, minutes after Ising moisturizer such as the first aid beauty repair cream, my skin would flake.I have used prescription grade moisturizer for my dry skin that did nit work as well as this product. I am totally in love with this specific tacha product. If you have extreme dry skin like mine and other products have not worked, TRY THIS. it is truly worth the price. amazing for dry skin
