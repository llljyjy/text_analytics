I am on my second bottle of this. The first go around I enjoyed it as part of a rotation, although I didnâ€™t really see any on going changes in my skin. However and drier my skin loves this! I have sensitive skin, combination but can lean oily. This makes my skin feel and look hydrated. My other products and make up go on so smooth because of this. Great for sensitive combo skin
