I love it! I ended up liking this more than I anticipated. It’s standard on how any other white face cream looks but when you apply it it’s light, great with it’s ability to spread well and there are no harsh after effects and it doesn’t leave my face greasy or overly oily from moisture. I don’t use a whole lot cause a little truly does go a long way, I don’t pack it on I use some from the lid that ends up on it. My only gripe with it is to make sure you wait a while to use the glow drops after cause it comes off as left over residue for me. Non Greasy and Smooth to the touch!
