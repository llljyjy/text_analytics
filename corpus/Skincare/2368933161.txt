I do like this sunscreen. It is suuuuper glowy/luminous, but if you like luminous primers it’s great under makeup. I love the finish because it’s not greasy but not too matte. All I ask is to please expand the shade range. The current shades suit people with medium skin tones. Those of us woth skin tones on either end of the spectrum, pale or deep, don’t match. Please more shades! Please expand the shade range.
