Ok there are a lot of bad reviews for this product but it works!!! You just need to use a LOT more than you think. The instructions say to use like 6 drops but I used this on my arms and shoulders and used like 6-8 full droppers of it and it worked really well. I wouldnâ€™t use it on my face as it is oily but the colour is nice and way easier to apply than the mousse in my opinion. it works
