I received this product to try from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I am always looking for a new spf to add to my daily routine but this one fell short for me. The scent was light but I prefer less scent. The texture felt nice going on but I was not a fan of how it felt after it dried a bit. It left my skin slightly tacky. I tried multiple times to make sure it wasnâ€™t something else I was using it in combination with but on my skin it did it no matter what. This is not something I would purchase on my own. Not a fan
