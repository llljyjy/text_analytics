I received this as a sample and I was really impressed! I have been looking for a exfoliating cleanser that is gentle enough to use daily, and so far this is it! It smells beautiful, and the little sugar granules slowly melt as you massage it into your skin. This leaves a heavenly almost slippery-feeling residue on your skin, and when you rinse it off your skin will feel like silk! Highly recommend. Love it!
