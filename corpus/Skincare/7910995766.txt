Works great! You really do have to shake it vigorously before spraying so that it is a fine mist. The bottle does say it’s a light hint of rosemary and mint but it is VERY strong. Highly recommend following the directions of not opening your eyes for 3 seconds after and try to not breathe in for 5 seconds because it is straight up mint in your nose! The product doesn’t move my makeup or make me look oily (I have combo skin). Happy to be able to apply sunscreen over my makeup! Strong scent BUT it works!
