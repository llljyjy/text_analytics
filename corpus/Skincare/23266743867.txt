Based on my experience and some of the reviews I saw I think the product description could use an update. This is marketed as a cleanser which you can follow directly with moisturizer or serums. For my combination skin this product left a very wavy residue which meant I’d only use it as the first step in a double cleanse. I found it worked well but didn’t compare to some better cleansing balms like the one from Clinique or oils. It had a gritty texture and since I want my first step in my cleanse to break down primarily eye makeup I didn’t like that and after a few weeks found the product separates and often needs heat of your hands or a really good shake before use. In terms of price however this isn’t a bad option. Probably won’t buy again but if you have very dry skin I could see this being a good option for you. Texture & residue didn’t work for me
