I was given IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for free to review and give my honest opinion and review. I was so excited when I received this cream because I have extremely dry skin. There are not many moisturizers that do much for the dryness. I am also 42 and really need something for fine lines and wrinkles. This product is the perfect solution. I immediately saw a glow to my skin after the first use. My skin didn’t feel greasy like it has after using other creams. I love using IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream under makeup because it doesn’t create piling like other products do. My skin has not felt dry skin started using this cream and I will definitely rebuy. I’ve already recommended it to my friends and family! For Hydrated Glowy Skin!
