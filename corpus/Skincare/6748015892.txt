This moisturizer is super hydrating and in my opinion, thick. I like it for night time use or if Iâ€™m feeling extra dry and patchy. For my regular day time use moisturizer, I prefer a lighter weight cream. However this one will also be great during winter months because it really locks in moisture and seemed to keep my face well hydrated for hours. The thickness of it did make my skin look and feel plump and youthful which was a nice plus so I would recommend this. hydrating
