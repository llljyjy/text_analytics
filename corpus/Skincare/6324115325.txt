I used the Charlotte tilbury magic serum crystal elixir for over a month in the morning before putting on makeup. I will say that I felt it created a glowy, smooth base for my foundation and did hydrate my skin thoroughly. I did not feel like it particularly improved the elasticity of my skin or appearance of fine lines or anything like that, but it didn’t hurt my skin either. Overall, it’s a nice serum and a little goes a long way. Glowy
