I got this as a sample in an order. I expected a moisturizer because that’s what it claims to be. I completely disagree. It doesn’t at all feel like my skin is getting moisturized or hydrated. If this was advertised as a glowy primer I’d rate this a lot higher. The glow is very iridescent, reminds me a lot of the unicorn trend that had a moment. It’s very siliconey in texture. I don’t hate silicones in products, but it’s not what I look for in a moisturizer. Over all fail for me. Also like all Huda products it’s headache inducingly fragranced. yah… no.
