I use this as a primer with sunscreen in it. It has a bit of a weird texture, similar to a regular primer to me which surprised me for a sunscreen product. Make sure you shake it well otherwise it comes out liquidity. I don’t love the container to squeeze it out, it’s tricky to use. But it does absorb quickly and work well under makeup.
