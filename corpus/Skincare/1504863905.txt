I love this product. I can see a visible difference after I use this, and while itâ€™s pricey, it lasts a long time. The exfoliating minerals are not harsh on my sensitive skin, and do a great job of removing dead skin and leaving my skin glowing and soft. In an era of sponsored reviews, would like to confirm that I bought this product on my own and have repurchased several times. I wish it was less expensive, but it is worth the price point. Worth the money
