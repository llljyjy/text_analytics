This Face roller is really good and so much more affordable than others on this site! I was worried it would be squeaky like the ones Ive gotten off amazon but its not! I love using it in the morning to wake my face up. The color is really pretty too and I love the bag that it comes with! Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. Not Squeaky!!
