As a first time self tan wearer the application was easy and fun to use. For reference I am shade 430 in fenty beauty foundation. As soon as I applied the tanner I could see the immediate  darkening of my skin and the wonderful glow that the tanner left behind! The only thing I will say is the product leaves your skin sticky after the initial application so be cautious what you wear and what you sit on. I canâ€™t wait to apply this product again and enjoy my summer glow! nan
