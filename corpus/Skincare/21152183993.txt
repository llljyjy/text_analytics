I just tried this microfoliant for the first time and IM IN LOVE! I instantly saw my skin look brighter and smoother, and I think this definitely helped with some blackheads. You can kind of definitely tell this is rice-based by the smell but it is nothing strong. I was actually impressed! 10/10 would recommend! This was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. LOVE THIS!
