I love Dr. Gross products. They are well formulated and effective. I can’t understand why this is not in a tube! A jar guarantees the product will break down and become weak when exposed to air and light, not to mention bacteria filled. If you can use it all in a week you’ll be ok. A rare mistake. Why Is It In A Jar?
