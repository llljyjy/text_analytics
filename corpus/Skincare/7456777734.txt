Thought I would give my 2 cents amongst all the incentivized reviews.Pros: Does not leave a sticky/oily residue (combo/oily skin here); barely any smell; nice glass bottle and travel friendly stopperCons: I personally don’t find it to be as effective as Paula’s choice and the travel seal is also much harder to open/close vs Paulas choice as it does not have any “grab“ tab (I have to open it using the hinge points since I have really short nails that can’t get under the seal... you can easily cut off the seal tab if you don’t plan to travel with the bottle)Verdict: Decent enough, the price I would say has similar value compared to PC and I will gladly finish it up however my quest to find the right BHA (sans sticky residue finish/minimal-to-no scent) continues. Okay but not holy grail
