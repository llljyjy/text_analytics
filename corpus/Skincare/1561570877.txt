I really enjoyed the feel of this product. It went on easily and left my skin feeling hydrated. There is a small spatula that is included but I wish there was a spot to store it designed into the jar. There is a light, pleasant scent to it and I enjoy that there is SPF protection. It leaves the skin with a dewy appearance and definitely felt hydrated throughout the day. Received this complimentary product for my review. nan
