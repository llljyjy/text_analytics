Gifted by EADEM . I absolutely love this moisturizer. It feels a little heavier than what I would imagine a cloud to be , BUT itâ€™s beachside it very moisturizing to the skin . Keeps my skin moisturized for a long period of time ! I enjoy the spatula it came with , helps make less of a mess and easier to use . You also get a lot of product for a great price , you really only need a little and it goes a longggg way !! Cloudy w/ a chance of soft skin
