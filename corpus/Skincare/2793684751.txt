This eye balm has a light and creamy texture that quickly melted into the skin leaving my eye area feeling moisturized all day. It’s light enough for day and night and didn’t impact the wear of my makeup. I also liked that this eye balm isn’t scented. I noticed my eye area appeared more moisturized and my dark circles were slightly lighter after using this a few weeks. The Drunk Elephant packaging with the twist up pump is one of my favorite designs because I don’t have a lid to keep track of yet I can securely close it after each use! Everyday moisture
