As someone with roseacea/slighty reactive skin, I have to be mindful of the skin care products I choose. Half the battle is finding something that won’t trigger a flare up. This checked the boxes for offering the lightweight moisture I prefer and not causing my skin to freak out. But that’s it! This didn’t outperform my tried and true Sensibio and Hydrobio moisturizers from Bioderma, both a fraction of the cost (thanks to cvs discounts) of Zenbubble. The latter has a similar texture too! I fell for the marketing, the  reviews and the hope for even slightly better results. But after finishing the container it confirmed I’d already had a good thing going with Bioderma and won’t be cheating on those babes anymore. I learned my lesson! It’s a nice product; I just found similar results at 1/3 the price. Didn't outperform my  fave drugstore brand
