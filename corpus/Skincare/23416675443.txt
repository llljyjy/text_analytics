The Caudalie Cru cream is very thick and moisturizing. First off the jar is very eco friendly since you can refill the jar once you finish the product with a new tub inserted in. The product is very luxurious feeling and works best during the winter time. I mostly have been using it at nighttime for a week or so and it really helps my dry skin feel hydrated and plumps my skin after applying the cream. The fact that this cream helps with anti aging, brightening, and moisturizes all in one product is very convenient to target all the skin issues without having to apply a lot of other products. Definitely recommend this product. #freeproduct #trywithtopboxcircle Rich moisturizer
