The employee in the skincare section did recommended this to me after telling her i had dry and red skin (my winter skin ) . And I was impressed by the texture,  it’s very light and buttery and does feel like it’s “floating“ on your skin , however I agree with the others it’s not good to use every day if you have sensitive skin . I kept mixing water in it because it wasn’t hydrating my skin enough plus my face started tingling and stinging and got red when I put it on after washing . So I’m gonna be switching However I will save this for summer when my skin isn’t dry and as sensitive . It's alright
