I really wanted to love this product. I’ve been using it daily for a week and my forehead has become more dry. I have combination oily skin, so I wouldn’t expect it to dry my skin out. The texture is good and has a light cucumber melon scent. I love that it has SPF 15 although it doesn’t meet the American Academy of Dermatology recommendations, so I still apply my daily sunscreen after the cream absorbs. I haven’t noticed any anti-aging benefits, but I didn’t expect to after just one week. It may be great for other people, just not for me. nan
