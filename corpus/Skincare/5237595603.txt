I received a small sample to test and review but since it was so small, I can only provide first impressions. This is more of a gel formula so it absorbed into my skin very quickly. It left my skin feeling soft however I don’t know if it’s hydrating enough for my very dry skin. I would need to test it more. First impressions.
