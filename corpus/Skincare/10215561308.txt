This is a lovely cream. It has nice, smooth, texture. It’s moisturizing without being too heavy. It worked well on my 40+ very dry skin. After the first use my skin felt softer and with continued use I noticed more softness and a gentle “plumping” of the fine lines. Only dinged a star for the fragrance. It has the typical Estée Lauder scent which is not necessary or wanted in skincare. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed this product Lovely
