I really like the texture of this treatment so far. I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin yet but I will continue use. It’s not a super heavy product, but you can definitely tell there’s something on your face. The one thing I really dislike about it is having to wait a decent length of time to layer moisturizer (I was told 20 minutes). At night, I really don’t feel like waiting any length of time to do an entire skin care routine, so the quicker the better. That is my main complaint nan
