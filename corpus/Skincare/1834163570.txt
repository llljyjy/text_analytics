The new formula is atrocious. This has been my go to lip balm for years; I threw the new one in the trash. It has none of the qualities that made the original great. It’s waxy, it doesn’t hydrate or keep my lips soft, the scent is only vaguely in the vicinity of coconut. Sephora- not everything needs to be vegan/clean. This was a serious miscalculation, please bring back the original version. New formula is terrible
