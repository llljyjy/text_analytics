I’ve used this product 5 times now, having extremely sensitive & dry skin I’m hesitant when trying retinal’s; had some really bad experiences in the past. So far so good, not a whole lot of redness and just a little bit of flaking, I increased moisturizing, had some pore purging about 48 hours after the first use, I did notice my face feels smoother, but I think it’s too soon to tell, I know these products take time, but I’m going to continue to build up my tolerance to be able to use this 3-4x/ week (I don’t want to over do it) and see where we go from there. However, this is the best experience I’ve had with a retinal so far. nan
