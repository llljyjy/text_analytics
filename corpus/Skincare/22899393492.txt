I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. The samples fairly small, so I truthfully have not seen much of an effect with this product. However that being said, the product feels very nice on the skin, adds a lot of hydration and moisture to the eye area, has a pleasant smell, and I do not find it irritating to my skin. I certainly think it is worth trying, I would like to try it for a longer period of time to see if it does have any long-term effects on wrinkles in the eye area. Hydrating
