This is a great moisturizer that absorbs quickly and leaves a nice healthy glow. Have been using for a few weeks now and have seen a difference in my skin and perhaps less visible fine lines due to the slight plumping effect. The packaging is very high quality and there is no scent, which is great as Iâ€™m sensitive to strong smells. Would recommend. Absorbs easily and leaves skin glowing
