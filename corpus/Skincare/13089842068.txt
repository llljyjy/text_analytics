I received a bottle of this for my birthday a couple months ago and have used it daily ever since as part of my night time regime. It definitely makes my skin feel soft but I find after a while my skin almost feels more dry and flaky than before. I get a lot of breakouts with this oil as well and breakouts and dry skin is not something I’ve ever suffered from. My skin before using this oil was generally clear, smooth and healthy looking. I rated it 3 stars because it does make my skin feel soft and it goes on nicely but I won’t be repurchasing simply because of all the pimples I get while using this and the flaky skin it gives me is pretty gross. It’s not moisturizing enough for me and is actually a little drying. Won't Repurchase
