I received a free sample of this product and was so surprised by how well I like this. The pump dispenser is great, no dipping fingers into a jar, and allows for a measured amount to be dispensed. The lotion goes on very smoothly and is not irritating at all. After using for a couple of weeks I noticed that I really like the way my skin looks and feels. It is smooth, clear, and even some of the wrinkles seem less noticeable and that is amazing to me! I would highly recommend this product. nan
