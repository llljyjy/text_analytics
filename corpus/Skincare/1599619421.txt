Those who wrote bad reviews… cracks me up.  If you’re complaining about white cast, then do not use mineralSunscreen because this is a physical sunscreen! Note covers and protects physically!  If you want invisible sunscreen, then go for chemical sunscreen that absorbs into your skin.  Stop complaining if you know can’t even tell between chem vs physical sunscreens.  This is a perfectly great physical sunscreen that provides 22% zinc oxide… more than you will find in other “physical” sunscreens.  Love this product!!!  Blends well and smells great!  Don’t ever stop making this!  Nordies has a sale for 50%off right now!!!!! actually protects your skin and blends well!
