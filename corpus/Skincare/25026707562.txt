I like and hate this balm at the same time! I like lavender scent, but I think this much perfume for skin care is not logical! I also like the balmy texture but some days I feel I’m using a light vaseline. It’s lightweight and absorbs fast which I love. I think this balm is for dry to normal skin, if you have combination or oily skin , or you are sensitive to scented products it’s not for you! love and hate
