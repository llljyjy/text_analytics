Wanted it to be a dupe of the DDG AHA/BHA cleanser while my local store was sold out. It smells kind of…rotten. Like when a face product turns. And definitely nothing like the resurfacing cleansers from DDG or PTR. Some smoothing. I might have finished it at this price point if it didn’t smell so bad. nan
