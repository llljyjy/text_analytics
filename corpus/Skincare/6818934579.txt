I was so excited to recieve this complimentary Shiseido Urban environment oil free mineral sunscreen in exchange for an honest review from Influenster and Shiseido right before taking a trip, that i made extra space in my luggage. i love finding sunscreens that work for my melanated skin. i cannot stand sunscreens that make me look like I rolled in flour. This sunscreen added to my glow and was so light weight on my skin.  this protected my skin from the carribean sun that was way more than i’m used to. you definitely will love this amazing product because i know i do. i can’t wait to purchase more from this line. Vacay ready
