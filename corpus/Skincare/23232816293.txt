The consistency of this lotion is more like an oil than thick lotion. It surprised me when it came out of the bottle! It comes out quickly and light but once you start rubbing in, you get that lotion feel. It doesnâ€™t leave me oily, it just comes out of the bottle like oil. It smells great and it absorbs quickly. Different consistency than a regular lotion
