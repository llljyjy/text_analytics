So far, so good. I have been using this product for a week now and I am really enjoying it. First thing, I really like the packaging. Super cute. It has a nice scent to it that I don’t find to be overpowering at all. This cream is very moisturizing under my eyes and feels very soothing. I haven’t had any issues with it. nan
