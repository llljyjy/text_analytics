First, I would like to say that saying it is a lotion is very misleading and hence I almost returned it right away. However, I decided to give it a go and I like it a lot but I’m not really sure why. I really can’t pinpoint what these magic mushrooms are doing but I do enjoy the experience of using it. I am trying to figure out a way to not use so much at one setting by soaking a cotton ball or just trying to pour some onto my hand and rubbing it in because with the water consistency it literally comes rushing out of the bottle. Overall, I would recommend the product but just be aware that you are not getting some thickish lotion. Interesting product
