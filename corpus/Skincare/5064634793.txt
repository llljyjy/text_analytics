I have oily acne prone skin and always have since I was a teen, this did nothing for my acne I’ve used 4 dots on one pimple and got no results whatsoever it’s like I never even put anything. It does stick very well though despite my oily skin and stayed put all night so it has that going for itself I guess. I was really bummed because I love how invisible it looks on the skin and covers the entire pimple. Maybe better suited for those who get the occasional pimple rather than one who struggles with acne more. * I received this as a sample in one of my Sephora orders and was so excited to try! * did nothing for me.
