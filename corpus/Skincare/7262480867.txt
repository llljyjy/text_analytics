I bought this product because I wanted to introduce an anti-ageing product without trying something harsher (like retinol). I’m on my third bottle of this serum, and I’ve been so impressed! While it’s expensive, I definitely think it’s worth the money. My skin is consistently bright and glowy, and it pairs well with the other skincare products I use. Most of my meetings have become virtual since the pandemic started, and I’ve gotten so many compliments of how fresh/glowy my skin looks even on the computer. The serum makes me feel awake and refreshed. Thank you YTTP!
