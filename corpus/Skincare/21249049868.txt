I am 48 yrs old with dry skin. I have never been able to achieve “the glow”. This product, which I will never stop using, got my skin glowing. I can hardly believe the results after about one month if usage. I was worried to try this because i thought it my be harsh and drying and only got it as part of a set but now I live it.I pat it in my skin using my fingers and let it dry naturally in the air. About 60-90 minutes later i layer moisturizer over it (either Kate’s Dilo oil or Tatcha’s dewy cream), rinse it all of with water in the morning and am all set. My makeup looks better than ever and I look smoother and younger. Seriously, if you want results buy this product.This is a great product, you will see results. Excellent product, gets results
