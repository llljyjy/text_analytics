I found that the pads were super thin and a little difficult to separate but they had a lovely light minty scent! Used it for about a month now and I definitely see that it did wonders for the black heads on my nose and minimize the pores as well! My skin feels and looks better! Iâ€™ve already repurchased! 10/10
