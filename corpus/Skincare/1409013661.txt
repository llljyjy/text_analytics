Received free sample from BzzAgent and have been using it for approximately 6 weeks. I’ve noticed an improvement in the firmness of my crow’s feet. The depuffing of my under eye area has been the most dramatic. The formula is very smooth, thick and doesn’t pill. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn’t caused any irritation. My only issue with the product is the initial smell of the product over the first few uses. I’ve since gotten used to it and think this is an excellent product! nan
