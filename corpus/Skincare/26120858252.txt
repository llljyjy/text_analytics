I havenâ€™t been acne prone since I was a teenager. I believe this product has been breaking me out which is pretty frustrating but not the end of the world I just will not repurchase. I was told to be patient when trying any new skincare products but zero results after 4 weeks plus the new acne.... not impressed. Also this is the worst smelling of all of the Glow recipe products. It does not smell natural and fresh like the other products. No results after 4 weeks plus breakouts
