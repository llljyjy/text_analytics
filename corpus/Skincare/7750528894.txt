Excellent. My skin is extremely pale, think, see every vain when I’m cold type of pale.  Using this stuff gives my skin a VERY natural colour. It’s easy to apply! Regular tanners need skin prepared, like shaved and moisturized in the dryer areas before application, this stuff isn’t so hard on the rules. While you still need to keep a clean and shaven sufferance, you won’t need to worry as much for darker harsher lines, toes, knee caps and so on. If you keep yourself moisturized on the regular and need a confidence boost wearing a more revealing outfit during the winter and spring months, get this.  Summer months? Use this to keep up that natural tan with a boast of colour for seriously impeccable looking skin.  11 out of 10 would recommend. everyone needs this. 11/10
