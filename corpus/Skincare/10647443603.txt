I really wanted to like this product, but I just can’t. I don’t normally have issues with breakouts. After using this for only three days, my skin looked terrible! Blemishes, oily skin, and it was so irritated. The fine mist was nice, but there was no hint of the fragrance I chose. I also had to use quite a bit of product with each application, and I was using according to the enclosed directions. They say spritz at least 7x, and that uses up a lot of the bottle at one time. Overall, bad for my skin and my wallet. No returns allowed for open products :( Breakouts for days!
