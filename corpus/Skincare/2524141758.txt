I received this product complimentary from Influenster, and I’m very happy that I did. I deal with a lot of skin redness in my cheeks and forehead, and this product did wonders. I use an anti-redness cleanser recommended by my dermatologist, and then followed that up with this system. My face definitely looks less red and isn’t as dry as when I started. The color corrector is fantastic as well. I love the way it really tones down the redness, so that I don’t even need to use concealer or foundation. nan
