The only Vitamin C serum (besides Mad Hippie Vitamin C) that has worked for my skin. I love that you can use it on its own or mix it into a moisturizer (as it is a liquid consistency). The smell is not the best but the results are amazing. My skin tone has evened dramatically and looks glowy. Similar to Mad Hippie Vitamin C
