I had high hopes for this eye cream since my partner loves the hand cream by the same brand. I assumed it would be quite gentle, but it makes my eyes water badly, and I don’t put it anywhere close to the lash line. Two stars because it does seem to moisturize and absorb well, but with the eye watering it just isn’t worth it. Not for sensitive eyes
