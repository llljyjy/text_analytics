I have used some biossance products in the past so I was excited to try this moisturizer. It is very heavy and thick so you can immediately tell it will add good moisture to the skin. But I think bc it’s so heavy duty I can only use it at as night cream, bc it didn’t work as well under my makeup. The scent isn’t very good but it is plant derived and clean so I can understand why. I think it has helped my overall texture and fine lines so far and I can’t wait to see over even more time. There is alot of product and you don’t need much so it’s definitely worth the money. I do like squaline and think it is effective in skin care. I would recommend this as a good night cream for sure. nan
