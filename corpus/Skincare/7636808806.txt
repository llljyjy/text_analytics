I received this product for free from Influenster and Biossance for my honest review.  This was my first product from Biossance and I love it!  I put this serum on my face first underneath my moisturizer.  It is really moisturizing, or ‘plumping’ on my skin.  My skin gets really dry and flakey this time of year, but I haven’t noticed any flakiness with this serum.  I recommend it highly. Get This Serum
