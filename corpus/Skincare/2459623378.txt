Oh I just can’t say enough great things about this product! The applicator is so easy to use. The product itself doesn’t leave your skin feeling sticky at all. It absorbs quickly. After absorption it my skin felt so soft, smooth and alive. It didn’t feel “wet” or “dewey” which was an initial concern for me as I didn’t want my skin to feel that way. I highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a serum. nan
