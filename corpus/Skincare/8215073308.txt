I got the opportunity to try out the new It cosmetics confidence in a cream and I absolutely love it! I’ll start off by saying that the packaging is very nice, sleek, and modern. I like the tub container it comes in and I have no issues opening or closing the tub. I like the fact the moisturizer is anti-aging and has only a slight scent but not a bad nasty scent. When I apply this moisturizer it makes my face feel smooth and moisturized, but also feels nice once it has dried like I didn’t apply anything which is great because it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling. I’m not sure how well the actual product works against wrinkles or fine lines because I haven’t used it long enough but overall this product will be a staple in my household. Best moisturizer I've ever used.
