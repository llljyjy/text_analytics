I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I love Laniege’s products and this is no different! It feels super lightweight and silky on my skin and I love that it dries by morning, but isn’t hard to wash off. I have noticed a more moisturized and softer skin texture in the mornings after using it- which has been great during this dry winter we’re having! Love this for winter dryness!
