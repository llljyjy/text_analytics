I received this product from influenster in return for an honest review.  Initial thoughts; the packaging is super cute and easy to use. I love that it’s in a stick form; it’s less messy for someone with long nails.  (Yes I know to scoop product with the back of my nails but sometimes product still gets under them)  I do find a little product goes a long way. If I use too much I notice I feel a little greasy and I end up with my mascara kind of coming off and ending up under my eyes. (This may also be due to wearing a mask all day!) Overall I do think it’s a great product, clean beauty, and definitely leaves my under eyes feeling hydrated all day. Super Moisturizing!
