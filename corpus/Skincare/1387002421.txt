I recieved a sample sized product as a #freesample and I loved it! The cream is the perfect consistency, not heavy, sticky or oily. I used it as a nightly cream,  and applied it each night before bed for about 3 weeks. I found that it did not take much to get an even, all over coverage.  I found that my skin felt less dry and tight than it had before using this cream nightly.  The scent was pleasant,  the packaging attractive.  A very nice product. All good things!
