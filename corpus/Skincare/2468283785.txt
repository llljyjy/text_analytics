I received this item free from Estēe Lauder and Influenster in exchange of my honest review. It doesn’t take much product to cover your face. It’s smooth and creamy going into your skin. And leaves skin feeling so hydrated and soft. Lost a star for the scent. I don’t love it going on. But it fades fairly quick. Love this product!
