Iâ€™m so confused by the bad reviews. The wander eye masks won a bunch of awards and I love them. They work really well for wrinkles, and I wear them in the morning before I do my makeup (but only for a special event because they are expensive). I would give them a try, they really are pretty awesome. Bad reviews???
