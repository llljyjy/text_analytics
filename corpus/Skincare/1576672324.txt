It was great until it wasn’t. Initially, I used it occasionally and thought it worked ok at exfoliating and cleansing the skin. After increasing to daily usage, it started to irritate my skin and left me with a lot of little bumps and dryness. Currently still working to repair my skin from that irritation even though I’ve stopped using the cleanser for awhile. nan
