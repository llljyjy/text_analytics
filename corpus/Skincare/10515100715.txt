1 star for the rip off amount of product inside and for the price it cost. This cream only lasted 1 month. I used it twice a day, 4 days a week, and maybe 1.5 pumps of product. So disappointed how quickly it ran out. I’m not waiting 3 to 4 bottles of this stuff to properly see results and determine if it’s effective for my skin. Don’t waste your money.
