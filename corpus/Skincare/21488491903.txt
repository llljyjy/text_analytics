My daughter has been using it and there is a definite noticable difference in skin tone and it definitely has smoothed the texture of her skin for sure. She is super excited because it seems to be reducing the frequency of her breakouts too. This cream comes in at around $70 for a 1.5 oz tube but it’s worth it. I have been using it as well and it definitely lives up to its claims. We experienced no irritation,  there’s a very light almost medicinal smell at first, but barely. It’s thin and lightweight and goes onvwith no greasy feel.  This one’s a keeper! Amazing! Definite results
