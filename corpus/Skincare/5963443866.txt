I have used these MANY times and highly recommend. They’re nice & sharp & last many uses before having to dispose of them. I honestly prefer these over the SC refillable razors. They’re a great price and work super well for shaving anywhere on your face/neck. I usually use them when I’m in the bath, splash water on my face and shave the entire surface of my face. I am super sensitive and have never experienced any issues using these. Great Quality & Great Price
