This is sunscreen and fountain in 1, that’s what I feels like to me. I love this, it’s light on the skin and blends in well the fact that it has vitamin C and other minerals! Covers most those morning serum that I use. Lol I have not experience any irritation whatsoever this to me is good for like a non-full-blown make up day like a lazy Sunday. It’s clean, yes it’s runny but a little goes a long way! There ain’t a fragrance so it’s not bad. I love it!! Loved the sun
