I received this complimentary from Influenster. The packaging is ok, definitely not worth the hefty price tag. The combination of the serum, face cream, and the flow drops did leave my skin feeling moisturized and I loved the combo of all 3. This on its own leaves a very subtle glow. Wouldnâ€™t repurchase since I cannot justify the price. Mediocre at best
