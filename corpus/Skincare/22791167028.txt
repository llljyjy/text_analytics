It is cooling and feels nice when applied under tired eyes. However it’s very shimmery and appears silver with cool-tones on skin. My skin is light with warm undertones and this balm doesn’t look good on me personally. Cool and neutral toned people would compliment this better imo. Other than the gentle cooling effect I don’t feel any benefits from this. not worth the $
