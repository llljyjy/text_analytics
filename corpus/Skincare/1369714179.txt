Such a good product!! I was so nervous to try this before Christmas card photos! (Uggs were just my in between photos shoes!! Lol) But my dress was white and I was desperate to try and not look washed out. I was a little concerned while applying it as it didn’t go in as smoothly as I thought it would, but I trusted the process and used the mitt everyone suggested and viola!! Perfect, natural-looking tan! I’m notorious for missing spots and leaving streaks on elbows, ankles, wrists, etc., but not ONE SINGLE STREAK in any problem areas!! Lives up to the hype!
