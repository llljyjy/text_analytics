I must say I have no idea if this product does anything, nor what it’s actually supposed to do. I cannot see a difference immediately after applying it, but I also haven’t seen any remarkable difference in my skin since I started using it (one full bottle, but I’m not very disciplined in applying it every day). I use other Devgan products that I really like (the eye cream and the gold-infused mask), so I even wrote them to ask what this product is supposed to do, and their answer was vague (“some people see immediate results, some only after a while“). My sensitive rosacea skin does not react to it, so I guess that’s good. Aside from that, it’s a bit like putting water on my face. like water
