This is such a great product and I wish I’d tried it sooner. If you don’t like the feeling of heavy products on your face, this is awesome, especially for the summer. I usually use this in the daytime without anything else on and it’s just so light and weightless while still moisturizing. I will wear another moisturizer on top if wearing makeup, but overall, I LOVE this formula nan
