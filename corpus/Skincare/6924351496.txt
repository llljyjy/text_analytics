This is my new favorite moisturizer! When using at night I wake up GLOWING. Pleasant, light scent and rich as butter. I use it primarily as a night cream because it feels a bit too heavy for everyday. But it’s certainly not greasy and absorbs well. I am in my early 30s and starting to notice fine lines, and this moisturizer makes a dramatic difference and smooths everything out.  It’s luxurious and luscious and I feel like a queen applying it. so luscious! prevent early signs of aging
