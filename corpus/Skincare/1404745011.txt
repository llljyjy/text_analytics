I purchased this product because the weather lately has been rough on my lips. I originally went to buy the laniege lip mask but they were sold out completely. Just my chance I saw that tatcha also had lip masks and this was literally the last one left. I had hoped for the original color but ended up getting the red camellia because it’s all there was. I am so happy I did. The tint is so subtle but adds a little bit of life to my lips. I exfoliated my lips then put this on and my lips haven’t been dry or cracked since. I’m going to buy backups because I love this color so much. Highly recommend! unexpected holy grail
