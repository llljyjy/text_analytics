I have used St. tropez products for years (body self tanner) and rave about it. This was my first time trying this product and I plan to continue buying it on the same schedule with my body tanner. I simple drop a couple drops in my hand with my moisturizer and then spread evenly across my face and neck. 8 hours later I am left looking naturally sun-kissed and moisturized. It goes on super evenly which is what you hope for with a product like this. Would definitely recommend! Perfect glow!
