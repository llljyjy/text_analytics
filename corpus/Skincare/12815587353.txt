I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review.Iâ€™m not a regular user of any eye cream. I liked the texture of this product. A small amount goes a long way, too!  My 0.1oz sample had lasted about 5 weeks.  I have the start of crows feet and this did seem to lessen the visibility some. However, it did nothing for my undereye circles which was disappointing because that was one of the prominent claims. I'm happy with the product but it's not a miracle.
