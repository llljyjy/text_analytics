I like the product... But my tube only had about 1/3 of the amount it should’ve (.5 Oz). It wasn’t even close to that. At this price point, that’s absurd. I like the color, the texture, and how moisturizing it is. But again, the price is asinine for a tube that barely has any in it. You get like a sample amount. I’ve seen other reviews saying the same thing so the brand needs to figure this out Tube barely had anything in it
