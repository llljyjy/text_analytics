I LOVE lip care, and have tried out many items. I loved this balm at first! Was very smooth and hydrating on the lips. I’m a huge fan of drunk elephants products and use many of their products consistently. However, after only 5 days I ran out. 5 DAYS? Maybe I reapply too much? Not sure, but no lip balm has ever lasted that short of time for that much money. Maybe if it was 1/3 of the price, but I’ve tried many other products that have better formulas for the same price and a lot more of it!! Lasted maybe 5 days...
