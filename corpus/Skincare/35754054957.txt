This is the first type of spf I have bought, I don’t expect to buy any other brand. Personally, I haven’t experienced what others have (the packaging breaking) so that’s nice. It doesn’t leave any white cast, it’s good for oily skin, and it has a nice finish that doesn’t make me look like a grease ball. I also wear this when working out and I would say it seems pretty sweat proof. loving it
