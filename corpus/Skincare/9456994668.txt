Love this. It works really well. Best to use with a moisturizer on top, it can cause very light dryness. I have been doing a lot of research and watching many professional YouTube creators speaking on skin of color (if you’re skin is more likely to tan as opposed to burn when exposed to the sun, it’s highly possible you fall under the category of skin of color). Skin of color requires caution while using products, especially in regards to exfoliants. After much research I went onto Sephora website and typed in Mandelic Acid, this YTTP product came up under my search and I am so pleased with it. I wish I would’ve purchased it when I first found it, however I am in the process of rebuilding my entire skin care products/routine which can be expensive. Mandelic Acid is a gentle exfoliate, not only good for treating breakouts but hyperpigmentation also considered dark spots. To add to the list of great active ingredients includes a BHA- SA (which also helps with breakouts). A little goes a long way using this product. I hope they continue to keep this product in stock and without changes made to the actives ingredient list. I am incorporating this in my new skin care regimen (literally starting my skin care collection over from the bottom to top, with quality working products for my skin needs). I do not use this product daily as I’ve learned that daily exfoliation is not ideal for skin of color. I also suffer from PCOS which can contribute to my hormonal breakouts. I also found to help combat hormonal breakouts, following a regimen for each 4 cycles during your monthly menstrual is beneficial. Meaning evaluate your skin based on where you fall during your cycle. I feel this product is well worth the price. I will probably keep a back up depending on the expiration date. On day’s I don’t use this, I opt for product’s that are non exfoliating for breakout control or dark spots. All the prior reviews helped. awesome product containing great actives.
