Just like a few others have said, I am baffled by all the one-star reviews. This product has sunscreen in it, so of course, it is going to have a different/stronger smell than your regular setting spray. Personally, I love the smell because it makes me think it is actually doing something. Also, the alcohol in it makes it dry super fast which I really like. I have worn this with and without makeup and have never been burnt and it definitely helps my makeup stay on through sweating and hot days. I personally love it.
