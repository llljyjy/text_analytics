Love it. I’m in my 50’s and it’s the perfect finishing product after I use a physical exfoliant, or for nights in between acids and retinol when I take a break from actives. Maybe it’s not for younger skin. No breakouts, definitely sinks into skin rapidly, skin just drinks it up, and is dewy and glowing in the morning. Favourite new splurge product and well worth it.
