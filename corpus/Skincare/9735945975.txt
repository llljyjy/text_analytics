I’m obsessed with this! I haven’t used anything with squalane before this product so I was excited to try it. I was absolutely delighted to see how hydrating it was, I could already see it working in just a few days. I even started using it on my hands that were dry and rough from this winter, and it worked better than any hand or body lotion I’ve tried! I might keep buying it just for that purpose. Super Hydrating!
