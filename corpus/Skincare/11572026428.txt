So far, I only tried this cream as a “mini“ tester that was available for free. I wanted to try it first before purchasing it. I have tried numerous creams and there aren’t many that I recommend. This one, I do recommend. It’s not oily, does not clog pores, has a fresh feel and did not clog my pores. It’s not a heavy cream at all. I likey like!! YES - Buy
