This cream is a nice thick consistency. It has a light natural citrus scent but certainly not an over powering synthetic fragrance. I feel it has significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles and puffiness. I use this day and night. My skin is extra thirsty and this product is the ultimate hydration. With other creams, my face is left thirsty and dry in the morning, but with this I can still feel the moisture.  I absolutely love this cream and will be using it from now on. I cannot stress how much I love this product and highly recommend it to friends and family. Add this to your cart and get it now! My new favorite!!!
