I didn’t feel that the serum did a lot of hydrating for my face, and when I was only halfway done with the bottle the top stopped opening and I found no other way to extract the remaining serum from the bottle. I went to Sephora for a refund but was out of the 60 day window. It’s OK I did not to move the hydration and I was looking for though. Not worth $50 Not great & bottle broke
