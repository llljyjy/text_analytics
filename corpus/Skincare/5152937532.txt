I have stubborn dark body scars that I’ve been trying to fade for a bit, and this has been the most effective at clearing them. Not only has it reduced the color of them, but it also has helped with the texture too. If you’re someone who suffers from dermatillomania like myself, and you’re actively trying to fade scars from picking, this will be your new best friend! Just Go For The Full Size!!!
