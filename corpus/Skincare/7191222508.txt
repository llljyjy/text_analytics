I have been using it for the past 6 weeks or so, and I liked it. I didn’t notice major improvement on my skin, but I can see a slight change on skin tone, it seems it’s getting more even. Also, I feel skin smoother and health after applying it. I started using twice a week and know I’m using every other day. I tried to start using every day, but my skin couldn’t take it, it got sensitive and dry. The product is good, it spread well and it’s rapidly absorbed by skin. It doesn’t have strong smell, which I appreciate. It’s not a very affordable product, but you just need a little,  it will last A couple months, probably, so it worth the price on the long term. Overall, it’s a good product and I hope to see more results in the future. Good retinol
