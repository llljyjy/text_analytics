I bought this moisturizer during the spring savings event and have used it on and off for several months. Right now I have very dry skin due to several acne treatments and actives I am using. Regardless of the acne treatments, I have always been on the drier side. Once I started using this regularly I realized that it really wasn’t hydrating my skin enough. I would wake up with super dry skin. And my makeup would look terrible part way through the day after using this moisturizer, because I was so dry and flaky. I think this product may work wonders on combo or oily skin, but it didn’t work out for me. I think it’s great that it is a clean product though! Not for dry skin IMO
