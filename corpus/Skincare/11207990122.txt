I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest feedback. this sunscreen has a Very light sunscreen smell. Almost no fragrance. The sunscreen itself is a thinner lotion like consistency that applies white but disappears when rubbed in. Applies just like a moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and have no reaction. Wears absolutely beautifully with zero pilling under makeup. Does not make me break out. Love that it has hyaluronic acid in it and is 42 spf. My skin looks great while wearing this!! nan
