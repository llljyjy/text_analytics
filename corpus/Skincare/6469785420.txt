( I received this product for free from Influenster and Goop in exchange for my honest review.) I am 28 years old with combination skin and occasional breakouts and this product has amazed me so far. I’ve used this product once every 3 days for the first two weeks to allow my skin time to adjust. Follow up with moisturizer and go to sleep. My overall skin texture and appearance improved within the first use. My pores appear less visible, skin is glowing and dewy and any breakouts I had were decreased greatly. The serum indicates it can be used as a mask or spot treatment as well- I have not used it in this way, but based on the results I’ve seen I would recommend. No negatives at this time, non drying to my skin, but as mentioned, I’ve been following up with my moisturizer. Smell is slightly herbal and may be off-putting to some, but I do not mind. The only thing I’m not in love with is the retail price, haha. But I would definitely recommend and will likely continue to use unless I can find something comparable at a lower price. nan
