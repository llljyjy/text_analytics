I have never used a toner before but I could instantly feel the difference in my skin after applying. I have very dry skin and this boosts hydration under my regular skin care regimen. Itâ€™s silky, milky with a slight scent. It was the boost of hydration my skin needed. It Did not irritate my skin at all. Love it, will continue to use it daily. Boosts hydration
