I received this in a sample set along with one of their moisturizers.  I found it interesting that it has mushroom in it.  It definitely moisturized my face but I did feel that I went through the bottle quickly.  I think that’s because it’s not oil based so it takes more to spread it over a large area.  I would buy it if it was on a good sale. Mushroom Serum
