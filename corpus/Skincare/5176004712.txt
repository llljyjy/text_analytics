Who is the company? and this what a product! I received this Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Drops. First, I’m 50. I need moisture. I bought this based on reviews and did not receive it free. I am not a watermelon fan- smell or taste. Honestly, I’m really surprised I bought it. But it is amazing. The smell is fabulous and the texture, it is somewhat tacky at first, but it melted into my skin and hydrated so well. And it can be added to makeup concealer for added moisture. For me it is long lasting and that is a good thing for my dry skin. Secondly, this company. I am not familiar with Glow, but bought the Plum Plump moisturizer product as well. The packaging is brilliant. It is quality, sustainable and recyclable. I am very impressed with the forward thinking of their footprint to this earth. Well done! I am now wondering if I need to purchase a couple more of the Watermelon Glow, fearing that it might disappear as is the trend in marketing for better products. Don’t discontinue please. This is a wonderful product and I feel I have bought almost all. WOW!
