I received the IT Confidence in a Cream moisturizer complimentary for my honest opinion. I have been using the IT Confidence in a Cream for about 3 weeks and as I went overseas on vacation. Traveling to a different area can leave your skin dry and dehydrated but I found this to keep my skin very moisturized! It did not break me out! The texture is super light and soft almost whipped consistency. The fragrance is slightly citrus but honestly so light it is not really much of a fragrance at all. I did notice improvement in my skin texture and it helped hide my fine lines. I wore this in a very humid environment and it performed well under makeup as well as overnight. I love it. Very Moisturizing!
