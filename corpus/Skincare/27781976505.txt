I received this product for free from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I have used this product before and was very excited to receive the new formula version of it! I am someone who has dry skin, so this sleeping mask left my skin feeling hydrated and soft in the morning. Been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and it is definitely going into my skincare routine!! Very Hydrating!!
