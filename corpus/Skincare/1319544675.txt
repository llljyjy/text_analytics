I was very impressed with the packaging. I like that the retinol was in a powder form separate from the serum and activated once you combine the products. I enjoyed the texture of the serum and like that my skin felt soft and smooth in the morning. I did not experience any dryness, flakiness, or irritation which is always my concern with a retinol. Overall I think this is a great product. great retinol product
