I’ve never used a cleansing balm to clean my face until I tried the Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm.  I am in love with it!  My face is always dry and this balm does a wonderful job of keeping my skin hydrated while removing all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara.  I love the thick, rich texture of this balm and it has the most heavenly scent from the rose hip oil.  The Vitamin C keeps my skin looking radiant and healthy.  I like that this cleansing balm is a 3-in-1 because this eliminates the need for multiple products, especially when I’m in a hurry! This Cleansing Balm Is Amazing!
