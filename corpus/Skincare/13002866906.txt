I am a huge fan of this brands’ moisturizer so I thought I’d give this product a try. It’s not for me, it took me 3 washes to get all my makeup off and even when I was done I felt like I had a thin film of residue on my face. My face did not feel clean at all. I liked the way it spreads easily and packaging was great; good amount of product for the price. However, I will be returning. Really wanted this to work out
