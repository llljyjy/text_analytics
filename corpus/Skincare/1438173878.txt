I’ve had very dark circles from childhood and after a few uses, this eye cream lightened them slightly. I don’t know the long-term effects of this eye cream, but I’m assuming that with continued use that they’d become even lighter. I have not seen any wrinkle reduction, but that again takes longer use. I did feel instant Smoothing and hydrating effects from this eye cream. It made my eyes look younger and me look less tired. I also think this would be great under makeup. *This product was sent complimentary in exchange for an unbiased review. Younger looking eyes
