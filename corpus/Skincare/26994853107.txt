I only use this twice a week with a hydrating serum and layer of moisturizer to lock it in. I use it on nights I donâ€™t use retinol and a tiny bit goes a long way for a thin layer. It brings any active acne to the surface and leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft. I recommend this for people with acne-prone skin or skin that tends to get clogged. Definitely start off using it once to twice a week then build up if needed. Super helpful for acne prone and/or textured skin
