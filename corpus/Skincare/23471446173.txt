I received these products for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.I like that there wasn’t much of a scent to it. Using this as a face moisturizer was nice. It absorbed nicely and left my skin feeling nice and soft. This product is for dry areas on the body, but I didn’t like it on the body. I put it on my hands, elbows, and feet. It absorbed nicely, but I didn’t feel any difference or added softness. I will continue to use it as a face moisturizer. Not a doby moisturizer
