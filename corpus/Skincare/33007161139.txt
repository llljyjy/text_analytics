This is my first review but I love this serum so much I had to tell everyone!! Been using this product for 2 weeks now and the results are crazy! I thought my skin was moisturized before, but it was dehydrated and I couldn’t figure out what to do. I used this product twice a day before moisturizing and I could immediately see noticeable results in tops 3 days. Not only is the skin under my eyes and on my cheeks brighter and smoother, my skin overall is plumper and I can wear makeup without it clumping and pilling off. My makeup blends perfectly into my skin now- no dry patches or clumps. I’m truly shocked with this product and will 100% be repurchasing. It’s cheap, but genuinely works. I definitely recommend this! Works very fast and has great results!!
