I really like this mud mask. It felt so cooling and refreshing! I kept on the mask until I didnâ€™t feel the cooling effect anymore which was closer to a half hr. And after I took this off and washed the excess off. My face felt so fresh and soft. It was like a breath of fresh air for the skin! I highly recommend this mask esp if you like them.*I received this for testing purposes through Influenster/Vox Box! Breath of fresh air for the face!
