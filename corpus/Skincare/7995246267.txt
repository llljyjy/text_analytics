Great retinol product. I love the texture of this cream, its very lightweight and goes on smooth. I started out using it only a few times a week and then worked up to using it every night. Some retinol creams can really dry out your skin and this one doesn’t. I’ve been using this for about a month now and I already notice a difference in my skins texture and firmness. Great retinol product!
