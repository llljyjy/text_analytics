This is by far the best scrub that I’ve ever used. I’m not one to typically go for products that you can use on face and body but for me, this product is worth making an exception. I recently purchased and have only used a few times but wow can I see a difference. I have combination skin but am sensitive at the same time and this did not irritate me in any way. I also suffer from eczema and many products can irritate me but this did not - neither on my face or body. I really saw and felt the difference in my skin almost immediately. I can’t believe it is so gentle but so deep cleaning at the same time. Highly recommended! Hands down my favorite scrub !
