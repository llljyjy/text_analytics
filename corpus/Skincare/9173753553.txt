This price is insane but I love this product. I wait until sales to stock up, so it makes it a little more reasonable for me to purchase at such a steep price point, but it does help keep my skin clear and is super gentle. I alternate between this and benzoyl peroxide to keep my acne at bay. The smell doesnâ€™t bother me, but I know it does for others. I have repurchased many times. love it! but the price is scary
