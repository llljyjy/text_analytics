My skin type is Oily/Acne prone and I was looking for a clay mask to add to my routine due to the weather becoming a lot hotter (so my skin is much oilier) and I picked this baby up about 1-2 weeks ago. This mask is Great! It applies on real smoothly and does not leave my skin feeling tight at all. I also notice my pores look nice & clean when I wash it off. Totally recommend this clay mask if youâ€™re looking to try one! Awesome Clay Mask!
