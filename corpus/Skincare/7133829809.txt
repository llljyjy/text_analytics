Smells good, although not as strong as their moisturizer. Very lightweight and I appreciate that it is waterproof, reef safe, SPF 50, and doesn’t leave a white cast. It is a bit greasy so I wouldn’t recommend wearing this with makeup but that isn’t out of the ordinary for most SPF. Surprisingly good!
