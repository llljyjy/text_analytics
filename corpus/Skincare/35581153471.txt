This cleanser was okay but I feel like it didn’t clean my skin very well. I never really saw a change in my acne when I used it. It didn’t dry out my skin though, so that’s a plus. It’s also affordable. It wasn’t terrible but personally I don’t think I would buy again. Didn’t seem to do anything for me
