I heard great reviews about this cream, but was hesitant to try. It was it in Sephora favourites set. And let me tell you something. I have never tried something like this in my life. It heals my skin like no other cream, itâ€™s actually so enjoyable to use it, my skin feels so smooth. I always heard Kathleenlights rave about this. And now its my holy grail.  When I saw it was on sale for 15$ I immediately purchased few bottles. OMG, you need this !
