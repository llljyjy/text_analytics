I love a hydrafacial so I really wanted to love this device, but it is awful. The first one stopped working within the first week, and I also used up the concentrate within that time. It just beeped and beeped and the suction never turned back on. I contacted Sephora for a replacement, which they provided (shout out to Sephora customer service!), and which ALSO crapped out within a week. I read the manual multiple times to make sure it wasn’t user error...it’s just a crummy device. The concentrate is super expensive and runs out way too quickly, the waste chamber is tough to clean, and it honestly doesn’t extract blackheads very well. Not recommended. Terrible! 2 died within a month!
