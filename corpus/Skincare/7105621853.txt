The Anti-Aging First Care Activating Serum has become an essential product in my skincare routine. The serum itself feels very lightweight on my skin and has a clean smelling odor. After using it for a week I noticed my skin firming up in areas of concern like my cheeks. Overall the serum definitely helped my skin feel very hydrated. I am so glad to have this product gifted by Sulwhasoo. Great Serum
