I tried Herbivore’s Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative Smoothing Serum since my skin is too sensitive for retinol and I really liked it. Sadly, it’s no longer available, so I got this Moon Fruit serum instead but I was so disappointed! With only 2 uses, my skin became textured and red. I tried again once my skin returned to normal, using it at night a few days apart, and I had the same reaction. Preferred their Bakuchiol Smoothing serum
