This product has a nice fruity scent to it. You apply it like your normal moisturizer. The product absorbs into your skin quickly and it gives you a gradual tan. It develops pretty quickly within the same day. I would definitely recommend this product for an all-over tan. Just remember to wash your hands after application. Great tanner
