Dermologica gifted me this exfoliant and I really like!  A little bit of the powder goes a really long way. At first I thought the powder would feel gritty on my face, but it turns into a really nice, and smooth foam in seconds. Thereâ€™s no scent which is good for us sensitive skin girlies. My face feels really soft when I use it. I Like This!
