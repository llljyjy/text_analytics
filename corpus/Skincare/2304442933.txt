Good serum but packaging is horrible. After using it for few times the cap didn’t work and I try to fix it and just wasted the product by trying to put the cap back on. I still have the product but broken. Just wasted my money. I should have exchange it but I didn’t. I just stopped using it. I probably passed the 60 days return. Oh well Good but horrible packaging
