Disclaimer: I received this product for free from St. Tropez and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.I haven’t used that many self-tanners in my life but this one... is very good. After just a few applications I began to see a good color and actually stopped since I didn’t want to get darker. It was a cool experience to have it give results that quickly. The smell is good, but once applied it went from a sweet fruity watermelon to more of a perfumey scent. Didn’t really like that but it didn’t permeate everything and wasn’t super strong. I highly recommend this for super pale girls like me who just want a little color without going out in the sun.#complimentary #sttropezgradualglow #sttropeztan nan
