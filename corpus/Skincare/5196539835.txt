It’s an actual mud mask so it dries on hard. But you can feel it working, it doesn’t really have a smell. When you wash it off, it makes your skin feel softer automatically. I followed it with the pore remedy serum I got as a sample with the order and I absolutely love the way my face feels this morning. Pores appear smaller, face is nice and smooth. Nothing to complain about. It’s a pretty great mask
