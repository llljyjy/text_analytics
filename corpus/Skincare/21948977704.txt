I was gifted this product from Sephora for my honest review! For someone who is still getting into using these types of masks into my skincare this is a great product! It makes my skin feel amazing afterwards & it wasn’t too harsh! I have sensitive skin and it felt amazing, but I am also that person that needs to feel something to think it’s working haha nan
