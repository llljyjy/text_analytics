at first i was a little skeptical whether this would work to minimize my dark circles or not, but i am so happy i bought it! i’ve had dark circles since i was a child and nothing would make them go away. but this serum… i didn’t even think it was possible but it actually helped. idk what it did but it almost boosted the collagen in the skin under my eyes because it’s not only thicker, but the little wrinkles underneath have also minimized. it does take time to work though as i’ve been using it for a little over a month now but it is so so so worth it!! new holy grail!
