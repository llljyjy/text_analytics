I’ve been using this for around 6 months and at first had a hard time figuring out how to best incorporate it into my skincare routine. I eventually found I like it best with a drop or two mixed into one of my serums. It’s one of those products that it’s hard to say if I can see a difference, but I do think it’s helping protect my skin. It’s easy to use and a little goes a long way- I’ll definitely keep using it. nan
