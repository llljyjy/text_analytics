I received this product free to test from Influenster and I absolutely LOVE IT. It is effective without being too harsh, I have normal skin that is not overly sensitive. When you put the product on it is a lovely texture and once it is on for a few moments it feels warming. I have only been using it for a few weeks but have overall seen a small improvement in my skin. I am excited to continue using this product! Lovely retinol alternative
