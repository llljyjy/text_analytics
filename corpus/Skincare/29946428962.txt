I really appreciated the fact that this moisturizer was packaged with a pump for application, it made it quite easy to apply the recommended amount. The moisturizer itself is very lightweight and absorbs quite quickly, great for summer weather. I donâ€™t know if this will do the trick in the wintertime though, with its lightweight texture, I would have to apply more than once or use a thicker moisturizer. Nice applicator and lightweight moisturizer
