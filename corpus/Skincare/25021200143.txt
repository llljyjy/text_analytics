I love habit and am excited that I can now get them at Sephora! I’m on their text list so I grabbed some more ASAP.  I always forget sunscreen or don’t want to reapply after I’ve done my makeup and this is one of the few that is actually convenient enough to make it work.  No negative reactions from it, just a bit less flushed looking when the suns out.  Might send one to my mom :) Fave
