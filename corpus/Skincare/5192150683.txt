I received this as part of a DE value set and I finally got around to using it after running out of my other cleansing balm. First of the smell isn’t my favourite, but I know with clean skin care there isn’t much you can do about that. In terms of its texture and how it felt on my skin it reminded me a lot of a glue stick and I had a hard time spreading it around my face compared to other balms I’ve tried. It did feel like it cleaned my face and got a majority of the day’s gunk off of my face. Not sure how well it takes off make up since I only use it to help take off sunscreen. nan
