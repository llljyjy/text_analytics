Estee Lauder is timeless! I have used Estee Lauder for years be it cosmetics or their perfumes.I was so excited to be selected to receive thos product from influensters in exchange for my honest opinion and review I love the ease of application.  The cream glides on, is not heavy, oily, or greasy. The scent is not overpowering. I suffer from seasonal allergies and though this was not a miracle against the dark circles that come with allergies, it did help in making them less noticeable. My eye puffiness was reduced. I will be purchasing this in the future. My guess is that once allergy season has subsided that the results will be more visible but given it is helping tremendously now, I will continue to keep using it. Estee Lauder is timeless
