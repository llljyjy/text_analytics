Been using this for about a month now. This was an impulse buy to try something that looks and smells cute. I’ve tried several of Glow Recipe’s products and a lot of them tend to leave my skin feeling oddly sticky. Almost like a sugary sticky? This stuff feels the same for me. I do like that they went with a refillable format for the jar. I’d recommend this for people who are looking for fun and cuteness in their skincare. nan
