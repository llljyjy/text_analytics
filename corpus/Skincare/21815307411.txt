I just purchased and started using it, i love the SOS spray so i imagine I’ll love this as well. But the pump on this thing, and maybe it’s just my product, is super stiff but then when you press down the product spurts out really aggressively. i think it’s still a great product but it’s something I’d love to see the tower 28 team work on. the pump needs improvement
