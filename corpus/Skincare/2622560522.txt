I was really excited for this, but it fell flat. It’s a watery gel-cream. The second you start to spread it out, it feels like you’re spreading water around. I guess I was just hoping for something that felt a little more…substantial on the face?? I would say it’s medium hydrating. It does leave the skin looking very shiny, almost oily rather than glass skin. Overall, not impressed and won’t buy again. Nothing special
