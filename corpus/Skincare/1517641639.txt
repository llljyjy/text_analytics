I received a sample size of this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, the sample size of this product was really only big enough to use for 3 days, only at night. It has a very thick consistency, but it did not melt into my skin really well. It seems like I needed a lot of product just to cover my face and feel moisturized. It also made me totally break out in the 3 days that I used it, so I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive, combination skin. Broke me out
