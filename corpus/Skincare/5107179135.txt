OBSESSED is an understatement. I always loved Kiehls and thought it would just be a nice moisturizing cream for the winter, but it actually turned out to be the PERFECT product. I have awful permanent discoloration on one part of my face from a surgery years ago and I need to use a heavy concealer to cover it up. No matter what lotion, primer, foundation, concealer etc I use, it looks cakey and dry and breaks within a few hours... NOT ANYMORE. This lotion acts as the PERFECT primer and my skin looks flawless. I will continue to buy this again and again. THE BEST CREAM EVER
