I was honestly a bit mind blown at how fast the serum started working.It minimized the appearance of my breakout and evened my skin tone overall overnight. I struggle with combo skin so navigating the oiliness and dryness is a challenge, but this helped with my oil and overall complexion. Iâ€™m so pleased with how this one product accomplished so much so quickly.I hope you give it a try.For those looking for a minimal skincare routine, this is a good product to have. Good intro to using acid serums
