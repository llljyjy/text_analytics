I am loving this new moisturizer/primer from InnBeauty Project.  I am always intrigued by beauty products that claim to have multiple uses and I needed moisturizer and primer so I figured I’d give this a try because it had positive reviews and dope, clean ingredients.  It did not disappoint! I have oily, acne prone skin and this product doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy like many products do that promise to impart a glowy finish.  It leaves my skin glowing and hydrated, yet somehow also mattified? (Not sure how else to explain it, but it’s awesome).  It also holds my makeup in place throughout the day (granted, I also use setting spray from Charlotte Tillbury), and it has pretty much replacement my Bobby Brown Vitamin Face Base which I like but don’t love, plus it’s sooo expensive.I also love that it blurs imperfections.  I have mild dark spots from acne scars and a few signs of aging, (by no means perfect skin), and this product has enabled me to go without foundation and just use blush, bronzer, highlighter, and setting powder and my skin seriously looks gorgeous.  For the price and the fact that it actually delivers on what it promises to do, this stuff has become a favorite in my morning skincare routine.  It also makes me want to try more products by InnBeauty Project, (I actually just ordered their toner).  Super duper impressed and I highly recommend trying this, especially if you have oily skin like me but want a healthy, luminous glow! Healthy glowing skin
