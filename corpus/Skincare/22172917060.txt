it’s ok for blackheads if you pick at them & use it afterward but didn’t really do anything for my real pimples or deep breakouts. I should’ve stuck with my holy grail murad spot treatment but I wanted something cheaper and that’s what I got lol. For the price it does okay, but don’t expect a miracle overnight eh, not great but not bad
