I like that the product was lightweight, however it was a bit sticky for me. that was my initial feeling, but the consistency became less tacky after a few minutes and before my next product application. I like the bottle with the pump being able to be pushed down. iâ€™ll keep note as the weeks pass to see if it stands up t my other serums. Like it enough to keep using!
