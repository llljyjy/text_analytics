I was sent the Dr. Jart Beauty Balm Spf 40 in exchange for an honest review. While the shade I received is not correct for my complexion, I will say this is a great product. Its texture feels similar to foundation, maybe a bit more creamy and I love the added spf protection that it gives. It is light yet very buildable and blends very smoothly. Great product overall, just wished there was a better shade selection. Great product, ok shade selection
