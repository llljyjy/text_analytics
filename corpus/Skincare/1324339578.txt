Didn’t know I NEEDED this until I got a sample. Have since gone on to buy the full-sized bottle. It definitely has a distinct smell which I don’t mind, but I do understand why some are turned off by it (a very medicinal herb smell). I’m not sure what alchemy is behind this product, but when I apply it to my skin it’s as if it creates a barrier between my face and the world - like seals my face. It makes my skin feel stronger.Also, I had sun poisoning on my arm which was not going away despite a month of lotions (including LaMer cream) but 5 days of applying this 2x/day and my skin was healed! Weird smell, but really improves my skin!
