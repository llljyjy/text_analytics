Debating whether I should give this 1 star or 2 stars …. Crème de la mer  is definitely hydrating and moisturizing , but only 30 min to 1hr after application . I apply crème de la mer in the evenings , and the next morning, my skin feels extremely dry and tight , to the point where I need to apply aquaphor all over my face . I believe the fragrance is to blame . This crème is very thick , so if you are not too dry , this might not be the one for you . Felt very waxy and very hard to spread. Oh and by the way , this smells exactly like cetaphil face wash (not a good thing , I hate that smell !) But hey , if you have the money to spend $200 only for 1 oz , go ahead ! Tryit yourself . I have dry acne prone skin and this product was horrible ! Yuck Ok….
