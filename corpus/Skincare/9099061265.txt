I’ve seen slight improvements. For the money… unsure if the results add up to the cost. But I e been using inconsistently for two years. The brand has me sold and I can’t find anything close to receiving any worthwhile results . I simply try to balance products so using Retinol is not an everyday use product. Add up the cost?
