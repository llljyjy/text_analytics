I love everything about this formula - how it’s light, yet rich and creamy, and super hydrating. It has great ingredients including ceramides and peptide lipid complex. I knocked off a star because this formula contains fragrance, which I wish wasn’t included. Otherwise this formula would’ve been perfect! Perfect formula aside from the fragrance
