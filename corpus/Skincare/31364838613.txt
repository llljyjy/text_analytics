I received this in a voxbox from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and I have to say I’m pleasantly surprised. I have been using this for about 1 week now and it may become my new go-to product if it keeps working as it is supposed to. The first 2-3 days of using, I noticed a little more break outs in specific areas, but after that, my skin has been getting significantly better. Fingers crossed it will stay that way. I have very sensitive skin. Anyone that has to deal with oily, sensitive skin that is prone for breakouts knows how hard it is to find a product that actually works and does not cause more problems. The cream smells fantastic although it only has slight scent. Which is great if you want to use it with other products. It leaves a very lightweight feel and , and doesn’t make my skin feel heavy or oily throughout the rest of the day. Even when I used it combined with a liquid make up. I’ve struggled with breakouts and sensitivity my entire life and this has helped to minimize pores while keeping my skin hydrated. You can use it to target specific areas where pores appear to be larger or prone for breakouts. Or use as instructed on the product container/tube all over. I like that it incoporates natural products. The packaging is also so appealing!  Korres knocks it out of the park again. I would consider buying it in the future  and can recommend it if you have oily or sensitive skin like me. Pleasantly surprised
