I really wanted to love this stuff, considering the ingredients are really nice and the price point is a little high. I have very sensitive skin and experienced a long lasting red face after use, up to 2 days. The product was very moisturizing and didn’t need to follow up with an actual moisturizer. This may be a great product for someone with “normal“ skin. Be careful with sensitive skin
