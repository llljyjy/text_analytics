I was very excited to try this serum. I’ve never used anything like it before: it has a 3 in 1 bottle where all 3 formulas come out at once when pressed. The consistency isn’t too thick and I found after about 2 weeks of use my skin is more hydrated (I live in a dry climate and with the changing of the seasons my skin dries out a bit more). This product helped a lot with that and also I’ve noticed I’m not breaking out in my problem areas as much! (What a bonus!) I’m in my 30s so I have some small wrinkles and freckled skin, and I could see a small improvement with them. I’m hoping with longer use that I will see the results more. Also, the scent is very subtle and not overpowering, which I liked. I do wish the bottle had an area where you could see how much product you have left so you can tell when you’re running low. Also, the bottle is plastic and if you drop it, the mechanism to use the 3 serums at once could break, and with how expensive this product is, I would hope the bottle would be more durable in that regard. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. Great formula: Wish the bottle was more durable
