I prefer using this compared to regular self-tanners because I don’t have to worry about it transferring and I don’t have to rinse off the product. I basically spray lines one body part at a time and rub in thoroughly with an old sock (lol). Rub in as if it were moisturizer, and you won’t get streaks. I do two coats on my legs. Then I usually clean up my room or go on my phone for about 20 minutes while it dries down. I try to stand most of the time to avoid creases. Again, I much prefer taking 30 minutes to do this process then have to take the whole day like with other tanners! RE: white clumps in bottles- I think this happens as the products sit on the shelf longer than a couple months. I pulled mine out after winter and found that it had some clumps too. It worked like normal! Natural-looking tan!
