It was refreshing to experience an effective product that is unscented and unobtrusive. Also, I loved that the cleanser did itâ€™s job without soapy bubbles and its possible residue. It had a rich, creamy texture that felt great on the skin and did its job in removing oil from your skin but without stripping it so that it felt dry. My face felt soft and moisturized upon rinsing. Quietly effective!
