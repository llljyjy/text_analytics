I love this Ole Hendrickson Banana Bright Eye Cream that I received as a complimentary sample from Influenster! I’ve been a fan of this company’s products in the past, and they continue to impress me. The cream itself has a lovely yet faint banana-crepe-like scent to it, it’s not at all overpowering and smells natural. The formulation is the perfect consistency and viscosity, being a nice thick cream-like texture without being too thick or greasy or leaving a residue. It goes on like butter, and can easily be applied before you begin your makeup routine. I felt like after using this product for a week and a half straight, my dark circles definitely lightened a bit and the overall appearance of my under eyes just seemed more supple and nourished. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, and I am definitely considering making this a purchase once I run out of this one! My new favorite eye cream!
