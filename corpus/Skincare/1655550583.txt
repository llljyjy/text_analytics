This is one of the best sunscreens I’ve ever used. It checks off all my boxes (clean, mineral, higher than spf 35 etc) and looks and feels amazing. I have a light medium olive complexion and this leaves no white cast at all, and gives a beautiful dewy glow. I’m actually surprised I haven’t heard/seen more hype about this sunscreen! I have not had the same issue as many others with the product overflowing however I did have the issue of the outer layer of the packaging flaking off and getting all over my face. Now that im running low i also realized since the top part of the bottle right before the nozzle bit is kind of squared off, a lot of product is probably just sitting there when I invert the bottle instead of it flowing down into the nozzle if that makes sense.  The packaging is super annoying, but honestly I love the product so much that I will continue to repurchase. I just hope they can figure out better packaging without changing the formula. Great spf, crap packaging
