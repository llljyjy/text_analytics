This one in my opinion is a decent product. It feels a bit sticky at first but then it absorbs right under my skin and keeps my skin hydrated. Now, however, I have been using it for a week and does not see an instant result (pore minimizing) yet. Will keep using and keep you guys updated! Also, this one is fragrane-free. Decent Serum, just in my opinion.
