First off, this smells as expensive as it is…which is UNREAL. But past that, it has completely changed my mind as far as how much moisturizers REALLY “make a difference” in your routine. After putting it on my skin is bouncy, glowy and feels so hydrated without any stickiness or that terrible feeling like it’s not absorbing. I’ve always been blown away by CT products and this is no exception - A+!!! Bouncy skin without being greasy!
