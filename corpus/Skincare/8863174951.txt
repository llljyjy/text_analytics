I am so happy to see Herbivore returning to their roots with 1% bakuchiol in their products! This is a surprisingly thick and very nourishing eye cream - marvelous for dry skin. Packaging feels luxurious and I always appreciate glass packaging for its sustainability factor.I will caution that this may not be best for sensitive skin due to the long list of plant ingredients (largely due to the risk of allergy), but it has been working well for my tougher eye area. It does have a natural purple tint (no dyes!) and a bit of a berry smell to my nose (via the natural ingredients)Iâ€™ve seen an immediate boost in moisture since I began using this, and hope to see the benefits of bakuchiol long term! nan
