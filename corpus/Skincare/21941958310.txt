I used this wrinkle correcting cream in the morning and at night. It went on nice. Didn’t feel greasy, absorbed very well. The smell wasn’t offensive, smelled like other Clinique creams. I received a teeny tiny sample as a free gift #freeproduct. It was barely enough for four applications. That’s why I can’t say anything about it’s wrinkle correcting abilities. Overall ok. Overall ok
