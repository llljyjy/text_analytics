The texture of this cream is thick but has a whipped consistency that reminds me of marshmallow fluff. Love that. The lemongrass scent, however, is not appealing and makes me dread application. I’ve noticed that I’m breaking out more than usual after starting this cream, with little to no positive results. Won’t be buying again. Great texture, bad smell, few results
