This one was such a bummer for me. I love The Ordinary serums and treatments. They work so well on my skin and do make a noticeable difference, so I had high hopes for this one.My skin is combo; oily t-zone and dry patches on cheeks. I also have sensitive skin and did notice some redness and breakouts the next day after using this. This moisturizer takes so long to absorb and for some reason my face keeps sweating while I wait for it to sink in. Once it does dry my skin feels incredibly tight and the furthest thing from hydrated. I will say that, at the very least, it does control shine in my t-zone but it does absolutely nothing else! Also, use this product sparingly as it can leave a white cast if you apply too much.Unfortunately this product is a no-go for me. Iâ€™ll probably switch back to my Neutrogena Hydro Boost. Really disappointed with this one. Why The Ordinary? WHY?!
