I’ve tried many Vitamin C Serums throughout my skincare journey and this is hands down one of favorite formulas. Its so lightweight and has a nice slip/absorption as I work it into my skin, which makes it layer beautifully under my other products (moisturizer, SPF, makeup). I also love the packaging and how easy it is to use - you just have to be cautious of how firmly you pump so you don’t dispense too much product. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective Vitamin C serum that leaves your skin glowing! A Vitaminc C Serum for Me
