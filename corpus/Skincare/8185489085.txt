I received this moisturizer for free in exchange for my honest review of it. For the price I expected to love this moisturizer, however it was just ok. I didn’t love the fragrance, it’s not very strong, but it’s very unnecessary. This moisturizer almost felt greasy on the skin and didn’t last all day, my skin felt like it needed more several hours later. For the price, I would skip this product. Just ok
