Really loved this product! It felt so smooth and soft while going on. Was not greasy or heavy. My face felt so moisturized through out the day and even the next morning! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great moisturizer that does not make you skin feel like you caked stuff on or make sensitive skin break out. nan
