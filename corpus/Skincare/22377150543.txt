This is the Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream. When I applied the cream to my face; I do feel a slight burning sensation but it t goes away on its own. I’m happy to say that this product’s scent is faint yet pleasant. I’ve also took notice that my face feels smooth; unlike the many times I would apply different products that make my face oily. It is hydrating especially the next day; it’s refreshing. It’s also nice to know that this is an affordable skin care product. nan
