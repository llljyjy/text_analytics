This is the BEST self tanner I have ever tried!! I’m slightly darker than fair, and the dark color is perfect for me and buildable. I see people complaining about how long it takes for the color to show up but I think that’s totally fine. This isn’t that type of self tanner where you wear it for one night and then it washes off. I usually spritz my entire body at night, use a tanning mit to rub it in, and then wait till it’s fully dry before putting on pjs and getting in bed. It’s never rubbed off on my clothes or my white sheets. When I wake up in the morning my skin is GLOWING. Freshly tanned and it lasts for almost a week! If I want to build up the tan, I’ll repeat my nighttime spritzing process 2-3 nights in a row, and if I start on a Monday, by The Weekend I look like I’ve spent days in the beach in Hawaii. I definitely plan on buying this over and over again. Also I just ordered the fast mist to see how that is! 10/10 starts!! BEST SELF TANNER!! Buildable and lasts for days
