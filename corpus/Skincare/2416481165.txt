I cant say anything that i liked about this product. The pump is messy you need to shake it alot or it will be runny. I applied it and my face just looked greasy and it was stinging my face and the smell is horrible i just wanted to wash it off. It flaked off my dry skin patches. Does it help with discoloration? i wouldnt know as it was too strong for my skin. The price is too much for the product. Not for me
