As an avid skin care connoisseur, the Summer Fridays Cloud Dew Gel Cream Moisturizer was a good option for those who enjoy a creamy yet delicate product on their skin without leaving you feeling oily. I personally would have given this 5/5 stars if it had a scent. So for my scent-free product loving girlies out there, this one is for you. Good without any scent
