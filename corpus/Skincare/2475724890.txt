This face mask smells nice and light and feels moisturizing on. I felt like my skin was cleansed after use and overall I thought it was a good mask. I like that it had a portion just for adhering to my nose because that is hard to get. Cons: I felt like the applicator was sort of hard to unfold and didnâ€™t stick to all of my face. It also started irritating my skin towards the end of the timer, so I would suggest using it for less time if you have sensitive skin. I received this complimentary from Influenster! Nice light purifying mask
