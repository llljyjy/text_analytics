Beautiful packaging as always and the serum feels very luxurious. However, my issue with this serum is in the ingredients. Alcohol (yes, plain alcohol) and fragrance are completely unnecessary (and irritating) in a serum and I was surprised to see a company like Shiseido would include them in this expensive luxury product. The beneficial ingredients and extracts are at the very bottom of the list too meaning their concentration is so minimal. I really wanted to like this but I find it makes my skin a bit red which is not worth it to me. Alcohol and Fragranceâ€¦.in a serum?
