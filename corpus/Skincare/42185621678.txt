I was very excited to test and review Clarins Double Serum as I felt it is well made and would benefit my skin. As a 46 year old, my skin is starting to get fine lines and feels dry.  This double serum was a fantastic addition to my skincare routine. My skin was moisturized and felt hydrated all day!  The scent was nice and light, not overpowering which was pleasant. The trial packaging was a bit tricky at first to get all of the product out. I used it for the full 7 days and although I didn’t see a huge change with fine lines, the hydrating part makes me want to purchase again knowing it’s doing wonders for my skin Moisturizing and Hydrating!
