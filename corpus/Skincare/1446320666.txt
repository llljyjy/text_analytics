5I received a sample of this product compliments of Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. I am an aging woman, from a hot and humid climate with combination skin and must be honest that this product surprised me! Light scent, thick and creamy texture, absorbs beautifully! Using the moisturizer twice a day I noticed a difference in elasticity and suppleness of my skin. The scent does not linger and is not over powering but smells fresh. Overall- this product does what it’s meant too. A little goes a long way…
