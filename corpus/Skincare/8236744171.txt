I had high hopes for this sunscreen, but it was similar to most other sunscreens on the market. It protected me from the sun. The formula went on with a slight cast that did disappear quickly on my light skin tone. It still felt and looked like other sunscreens, slightly greasy feel and shiny. I did not wear makeup over it.  It did not absorb into the skin, but most sunscreens don’t on me.Over all: it’s nice; it works; it’s nothing special. Good, not great
