I received the IT Confidence in A Cream from bzzagent campaign. I am going to be honest about the moisturizer.  I have a little texture on my skin and I wanted to try it. Let me tell you, this moisturizer really works. It absorbs fast in my skin and it isn’t greasy. It helped with my texture on my skin. I was very pleased with it. I used it as a primer before I put on my makeup. My makeup stays on all day. I would recommend this product to family and friends. I am going to continue buying it in the future because I had no idea this moisturizer is the prayer to all my answers. It is an amazing product! You should try it and you won’t be sorry. Amazing moisturizer
