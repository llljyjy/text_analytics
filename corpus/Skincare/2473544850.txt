My new summer go-to product! With the summer, I tend to go for a less-is-more makeup look. The brightening effect of this cream allows me to go the whole day without concealer.  For those who do like to put on makeup after eye cream, I haven’t found a problem when I used concealer if I’m feeling a bit extra. I like how this also makes me look less tired, thus brightening up my face. I’d also like to add that my eye area feels hydrated and soft after using it. The texture itself of the cream goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly. Will definitely keep using as I’d like to see if it improves my overall skin texture. nan
