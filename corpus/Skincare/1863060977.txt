I wanted to love this product because it truly does leave my skin looking hydrated but unfortunately it also irritated it. My skin would turn extremely red after applying this. It has fragrance in it so I’m sure that’s what irritated my skin. If you’re sensitive to fragrance, stay away. But if you have dry skin that isn’t sensitive, then it is definitely a must. good for dry skin that isn’t sensitive
