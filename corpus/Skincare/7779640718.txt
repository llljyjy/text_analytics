I received a single sample of this product via topbox as a #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review.I used this sample once only so I can’t say more than this : it applied well and absorbed well. It has no fragrance-as all Clinique products. It doesn’t leave a residue but it leaves the skin plumped. I can’t say anything about the long term benefits since the sample was minuscule.  I am not sure if  I will purchase a full bottle since it is quite expensive. I trust Clinique to put good products out there , so that would be  a reason to give it a try, but my advice to skincare companies is , if you want people to write reviews about your products, make sure you sent them at least one week supply for people to have a well informed opinion about your products. possible good product
