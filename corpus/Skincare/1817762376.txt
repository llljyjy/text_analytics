I enjoyed how this cream felt on my skin initially. Glided onto my face and absorbed well without feeling greasy. Unfortunately, I didn’t feel it had moisture staying power. My skin felt dry and flakey after a few hours. I expect a cream product to be full of moisture so this was a bit disappointing. I think for someone who doesn’t need a lot of moisture this product will suit them well. Again, I liked the initial effect of the cream, just not one I would use expecting it to give me long lasting mouisture. Feels good on my skin.
