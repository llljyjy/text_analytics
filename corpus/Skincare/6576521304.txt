I loved this serum. It feels nice on the skin, it’s pretty oily but since my skin type is dry it absorbs the serum well. Over the serum I apply my gel moisturiser and it locks the hydration! In the morning my skin was still glossy! I didn’t really see a huge anti aging effect because I used it only over a few days because they were samples, but I can see my skin glowing if I continued to use it. The smell is divine and it leaves a lovely glow.
