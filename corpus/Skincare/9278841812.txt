I was looking for the philosophy micro exfoliant facewash and when I learned Sephora didn’t carry it the sales associate showed me this product. LET. ME.TELL. YOU. GOOOOODDDDD LORDT. This product have cleared my skin ten fold. I don’t have a long skin care routine and with this....I do not need one. My pores are clear and small, my skin is smooth and clear. It is a little rough but I can literally feel it taking the pollution out of my pores. Absolutely unreal. I used to HATE clinque because I thought their products were poorly made, over marketed and not effective but this one right here is the exception. Highly recommend if you are looking for a micro exfoliant that does everything. I look like a freshly glazed donut.
