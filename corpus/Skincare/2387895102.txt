I want one eye cream I can use day and night so this was a fail because it is high shimmer like a liquid highlighter. I didn’t find the shimmer flattering during the day because it highlights pores and I personally don’t put highlighter on my eyes in the same areas I would put an eye cream. I consider this more of a makeup product and not a very standout one. Thankfully what I used was a sample otherwise I would have returned it. highlighter
