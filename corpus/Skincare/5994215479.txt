Works fine as an overnight mask but absolutely needs to be washed off the next morning or it will be Pill City with primer/foundation application (am baffled by reviewers who say they wear this as a moisturizer or under makeup!). I don’t always want that extra step in the morning so will only use this on nights when I know I won’t be wearing makeup the next day. For my money, I’ll stick with B Hydra, which delivers similar results but actually absorbs fully and plays nice with other skincare/makeup products. Nice but adds an extra step
