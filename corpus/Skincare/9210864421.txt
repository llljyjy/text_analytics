Did not like this. It clogged my pores so much and I am still trying to clear my face up. It was nice at first, but really really hard to remove. The scent is very strong and your face will feel heavy all day. I usually really like Fenty products but this one was a big no. Will not be using and do not recommend, specially if you have oily skin. pass
