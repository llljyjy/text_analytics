I used it consistently day and night for two months until I ran out. I didn’t notice a huge difference when it comes to dark spots and hyperpigmentation. The texture is nice but it leaves a sticky film on the skin. Although I’m not a fan of citrusy scents this one was not overpowering and faded quickly. Overall, I don’t think I will be repurchasing. Oh well, the search for the dark spot holy grail continues.. Didn’t hate it, didn’t love it
