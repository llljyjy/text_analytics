first of all the price is kind of outrageous for such a tiny bottle, which is why i got the mini first. a little does go a long way, but i’m new to face oils so I dont have much of a point of reference. I will say I do love the product, I have like a 9 step skincare routine and I think this really enhances those by locking everything in overnight bc I wake up every morning still feeling moisturized. it’s hardly greasy but I don’t use too much, maybe a drop or two! I hope the bottle lasts, now that it’s nearing winter I can see myself using it during the day for added protection against the nyc wind and cold worth it if you can afford it
