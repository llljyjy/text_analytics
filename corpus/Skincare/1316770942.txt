So I am disappointed in this sunscreen because I love the way it does not sting. I didn’t break out like some reviews provided here and the white cast…as soon as mu skin absorbed the cream…I was ok. It was a perfect sunscreen until I met with my dermatologist. She said the sunscreen has ingredients which are banned from various states and countries. Some of the ingredients are banned due to affects in ocean water which has caused bleaching of coral reefs.  In addition, and surprisingly… advised to use coppertone mineral face sunscreen. It’s inexpensive and a better option. I will be surprised if this gets posted since I mentioned a product not sold by them. nan
