Unfortunately I missed the return window and forced myself to use the product so as not to waste it - I ended up throwing half of it out…it left an awful film on my face after rinsing it off - even after double cleansing. Does not effectively remove makeup or sunscreen. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Clinique cleansing balm (I will go back to the Clinique product as it’s well worth the money). nan
