This cream is very thick and does leave your skin smooth but it also leaves it slightly greasy and I’m not a big fan of the smell. The greasy feeling does go away after a bit so that’s not to bad and it does leave your skin feeling smooth. My main dislike is the scent; it’s like a heavy lotion smell if that makes sense. The scent is my main reason for the 3 stars. So-So
