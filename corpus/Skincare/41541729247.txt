I have been using this toner for a little over two weeks now and I love it! I was kind of hesitant to use this because most toners I have used in the past give my skin a burning sensation along with drying out my skin with that tightness feeling. I have another toner that is my usual go to to avoid this, but I am so glad to say that this toner will be another go to of mine. I donâ€™t feel any dryness, tightness to the skin, and no burning sensation like other toners! Also a little goes a long way. My skin has definitely felt hydrated and is looking glowy! A win for me!
