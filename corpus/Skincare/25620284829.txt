When I first opened the jar and smelt the strong rose scent I was initially concerned. It smells lovely, but some moisturizers with heavy fragrance can cause me to breakout, as I have sensitive skin. Luckily that was not the case at all - I’ve have had no issues with breakouts or irritations since using it for the past 2 weeks as my evening moisturizer. It feels great going on, super silky and gives my skin a nice soft glowy finish (thanks to the shea butter). Its a bit on the thicker side, which is also why I’ve been using it in the evening, but not too thick - it definitely hydrates and I’ve found my skin looking more ’awake’ and bright in the mornings. And finally I’ll just add - the jar it comes in is super luxe and cute :) a super nice addition to my skincare collection. nan
