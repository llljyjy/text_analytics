I went through a travel then full size bottle over the course of a year. When finished, I went a couple months trying different oils/balms in its place and noticed that my skin wasn’t as clear as it consistently stayed when I used Saint Jane daily. It is an oil as opposed to a standard serum so I use this over my moisturizer to create more of an occlusive layer at night. I think any skin type could benefit from this! P.S. This doesn’t smell manly... Makes a difference in the long run!
