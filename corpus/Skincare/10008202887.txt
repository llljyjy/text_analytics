This stuff is literally amazing!!! Within the first week of using I had so many people complementing me on my skin! I use it at night and as primer before I put my makeup on. I have pretty dry skin so it worked really well for me. If you have oily skin I wouldn’t recommend because it does get a lil oily. The only negative thing I have to say is the smell is bad smells a lil like rotten milk but I don’t mind because of how good my skin looks! Holy grail!
