This is my 4th day using the product. This time I applied at 10 minutes after the shower. The deeper layers of my skin or still rather wet but it applied nicely. I mostly use it on my face and my ring finger as it gets dry from the soap under it. I only needed to apply that once the second day and this is already healed. I’m holding my phone doing this review and I feel the silky smooth consistency. There’s no heavy take residue. It applies so nicely and comes out of the tube rather sick but not to the point where it is like a paste. I would definitely work this into my regular skin care regimen. It’s a little pricey but you get what you pay for. You can always ask this for a gift or just treat yourself and it goes a long way. If we pay between 45 and $60 for a haircut why wouldn’t one do that for face cream you apply everyday. This stuff is so good you don’t even need to use it everyday. I use it yesterday morning and woke up this morning with my face super smooth. It feels like butter. I don’t have any skin problems neither oily or dry. But to have a product key on your face a whole day is amazing Silky smooth top of the line recover cream
