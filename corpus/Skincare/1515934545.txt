I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review.I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now, I do like it but not sure if it’s something I would repurchase. My skin is on the drier side, especially my under eyes and this feels very smooth and hydrating on my skin, it’s almost like a lip balm for your under eyes. I like how soft it makes my skin feel. Other than the hydration, I haven’t really noticed any other benefits. It may be helpful to use my regular eye cream and apply this on top. One thing I have really found it helpful for is applying this 5-10 minutes prior to applying my concealer and it makes my concealer look great and go on very smoothly. I’m looking forward to continue using it and see if anything changes. nan
