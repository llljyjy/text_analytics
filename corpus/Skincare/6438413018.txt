This is the first time in writing a review because I absolutely love this product. I only bought this product before because it’s eyelash extension friendly (doesn’t contain Glycol which melts down adhesive… found out most lash serums contain this and this is the only one that specifically notes extension friendly in label too) HOWEVER I have the OILIEST freaking eyelids ever and this has changed that. I used to literally have to wear primer on my eyelids even wearing no makeup because it would be so bad my slippery eyelids would swell and the excess oil would get in my eyes and cause dryness/tiny styes due to clogged meibomian glands. When I tell you I occasionally  see an optometrist to squeeze the oils clogged out of my waterline it’s such a nuisance. Ever since starting I’ve stopped having oily eyelids and not need to wear makeup!!! The thin coat you put on literally stays on all day and keeps you refreshed :) I’ve also felt that my eye bags are less puffy. Literally wearing this and clear mascara throughout the day with a nice eyelash curler lift is the best natural look ever!! BEST FOR OILY EYE LIDS AND LASH EXTENSIONS!
