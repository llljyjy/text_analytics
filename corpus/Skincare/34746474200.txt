I received a 1 ml sample of this serum #trywithtopbox  #freeproduct to try.  It was enough for using just twice, in the morning and evening.  The scent was not strong, and the texture was nice too.  The serum absorbed by the skin well, providing enough moisture and hydration. On top of this, the product didnâ€™t provoke any irritation. A good product but a tiny sample
