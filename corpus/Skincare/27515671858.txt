I loveeeeee this cleansing balm, it’s super hydrating and I have very dry skin. My regular skincare routine without this product added is just cerave dry skin cleanser and aquaphor, my skin absorbs the aquaphor and I have to reapply so that I don’t feel so dry, but since I’ve added this I’ve noticed I don’t really have that problem anymore, my skin feels a lot more soft and less dry than before so I’m very happy I tried this. I recommend if you have dry skin like me and don’t have much experience with cleansing balms. It’s super easy to work with. amazing cleansing balm :))
