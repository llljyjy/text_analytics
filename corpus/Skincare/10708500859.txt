If you are fair I would not recommend this. Its tinted but it was ORANGE on me and very patchy. I tried using a little at a time and still had the same problem of it being patchy and turning me orange (I tried showing in on my hand in the picture). It has a strong sunscreen smell so if you don’t like that don’t pick this up. Overall I was not a fan. Not a fan
