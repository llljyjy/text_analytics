I found this balm to work great in conjunction with my Gua Sha. It definitely has a thicker balm like consistency but melts into my skin and allowed my Gut Sha to glide without causing any tension. It has a pleasant earthy scent and did not cause any clogged pores, breakouts or skin irritation on my somewhat sensitive acne prone skin. The main reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to the high price and small amount of product received. However, a very small amount is needed so I hope it lasts a long time! Relaxing & Calming
