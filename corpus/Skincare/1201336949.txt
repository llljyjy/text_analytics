My skin loves this product! Iâ€™m in my mid 30s, have very sensitive and dry skin. This cream has very thick whipped texture. I applied it as the last step of my skin routine. My skin feeling so soft and smooth the next morning! I love it has a very calming herbal scent that reminiscent my sleep oil blend. I will definitely repurchase the full size! My Dry and Sensitive Skin loves it!
