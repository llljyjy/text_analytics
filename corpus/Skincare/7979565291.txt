Thanks Topbox for this #freeproduct. I’m a huge fan of Laneige products so I was excited to try out another one of their products. I love that this eye cream has hyaluronic in it as it’s an ingredient that helps to hydrate and plump. This product has a very little scent and isn’t irritating. It feels smooth and lightweight under the eyes which I like as well. The product size is very reasonable and will last quite awhile. #trywithtopbox nan
