I’m not quite sure what all the hype is about this product.  This product works, but does the same thing as less expensive natural, clean skin care products.   Feels light and creamy going on and isn’t greasy.  I have oily skin and this didn’t add to the oil, which is good.  If you have tons of money to burn and don’t care if your products have toxins, then check it out. Nothing Special
