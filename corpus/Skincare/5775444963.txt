I am forever a big laneige fan. They are so affordable and the products ACTUALLY WORK. I started using this at night to see how my dry skin and hormonal acne would react to first time using vitamin c, I put a few squirts on a cotton pad (a little goes a long way) and after applying on my face I padded with my hands and put on a nice moisturizer. Right away my skin had more glow from this product. I used it for two weeks now and the results are amazing my acne is almost cleared up no breakouts or rashes and my skin feels so healthy and hydrated. Thank you for making another amazing product this is one that I will purchasing!! I received this as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox. Super happy with this product!!
