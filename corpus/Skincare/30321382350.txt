I have acne-prone skin (although it’s much better than it used to be) and a lot of hyperpigmentation on my cheeks from when my hormonal acne was at its worst. I’ve been using this product for a few days and I already can tell a difference in my skin! Even after one use, my face feels so much smoother. I have textured skin, especially on my forehead, and this has helped it tremendously. It’s too soon to tell but I’m hoping this brightens up my red marks from having acne - the vitamin C should really help! Lastly, the packaging is beautiful!! My skin is so smooth!
