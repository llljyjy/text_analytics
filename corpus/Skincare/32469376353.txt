Wish I could give this product less than one star. It is seriously god awful. Every line and crease is highlighted. Not to mention this product pills and crusts like you would not believe. It is an awful pinky color too that looks odd even on my fair skin and does not blend well at all. Most regrettable beauty purchase I ever made, especially because the store would not take it back (despite barely being used and proof of purchase in my Sephora account). I could not hate it more
