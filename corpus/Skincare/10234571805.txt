I have really been enjoying this product for the past month. I appreciate the fact that I can’t detect any discernible scent from it. I like wearing it by itself and with my primer and makeup. My skin is very dry, and I enjoy how smooth and glowy it makes my face feel. You may find that your makeup doesn’t stay on as perfectly as it would without it, but I don’t mind how my makeup wears throughout the day, and I would rather have the SPF protection than not. I also keep a travel size bottle of the SPF setting spray at my desk at work so I can add more sun protection throughout the day while wearing makeup. If it’s a no-makeup day, I will apply throughout the day, sometimes blotting my face with a tissue to remove older product before applying a new layer. I wouldn’t recommend putting this product on your eyelids if you sweat a lot—doesn’t feel great when it runs into your eyes. As someone who is trying to incorporate SPF into their everyday skincare routine, I think these are very useful products that streamline the process. Great for dry skin
