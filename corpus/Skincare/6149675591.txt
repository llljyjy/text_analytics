This is one of my favorite products. Everything about it works for my reactive/rosacea skin. It instantly calms down any redness. It’s a treat to use. The scent is great too. I definitely recommend this to everyone if you’re looking for a nice, lightweight, soothing moisturizer to add to your routine. It’s especially nice to use at night. Great for soothing reactive skin
