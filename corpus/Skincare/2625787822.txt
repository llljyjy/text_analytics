To start: I bought this product myself. I got this because I’ve been experiencing some breakouts mainly on my chin and forehead (probably related to wearing masks and hats, but maybe also hormonal). I’ve been using serums, but they weren’t resolving everything, so I thought I’d try a new cleanser. The texture is creamy, which can be a little disconcerting for someone with oilier, acne-prone skin who has always avoided creamy cleansers. This cleanser is great, though. It doesn’t strip my skin, and I’ve been able to use it 2x a day when I want. It has noticeably helped reduce my active breakouts. New ones still appear, but this helps reduce the number and size. Follow the instructions—really take your time massaging this over your trouble areas. Good cleanser to reduce breakouts
