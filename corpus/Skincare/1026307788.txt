It just didnâ€™t work for me. I have hormonal acne prone skin and niacinamide has changed my life since I started using it, so I had lots of expectations on this particular product. I tried using it in the mornings layering it with the rest of my routine and I just found it to be kind of oily and hard for my skin to absorb. Switch it to my nocturnal routine but I still think is hard to layer it with other products. nan
