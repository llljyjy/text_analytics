I received this in a sample size from influenster in exchange for my honest review. While this product wasn’t quite as rich as I like my moisturizer to be, I can see where it would be perfect for someone looking for something light. It did make my skin feel silky smooth afterwards, and the smell was subtle, natural, and pleasant. I love this brand in general, and will probably try another of their products in this line. I didn’t receive enough to see if it affected my pores over time, but scientifically, the claim checks out, as it contains salicylic acid. As an added bonus, SA also helps to clear up acne. I wouldn’t use this at the same time as a retinol or rx retinoid, because it could be very drying and even counterproductive, just as a heads up. It works well under sunscreen and makeup, and didn’t pill. Great stuff!
