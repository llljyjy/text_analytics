This is a really nice eye cream they provided excellent hydration and visibly reduces puffiness.  I’ve been using it a few days and have enjoyed how hydrated my eyes feel.  The formula is rather thick and a little goes a long way.  It is virtually scent free and does not cause any irritation.  I was pleasantly surprised by the results after only a few uses. Súper Hydrating  Eye Cream
