I love this product so much! It works well at cancelling out my redness and uneven skin tone while allowing my skin to still look like skin. It feels light on the face. It’s doesn’t cancel out all the redness of acne but It does make my skin look clearer. Interested in seeing the longevity of the product especially in the summer months. Definitely plan of substituting foundation for this. In terms of the cons, I would recommend using a good moisturizer before this product as it does cling to dry skin. It does also crease in the eyelids. These are all minor things I can overlook though based on the end result of using this product. nan
