Pros: great natural color tan (brown, not orange), thick cream leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized for a solid amount of time.Cons: because the product is thick it gets stuck in the bottle and because the bottle is also thick it’s impossible to squeeze all the product out. When i get towards the end of the bottle I need to cut it in half to scoop out the remainder. I love the color so much I think it’s worth the inconvenience but others might not nan
