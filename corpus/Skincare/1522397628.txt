I have used this cream frequently but I haven’t noticed too much of a difference in soothing my skin or smoothing even minimal lines. It’s a heavy cream so it seems to be quite moisturizing which is great! The reusable pot is also an amazing idea (you can swap out the internal cream pod). I will say though, the smell is horrible. Even my boyfriend commented on how bad it smells. Reminds me of my mothers face cream 20-30 years ago when scent wasn’t a selling point and it just simply smells like ingredients. Moisturizing but not smoothing
