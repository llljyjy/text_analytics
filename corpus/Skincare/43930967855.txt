I can’t say enough about how much I love this product. I have VERY sensitive skin and have been searching for a moisturizer that doesn’t make me skin breakout for years. I finally found it/ This product goes on smooth and light, with no greasiness, no perfumes, and no unwanted side effects. My skin began looking better immediately, and has gotten smoother and even better looking in the two weeks I’ve been using it. Finally a Moisturizer that Doesn't Cause Breakouts
