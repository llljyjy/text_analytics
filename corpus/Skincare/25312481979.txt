I have been using this for two weeks, I use this after washing my face then vitamin c, hyaluronic acid,  moisturizer then this Retinoid. It claims that it reduces fine lines, wrinkles and uneven tone. Well, base on my experience, some of my fine lines are still there, I have some wrinkles still but I must admit that my skin tone improved which is good.  Maybe I need to use it more as two weeks isnâ€™t enough to prove that it works for fine lines and wrinkles. The consistency is just right for me, not so thick and not so thin. Overall, I still like it.  This is gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. Hope it will do more
