I was nervous to try this product because so many people complained about pilling. I did not have this issue thankfully! I do want to mention that my entire skincare routine is Glow Recipe, which is perhaps why this works for me. So far no breakouts! I did notice some stinging on my eyelids when applied in that area though. nan
