Was so disappointed with this sunscreen. It has a nice texture out of the tube and a pleasant, not overwhelming smell. However, it pills HORRIBLY. I bought this to wear under my makeup and its impossible to wear if you plan on touching your face within 30 minutes of putting it on. Would not recommend. Pills horribly
