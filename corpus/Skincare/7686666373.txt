knowing this product had argan oil which I’m sensitive to, I still decided to use it to see if I could keep some wrinkles away. it worked. it actually smoothes the incoming wrinkles, but I simply can’t use it everyday since I’m really sensitive to the argan oil which makes my skin itchy. with that said, I still use the cleanser and cream periodically because it does work...however I probably won’t buy again unless they make a product without the argan oil. works but use with caution
