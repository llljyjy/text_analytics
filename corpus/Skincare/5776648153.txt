This soothing cleanser feels like combination of the Papaya Sorbet cleanser and the Blueberry Bounce one. It thoroughly cleanses the skin, but without the drying effects you get with so many cleansers. Seems well-suited for normal, dry, or sensitive skin. Iâ€™m still undecided how it would work for more oily skin. Definitely worth giving a try! Very Moisturizing
