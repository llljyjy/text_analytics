Wow ok so where to start? I was so excited to try this! I love Kiehl’s products but for whatever reason I have horrible luck with moisturizers. They never work and always burn! But this one worked! One of two I’ve found and the texture is so nice. Cooling, thick yet somehow water like and sinks in. Try it for that alone. This texture!
