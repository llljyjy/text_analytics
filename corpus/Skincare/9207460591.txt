I was looking for something to give me “sun kissed glow” that wouldn’t break me out and the Sephora employee recommended this.. I was told the smell was relatively mild & that is untrue it has quite a potent scent.. however as quite the pale chick I went ahead and decided to give it a try.. I only mixed in 2 small drops with my moisturizer, and woke up the next morning looking like an extremely streaky Oompa Loompa & it made me break out! Not worth the price
