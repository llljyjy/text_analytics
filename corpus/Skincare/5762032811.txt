I LOVE this cleanser. It is thick and easy to apply compared to most cleansers since you can apply to wet or dry skin. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshing. I love the smell too. I wear a lot of makeup and this is great for removing all of my makeup effectively with just one product. It also leaves my skin feeling hydrated! which is probably most important to me since I do not like anything that dries out my skin.  Highly recommend if you are look for a cleanser that works effectively and keeps your skin looking hydrated and youthful. My FAVORITE cleanser!! a MUST have!
