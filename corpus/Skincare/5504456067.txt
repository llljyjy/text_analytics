Laneige Water Bank is hydration to the max. After experiencing such dry skin patches after seasonal cold weather exposure I incorporated this product for immediate same day hydration in my skin care routine. The moisture is long lasting and leaves my skin feeling bouncy and youthful. The moisturizer is silky and smooth and absorbs into my skin well. I love the packaging and elegant simplicity of the container as it sits on my vanity. My results are excellent and I highly recommend this water bank by Laneige skincare product that I received complimentary from Laneige for my honest review. Renewed Moisture
