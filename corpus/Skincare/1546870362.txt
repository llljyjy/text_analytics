This night cream is lightweight yet, hydrating and nourishing. It feels instantly soothing and hydrating on the skin. It has not noticeable fragrance to it, which is great for sensitive skin types. The formula is like a rich gel-cream but it doesnâ€™t feel heavy or greasy. It feels refreshing and hydrating. It works really well with my other skincare products. I love niacinamide products and this cream is delightful. It really helps smooth out the texture of my skin and brighten it. It makes my skin look really healthy, feel hydrated, and look smoother. In the morning, my skin is glowing! This is a great night cream for all skin types and I highly recommend it. Gifted by The Outset. Glowing Skin
