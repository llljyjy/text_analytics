I love the gel consistency of this acne treatment. It applies so smoothly and dries quickly- but doesn’t dry out the skin like most acne treatments do. A little goes a long way. It allows you to put makeup on top and not worry about how it’ll look. I don’t think it’s something I’d reach for if I want immediate emergency results but I think it’s great for everyday use to calm down acne, I would definitely recommend! nan
