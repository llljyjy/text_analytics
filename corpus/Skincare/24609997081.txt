I was given the opportunity to test this product for free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant. This product surprised me on its performance. I have been using it in my routine at night and in the morning. It did a good job at moisturizing the eye area. I am obsessed with the clever and convenient packaging, as well as the expandable pump, which makes storage leak proof and compact. The formula is thick and creamy and truly a balm. I love and appreciate that itâ€™s not super fragranced. It is very subtle. The product is free of fragrance and essential oils. This is a cleaner product. The area around my eye feels smoother and hydrated. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product especially for somebody looking for cleaner ingredients. Very moisturizing & nourishing
