It takes a lot for me to write reviews but after watching @makeupxka rave about this cleanser I decided to try it. It’s changed my skin! And highly recommend for winter if you have dry skin. It’s pretty thick you don’t need much , it’s creamy and never feel like my skin is tight or stripped. Great for my sensitive skin and has also surprisingly helped with my hormonal acne and maskne. Holy grail now! Holy grail!
