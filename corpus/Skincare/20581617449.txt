This Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-aging Balm is very nourishing to my skin. It has a velvety feel when applying to skin, very calming as the name suggests. You can see the balm “melting” as soon as your fingers touch it. It’s not sticky and absorbs nicely into the skin. Be careful not to use too much though, it may get greasy. A little goes a long way! The first day I used it I was expecting my oily skin to be very oily when I woke up but it wasn’t. After a few weeks using it my skin is noticeably smoother and radiant. I like that it’s packaged in a glass jar. My least favorite thing about this balm is the scent. It has a very earthy/ herbal scent which I don’t care for but after application it didn’t linger for too long which I was glad about. All in all it’s a great moisturizer. Velvety!!!
