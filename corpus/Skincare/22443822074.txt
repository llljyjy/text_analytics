I received the Dior Capture totale super potent eye serum for free from influenster and Dior for my honest opinion. First impressions nice packaging Love the little metal  applicator helps to smooth out the serum evenly and a nice cooling feeling the serum is a nice thin consistency and absorbs into the skin very well.  There is a slight floral scent not overwhelming a very pleasant scent. I use this for 4 weeks did help with fine lines and wrinkles help reduce puffiness I did not see any change in my dark circles. Did help with  Firming my eyelids slightly  Which I loved I would recommend Dior Capture totale super potent eye serum Will keep using
