I am honestly obsessed with this serum.  Merit did it again!  I can definitely see the difference soon as I apply it and I love how it doesnâ€™t feel sticky on my skin.  Also, it doesnt have a weird or strong smell. I have been using it for few days now and my skin looks brighter and well hydrated.  This is the best thing ever touched my skin.  I have very dry skin specially when it is cold out.  This serum definitely helped me with that.  I will be keeping it in my bag and have it with me all day.  I will be recommending it to everyone I know for sure! A must have with your skincare routine
