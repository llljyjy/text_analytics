Kosas plump and juicy collagen lip boost is a day-and-night lip plumper treatment.I was super excited to receive this product as I love lip hydrating products. I currently use a very highly coveted lip sleeping mask that Iâ€™m sure everyone knows about but definitely was looking for something with a little bit more of a clean formulation that will provide me the same benefits. I love that this lip plump booster can be used day and night and the one that I currently use is intended for nighttime only as it is a bit thicker in consistency as opposed to the Kosas lip treatment. What I also enjoy about this product is that you can boost your benefits by layering it under wet lip oil. They pair beautifully!For those of you who are wondering why invest in a lip treatment here are a few reasons why. The lips are different from the rest of the skin, they are thinner and do not consist of any pores. Since the skin on the lips is thinner it is important to provide topical treatment to protect the barrier and keep it moisturized. Since the lips do not contain pores this also means that sebum is not present in the lips which can result in dry chapped or cracked lips which some of us experience a little bit more in the colder weather, offering your lips hydration and protection and a lip treatment can help to maintain the health of your lips all year long. nan
