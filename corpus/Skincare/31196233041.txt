This does what it says it will, which is keep your skin moisturized. And as a heavy duty moisturizer it’s really good -- I will say that I have combo skin and when I applied it to my face there was a bit of an oily sheen afterwards (perhaps I applied too much?) Which I didn’t love the feeling of (I don’t particularly love facial oils) but it did keep my skin super moisturized overnight even in the dry winter.Received complimentary from Influenster in exchange for honest review . Super moisturizing
