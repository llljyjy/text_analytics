I LOVE this cleanser. If you double cleanse, GET THIS! It’s an amazing gel that turns to a cleansing oil. It’s so much easier than those annoying cleansing balms. It gets off makeup great. I love the feel of this cleanser. I highly recommend if you want a great double cleanse oil that gets rid of makeup! GREAT alternative to cleansing balm!
