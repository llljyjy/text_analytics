This Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum is a triple-dose serum that definitely helps improve volume loss, plumps skin, visibly reduces wrinkles, brightens the appearance of dark spots, and evens skin tone. It has three potent ingredients- HYALURONIC ACID, C+NIACINAMIDE, and FERULIC ACID. Although the ingredients are strong, it’s not harsh and is ideal for sensitive skin. The bottle itself is absolutely beautiful & screams luxury. It seems like there are 3 different compartments inside the bottle because when you pump, all three ingredients come out separately and you can see each one. You mix them together and apply on a clean, dry face and follow-up with moisturizer. The scent is so pleasant & heavenly. It sinks into your skin as you massage it on your face & your face immediately feels more lifted. My skin is smoother, firmer, and plumper with less fine lines and wrinkles. After a few uses, dark spots are way smaller and less intense. It’s a bit pricey; but the results are extraordinary - you see a big difference with daily use in just a few days. I regularly use a few expensive products that were my “holy grails” but this can for sure replace those! My skin looks so much better. There’s a visible difference when I don’t use it. It truly is an exceptional product and I’d definitely recommend and will continue to use in my skincare regimen. I’m glad I received this product as a gift to review because I will definitely purchase. After using a bottle, I’ve repurchased and purchased a box set of 9 items from Lancôme to try because this was just THAT GOOD! Luxury miracle serum that actually WORKS!
