I love Confidence in a Cream. My skin is oily, with dry patches, so I definitely need something very moisturizing to combat that. Most moisturizers donâ€™t usually cut it for me. This one works great- it makes my skin look plumper and more rejuvenated. The scent is lightweight, but not overpowering. I would definitely repurchase this moisturizer- it is definitely a favorite of mine. works great
