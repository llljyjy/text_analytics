Not worth the hip! Very greasy and It doesn’t feel like it penetrates the skin. There are lots of better options at the drugstore…laRoche Posay, CeRave, Aveeno…..I have sensitive skin and this product irritated my skin. It’s a good thing that I bought the small jar which by the way contains about 2 teaspoons of product! Won’t buy again. Save your money!
