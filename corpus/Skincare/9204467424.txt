I tried a sample of this product and was disappointed. I didn’t find this moisturizer very moisturizing at all. In fact, my skin felt tight and dry after putting it on, so I had to ad a second layer. Maybe it’s better for people with oily skin? Also, it has a very strong rose scent. This wasn’t unexpected, based on the name, but if you don’t like that smell you should definitely stay away. nan
