I’ve only been using the Absolue Rich Cream for a few weeks , and i have noticed and almost immediate improvement in my skin’s appearance and feel! My skin feels dewy and plump. The cream is quite thick and a little amount goes a long way, so this product should last a good few months, even using day and night.  It really does wonders for my dry aging skin , just wish it was a little cheaper. Absolue the best !
