This is the first product I have ever used by Korres. I have to say that I really like this skin cream. The smell is pleasant and it doesn’t leave a sticky residue. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t irritate sensitive skin. Only time will tell how effective it is at minimizing pores. I highly recommend. I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. Great cream!
