I love most products I have tried from Paulaâ€™s Choice and this is not exception. I love their simple yet effective formulas. I am using this as a spot treatment for hyperpigmentation. It is too early to see true results but so far I have not experienced any issues which is great for my sensitive skin. Thanks so much for sending me this to try. nan
