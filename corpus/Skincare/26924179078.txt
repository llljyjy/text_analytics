Got a sample of this and bought the full size because i loved the thick texture and light fresh smell! I wanted a thick night cream to use while on retinol but overlooked the fact that it is exfoliating / brightening.. so now i just use it on days when im not using another exfoliant. It feels very nourishing and fancy to apply before bed :) V nice night cream
