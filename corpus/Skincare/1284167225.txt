Absolutely loving this bright start moisturizer! A great combination of ingredients to battle many of my skincare concerns. It goes on smooth and has a bit of a citrus scent. It absorbs beautifully with no greasy or tacky feel. It makes my skin feel fresh and has a nice cooling feeling to it as it absorbs. Definitely adding this to my skincare regime! Greta little gem!
