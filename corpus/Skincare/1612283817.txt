I received this eye cream as a free sample. I always buy the eye cream from this line for my mother who is in her 60s. She swear by this. I never thought that I would need it any time soon. After trying it for 2 weeks now, I definitely say it smooth out the eye area and the underlying darkness is not as prominent. I am curious how much better is this compared to the original. Just note that this is a thick formula but gets absorbed into the eye area after massaging gently. Good to prevent aging
