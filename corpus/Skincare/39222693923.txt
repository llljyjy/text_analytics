I received a sample of the C Beyond Triple Serum Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Sunscreen in TONE 2 from PinchMe. I really like this product, I love that it has a 40 SPF compared to other products I have used of only 15 SPF. I like that it does not leave your skin white like when using sunscreens. I love that it hydrates my skin leaving it with a glow. I tried it on it’s on one day and under my make up on a different day, it’s perfect! Definitely recommend, I will be using this serum every day this summer. Perfect for summer
