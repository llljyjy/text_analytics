This product was fine, but I did not think it was remarkable for the price tag. I did like that it was lightweight and definitely didn’t clog pores, so in that way it is a great sunscreen. But compared to the oil-free one in this line this felt a little underwhelming. It smells very sunscreen-y and didn’t feel super moisturizing on my dry/normal skin. Didn’t notice flashback in photos. Absorbs well before makeup! Good sunscreen but prefer the oil free one
