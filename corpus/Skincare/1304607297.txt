I received this complimentary from Laneige. I really like this gel moisturizer. My skin feels very hydrated after use and I like the consistency as it’s thicker than other gel moisturizers I’ve used in the past. I do think that it takes a little too long to absorb and felt slightly tacky after absorption but I’m loving the results and will continue to use. nan
