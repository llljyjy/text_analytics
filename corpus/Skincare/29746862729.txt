I like this serum. This retinol did not leave my dry the next day nor did I have sun sensitivity the following weeks of using product. I like being able to mix my own product knowing it is fresh and sealed upon first use. It left my skin glowing and I did see a reduction of fine lines and wrinkles after continuous use. Great retinol! I will purchase again!
