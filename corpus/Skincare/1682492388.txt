I use this for under eye dark shadows. When I stopped using it for a bit and saw how much the shadows returned I realized how effective this product is. I use it every day. Not sure I’ve seen a difference on lines or other issues but that is not what I’m targeting with this product and I use it in combination with moisturizer. Reduces dark circles
