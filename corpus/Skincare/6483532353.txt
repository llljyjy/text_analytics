I received this product as part of a free sample program, this lip mask is great for the winter. It’s super thick and really moisturizes your lips and prevent them from getting super chapped. It has a very faint vanilla scent, so nothing too overpowering. I love the packaging it’s not too bulky and the product dispenses nicely. Great lip mask for winter!
