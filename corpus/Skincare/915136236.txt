I got this in their holiday sheet mask collection. I bought the set for the face masks but this ended up being a great addition. It is scented like coconut which is just okay but this mask leaves your feet super softened and moisturized. I used this after exfoliating my feet in the shower. I did leave it on longer than the 20 minutes. I will purchase again. nan
