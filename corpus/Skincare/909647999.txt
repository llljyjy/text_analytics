Wonderfully moisturizing--does what is advertised! What I do not understand are all the poor reviews due to the smell--yes, if you put your nose in the jar there is a slight odour of ingredients--like the squalene perhaps, but it is barely noticeable. It certainly is not apparent after it has been applied. Unbelievable nit-picking. This is a great moisturizer that does the job period. You can buy a cheaper sweet-smelling moisturizer that does a crappy job if smell is what you are after. Personally, I like a moisturizer that does a good job at.....moisturizing. This isnâ€™t the perfume counter. This is a great moisturizer-smells fine!
