This is my favorite lip balm. Hands down no question. It delivers long term results unlike some other ones I have tried which just make you dependent upon applying it over time. I put this on at night and my lips wake up moisturized. Also, it doesn’t clog my pores. I didn’t realize this was a concern until I started using the cult classic rosebud salve. That gave me the largest pustule pimple since I was 15. In short, this stuff works. Highly recommend as my favorite lip balm you can get at Sephora or anywhere for that matter. 100% worth it for the price. It will last you awhile especially because it actually does it’s job to keep your lips hydrated for a while. Best lip balm - long term results
