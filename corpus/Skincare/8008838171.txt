I was given this product by Influenster for my honest review. Eye cream is thick and rich, a little goes a long way. I apply before any moisturizer or makeup, I have noticed it helps with my under eye puffiness but not sure about the wrinkles yet( I’ve only been using 2 weeks) I have noticed that my makeup goes on smoothly over the area and it’s not greasy. Feels great
