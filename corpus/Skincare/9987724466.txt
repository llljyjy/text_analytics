I received this product for my honest review. I used the product for a week, to see if I noticed any difference. To be honest, I did notice a slight difference in my skin. A week isn’t long sadly to try a new product. My skin was a bit smoother, and felt nice after using this product. I think if I had a longer time to try it, perhaps I would have noticed a difference? I generally don’t use serums like this, but I did enjoy it while it lasted. I will look into purchasing this in the future, so I can see if it makes any further difference. I did not find the scent overpowering, and it did not irritate my skin. A great product!
