I rarely ever write reviews but this product is so good I just have to. I was looking for a sunscreen that wouldn’t disturb my makeup but still protect my skin. When I first started to apply it, I really thought I was going to hate it because it feels like silicone at first, almost like I was applying the Smashbox photo finish primer! But I let it dry down for several minutes and then applied my makeup and it instantly exceeded all my expectations. It grips my makeup so well and made my skin look completely poreless and smooth. As someone with super oily skin, this made my makeup last longer than anything else I’ve ever tried (and I’ve tried it all!) it wore so well all day long, after 12 hours I didn’t even want to take it off because it still looked so good! It didn’t feel heavy on my skin, it didn’t irritate my eyes at all, and it made my makeup look phenomenal. I love this product and I hope it sticks around forever. the BEST!
