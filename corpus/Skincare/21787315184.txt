This mask is magic, I have sensitive dry skin, acne prone and occasional rosacea flare up’s. This mask is quite literally a glass of water and more, incredibly hydrating and even more nourishing. I highly recommend this! I will say few skin products surprise me because there are so many options in the market but this mask and ampoule itself is just downright amazing. Please try this product! You will not be disappointed. If the ampoule product is sold alone sometime I will definitely be first in line I don’t know what it has but its just…. THAT GOOD. Perfect to use while on a short flight and want to perk the face. MAGIC MASK ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
