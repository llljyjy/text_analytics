I received a complimentary sample to test and review. I gave it three stars cause I don’t feel the SPF is long lasting. If I was just running around town it would be fine. But this is definitely not a product you want to wear to the beach or on a 5k. On the flip side I do think it is good for everyday wear. It’s smooth and glides on easily. There is no strong order, like a regular sunscreen. I'm not sure if I love it
