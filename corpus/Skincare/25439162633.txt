I love this moisturizer. I am a south asian and have combo/oily skin, depending on the weather and have pores. This moisturizer just absorbs into the skin and doesnt feel too dry or too heavy for my skin. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. It has an amazing texture and you do not need a lot. I highly recommend this product. I have noticed a difference in my pores and acne scars as well. And it has certainly made my skin healthier and better. nan
