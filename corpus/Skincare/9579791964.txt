I honestly really enjoyed using this eye balm. It feels very refreshing and cooling, and I love the design of the bottle and the fact that it is a stick. For me it is very comfortable to use. The only thing that I do not like is the fact that the balm has some kind of sparkly particles and if you apply the product more than 3 to 5 times you will see a sparkling line under your eyes. But maybe thatâ€™s just because I overused it, I just loved the cooling effect it has. Other than that it is a great product and I would totally recommend it. Great cooling eye balm
