My go to oil. I use as a last step over my moisturizer for extra hydration at night and I wake up glowing. I think it has some firming effects as well. I will use a couple drops in the daytime if I’m home for hydration and antioxidant benefits. But I don’t use this if I’m going out because it is oily, at least my skin type. It smells like a marina, kind of like seaweed, but it is mild and doesn’t bother me personally. I add 3-5 drops on my hands, rub together and pat onto my face, neck and chest. nan
