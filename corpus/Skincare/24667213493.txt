This is one of the best tinted lip bombs I’ve ever used. It’s almost like a lipgloss but has all of the benefits of a hydrating lip balm. This color is very suitable for all skin tones, and don’t have even getme started on the sun. Smells like straight hot cocoa but isn’t too overpowering. I also love the applicator it’s almost jelly like very great product.￼ I take this everywhere I go!
