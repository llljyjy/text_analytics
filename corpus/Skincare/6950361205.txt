I LOVE THIS PRODUCT WITH MY WHOLE HEART. In all honesty I always found it really hard to find a cleansing balm I liked. Often, some would feel too waxy, and others would not emulsify well enough. But, this is amazing! I love the consistency of it, and it emulsifies really well once you add the water to your face. It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. My skin feels soft and supple after using this product. I have also used the original one (not the clean version) I prefer this one more. I don’t care if my skincare does or doesn’t have fragrance but the texture and consistency of this one is much better. FOURTH REPURCHASE!
