This eye cream goes in very smoothly, almost like butter. I love keeping it in my mini fridge and applying it while itâ€™s cool. Unfortunately the sample was way too small to notice if it works or how good it works. But I did like the feel of it. Might consider buying it after going through others reviews because the price is pretty steep smooth eye cream
