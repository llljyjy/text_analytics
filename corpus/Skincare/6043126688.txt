I’m so mad at myself for buying this. I was excited to try it, but it is not worth the hype. I watched all the videos and gave myself time to try it several times to get the hang of it, but it’s not a great product. Never cut myself or anything, but it just doesn’t give a close shave. I’ve always never really had to deal with ingrown hairs until I used this razor, so the claim that it will help with that is completely false in my experience. After weeks of using it, I tried shaving one leg with Hanni and one leg with my Billie razor and the results were pretty extreme. The leg I used the Billie razor on was so much smoother and took way less time. I don’t usually write reviews, but it makes me so mad that they hyped this product up so much and I spent so much on something that’s essentially useless. I will say that I like the shave pillow. I wish I could have liked the razor too A waste of time and money
