Things I like about this lip mask: - I don’t get fur stuck to my lips when cats get too close- it doesn’t feel or look like a mask, just glossy- it’s light enough to wear during the day- I can kiss people after applying Things I don’t love:- if my lips are particularly chapped, it takes more applications too see smoother lips than other products I’ve tried. If you experience cracked lips, you’re better off using a more intensive lip balm like Neosporin and using this lip mask once you’re all healed up. nan
