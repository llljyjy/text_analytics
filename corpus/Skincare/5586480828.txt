This is my new go-to cream. I have used so many luxury moisturizers (some over 500 dollars) and none performed better than this. It’s given me glowing, radiant, gorgeous, flawless skin. I’m 29 with combo/oily skin with some dry areas, and still do get the occasional hormonal breakout from time to time, and also have large pores. This cream gives me skin that looks filtered/retouched 24/7 and feels amazing. I’m obsessed with it. I’m so glad I got two of them to last a while. Honestly though, one of my favorite things about it is the lovely scent. Very nice, but not overpowering. It was a nostalgic smell and for the longest time I couldn’t place it but now I realize it smells like lovespell or fruit loops!! Heavenly! This cream is divine and smells like fruit loops!
