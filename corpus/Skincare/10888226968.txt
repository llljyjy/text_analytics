I’m a skin care junkie . I love a good night routine!! I recently tried the DR. ZENOVIA SKIN CARE - INFLAM-AGING NIGHT REPAIR TREATMENT. I have to admit I was scenically since it doesn’t have a retinol. I wear them daily usually. The color is beautiful, & clean. It’s not too tacky, & I didn’t think it has a smell. So that is nice. The packaging isn’t too heavy and would work well for travel too. I still think this product comes with a “prestigious” feeling. I will say for the price though I had some reservations. The longevity of the product is impressive. My breakout were almost none! I love how moisturizing & fantastic product is and I think I’m going to bite the bullet and purchase this afterward. adult acne night cream!!
