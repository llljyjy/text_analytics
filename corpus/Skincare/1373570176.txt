I used this instead of my usual airbrush spray tan for a wedding. It gave me a beautiful, natural glow without orange color or streaks within two applications, I used three to deepen the color.  It did not irritate my highly sensitive skin and actually moisturized very well! Make sure you wash your hands with soap after application. Add to cart, you wonâ€™t regret it! Glowing Reviews!
