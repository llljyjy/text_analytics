Overall, I really enjoy this day cream. It’s rich but doesn’t feel heavy and leaves my skin looking a little more plump. It does have that classic sunscreen smell to it, but it doesn’t bother me because it’s a nostalgic smell for me. I think the SPF could be a little higher though. The packaging is really nice and I like that it’s refillable. I don’t really have the patience for the little spatula that it comes with but I think it’s a nice touch. I will say that I don’t think my foundation wears quite as well over this moisturizer as it does with one that’s a little more lightweight, but it’s nothing a little setting powder can’t fix. I would consider repurchasing and would be interested in trying the non-SPF version for nighttime. nan
