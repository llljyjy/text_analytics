I bought this after seeing the lady-with-puffy-eyes TikTok results convinced that this would help with my puffy eyes (much less severe) and dark circles. I used true botanicals previously. I will say that my fine lines and dark circles have dramatically improved, but the puffiness is almost worse somehow. I knocked only one star off because I’d someone doesn’t have puffy under eyes this product would be amazing! It doesn’t clog my pores either (I have to be careful with eye creams causing breakouts if I use them in the morning. I plan to use this in the morning but switch back to my true botanicals at night to hopefully prevent the puffiness. Dark circles gone, puffiness worse?
