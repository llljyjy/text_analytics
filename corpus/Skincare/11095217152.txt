I received this kors poreless skincare cream Complimentary. I have tried many different creams and I’ll have to say while I haven’t seen any huge difference in my pores being reduced I do like that it has salicylic acid in it. It hasn’t dried out my skin and it’s very lightweight and goes on smooth. Will continue to use. great skin cream
