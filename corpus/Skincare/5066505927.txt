At first, I really enjoyed this product. The metal tip is super soothing, even if I had to go in with my fingers after application sometimes to rub it all in. But I didn’t realize its “illuminating“ nature included some kind of shimmery product. Used it for two weeks and didn’t see a huge difference, and then, under a different light in my bathroom, I saw the shimmers. I wasn’t a fan of thinking about how many nights I’d slept with what seemed to be cosmetics on under my eyes after getting back into the groove of a skincare routine. Even if it’s a recommended AM/PM product, I think it would be best advertised as pre-concealer brightener, rather than a treatment. Will not purchase again. Shimmer?
