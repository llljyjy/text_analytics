When I first put this on and waited about an hour, I was immediately disappointed to see no difference. However, after about 4 hours I started to see a huge difference in the tone of my skin!! I didnâ€™t use a tanning mitt or anything, just put on lotion first, and then apply the tanner. It dries pretty fast so no worries about staining on clothing. be patient!!
