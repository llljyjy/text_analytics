I received this complimentary product via Influenster for my honest review. This cleanser has a light citrus scent that is quite nice. I have dry, sensitive skin and the tiny microbeads gently exfoliate my skin without irritation. I do life this product but worry about environmental harm due to the beads, for that I subtract one star. It left my skin feeling very smooth! Gentle nonfoaming exfoliation!
