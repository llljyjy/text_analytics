Already starting to see a different in my laugh lines and the creases on my neck after using this product. My skin was already uses to using a retinol daily, so it wasn’t an issue to make the switch. Doesn’t feel heavy, not sticky, and absorbed quickly into my skin. Love it already and can’t wait to see what the 2-3 month results look like! great retinol!
