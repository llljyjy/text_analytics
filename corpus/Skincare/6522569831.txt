I got this sample through influencer and I was a bit skeptical. I am brown skinned and lots of sunscreens that I’ve tried always leave a white cast. So I went on vacation to Antigua and the sun is so hot there. I thought this would be the best time to test it out. I am lost for words! This sunscreen was so smooth and easy to apply. It wasn’t thick. It felt like face lotion.  The best thing about it was that it was 50 SPF and NO WHITE CAST! I am in love with it and after this sample, I am going to buy more!! I am literally obsessed with it. It also smells very fresh, unlike some sunscreen that smell like chemicals. I recommend everyone to try it out.  My skin type is oily. But this sunscreen did not break me out or made me feel like I super oily. Definitely worth the hype! Literally the BEST SUNSCREEN!!!!
