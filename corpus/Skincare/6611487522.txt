I received a free small sample from Topbox to try #freeproduct. I was only able to use it for 2 days, morning and evening. However I liked it and I would have taken more of it! I found the serum very light, non-sticky and it does feel smooth on the skin. Again, the sample was too small to notify any change in my wrinkles yet. I would test it longer to see the long term result! Not bad !!
