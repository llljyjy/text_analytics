The Peter Thomas Roth FIRMx Collagen Face & Eye Hydra-Gel Patches is a nice way to get targeted firming in the areas where you need it the most. The patches are easy to remove with the provided tweezers and I like that there are two sizes—one for under the eyes and another for other areas of the face. The patches adhere well to the face and after 15 minutes of application my skin felt really nice and hydrated. I didn’t necessarily see any changes to fine lines but my skin definitely felt healthy and moisturized. I prefer these targeted patches versus full face sheet masks. nan
