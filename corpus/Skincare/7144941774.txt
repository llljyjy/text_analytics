This product has beautiful packaging but that is about it. The sunscreen does not mix well with other skincare products and balls up even if I wait over an hour between applying my moisturizer and this sunscreen. I also have very fair skin and this sunscreen needs to be rubbed in really well or it will leave a white cast. I will be returning it. not worth it
