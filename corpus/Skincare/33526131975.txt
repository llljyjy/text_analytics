I received the eye cream complementary, and let me tell you it is worth every penny!! It is fluffy and lightweight. Soft like marshmallows! I put it on at night and it lasts all night long. Definitely starting to see a difference in my under eyes looking lighter with less fine lines! This has hands down become a daily staple in my night time routine! Love this!!
