I bought this after I was unable to find the Clinique face wash I was looking for, and Iâ€™m glad I chose this one.  My face really feels clean after using this, and it only takes a small amount.   I plan on buying more after I run out.  I do wish it came in a pump though so it would be easier to dispense. Glad I came across this cleanser!
