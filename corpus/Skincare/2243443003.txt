I received this cream as a #freeproduct from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review so here it is! - I have been using this cream for a little over 2 weeks at night after my cleaning routine and I love it! The sleeping mask is very light and absorbs into the skin very well, without leaving greasy residue on your face (or pillowcase!!!). The scent is very mild and not bothersome at all (unless you are normally using non-scented products). In the mornings my face feels hydrated and soft! The only thing I would suggest is that if you have an oily T-zone like I do, I found the less product that I used the better off I was in the am! Would definitely buy this again! The price point is also very reasonable and will not break the bank for a product that truly works! I bought the lip mask to try as well next! Definitely worth a try!!
