itâ€™s definitely a little harsh for my sensitive skin, i get a bit of a burning sensation probably from the menthol, but nonetheless it has significantly decreased the appearance of the sebaceous filaments on my nose area which is a huge insecurity for me so i will continue to use!! love it!! good outweighs bad
