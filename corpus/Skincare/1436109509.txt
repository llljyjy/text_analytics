I received a sample as a birthday gift and I used it just this week. I LOVE the smell, the packaging, and it leaves my face hydrated and soft. However, keep in mind to use very little! On the first day I dabbed a lot on my face and it left my face feeling very oily. So a little bit goes a long way. Will rebuy once I finish my sample jar! nan
