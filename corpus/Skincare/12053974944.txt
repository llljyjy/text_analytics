I had the pleasure of trying the Clarins Double Serum in a one week trial and I really enjoyed it. My skin felt smooth and hydrated after each use and I didn’t have any reactions to the ingredients this product contained. I can’t attest to how well this product will work in the long run but I did enjoy my nice fresh face for the week I was using the product. I would definitely consider trying this on a more regular basis to keep this glow going. Feeling fresh and hydrated
