I love how moisturize and dewy my skin looks. It doesnâ€™t make my skin feel greasy or oily. I love that it has lactic acid and vitamin c that helps the skin brighter and renew without irritating my dry skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and I can use it under makeup. I just top it with spf for protection. I definitely recommend this cream! Dewy look
