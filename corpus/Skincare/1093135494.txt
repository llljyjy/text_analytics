While this cream does a great job calming and moisturizing my skin, itâ€™s too heavy for a regular choice in the sweaty Southern summer. It would be more optimal for daily use in the cold months or in less humid climates. I had a little patchy dry spot on my face and the cream eliminated it entirely in just one use. A little bit goes a long way. I have mild rosacea and a light layer quickly calms the reddish appearance. I like that there are refill pods available, so no need to buy a new container when you need more  - just the refill. On the down side, the container is really heavy and awful for travel so you need to transplant some in a small, light travel container. A Great Winter Choice
