I like using this as a leave on treatment. I applied a tiny, thin layer (at night) over problematic spots and woke up to noticeably less red, more smoother skin!! Like, I’m shocked!! The texture is liquidy gel type and blends nicely. I do get bit tingly feeling after applying it, but it goes away after about a minute. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the results and will continue using it! Really made a difference on my skin!!
