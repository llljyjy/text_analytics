I like that this lightweight serum absorbs quickly into the skin, hydrates, and does not leave any stickiness. However, after using it for some time, I’m somewhat disappointed that I don’t notice any difference in the look of my skin. I don’t see that glow which the product advertises. I have normal to dry, sensitive skin and this serum was gentle and didn’t cause any problems for my skin. The packaging is beautiful! nan
