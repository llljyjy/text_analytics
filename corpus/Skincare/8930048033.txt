Really liking this so far! Most cleansers dry me out right away, even one’s that state they’re for dry skin. This once has kept my skin hydrated. I love the consistency and that it turns into a foam cleanser. I use this as my second cleanse and I feel refreshed after using it. Hydration is key for me and it’s taken me YEARS to find a cleaner that doesn’t strip my face! Only using for a week and I see a huge difference. I highly recommend!! YES FOR DRY SKIN!!!!
