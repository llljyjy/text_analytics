I received this product as a free sample to test and review from Influenster & Clinique. My honest feedback is that it does exactly what it needs to. The consistency is smooth and very light - very quick to absorb and doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue. Having only received a small sample size, I cannot review its long term affects, but in the couple of days I did use the product I was pleasantly moisturized. It had all-day lasting power and I nevever needed to reapply. That being said I have combo skin, and my acne prone areas seemed to flare up - most likely due to a NEW product in the routine and not the product itself. As a moisturizer, it did its job very very well. Liked, but wanted to love
