I love all Clinique products that I’ve tried so far, so I was excited to receive a trial size of this moisturizer. I find it light, but hydrating, and doesn’t cause breakouts or oily skin. You also don’t need to use a ton of the product which is nice. I used it each morning after applying serums and it helped prime my face and was a nice makeup base. I would recommend this to others. Thanks Influenster! nan
