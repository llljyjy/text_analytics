I received this product as a complementary sample from BzzAgent. I expected it to be like an actual lotion like cream but it’s mainly liquid I’m not complaining I like the product in total. It has a great scent not so over powering. I applied in a red spot and u can notice it made the redness go away . It’s kinda sticky but not sticky it’s hard to explain I love the packaging. In overall I liked the product . nan
