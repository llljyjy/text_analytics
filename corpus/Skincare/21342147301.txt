This product did not cause any irritation or other adverse effects to my skin. I use this every other day and I have noticed an improvement in my skin. I think the dispenser works great to give you the appropriate amount of product (I use 2 pumps of product). I gave this 4 stars because some of the powder did not mix with the liquid. Retinol products work best at very specific concentrations so Iâ€™m not sure if this product will work at 100% efficiency if some of the powder does not mix. nan
