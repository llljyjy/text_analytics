The concept of a SPF that you can reapply by misting is great, really! & I really wanted to like this product.First & foremost, it’s marketed as “matte”, but even after shaking the bottle for a minute or so, it felt & looked greasy. Plus, it stung my eyes. After an hour or so, I was extra oily.I wanted to give it a second chance, so I used the Unseen Sunscreen (which I love, 5/5 stars) & applied light makeup. When it was time to reapply SPF, I found that the nozzle leaked in my bag, & my purse smelled like it, & all my items were greasy/oily. Half of the product was gone. The nozzle wasn’t loose at all, but still somehow leaked.I think this product has potential. Just needs a few tweaks. But as of right now, I wouldn’t recommend it at all for my fellow combo/oily people. It has potential.
