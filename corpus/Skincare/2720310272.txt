This Pore Remedy Purifying Mud Mask is designed to exfoliate and purify the skin by extracting your impurities. It also helps control excess oil production on the skin. This is a crossover between a mud mask and a sheet mask, because it’s a mud sheet mask. This was a bit of a surprise for me since I saw where it said mud mask and expected a packet of the type of mud mask I’m used to, not a sheet mask of mud. This sheet mask is easy to apply and was a new experience for me since I’ve never used a two piece sheet mask before. You remove the back layer first and apply to your face, and once it is in position you remove the front film off the mask. You let it sit on your skin for 15-20 mins before removing and rinsing any residue off your skin. I used the mask last night and my skin felt really nice afterwards. It felt purified without feeling tight or dry, and it was smooth and fresh looking. My serums absorbed really well after using this mask and also my moisturizer went on smooth. I decided I’m not really a fan of sheet masks despite how easy this is to use, I really just prefer a clay or liquid mask to apply but overall I loved the formula of this product and would record it if you want the benefits it offers. Wish this wasn't a sheet mask but still liked it..
