This moisturizer is amazing. I have combo skin and in the winter I get very dry patches but I don’t want to look too oily during the day. This moisturizer does the trick with hydrating while not looking oily. I took off a star because the packaging sucks. The pump only works half the time for me. I store it right side up and do the same when dispensing but it always fails. I don’t know if I got a dud or something but it ruins the experience for me. I generally go for packaging with a pump or squeeze because I feel like it’s more sanitary but this just doesn’t work for me :( Great moisturizer but packaging sucks
