Sometimes Clinique gets a bad rap for being a bit dated however sometimes if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. I’ve always had oily skin and I have to admit sometimes I just don’t feel like washing my face before I go to bed and I use this instead let me tell you it completely clears off dirt oil and strips it down to where you could put moisturizer on a fresh clean face now. No more oily skin!
