I have really sensitive skin, and this is the only sunscreen that doesn’t make me breakout or result in dermatitis. It leaves a white cast on my porcelain skin but I add my foundation over top and it brings some colour to my face. To me it’s most important to have sun protection and avoid a skin reaction so I will continue using this product. I use a very basic soap free face wash and it takes some effort to wash off. I would recommend this for someone with sensitive skin and reoccurring skin issues. nan
