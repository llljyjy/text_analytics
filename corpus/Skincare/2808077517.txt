I’m over 3/4 done my first bottle. It’s a great serum; easily layers, hydrating, non-irritating and evens/brightens my skin. I’m on Retin-A but might just stop as this is a great alternative. What I don’t like is the bottle. The dropper doesn’t form a tight seal every time I close it. Like it undoes itself after screwing it back on. The dropper also doesn’t come close to reaching the bottom. Currently, I’m having to do multiple suctions and angles to get enough serum. Fix the bottle and this gets 5 stars. love the serum, not the bottle
