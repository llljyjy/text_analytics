I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I’ve gotta say it’s effective. I’m a sucker for eye creams but not when they don’t work. This eye cream is cooling, relaxing and really brightens/awakens my eyes when they’re tired. I also have to mention the packing and consistency of the product. Presentation sells for me. The glittery, dewy orange cream makes my self care routine all the worthwhile. I’ve shared more on my IG: @steph.verdugo! Favorite Eye Cream Ever!
