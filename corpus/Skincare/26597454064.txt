I received this product from Influenster for my honest review and I loved getting to know the Tula brand.  The texture and consistency of this moisturizer is great, it is not oily, is quickly absorbed by the skin and is perfect for using makeup. The smell at the time of application is a little weird, but soon disappears. My skin is dry and mature, I don’t have acne, but unfortunately my skin didn’t tolerate it well and I had some pimples on my skin during the time I used the product. This moisturizer didn’t work for me, I believe it’s not the product’s fault, but my skin’s sensitivity. nan
