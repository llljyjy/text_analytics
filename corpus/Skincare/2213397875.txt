I received this product for free to try. I really liked it. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the scent. It smelled great and kind of florally. I used this in my skincare routine. I used it after cleansing but before my moisturizer. Overall, I was pleased with how it made my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I would recommend this product. nan
