Dr. Dennis Gross gifted me their Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment.. and wow wow wow - am I impressed! At age 36 with visible dark circles and some general aging going on.. I am always looking for an eye treatment that’ll actually minimize my dark undereyes, but most of the products in my collection fall short of making a big difference, until now. I’ve been using this eye cream daily for just over a week, and can already see a visible difference. It’s as though each day my dark circles are becoming less & less noticeable, along with my eye area just looking brighter, healthier, and more youthful. I’m actually obsessed. Hands down 10/10 would recommend this! Bye bye dark circles!!
