My skin adores this stuff. I use it after cleansing as a toner in the am & pm. I have medium-sensitive skin, errs on the dry side with occasional small break outs and starting to get some wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. I have been introducing retinol into my routine (the Youth one, definitely recommend it) so I wanted something that would be calming and nourishing. I only took off a star because at least for me it didn’t reduce redness by itself (but with the Ordinary pressed rose hip oil, omg the overnight results are INSANE. My skin has never been this soft, GLOW IS REAL, pores are tiny, my grandmother wanted to know what foundation I was wearing the other day, she said I looked so radiant and I was only wearing mascara!). Sadly the price point is a bit steep as well for the common folk. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I’m already 1/3 through the bottle. nan
