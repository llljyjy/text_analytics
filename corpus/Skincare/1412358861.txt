I can’t say enough good things about this moisturizer! I don’t have a ton of acne, although I do wake up with a pimple here or there. I do, however, have combo skin and get little dry/bumpy patches on my cheeks. I’m usually OK if I’m diligent about my skincare routine, but his moisturizer makes it so easy to clear those patches up. After only one use of a sample a few weeks back, I noticed an immediate change. I’ve now used daily (I use only in the AM, though it says twice a day is fine) and the patches have not returned. I really, really love this stuff. Absolute staple
