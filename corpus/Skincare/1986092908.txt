The Nudestix Nudeskin Citrus-C Mask and Daily Moisturizer is a dream for my dry winter skin. It has a rich, creamy consistency that absorbs beautifully into the skin. I was afraid that the richer texture might feel heavy, but even after applying a bit too much during my first application, the Citrus-C Moisturizer felt very light on my skin. I love the dewy glow it gives my skin - it doesnâ€™t look at all greasy. I have been using this product for over a week now, and I have already noticed some significant improvements. My skin feels velvety soft and a lot smoother. My face looks much brighter, and my overall complexion has become more even. This makes perfect sense, since the Nudeskin Citrus-C Mask and Moisturizer contains Yuzu Oil, which is known to have brightening properties, and turmeric, which aids in the reduction of the appearance of blemishes. The product does have a bit of an earthy, peppery scent to it - but it is nothing like perfume. The smell does dissipate pretty quickly, however. I will continue to use this moisturizer, as I am really enjoying all of the benefits and changes I am seeing in my face. A moisturizer that improves my complexion!
