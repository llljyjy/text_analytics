I was so excited to receive this sunscreen! I run five days a week outside and am always looking for something to wear on my face that won’t sweat off and protects my skin. This sunscreen is great for anyone who is also looking to keep their skin moisturized. The moisturizer did feel a bit heavy on my skin while I was running, primarily because I sweat a lot and don’t need the extra moisture: however, when I tried this as an every day under my makeup sunscreen it worked great! It does smell like “sunscreen” in a way that reminds me of a good day at the beach. The packaging is bright and eye-catching and the product is easily to dispense and apply! nan
