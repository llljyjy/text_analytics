I’ve enjoyed using Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream so far.  It’s only been a week, so I’m eager to see the results after more time has passed.  It feels good and absorbs well, quicker than most night creams which makes me feel like I should put another layer on top of it.  Maybe an oil?  But for now, I’m going to see what this cream can do.  Light scent, feels good on skin. Good cream - lighter than expected
