I love this sunscreen for it’s intended purpose.  It protects my skin from the sun and adds a lovely amount of moisture that doesn’t become distrusted under makeup.  The packaging is horrific - it flakes off on your hands and leaves tiny purple flakes all over the skin that you need to pick off with your nails.  It also explodes under the cap before you even take the top off.  Not cool for such a speedy product. papackaging.  It Love the product - hate the packaging
