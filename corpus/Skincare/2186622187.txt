I barely had any acne for most of my life, but about a year and a half ago I started breaking out really badly all the time. I tried so many different products to help with redness, inflammation, healing, etc., but nothing seemed to help. If anything, most products ended up making things worse and now I’m left with lots of scars on my face. After I saw a tiktok where someone with acne prone skin used this product and it worked--I was sold. Now after having used it myself, I can honestly say this is the best and most effective acne treatment product I’ve ever used! Redness is decreased so much and it dries out the zit/pimple/whatever so that you can easily apply makeup on it. As well, I found that the healing time of my really bad under the skin zits was reduced by at least 3-5 days. I’ve also been using the Mandelic Acid treatment to help with discoloration and hyper pigmentation and I use Cerave AM (with SPF) and PM moisturizers. My skin now looks the best it has in a year and a half--first picture is June 6, 2022 and second picture is June 17, 2022. 10/10 RECOMMEND
