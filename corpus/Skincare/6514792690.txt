I have combo skin and I feel I’ll definitely use this in the winter and not in the summer at all. I agree with the last reviewer who said they feel it is a bit heavy . I also am not a fan of the greasy residue it leaves on the skin . I thought it was just me that felt this way . But my face does feel moisturized. The scent is barely there in my personal opinion . I used a sample of this first and it made me want to purchase the larger version, so I did it because it left my face feeling clean and moisturized with the tiny non harsh exfoliating beads in it . I don’t know if I will purchase it again tho . definitely only a WINTER WASH for me..
