Best lip mask Iâ€™ve used! I love that it is clear and has no scent. I have used the laniege lip mask and find the belief one a lot less sticky and more moisturizing. Every winter I struggle with dry lips and no amount of lip balm ever helps. I have been using this lip mask every night since I got it and it has worked wonders. I can still feel the moisture throughout the next day after using it at night. bye bye dry lips!
