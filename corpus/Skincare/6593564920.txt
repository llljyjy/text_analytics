This product is deff expensive but so worth it, I have been using it at night time for about 2 weeks and i can see such a big difference in my skin. The pump is amazing, it pushes out the right amount of product and you dont waste too much since it is so expensive. The fragrance is great, not too over powering. Buy it!
