I received the Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment from Dr.  Dennis Gross for free to test and review. I like the texture of this treatment and the amount that comes in it, it will last you awhile. I have noticed a slight difference in my fine lines and dark circles, unfortunately not with my puffiness though. While I believe that more than four hours of rest is what will really help there. I am loving this product and recommend it to others. I Love the Texture
