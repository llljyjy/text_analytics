This is an amazing, indulgent product!  The secret ingredient is flowers, picked in the morning. This product is lightly scented with a pleasant, slightly floral scent. It goes on very smoothly and is immediately comforting. The product helped fill in some of the laugh lines around my mouth. My skin is a. It dry and this was very soothing. I only used it in the morning to try to make it last longer, as it is a bit pricy for the size of the container. I would absolutely buy this product again. Flowers are the secret weapon!
