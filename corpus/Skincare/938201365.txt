The rating stars seem a little off.  I give this awesome eye cream 5 stars.  This is my “go back to’’ eye cream,  You see, I got suckered by reading other eye cream reviews thinking that the product must surely work awesome and I end up spending a lot of money for that particular eye cream only to be disappointed.  But no worries!  I know one sure thing I can count on to make the delicate skin under my eyes look and feel amazing while taking care of a few lines.  THIS ONE.  Try it. Don't Be Fooled!
