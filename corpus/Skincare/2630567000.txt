I live in a dry winter climate and during the winter months I don’t think my skin could take it without this moisturizer. Tried switching due to price point and nothing else makes the cut. Rich and creamy texture that hydrates my skin and is the best supporting role to all of my actives (retinol, lactic acid). Worth every penny. It goes on a little thick so you don’t need much Saved my skin
