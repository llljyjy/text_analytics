milk marvel is my skin’s safety net. this is the product i most consistently use because it does not burn my skin but instead is like a light protective cocoon. it is not an instant fix for anything, instead with consistent (at least once a day preferably twice a day) daily use my blemishes don’t cause as much hyperpigmentation, and when they do it doesn’t take months to fade like it did before this product. i find when i do use it consistently twice a day i need less foundation. it is light enough for summer when i can’t stop sweating but buffering enough to help during winter dryness. i think i am probably on my sixth bottle. highly recommend because it just works. my skin’s safety net
