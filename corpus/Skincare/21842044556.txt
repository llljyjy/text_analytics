Before this, I was using an oil free face wash with salicylic acid, which was drying my skin out a lot and actually making it more oily over the course of the day. I switched to this every other night to still benefit from salicylic acid and it definitely helps prevent acne and makes my skin less oily. But I also use dapsone gel every night for acne and I find I can’t use both products on the same night or else the products start to pill on my face. This also feels like it doesn’t absorb fully, leaving my skin the slightest bit sticky, but it doesn’t bother me since I use a super basic face cream afterwards at night. It does the job and lasts a while! And to get it out I just flip it upside down and tap on the bottom of the bottle into my palm, then use my fingers to apply to my face pretty good for the price
