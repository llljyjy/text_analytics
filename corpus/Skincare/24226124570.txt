As you can see, my 8 year old REALLY loves this glow up shot serum! (She used half the bottle) It smells so good but very mild fragrance! I absolutely LOVE using this product under my make up! It leaves my face looking flawless and I can’t explain to you how well my make up blends after using this product. I’d give 100 stars if I could! Well loved in this house!!
