It is the first time I have complimentary from innisfree this cream and it leaves the skin very beautiful, it is not very creamy or thick, it is very light and spreads very quickly on the skin. It leaves you with a beautiful glow, the skin looks fresher or cleaner. The container is small but with very little cream is enough, you do not need to use a lot of product.Love it. nan
