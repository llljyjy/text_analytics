It works. Price is right. I would only use this as a makeup remover or 1st cleanse and 2nd cleanse with a regular cleanser. its like a vasoline texture and leaves behind a film if I don’t 2nd cleanse. I find I have to work a little bit more to get off all my eye makeup than say with the farmacy balm maybe about the same as drunk elephant but that’s not a terrible experience ... just more time massaging the face. My fave of those 3 balms would be the farmacy but for the price ... I have found my staple makeup remover. good product, great price. nan
