I’m a big fan of Glow Recipe’s avocado skincare products and always found the blueberry cleanser a bit too drying so I was very much looking forward to trying this out. I used this cleanser in the morning for about two weeks and my skin felt incredibly soft and supple. This is a great addition to Glow Recipe’s avocado skincare line! Highly recommended! best cleanser from Glow Recipe!
