When I tell you to run to the nearest store and buy this j mean it. Let’s start with the smell, it’s subtle, but pleasant. Not overpowering at all which I love in a skincare product. The application went on smoothly and wasn’t tacky at all, my skin absorbed it so well. I always wake up the next day with smooth/hydrated looking skin. I’m so happy I got this! RUNNN to buy this!!
