While I enjoyed the face oil and moisturizer I felt that the cleanser was a little drying for me personally. I hated the ball and felt it gimmicky. The massage techniques that the QR video taught were nice. I loved the glow this set gave my skin. The “14 day trial” actually lasted a good month and a half because a little of each goes along way. I feel however for the price I would skip the set and literally just buy the oil. It lasted so long. Enjoyed but would skip the set
