This was lovely in every way.  When you first open it, it has a nice rose smell but not over powering. I do not like anything with a strong scent, this has a light rose water smell which is not overwhelming.  I tried using is both wiping it off and rising. Both worked great to take off my makeup, ever mascara and eyeliner.  It left my skin soft and smooth. nan
