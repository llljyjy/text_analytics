This does not remove my makeup off my face and I don’t wear that much makeup. For reference, I typically just shade in my eye brows (Anastasia Beverly Hills perfect brow pencil) and use mascara (urban decay perversion). After using this to “remove“ my makeup I look like a raccoon.  I wanted to love this product but I am back to micellar water for makeup removal! Does smell great! Makeup Smearing Balm
