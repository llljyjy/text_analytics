This product is SO good. I don’t even know what to call it primarily - it has SPF, it’s a colour corrector and makes my skin look plump and glowy, not to mention once you apply it, it changes to match the tone of your skin. I used to have severe acne so I’m left with scars and very sensitive/irritable skin. I find this calms my hyperpigmentation down sooo much. It’s my go-to for ’no makeup’ days and still leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean and so much brighter. I love, pls never change it. Also smells so nice and fresh! Just the best
