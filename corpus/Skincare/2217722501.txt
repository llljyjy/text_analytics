So far I’ve used this twice after receiving it from Influenster for testing purposes and I love the coverage and SPF protection . The shade I received matched my skin tone and it’s good to reduce dullness , even out tone but it’s a light formula so I wouldn’t recommend it on a skin that needs more coverage nan
