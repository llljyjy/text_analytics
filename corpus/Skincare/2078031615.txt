I love this! I was surprised by the ease in color matching when I wore this alone. I have combination skin but it’s summertime in the south so I’m always a wee bit dewy from the humidity lol The sunscreen went on easy with zero discomfort; a little goes a long way. Because it was so sheer, no one noticed my bare face poolside. My skin was totally protected in the sun so even when I laid out, my face did not tan as dramatically as my body. Huge plus so that my makeup would still match! This was also easy to wear under my liquid makeup. No discoloration, no clumping. I was able to completely remove with a regular moistened face wipe. My skin did not feel dry after removal either  I don’t know how this will play for those with skin tones lighter than mine but this one was perfect for me. I’ll be using this all summer. Brown skin rejoice
