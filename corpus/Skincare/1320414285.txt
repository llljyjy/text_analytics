I am in my 40s and have dry skin with rosacea. I have tried so many foundations over the years with little luck finding a good match for my fair skin and finding one that is in cakey or uncomfortable. This product completely covers my redness and looks like my skin but better. A little bit goes a long way I just rub it in my fingertips and then put it on like I would moisture. I have not worn foundation since Iâ€™ve started wearing this and it literally looks like skin. I probably will not be going back to foundation. Life changing
