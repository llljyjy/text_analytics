I received this from Influenster to try and the tube was very small so I csnt comment on long term use, but I didn’t notice any short term results. It was a bit sticky and I don’t think I’d replace my normal vitamin C serum with this one. It’s watery and sticky and if it worked great I’d live with those things, but I just don’t see it working even long term as well as some other serums work. Grateful to try it but wasn’t for me. Not good enough to replace my current serum
