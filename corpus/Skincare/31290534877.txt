The consistency is awesome and it feels so smooth on the skin. The scent is nice and light and a little product goes a long way which is awesome. I personally will probably not be able to continue to use it as I think my skin is too sensitive to it, but I will give it another shot. It's nice, (but maybe not for sensitive skin.)
