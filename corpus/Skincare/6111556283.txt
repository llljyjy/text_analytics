I was struggling with breakouts not understanding why. Until i decided to change my face cleanser because my hunch was saying that it had something to do with it. And I found this cleanser, not expecting it to do anything to me. But i was amazed of how it stopped my breakout from getting worse in just 2 uses. Combine with the oil cleanser they have, im absolutely speechless of how my skin become so much better now, from cleansing my face with the right products. Im tempted to try their other stuff now, i hope it will work for me as well. amazing cleanser!
