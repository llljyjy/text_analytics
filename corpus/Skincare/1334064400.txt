I really enjoyed this 2 in 1 serum. It made my skin feel very soft and was noticeably brighter after the 7 day trial. It didnâ€™t make my skin feel oily and it was absorbed easily.  It did have a scent but it was really nice.  I like that it contains turmeric which is really great for anti aging but I would have to use it longer I think to notice a difference in fine lines. A great 2 in 1 serum
