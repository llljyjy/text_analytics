I received this as a #freeproduct. I used this at night and during the day, and enjoyed how my skin felt moisturized when I woke up. This did cause my a bit of shine when I used it during the day, so if you have oily skin, it might not be the best. The product was fragrance free so it was definitely a bonus, and wonâ€™t be irritating for those with sensitive skin. Great product
