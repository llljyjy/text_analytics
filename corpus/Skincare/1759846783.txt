I like the packaging and that it comes with a sample of the eye cream.  I do wish that it came in a pump or had a spatula for hygienic reasonings.  I do like that I donâ€™t have a reaction to it, I do have very sensitive skin. I donâ€™t really like the smell, it might be because I donâ€™t like rose smells but it rose and something else, which it makes it smells worse than just roses.  I like the texture, it feels kinda jelly like and lightweight but absorbs pretty fast and my skin does feel soft ðŸŒ¹
