This eye cream does a great job of hydrating. Absorbs well into the skin and diffuses light a bit. I prefer a slightly richer formula that plumpsout small wrinkles and i didn’t get that from this one. It’s ingredients lead me to believe that after 3 months of use i will see bigger change to the skin in the eye area, so we will see if this holds true. A good eye cream and I’m glad i got to try it out. If i see any true long term improvement, i will definitely update this review on three months. An effective moisturizer
