I love this product I’ve used it for two years now and I was excited to see that they made a refill to cut back on waste.  However when I put my refill in it did not pump the cream into the top as it should.  I tried taking it out and putting it back in several times several different ways all in vain.  I love the idea of this but the mechanics do not seem to work once a refill put in.  I hope skinfix resolves this issue. Refill doesn’t work properly
