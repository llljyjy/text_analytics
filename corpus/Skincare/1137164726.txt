Great sunscreen! I have oily skin and live in a dry desert climate. I never found a hybrid moisturizer/sunscreen that I like so I’d use both before makeup application. This products replaces both! It works well under makeup and doesn’t leave a white cast. It gives my skin a lit-from-within glow. It feels super light and gives me the perfect amount of moisture. Not sure if it will be enough in the winter months, but now that’s it’s getting warmer it’s perfect. I haven’t experienced any of the pilling the other reviews mentioned, it may be due to my naturally oily skin. great product!
