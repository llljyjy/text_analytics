I’ve opened two packages at this point. Each of them had one of the patches out of its packaging, with all the product leaked out - useless. I used the “good” one from each package under my eyes. Results were barely visible, with some depuffing and nothing else. I get better results from my regular (much cheaper) depuffing gel. Waste of money
