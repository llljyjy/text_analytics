I’ve heard so many great things about Tula prior to trying out this mask, and now I fully understand the hype. WOW. I used this over the span of 2 weeks, and not only did it integrate easily in my existing routine, but it made dramatic improvements in my skin. IN TWO WEEKS. That is almost unheard of for someone like me! I have extremely dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin and I usually avoid a lot of resurfacing products because they’re too harsh for my skin type. The combination of fruit enzymes and gentle acids works perfectly for my skin and even after 10 minutes, my skin is noticeably brighter and feels much smoother. I love how there’s a gentle, tingly sensation as it indicates the product is working it’s magic! It’s not overbearing or harsh unlike other masks I’ve tried in the past and the scent is an added bonus. My makeup has been applying FLAWLESSLY and my skin hasn’t been this clear in months. I’m excited to continue using this and see how radiant my skin becomes in the next couple of weeks! This was my first time ever trying Tula, and it definitely won’t be my last. If you’re wanting to take your skincare game to the next level, you NEED to try this! First time trying Tula and definitely not my last
