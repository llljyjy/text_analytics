Purchased this in the three piece travel set.  This is a thick, greasy ointment, very similar to Vaseline.  I used the tiniest amount possible, and hours later it still had not absorbed into my skin.  It might be useful for someone with very dry skin, and only at night as it leaves a faint shine.  I canâ€™t speak to results, I only used it once.  The texture is just too heavy, and I was afraid it would clog my pores. Heavy ointment, doesn't absorb.
