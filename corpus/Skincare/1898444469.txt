Not only does this gem of a product contain, naicinamide, caffeine (cacao), Japanese goldthread root and 4 types of hyaluronic acid aka functional properties which we all know are amazing for the skin barrier, it also can act as a perfect base for a no makeup make up look giving me that glass skin by using one functional product. Iâ€™ve been loving using it under my make up and adding the minimalist to cover under eye bags and blemishes (as pictured). The texture is a mix of watery and dewy and you basically press it into your skin for optimal benefits. I feel super confident wearing this alone and letting the beauty of my skin shine. 10/10 would recommend. GLASS SKIN HELLO
