I love this product! It’s almost a hybrid between a toner and a lotion. The consistency is watery like a toner, but it moisturizes like a lotion. It has a slight fragrance to it but it fades quickly. It doesn’t leave my face greasy. I suffer from eczema and dry skin, and I noticed less dry patches on my skin when applying makeup while integrating this into my morning routine. nan
