The biggest problem I had with this was the sheet. It was HUGE on my face and just so so so messy. The results I got were not worth the struggle, but the overall formula was good so I couldn’t totally knock it. It is a nice creamy “mud“ texture and does wipe off very easily once it’s complete. Overall I’d buy again if they sold it in a non-sheet form! Mess not worth the results
