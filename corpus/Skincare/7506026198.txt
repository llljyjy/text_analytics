I received this product as an incentive for an honest review. I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I have to say it is extremely moisturizing! I definitely noticed around my eyes where I applied the product to be smoother and looking more refreshed. Thereâ€™s not a huge scent to it, but it does leave your face very hydrated. It wears well with makeup if you have to apply over it. I also really like how the packaging is, the twist top is really helpful. Great Moisturizing product!
