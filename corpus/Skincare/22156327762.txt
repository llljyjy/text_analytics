It’s been slightly reformulated but I still love it. It’s rich, but not heavy. I’m middle aged & have very dry skin & cystic acne at times . Since I started using this cream, I’ve had very few cysts.I’m also allergic to aloe & have celiac. This cream has no aloe or wheat, which many do, so that’s a plus for me. I just wash my face with cetaphil and use this w/ one other rich cream on my lips and eyes. Voilà.  #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Awesome
