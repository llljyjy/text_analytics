This sunscreen is a magnificent everyday sunscreen!  It’s not to thick  and pairs well with makeup.  I waited until an 84 degree day to wear this sunscreen to test the rubbing, it did not run at all!!  Best of all it does not leave a white cast on your face, so black and brown people are able to wear it!  I’m brown skin and it melted in my skin quite nicely! Great Everyday Sunscreen!!
