I have baggy under eyes, lines and have some darkness in the corner of my eyes. Ive used my fair share of eye creams before and it’s been hit or miss. This surprisingly delivered. It’s a thick gel in the pot and you need very little. It spreads under the eyes easily, smoothly and absorbs quickly. I’ve used it at night for a few weeks now and my eyes have been looking smoother, brighter and look well rested (even though, let’s be honest I have not been getting as much sleep). Some eye creams that brighten have some shine to them, which feels like cheating because the brightness was short lived. But this one has been quite impressive so far and I look forward to using the rest of the sample and I’m probably going to buy the full size as well. Definitely would recommend. Smooth
