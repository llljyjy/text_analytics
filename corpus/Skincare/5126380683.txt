Do not buy! I read the reviews and ignored me, so shame on me. They are true, the pillowcases rip and so badly! The zipper has come off completely on one side and small rips by the stitched on logo. Thw small rips happened after 6 months of use and has progressed as I reach one year. They should make them without a zipper to avoid the big tears. Save your money! Find something of better quality. Do not buy!
