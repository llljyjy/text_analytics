I really want to love this product because of what it does to my skin. I makes it look like I am wearing makeup and allows my face to feel soft. HOWEVER, it makes my face feel warm or clogged where I feel congested but I am not actually congested. Please tell me that makes sense. Lol. If you have COMBO skin, I suggest this for the winter as our skin type tends to get dry v the summer. Hopefully in the winter, my face wonâ€™t feel congested with this product. It's a great product... but....
