I received this free from Pinchme for review.  I’m a fan of vitamin c and to have it With niacinamide, SPF, and some coverage!  I do like the glow it gives me, no white film due to sunscreen.   I’m 59 and love the way it feels, just pat on your face, no rubbing because it will cause piling.  I would recommend this product Would recommend
