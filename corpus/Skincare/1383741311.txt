I received this product complimentary from Tula for my honest review. I have sensitive combo skin. This cleanser does have a scent to it (powdery scent) so if you are sensitive to fragrance, I would stay away from this product as the scent does linger. After using this cleanser for two days in a row, I did notice some skin tightness. I do feel that this product is a little pricey for a cleanser that I will only be able to use every other day. I will continue to use this cleanser however, I will most likely not repurchase once itâ€™s finished. nan
