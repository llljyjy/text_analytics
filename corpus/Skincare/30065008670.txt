First of all, yes, the consistency of this serum is rather oily. I’ve tried a few other vit c serums that were more jelly like and disappeared on my skin as soon as I put it on, but honestly, I LOVE that this feels more like a face oil. It feels hydrating, it makes my skin glow as soon as I put it on, and it works really well with my other skincare products. Some people complained that it doesn’t absorb well but it absorbs perfectly fine for me. The more oily consistency gives your face a hydrated look, so maybe they’re confusing that with it not absorbing? Anyway, if you’re looking for a serum that vanishes or are not used to/dislike face oils, I wouldn’t recommend this. That being said, I’ve tried a few other vit c serums but this one works the best for me. It’s potent but not irritating, totally affordable but effective, and it’s non drying but doesn’t cause breakouts. I am very acne prone/have combo skin but I have no issues with this causing acne. My skin loves it, in fact. Like with most skincare products, don’t expect instant results. It takes time. It took about two weeks of consistent use for my hyperpigmentation from old acne to begin to fade. But now this is a staple in my AM routine. Did it magically reduce the size of my pores? No. Did it erase some fine lines? No. But my hyperpigmentation had all but disappeared, my skin is balanced and glowing, my complexion is healthy, and my pores appear smaller than before I used this. If I have a bad hormonal breakout and need a little more oomph for leftover hyperpigmentation, I’ll typically use this both AM and PM and get faster results. Otherwise, it’s an AM staple. I also love that, it being The Ordinary, what it says on the bottle is all that’s in the ingredients. One of my biggest pet peeves when searching for a good vit c serum was all the extra additives and harsh chemicals in them (many of which have Disodium EDTA). But this one is clean and wonderfully effective Honestly, has my love forever
