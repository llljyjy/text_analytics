This is my very first chemical exfoliant and I do really love it! It tingles a tiny bit for me but am gradually feeling less tingly. I’ve been using it once a week for a few months now and do really love it! Takes off all the dead skin I get (I sometimes have tret face) and leaves me feeling silky soft. Think I’ll be upping it to 10% Awesome!!
