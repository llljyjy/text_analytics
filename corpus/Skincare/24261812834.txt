This is overall a great sunscreen! I found that it absorbs pretty well, doesn’t leave any streaks and there’s no irritating fragrance. I have dry, acne-prone skin and it doesn’t make me break out at all! It does feel a bit sticky and shiny when first applied but it does even out after a short while. I would use this over the previous sunscreen I used which was double the price! nan
