I received the Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist as a #freeproduct to review from #trywithtopbox. The mist is strong and refreshing in the morning. Every time i use it my skin get firmer and my pores are less visible, It gives my skin a little shiny look but not greasy. I use it everyday as a make up setting spry and I also use it alone to refresh my skin. This product is gentle with my skin, no irritation, no clogging poresâ€¦ I like it a lot. nan
