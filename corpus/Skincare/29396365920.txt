It makes me sad to give this product 3 stars because I am such a fan of the actual moisturizer. I have always loved the Langeige products and packaging, but I am disappointed that they have switched to a cheaper-looking and feeling container with the same price tag. Atleast with the previous glass packaging and clear applicator, it felt like it matched the price you were paying. You can feel and see that this plastic container and applicator is much cheaper quality, yet weâ€™re paying the same price. So, overall, I recommend the actual product as a moisturizer but am disappointed in the rebrand quality. Take that as you will. Cheap Rebrand :(
