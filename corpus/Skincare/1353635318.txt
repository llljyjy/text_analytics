I LOVE this product. I have been using it at night and wake up with my skin glowing! I can definitely tell a difference in hydration and overall texture. I’m hoping with continued use I’ll see a few of my fine lines fade away. The packaging is lovely and you get a lot of product in the jar… I’m expecting it to last for quite a while. The texture of the cream is thick but it definitely goes to work and after it absorbs, you’re just left with a silky and glowing complexion. There’s a slight smell to it that’s not my favorite, but it fades away pretty quickly after application. Dr. Dennis Gross skincare products never seem to disappoint! LOVE THIS!!
