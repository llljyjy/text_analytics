If I could leave a 0 star review I would. I started using this thinking it would help with my acne scaring and pores but it did complete opposite of that. It made me break out like I never have before. I get the occasional hormonal pimple but this caused me to break out almost everywhere even my neck! I have never broken out on my neck. I would say if you start using this maybe make sure it’s the only new skincare item in your routine that’s new just in case. Made me breakout :/
