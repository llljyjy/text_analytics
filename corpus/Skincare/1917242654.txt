Feels nice and plump on the skin, but I didn’t notice any benefits other than general moisture and maybe a little firming. It keeps puffiness and fine lines at bay (I don’t “struggle“ with either), but I think you could go for a more affordable option to get similar results. The wee pump is a great feature, but sometimes it just stops drawing up product. I’ve ended up pulling out the plastic tube and scraping off product with my fingers, which defeats the hygienic purpose of the pump. It's Good - Not life changing
