I received this product as part of a free sample program. I’ve been using this product for about a week now and it doesn’t see to have an ill effects on my oily t-zone/combination skin. I use this daily in replacement of Cosrx hydrium watery toner and Laneige essence. The product smells a bit like green tea and apples, not too fragranced which is nice. Initial application of this product is quite refreshing and keeps my skin supple without a greasy feeling.Deducted one star due to the design of the opening. The opening is way too large which makes it hard to control how much product you pour out as the directions say to first pour into palms and then directly onto your face. Supple without the greasy feeling
