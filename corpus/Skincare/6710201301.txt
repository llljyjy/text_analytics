I recieved this as an Influester box sample and I was really excited to try. I have been a long time Clinique user and have been using their brand of creams for over 10 years. I loved this cream. It was a mix between a gel and a cream, light enough for oily skin but nourishing enough for dry skin such as myself. Very pleased with this and will be buying the full product soon. Great for oily and dry skin
