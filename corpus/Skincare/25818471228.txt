I was a little worried as this lotion is much creamier then my previous, but itâ€™s AMAZING!  The texture is creamy and can be applied easily.  My skin looks and feels soft, smooth and plumper. This does have a rather strong fragrance, but it does not bother me once the lotion is on my skin.  Also, a little goes a long way, which in my book is great as it lasts a long time! Must have!
