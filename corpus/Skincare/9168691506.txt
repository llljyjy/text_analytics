Received free for testing purposes. I live in an area where there’s seasonal changes. It’s quite cold in the winter months and hot in the summer months. I tend to wear heavier /more nourishing face/eye cream in the winter and lighter creams in the summer. For this eye cream, it would definitely be my winter cream. It’s a little thicker. I put it on after my shower, get dressed and then put make up on. This gives it time to soak. For the summer, it might take longer to set in with the humidity/heat. At night I put it on before bed. Which could also be a great night cream for the summer. I do recommend it, there’s a fragrance though. So be careful! #gotitfree #influenster Great for cold winter months!
