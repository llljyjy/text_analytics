This has such an interesting texture. It feels really thick, almost gel like but then it’s bouncy? If you held it upside down it would not come out. But once you apply it, it feels lightweight and amazing! Doesn’t feel heavy at all but it does feel super moisturizing. My skin instantly looks glowy, not greasy. I absolutely love this stuff! It’s gentle for everyday use and great under makeup. Interesting texture
