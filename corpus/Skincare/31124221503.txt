This only has one speed, which is super unfortunate. I can only use this on my cheeks as it is way too harsh for other areas of my face. When I say harsh, I was worried this would bruise my face. The tool itself is heavy and feels luxurious, but I donâ€™t think this is worth the price point. If there were adjustable speeds I would keep this product. I am definitely disappointed. Not Worth It
