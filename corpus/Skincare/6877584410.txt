I bought this product on a whim in Sephora, and after using it about 5-6 times over the last week I’m still amazed!  I wouldn’t say it reduces my puffiness as I don’t generally have puffiness.  But it makes my eyes look AWAKE.  I normally use caffeine eye masks but this does the trick in and can be applied under your moisturizer.  And way easier on the wallet Momma needs a Wake Up - and this is it.
