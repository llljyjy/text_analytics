I  didn’t think that I was going to like this. It has some ingredients that I am not familiar with and normally would not seek out. However, this stuff is amazing. It has a gritty texture, but it is not harsh or abrasive on the skin. There is a slight scent that I would not describe as pleasant or unpleasant but it doesn’t linger. This my skin feeling very smooth and a bit glowing just like it says. nan
