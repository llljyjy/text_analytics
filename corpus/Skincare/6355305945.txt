I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This is very similar to the original but in a gel-cream formula. This has a very thick consistency, thicker than most eye creams. I use a very small amount and it goes a long way. I would be careful if you’re prone to milia. I’ve used this for 2 weeks and it is very hydrating which helps my under eyes look more plump. I think I would need to use it for longer to notice if my under eye darkness improved. So far I haven’t seen much of a difference but I will continue to use it Hydrating
