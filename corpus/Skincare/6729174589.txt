Every single Farmacy product I’ve tried has been amazing and this one is no different. I got a mini through rewards and I’m going to be so sad when it’s gone. I have fairly oily skin and a lot of moisturizers can be too heavy but this is moisturizing without being too heavy and makes a really great cream for bedtime. And there’s just the lightest honey smell which is really nice. obsessed!
