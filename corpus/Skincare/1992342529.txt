Like this! It’s not a love- a bit heavy feeling for something that’s only a 40 SPF on my delicate medium skin. Fine lines are a concern for me, and some of these heavier creams make me feel like my skin is suffocating and being pulled on when I apply. The CC power is good on this if you’re looking for coverage. nan
