I absolutely love this face cream! It melts right into your skin once you put it on and is super hydrating. Itâ€™s thick but does not feel heavy or make your skin feel greasy at all. My skin is so soft and smooth since using this product everyday! I use a heavier moisturizer in the winter because the cold weather makes my skin dry and this has been a great addition to my routine. A must have!
