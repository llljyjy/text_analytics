This toner was decently sized and unscented which is perfect for my sensitive skin. Toners tend to sting for me after washing my face and it can also be drying. BUT this toner was great, didn’t sting or irritate my skin. It’s vegan, clean & rich with vitamins C and E. It’s helped me so much with skin brightening, especially since I have lots of hyperpigmentation. It’s true that quality doesn’t have to be expensive, the ingredients in this toner says it all. It’s been great for my sensitive skin and I can’t wait to purchase my next bottle! Love that it’s VEGAN AND CLEAN!
