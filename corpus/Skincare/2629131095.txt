I received this product for FREE from @topbox and @laneige in exchange for my honest review. This serum changed my life!!! It’s so unbelievably light weight, absorbs almost instantly into your skin and leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I found it to be so hydrating, and it’s helped so much to improve my skin barrier, my skin has never looked better. It’s loaded with peptides, green tea enzyme and algae to firm, exfoliate and hydrate and it has no strong scent which I love! I used this morning and night and it has seriously done wonders for me. My skin is looking so clear, plump and healthy. The packaging is unique, you twist the top to pop out the dispenser and I’ve found that two pumps is enough cover my whole face and neck. I do wonder if I’ll be able to use all the product since the tube doesn’t actually come open though, which would be heartbreaking with such a beloved product, especially for the price. That being said, I’m already thinking about getting another since it says one Sephora it’s a limited edition, even considering the price. I’d hate to miss out on having it once this one is finished!! An absolutely amazing product that you should try, you (and your skin barrier) will be glad you did! This serum changed my life
