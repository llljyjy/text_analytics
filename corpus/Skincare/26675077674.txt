I was in the market for a new night moisturizer since it appears that the one I’ve been using for years was discontinued, or they’re having supply issues. I’ve used a couple of other Farmacy products and have loved them, particularly the Green Clean. I was also having issues with sebum build up on my forehead (tiny bumps that I could feel with my fingers but not really see). I’ve been using this night mask combined with Drunk Elephants Beste No.9 Jelly Cleanser for almost a month now. The sebum build up is totally gone, my skin looks more even in the morning, and it just feels healthier. I have (adult) acne prone skin so trying any new product is a total gamble, yet I’ve had zero issues with this night mask. Total game changer. Game Changer
