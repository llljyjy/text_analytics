I have dry and sensitive skin. With this primer, my skin looked really great! Smooth and the pores looked less obvious. I did have some sensitivity to the salicylic acid, but as long as I only use it every couple of days, I haven’t had any other issues. For reference, since turning 30 or so, I’ve had this sensitivity. Now that I’m in my 40s, it’s still just the same. My teenage daughter has been using it too and she loves it. I will be buying her the full size next time I put in a Sephora order Great Primer
