I love this moisturizer! I use it under the watermelon glow sunscreen, and the dewy glow you get is so nice. I have combo skin, so it helps to keep my face hydrated, but also doesn’t make my skin look oily. I also live in a humid/hot area (South Texas,) but it really keeps my face hydrated all day and not too oily. It has a light scent, which I like, it’s very “fresh.” Only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish it helped with dark spots, instead of having to buy something else to use with it and making sure to find the right combo. But I’ll more than likely try their brightening serum, since both products I have purchased from them have really done a good job for my skin. Fresh and Hydrating!
