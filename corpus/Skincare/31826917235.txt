My skin feels very very smooth and soft after using this every night. It lost two stars for the weird rusty brown flecks. I think thereâ€™s a weird reaction happening, maybe old stock. It was a real turnoff at first, but the flecks disssolve when squeezed or I just pick them out. Would not purchase again though because of that. nan
