I have melasma from childbirth and it never went away. was getting worse. was prescribed Arazlo which didn’t help, then hydroquinone. Before I started using the hydroquinone I went on a trip for 3 weeks and took a small bottle of this. Didn’t pay attention until I came back that my melasma is barely visible and my face better than even. nan
