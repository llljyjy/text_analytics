I received this for free from Influencer for my honest and true review. The sample size was great to try out a new product. I felt it was thick and moisturized my face well. It didn’t feel to heavy or greasy. I didn’t like the smell it reminded me of something my grandma would have used. I doubt I would buy this again based on the smell. Grandmas moisturizer
