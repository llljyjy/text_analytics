I’ve been only using this for a few days and I can already tell a major difference in my skin! It’s more hydrated and supple, and definitely more even toned in conjunction with my current AM & PM skincare regimens. I was initially taken aback by the texture but quickly got used to it. It feels like an oil/water hybrid, watery texture but (good) oily application? It’s moisturizing af so I definitely don’t need as much as I would with the hylauronic acid. I’m still figuring out what application method works best for me but so far I’m enjoying mixing 2-4 drops into my moisturizer. I advise to determine how much product to use based on personal preferences and skin type. So far I’d recommend! still figuring it out but like it!
