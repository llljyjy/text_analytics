Okay so I was excited to get this, because I love clay skincare. Especially masks. I really like the idea of this product, clean paraben free ingredients. It includes apple cider vinegar/witch hazel. And it’s cruelty free. So far it’s helping clear up my skin issues. I have less pimples, and blackheads and my pores look a bit smaller. It’s also helping with the excess oil, since I have combination sensitive skin. By the way the product itself smells really good, even though I’m not big on scents. The only thing I can complain about is the applicator, I don’t like it. Plus I feel like I’m wasting product. I also wish the size was bigger. It’s only 1.23 oz. But I definitely will be checking out other products from this brand. nan
