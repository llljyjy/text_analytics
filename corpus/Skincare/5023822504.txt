While I have received a free sample for my honest review, I have been using this for a while purchased with my own money. Both when it was a 72 hour hydrator and now that it is 100 hour. I use it primarily as an overnight mask after serums and moisturizer, andas  the last stage of my skincare at night. It works better than most overnight masks, and I wake up with dewy hydrated skin in the morning. I highly recommend it used that way. Best as an overnight mask
