My sister swears by this stuff but I HATED it. First, it looks like a putty you would use to fill holes in your dry wall. Definitely not green, has like a grey cast to it. I used the tiniest little bit that was on the inside of the lid. It didn’t blend out good and it stinks!! I am fair skinned with freckles but I tan nicely. I have a gorgeous tan now and this made me look ashy. I’ve seen dead people have more color! It was like a mask on my skin and it stunk! I washed my face to get it off I couldn’t handle the smell after it only being on 15 minutes. The closest Sephora to me is an hour away and I will be making the drive to get my money back. Absolutely awful. OMGOSH just awful!!
