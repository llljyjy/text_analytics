This is a really nice sunscreen. One of the best that I have tried. I have rosacea and I really appreciate that there is no fragrance, it’s mineral-based and it is tinted. I don’t find it drying or greasy.  However, it is very expensive so I can only see myself buying this again during a sale. Also, the packaging is not good. I like the shape but paint comes off of the packaging onto your hands and then you rub it all over your face. That is obviously not ideal. Good Product but Expensive and poor packaging
