I received a free sample of this from Influenster. I have been working on revamping my skincare routine and I was immediately impressed when adding this cream into my morning mix. I prefer face products that contain antioxidants so I was excited to read that the santorini grape is full of them! I found this to be very hydrating and it gave life back to my dry, winter skin. It leaves your face feeling so soft and it absorbs quickly. I also loved it as a primer for my makeup. I had bought a popular foundation and I wasn’t a fan of it until using this cream prior to applying it and now I love it! I typically add gradual self tanner drops into my face moisturizers.. usually it takes 12 full hours to develop and I found that when mixing it with this cream, I had noticeable color within just a few hours! I’d definitely recommend this product to anyone :) nan
