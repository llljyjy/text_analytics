I was really confused when i received it because it says lotion on the bottle but it’s not lotion. It’s a watery lotion made for Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily Skin types. It’s meant to help with Pores, Dryness, and Redness. It definitely helped with redness&dryness! It soothes my skin and i love how it makes my skin feel cool and refreshed. I would recommend it! I would purchase it for myself! nan
