It’s a great product! It brings a healthy glow to your skin - almost like a dewy fresh look. It’s a great quality product, and goes on very lightweight. My one issue is that I have very oily skin and wear makeup regularly - I noticed it started to make my makeup slippery when I tried using it as a moisturizer underneath. Even when I wasn’t wearing makeup, my face would go from dewy to greasy really quick. Ultimately, I stopped using it, but I think this could be great for folks with dull and dry skin! Great product! But looks greasy on oily skin.
