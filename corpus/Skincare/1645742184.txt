Received as a gift for my honest opinion. Itâ€™s not my fav product from YTTP. My face and neck felt very dry afterwards. Sprayed the Adaptogen hydration mist and it helped a bit. My skin is more combo maybe this is why it caused this. The product has an odor even though it fragrance free. Personally this product is just not for me. Knowing all of there products from YTTP this will be a wonder cream for many. nan
