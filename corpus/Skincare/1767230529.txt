I was actually surprised that this moisturizer really does make your skin look matte and controls oil! On top of that the moisturizer feels smooth when applying and leaves my skin feeling so soft! Perfect for then going in with makeup, I can definitely tell a difference with how my foundation lays after trying this out. I’ve tried a lot of matte moisturizer and most of them were ok, but this one I can say really makes a difference! The smell is a bit strong, but I definitely liked it and it didn’t linger. Also, I’m normally acne prone but this didn’t cause any sensitivities or issues for me. Awesome!
