I was previously using The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Exfoliating Blemish Solution. It wasn’t giving me great results, so thought I’d try this one. I am impressed. My skin texture, as well as acne has improved significantly. I only use this once daily, in my nighttime routine, because I find that it balls up under my primer/makeup for daytime and is a bit too oily for daytime use for me. I use this first, wait a few minutes, and layer on the Ordinary Niacinamide 10%+Zinc 1% serum, wait a few, then apply the Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2%. I have been using almost 4 weeks now. Great results
