I have been using this product for a little over 4 weeks already. I like how hydrated it keeps the skin and making it feel soft. A little goes a long way because it is kind off a thick cream which is good. I even like that there is no scent. The packaging is nice and simple and I like that it’s also refillable when I’m done. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox liked
