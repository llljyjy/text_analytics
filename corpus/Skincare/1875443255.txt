I’ve been using the cloud cream for over a week and I really like it. It has a light blue color and calming natural lavender smell. It has a creamy texture which isn’t that heavy compared to other night cream, but is easy to apply, spread and absorb. It also provides great hydration to my skin overnight even during dry weather. My skin is moist, smooth and refreshed in the morning. Great night cream
