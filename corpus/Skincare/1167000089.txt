This didn’t seem to do for me what it did for others. At the same time, it definitely didn’t seem to hurt my skin in anyway. I am very sensitive and acne prone and this did not irritate me or cause sensitivity or breakouts. I probably won’t buy it again. It’s so reasonably priced though so we’ll see. just okay
