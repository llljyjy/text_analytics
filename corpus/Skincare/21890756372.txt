I fell in love with this eye balm as soon as I read the ingredients. I’m very pleased with how easily this balm applies. I just hold the balm under my eye for a few seconds to warm it up and it glides nicely. I apply every morning and evening and haven’t had any issues with wear. I have dry skin and always worry about dark circles and wrinkles around my eyes. I love how easily I’ve applied this eye balm into my routine. I definitely recommend! Powerhouse Eye Balm
