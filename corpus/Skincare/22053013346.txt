I have hereditary dark circles and puffiness, that said, however, I do find certain products to help. This product was recommended with rave reviews, thus, I switched from my regular La Mer to this as a less expensive alternative. I gave it an excellent chance - used morning and night, consistently for two bottles. I did not notice a single difference with either short-term, or long-term usage. No short, or Long Term Difference
