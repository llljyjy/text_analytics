I’ve been wanting to try these separately for so long but couldn’t justify the price. The eye patches feel great in the morning. I store them in a mini fridge so they’re very cool when I apply. The moisturizer is just ok imo I feel like it takes awhile for it to sink into the skin. But it doesn’t flake off and I haven’t broken out at all. A good value
