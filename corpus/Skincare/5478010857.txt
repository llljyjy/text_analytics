I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could. I like the idea of this, but not the applicator, and the “dark” needs to be a little bit darker. All in all I’ll use it up, I’m just not sure if I’ll repurchase.  And even though I said I’d recommend it,  I’m honestly not sure if I’d recommend it to someone else my skin tone or deeper. hmmmm…
