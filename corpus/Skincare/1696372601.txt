Are use this product for a few days a few weeks apart and I like that it gives me the subtle glow that I’m used to in the summertime. I think that it smells OK, it doesn’t have a very heavy watermelon smell to it but it’s not bad I would recommend this product if you’re looking for a subtle tan. Good for subtle glow.
