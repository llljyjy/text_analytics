Nice rich cream,  but not too heavy. You need the slightest amount for a nice level of hydration.  When I wake up my skin is so smooth, soft and supple.  I used this for the first time after spending a few nights in the hospital for testing which wreaked havoc on my skin.  I noticed SIGNIFICANT improvement after the first use in hydration, redness, irritation and tiny bumps.  Highly recommended Highly recommended!
