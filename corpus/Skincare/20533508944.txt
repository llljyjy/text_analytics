The ingredients were mostly water so was very skeptical about the effects of this so I first bought a small one to try and surprisingly it calmed my skin down and lessened my hormonal breakouts. I’m on my third bottle right now and it’s now a current staple in my skincare routine. Docked one star off because do you really need to overcharge water? surprisingly works!
