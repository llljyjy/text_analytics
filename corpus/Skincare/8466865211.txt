This eye cream is without a doubt one of the worst purchases of my life, I think that even in the drugstore I would have found better ones.  It is expensive, the bottle, although it says it contains the same amount as most eye creams on the market, seems extremely small to me, it is very dense and takes a long time to be absorbed by the skin and in addition to moisturizing (nothing exceptional) I didn’t see any other benefit in my under eyes.  Important: if you have a tendency to milia, please don’t use this, it caused several on my lower eyelid.  It’s not good, don’t waste your money on this one, you can find many cheaper and better eye creams.  I wouldn’t buy this again , and I do not recommend it to anyone Worst eye cream I’ve ever used
