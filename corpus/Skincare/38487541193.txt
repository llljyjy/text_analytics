It’s an average sunscreen to me. I will give it brownie points for not leaving a white cast(with it being a chemical sunscreen) but it has a very heavy fragrance to it. I don’t know if it’s to mask the “sunscreensy” smell (it absolutely does) but if you are sensitive to smells you should look for a different sunscreen. I’m surprised this didn’t break me out! The “dewy” is very close to crossing the greasy line. Overall this product is a 6/10 for me! :) It’s Okay!
