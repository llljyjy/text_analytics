Heed this comment and others like it: DO NOT PURCHASE THE REFILL!! The container does not close. I tried for a half hour before giving up. I even wasted producting trying to press and turn the container. Absolutely terrible and a bummer.Overall, the product is great and feels good on my skin. This is technically the third time Iâ€™ve purchased, but the first time I used the refill. This experience really put a damper on my relationship to the brand. But again, the product itself is a good. Refill does not fit, container will not close
