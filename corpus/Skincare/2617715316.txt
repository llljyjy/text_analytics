I have been very impressed with this product. After the first application my skin felt incredibly smooth and the fine lines on my face were much less visible. For longer term results, you need to be consistent, but follow the instructions and start with every other day as retinol can irritate skin. Also this is a NIGHT cream for a reason. Retinol makes you skin much more sensitive to UV, so apply at night and use a sunscreen moisturizer in the morning. Skip usage if you know youâ€™ll be exposed to a lot of sun/UV. Impressive
