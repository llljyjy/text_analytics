The Shiseido Anti-Aging serum has become a staple in my skincare routine! I use it every morning and night as recommended, and I definitely notice a difference! Not only is my skin tighter and smoother, but it’s actually helped decrease my acne. I have sensitive combination skin, and this product didn’t invoke a reaction like most serums do. There no harsh fragrance or unpleasant tacky feeling on my face after using. This has been a wonderful experience. Wonder Serum
