I’m not big on moisturizers, but i’m in my late 40’s now and I need some protection for my skin especially in the winter. This cream is extremely thick and it does take a while to fully absorb. It smells nice, not overpowering at all, and it stays put all day long. Meaning, I can feel the softness of it the entire day. Not sure about wearing it in the summer but we’ll see! A very substantial cream. Love the refill option! Very thick, smells nice, stays put
