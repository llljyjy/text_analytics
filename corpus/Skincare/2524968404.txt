This has to be my new favorite moisturizer. I’ve never experienced anything quite like this. Upon applying, it feels like a thicker consistency, but it very quickly seems to melt into a thinner/lighter substance that can only be compared to a cloud. It’s so moisturizing yet so light. It has some type of magic in it! I LOVE this! Must try!
