I received the goopglow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser free from Influenster for my honest opinion. I have oily skin most of the time. Having said that, I felt the cleanser was a little too much oil. It was harder to remove the cleanser than most. It felt like it was filmy and it took a bit more scrubbing to get it cleaned off. Donâ€™t get me wrong, my face felt nice and soft after I was able to get it cleaned off. The scent however, reminded me of the pharmacy exfoliating cleanser. All and all, it did what it said it was going to do. It did help exfoliate my skin and made my face feel refreshed. Goop
