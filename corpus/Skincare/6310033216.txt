I received a trial sample of Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum spf 40 from PinchMe. Although I appreciate the clean and effective ingredients, I just can’t get past the heavy feel of this product. It just sits on top of my face and never sinks in. If you have really dry skin and love a dewey look, you might like this. I have oily skin and this serum made my face feel like I smeared a layer of cooking oil on top of it. If you prefer a matte look, don’t even bother. Meh
