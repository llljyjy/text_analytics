I have combination skin thatâ€™s prone to feeling dry but I hate heavy the heavy feeling of most moisturizers so I was worried about trying out this product.But to my surprise, it was super easy to apply and the heavy feeling left after a couple of seconds. It smells OK, a tad orangey but I love how it left my skin feeling moisturized without the product/layer being noticeable.After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin looked brighter, softer and had no breakouts (yay!).The only issue is that too much product comes out at once and sometimes the scent feels off. But otherwise my picky skin liked it and I loved that my visage looked so much better. 4.5/5** although I recieve this product for free, the opinions and thoughts are my own. A non-heavy feeling moisturizer for the win!
