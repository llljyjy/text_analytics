This review is for the cherry blossom scent. I love the Laneige lip mask, and the sweet candy, gummy bear and berry are wonderful. The scent of the cherry blossom is way too floral for a lip product. It has the same smooth and beautiful finish, but the scent is overwhelming. Itâ€™s not sweet- just strongly perfumed and not pleasant at all. nan
