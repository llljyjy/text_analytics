I am in my 30s and I like fresh product  to address skin concerns - when I tried this product, this tea serum does what it states to do, your skin does feel clean and refreshed, I would wash my face in the am, add the serum then spf and make up. I noticed it reduced my redness around my t-zone after cleansing. This serum would be great for someone who wants good ingredients and going for a fresh clean feeling. It layers well under make ups and spf . nan
