I got this for free from influenster for my honest opinion, so Let’s start out with the good:I love the metal part of it, it’s so cooling and great for puffiness. It seems to really hydrate my under eyes and it’s great for putting under concealer for a nice dewy look. Really hydrates very well. The bad: the price, sheesh! It’s expensive for an eye cream that I’m not sure really does any better than a lower end eye cream. And it has a very strong smell like most of these products do from brands like Dior, estee, Chanel, etc. Good product, maybe not worth the price.
