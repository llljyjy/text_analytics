this is a really good eye cream for teens and people in their early-mid twenties with little issues on wrinkles or hydration. A luxurious beginner eye cream. I give it the star rating I gave because for someone that is 30 and with pronounced eye wrinkles, this eye cream felt amazing at first but then it dried out my eyes after a few hours. I highly recommend this eye cream for younger people for that nice lift but not people who have dry eye skin or looking for anti-aging results. For younger people with no aging/wrinkly issues
