I received a free product, but this review is my honest opinion. This C Beyond Triple Serum is very easy to apply. I like that it has an SPF 40 protection. I didn’t like how it has the same stinging feeling that I feel with some other SPF products. It also leaves a weird texture on my face (but I’m kind of picky about textures when it comes to facial products). It has a slight tint to it, which is great. I probably wouldn’t buy this as I have another product that I enjoy more. nan
