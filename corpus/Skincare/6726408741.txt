So impressed! I didn’t expect to love this product as much as I did. I anticipated that it would be a luxury experience and feel, but underdeliver on what is promised. I have to say I’m pleasantly surprised! The product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin. I noted a decrease in dark skin pigmentation after about 2.5 weeks. I will say the applicator was a bit frustrating at first as it tends to apply and inconsistent amount of product with each use. For $80 I would hope they can resolve that. Great product, ok packaging/applicator.
