Prob my most recommended product. Everyone needs this! It’s super user friendly - I usually mix in with a serum. It’s very user friendly - I’ve gone thru 2 bottles and I’ve never messed it up. Just remember to wash your hands after you apply it (and again if you’re applying anything else over it at the end of your skincare routine to be safe!). fave face tanner
