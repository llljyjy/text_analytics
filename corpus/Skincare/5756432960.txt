I have dry skin but not super dry and this stuff was not moisturizing enough. I think this product is most suitable for someone with oily skin. It sank into my skin instantly and never broke me out, but it just wasn’t great. I wouldn’t repurchase this for me but I can see how it works for others. I love that it is refillable. Just Okay
