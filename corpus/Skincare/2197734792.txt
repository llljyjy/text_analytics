I wear makeup pretty much 24/7 so my body tends to tan faster than my face. These drops give me a nice subtle glow/tan that makes the color difference less noticeable! the only thing is, I can’t say this will actually TAN your skin - more of a glow drop for temporary color.  I wear it under makeup and it doesn’t impact my application at all. nan
