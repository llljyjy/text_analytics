Kiehls midnight recovery omega rich cloud cream is my new night time moisturizer. It has a whipped feel to it and a light scent , not too over powering . It absorbs into my skin pretty quickly not leaving my skin feeling oily . By morning my skin feels refreshed, smooth and so soft . Itâ€™s definitely a game changer for my night time routine.
