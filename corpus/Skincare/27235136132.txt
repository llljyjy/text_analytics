This serum amplifies my moisturizer and makes my skin silky smooth and soft without leaving behind any sticky or heavy residue! As an added bonus the bottle is absolutely gorgeous and feels luxurious, and the product itself smells like a luxury perfume.I will say that the smell may be overpowering to people who have an aversion to “classic“ luxury brand scents and fragrances - it definitely smells more like perfume than standard skincare products do. nan
