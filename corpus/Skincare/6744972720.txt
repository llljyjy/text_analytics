I actually got the Green colored Pear scented one. Doesn’t really have a scent or flavor. The gloss is sheer, a little goes a long way. It isn’t sticky like most glosses and is lightly hydrating. I have had it for months and it’s still lasting. I use it as a clear gloss topper for lip colors or by itself. It was an impulse buy and I can’t decide if the price was worth it or not but I don’t hate the product. sheer, non-sticky lipgloss
