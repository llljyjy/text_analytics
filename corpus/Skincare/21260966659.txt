While it seems to clean the skin relatively well, I’m not a fan of the oily residue it leaves on the skin. It definitely takes a while to rinse off. Also wish this didn’t come in a tube because it’s hard to get out of the container and maintaining the balm consistency at the same time. But as someone with acne-prone skin, it hasn’t broken me out and for the price point these concerns might be overlooked. nan
