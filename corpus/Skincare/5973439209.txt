This was highly recommended for pregnant and nursing women and I gotta say, Iâ€™ve never been so on it before with using masks. I really love it and am itching to try other masks/products by them. Every time I use it, my skin feels amazing and looks so fresh. I use it at night mostly, and then slather on hydrating products after cleaning it off, and I use this twice a week religiously. I feel like my skin looks healthier, especially with pregnancy hormones doing a number on my skin, this helps clear and soften and calm it. Highly recommend this
