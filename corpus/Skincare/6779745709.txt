I have always wanted one of these, and for good reason! I love sticking this in my fridge and then using it to roll on my face to wake me up. It de-puffs me and is so refreshing. The small end is great for getting in smaller areas on the face without being too harsh. You need to try this! So Soothing and Refreshing!
