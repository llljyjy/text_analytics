This left my skin so soft and hydrated and had almost an instant brightening affect. I can notice almost immediately how plump and more alive my skin looks after application. I brought this along on my trip to Spain in July and it was perfect for everyday wear and never felt heavy or sticky even in the 95 degree heat and profuse sweating that occurred. Perfect summer moisturizer
