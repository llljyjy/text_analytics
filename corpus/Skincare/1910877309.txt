I am a huge fan of Ole Henricksson so I was super excited to get this eye cream to test. I really liked that this was gentle around the eye. it has a thicker texture so a little goes a long way. I do feel like Iâ€™ve seen some brightening around my eyes from this product. the price point is reasonable for the amount of product that you get. Would definitely recommend! nan
