I love this. I don’t use it specifically for redness but rather for hydration due to the ceramides. I love this. Minimal scent, lightweight and non greasy yet hydrating. My skin looks and feels more plump. I have super dry skin so I’m amazed that this has really made my skin a lot less dry. I follow up with a light moisturizer and oil on top and my skin is glowing. I am also acne prone and it does not aggravate or flare up my acne. love it
