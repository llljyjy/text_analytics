I absolutely love this balm once I got it I had to try it . It’s so thick and doesn’t have a smell which I love I have dry skin so think stuff os amazing for my skin. I use it on my neck and it leaves my skin hydrated like all day .! I would just changed the price I mean it’s Dior and I think it’s worth it because it’s amazing Loved it
