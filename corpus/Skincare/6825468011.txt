I’ve been trying to find something to help with the dark hollows under my eyes--it’s primarily loss of collagen, but also some minor pigmentation (I’m currently 35 years old). I saw great reviews for this product and started using it twice daily. I’ve been treating my eyes with this, paired with occasional Shiseido undereye retinol masks, and it’s worked absolute wonders. My eyes look SO much younger and fresher! Definitely an amazing purchase, especially for that price. Don't even hesitate, just buy it
