I love this product! I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks, but I’ve seen visible differences in my blackheads. This product has salicylic acid in it. It helps my blackheads and bigger blemishes decrease in size. It also reduces the inflammation in these areas.  This product does not work well on my whiteheads. I would recommend a hydrocolloid patch instead. I am used to using unscented products, so I do not notice an unusual or bad smell, unlike other reviews. I don’t find that the scent bothers me.
