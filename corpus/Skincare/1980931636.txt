I am now experimenting with different serums for wrinkles and was happy to try the #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox.  Although it was only a small sachet, it did go on smooth and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  I don’t have wrinkles at the moment, but am looking to prevent it.  I’ve always loved clinique products, so I’m sure with long-term use, it would help! Lovely serum
