I really love this, it is beautiful and luxurious. It doesn’t irritate my skin and makes it soft. Those who are saying it leaves a residue and there is makeup left- it is a cleansing oil, not a face wash. If you wear makeup you are supposed to double cleanse, cleansing oil softens your makeup and breaks it down and then you wash your face with a cleanser to completely remove it from your face. If you wear makeup you should be double cleansing, even just using a cleanser once isn’t enough. You also have to shake the bottle before using it and i use about two-three pumps for a full face of makeup. Again it is made to break up makeup not completely remove it, and the film that is on your skin is meant to be washed off with another cleanser. It is a very gentle formula which i love. I have tried other cleansing oils and they don’t work half as well as this one. I wear lots of glitter on my eyes and after using this and the ordinary’s fulvic acid wash my face is completely clean. If you aren’t using the product properly, you aren’t going to get desired results. Use it properly!
