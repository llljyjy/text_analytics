the other reviews are right. i popped open the pump to get into the bottle to get all the product since i didnt have a back up, and oh my, this rebranded bulbous bottle holds about half an inch deep by a quarter inch wide filled with product…. whats the rest of the bottle for then? it is comically large and 50% less product than the old glass packaging. i like the product but for the price and seeing what you actually get, probably won’t rebuy again. big bottle no product barely any product
