I have definitely seen a reduction in my acne scars that I’ve had for years on my forehead!!! I now barely can see scars. This product really really impressed me, I’ve never seen such a big change in my scars and I’ve done micro needling before to get rid of the scars which barely worked. With this serum I 100% see a huge improvement. My scars are barely there now.   At first this I did feel a bit of a burn when applying this serum but I think it’s cz I wasn’t used to the lactic acid but after a minute or 2 it stopped burning and didn’t leave any negative effects like redness on my skin. Now that I’ve been using it every night I don’t feel that burning sensation anymore. Amazing for scars
