This set is perfect for travel, and thereâ€™s enough product for several days (or maybe a couple weeks?) depending on how much you use each day. I personally liked the makeup removing balm the best out of the three -- it had a pleasant fragrance and did a great job of removing my makeup. The peel was okay, but I would recommend using it only about once a week. Nice travel set
