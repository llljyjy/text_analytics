I really need caudalie to repackage this product into a bottle that gives more than 1 oz. I would even pay more. I love this formula and how silky it feels on my skin and it smells amazing, but it just run out so quickly and I cycle through probably 3 or 4 of these a year (and I only use one pump per use). nan
