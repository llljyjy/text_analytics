Initially, I was wondering does this really work to calm your skin, with a side eye, and surprisingly it worked well. It absorbed into my skin making my face smooth, calm and feeling fresh. I was using another brand that had my face angry with breakouts and itching, which I happily replaced with the Ren Evercalm and it got my face back right to being calm, no breakouts, smooth and back to my healthier looking skin. Perfect calming cream
