This toner is a different consistency than the typical toners I’ve tried before. It is more of a gel consistency, which I actually really love. I think it makes the application process so much easier, although it may require you to use more product at a time. My skin is on the oily side and I do feel like it has helped reduce the texture on my face so far. After using this product, my face feels clean and refreshed. I can’t wait to continue to use this product! I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It's great!
