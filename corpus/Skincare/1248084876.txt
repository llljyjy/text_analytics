I love this night cream. No major scent, which I appreciate. Feels luxe going on, hydrates and soothes through the night, and definitely makes a difference, especially applying it down my neck and décolletage.  It’s a keeper for sure. I have pale combination skin with some redness, and this generally just helps everything but mainly hydration and fine lines/crepey skin. Love it
