I absolutely love this serum! I have been using it day and night for just over two weeks. I might be slightly addicted to its amazing scent, which is not overpowering, but nice and subtle. The Double Serum is so silky! I love how you can decide how much to dispense, however, even at the lowest setting, I found it was too much and I had excess after using it on my face, neck and decolletage. The two serums are dispensed evenly and mix well together. The serum absorbed well into my skin. Even though I have oily, sensitive and acne-prone skin, I found that my skin wasn’t oily afterward and it didn’t cause any breakouts or concerns. My skin looks youthful, radiant and my fine lines aren’t as noticeable. I absolutely love Clarins and their Double Serum! My favourite!
