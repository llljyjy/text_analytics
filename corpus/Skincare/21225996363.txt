I literally couldn’t wait till she dropped this product; i was hooked instantly when it was first promoted and it honestly didn’t disappoint. I love love love this face mask. It is so hydrating but so cleansing at the same time. The salicylic acid on top of that is a complete chefs kiss! My skin has never been so clear and radiant since I’ve gotten this mask. I also recommend (if you have dark marks like me) trying this in the daytime 2x a week and adding Farmacy’s 10% Niacinamide Night Mask to your nighttime routine to completely change the game. Love it! Love this!
