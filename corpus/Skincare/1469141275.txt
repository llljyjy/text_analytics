My first impression of the cream was that it was super thick and rich so I was initially concerned that it would be too heavy. After I applied it and it had time to soak into my skin, it made my skin feel hydrated and well moisturized. Allowing it to soak into your skin before I apply make up helps a lot. This product is great if you need extra moisture in your skin which I live in a desert so I definitely require that. My skin has less dry spots and feels super hydrated and supple! I would recommend this to my friends that live in dry places as well as anybody who feels like they have dry skin. Great moisturizer!
