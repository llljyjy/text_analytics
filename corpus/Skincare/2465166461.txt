I was quite surprised to see notice results the morning after my first application. I have small  bumps/texture on my cheeks due to rosacea and the only thing that truly has helped are oral antibiotics but this product has made some noticeable difference. Since I have sensitive skin I am slowly incorporating this product into my routine (once a week so far) and I havenâ€™t had a adverse reaction. Excited to see long term results with this product. I have been using this product along with the serum from this line. Noticable results after first use
