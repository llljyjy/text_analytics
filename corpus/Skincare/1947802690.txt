First, superficially speaking, I adore the glass bottle and light green soap... and it keeps its nice look after months of use, as you can see from my picture.I’ve used this once a day at night time to  remove make-up, sunblock, or the two combined.  With make-up I first use LANCOME Bi-Facil to get my mascara, eyeliner and/or eyeshadow off.  Then two applications of this soap works beautifully to remove the rest.  Only a faint make-up residue from my hairline areas is leftover on my white face towels.In the mornings I find I don’t need to wash my face usually; slept in my face creams and ready to add to.I do get adult acne extremely easily.. “macne“ and you name it.. as well as flakey in some patches.  This leaves my face clean and soft.. and hydrated.  No acne side-effects.And has light green tea lovely scent.Can you tell I’m a fan?!!  I like it :D Nice for Sensitive Skin
