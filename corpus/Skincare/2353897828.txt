*I paid for this product* It is so oily! I appled 1 teaspoon~ the recommended amount to get adequate protection, my face was an oily wet mess! I told myself, maybe give it 15 more minutes  everything will be okay. Nothing changes. 8 hours later~ still an oily hot mess. Love Shiseido ~ but I will not repurchase this. Oilyyyyy
