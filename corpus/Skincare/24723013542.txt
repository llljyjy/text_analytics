The Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer is an amazing product. I used it as instructed. I massaged it all over my face and neck everyday. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling afterwards. I’ve noticed my face is smooth and looks very moisturized. The smell is not strong at all. My Review
