I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my review. This product has a faint but very pleasant chamomile smell. It is a nice consistency and it feels nice to put on. My skin feels moisturized after application. I have sensitive skin and the formulation doesnâ€™t bother me. I like the product but am unsure if I would purchase it due to the price. nan
