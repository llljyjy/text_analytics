My skin doesn’t do well with the overly praised “safe for everyone, even sensitive skin” hyaluronic acid or niacinamide. Meaning, I cannot use 90% of products on the market.But I desperately need hydration….. So, as a Hail Mary I tried The Ordinary B5 + Amino Acids; and I was pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness at such an affordable price. Extra points for glass packaging.I use this 1-2x daily as a 1st step on damp skin, layered under my tallow moisturizer. My skins’ hydration has improved, with no redness, itching, stinging or flare ups of my perioral dermatitis/seborrhoeic dermatitis-prone skin. I really enjoy this product and have been using it consistently for 5 months. A cheap option for sensitive, dehydrated skin!
