I purchased this after it was recommended by a Sephora employee. I have oily skin and needed a moisturizer that would wear well under makeup. At first, I hated it because it did absolutely nothing for me but I decided to give it a bit more time because I was tired of going to Sephora and returning/re-purchasing moisturizers (please bring back samples!!!). After a couple of weeks of use, I do believe it works to control oil production (I do find I have to use more product than I normally would for it to work). I’m not completely in love with it but it will do for now. I’m reluctant to re-purchase purely on price and how much I have to use. I’ll see how long the bottle lasts before I make my final decision however, I would recommend this to anyone with oily skin (current foundations I wear on top of this: Estee Lauder Double Wear and Essence Pretty Natural Hydrating Foundation) nan
