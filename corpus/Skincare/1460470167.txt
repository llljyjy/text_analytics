I really love this moisturizer and was so happy I finally found a product that I like as much as DE’s Lala Retro at a more affordable price point for me. But I wasted so much product in the process of trying to get the refill to work with the pump in the original container that it ended up just costing me more money now that I have to buy another one again soon. There’s a video that the company made with instructions on how to use the refill, I wish I would have seen that first. I also noticed some of the reviews here explain it as well. I wish I knew that you have to remove the “piston”! Regardless, I still will be buying and using this going forward, but a better experience with the refill packaging would have made this a 5 star review. Use the Skinfix video for refill instructions!
