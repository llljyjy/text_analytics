This is a very moisturizing under-eye cream! I was pleasantly surprised by the thickness of this cream and how easily it spreads over my eye area. It doesnâ€™t settle into fine lines or leave a film that you can feel later as it dries. It is not noticeable under other moisturizers or makeup. I have noticed a slight reduction in the fine lines, mainly around my smile lines, after using this morning and evening for approximately 3 weeks. Thick and Smooth Cream Formula
