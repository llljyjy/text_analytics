I’m not sure if it’s the Centella Asiatica but my skin looks great by the end of the day when I wash this off. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this doesn’t bother my skin- despite the fragrance. I usually don’t like fragrance in my SPF/skincare but this product’s fragrance is quite nice and enjoyable. No white cast and wears well under makeup. Knocked off one star because this isn’t water/sweat resistant- it’s the only drawback. Blind-bought and didn’t regret
