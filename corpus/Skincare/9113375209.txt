It is WORTH it. Just know you might purge, and it comes with fury…but if you remain consistent and weather the storm (took me about 5 weeks) it will leave your skin so balanced, decongested, and clear. I apply this at night and the avocado soothe serum in the morning to combat any redness or irritation I might get and it’s been a holy grail paired with the watermelon toner. The Purge is worth it.
