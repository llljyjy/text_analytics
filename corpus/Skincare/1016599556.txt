Not sure if it’s a coincidence or not, but my acne has really cleared up since I started using this product. I use Proactiv products and usually when I introduce a new makeup item my skin totally revolts. For some reason, it cleared up when I started using D-Bronzi. I like the little glow it gives me when I mix it with my Proactiv moisturizer each morning. For no makeup days I wear it alone, but a quick dusting of Bare Minerals illuminating veil keeps me shine-free. For a longer-lasting and smoother look, I use a colored Bare Minerals powder. It’s more $$ than I would like to spend, but I’ve been using it for almost 3 months and it still feels like there’s a good amount left. $10/month for better skin doesn’t seem too bad! Cleared my acne!!
