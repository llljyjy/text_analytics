One of the few moisturizers I will repurchase. It is very lightweight, pairs well under my other skincare and makeup, and feels very cooling on my face. It does have a light scent, I would describe it as fresh. Iâ€™ve used this moisturizer for both winter and summer and it works well at keeping my skin hydrated. Amazing Moisturizer
