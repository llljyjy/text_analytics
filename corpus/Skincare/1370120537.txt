I get very dry/chapped/cracked skin as soon as it starts to get cold out. This has been a great substitute for my regular moisturizer in the winter as it seems more hydrating. I use it after my typical serums. I do not use foundation, so I canâ€™t say how it looks with makeup on top. I probably could not use this in the summer as it would be too heavy for me. Overall I think it is a great product. Super hydrating
