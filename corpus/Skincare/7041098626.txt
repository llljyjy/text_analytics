The best serum I’ve ever tried, hands down. The bottle alone is beautiful and the serum has a lovely honey scent. After using it for a month, I’ve noticed a dramatic improvement to the texture and elasticity of my skin. It’s smoother yet firmer, and I don’t have a singe blemish. My pores also look more refined. The price is steep but I will definitely be repurchasing! A little goes a long way and I believe the bottle will last me about 6 months. Best Serum I’ve Ever Tried
