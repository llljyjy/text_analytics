I’m so disappointed. I’ve used this product for more than 3 years and have had the best looking skin.I have normal to oily skin. I bought a replacement, without knowing the formula changed. Cystic pimples overnight! I’m so annoyed. Why change something that wasn’t broken?? Formula changed, buyer beware!
