I got this as a sample in my last order and WOW. Immediately running to buy the full size. I had 3 huge hormonal pimples, I used this, and overnight they were 99% gone. It has a slight grainy texture when applying but it’s not abrasive. I noticed a slight tingling but I don’t use many acidic products so take that with a grain of salt. I have combo skin with an oily t zone, dry cheeks/mouth area, and minimal breakouts. You need this
