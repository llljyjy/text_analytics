Fantastic eye cream. It’s very moisurizing, so I originally bought it to use at night. However, I have never found an eye cream that so effectively plumps up my under eyes with hydration, that I also began using in the morning. It is one of the most expensive products I’ve ever purchased, but given I was using it twice a day for about 6-7 months (meaning I got about 400 uses out of it, so $.32 cents per day), and nothing else has given me that affect, I have to recommend it and am considering repurchasing. A really good staple. Very hydrating.
