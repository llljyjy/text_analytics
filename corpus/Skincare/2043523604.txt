I didnâ€™t know what to expect but this is a beautifulProduct. I thought it would be oily and not soak into my skin but it does. The scent is lovely, but not overpowering and feels luxurious on my skin. I noticed that the lines on my forehead are definitely reduced after 3 weeks of use. I have dry skin, and it leaves my skin supple and hydrated without greasiness. It does leave the skin a slight but tacky but mot too much. I feel my skin does look more youthful and radiant. nan
