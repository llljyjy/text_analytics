This product is the best I have ever tried. I live in Canada and our winter has been crazy cold. I spend a lot of time outside and my skin gets super dry. I have spots on my face when my skin peels of as I have already frozen my skin in those spots. The Jet Lag Mask delivers enough moisture to help those dry skin but doesn’t break my skin out at all. I’ve been using it since October now. If anything, I have seen an improvement in my pores and have had no breakouts. Definitely going to try the eye cream when it’s back in stock. winter life saver
