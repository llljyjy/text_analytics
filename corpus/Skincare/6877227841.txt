This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive, red skin. It calms down my skin and reduces redness after the first use. It hydrates well but not enough for my super dry skin so I use it on top of a hydrating serum or add a few drops of YTTP oil. I will continue buying it in the future. Relieves redness after first use
