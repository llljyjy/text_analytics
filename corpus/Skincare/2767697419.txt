Let me say up front that I have not tried this on my face! However, I used about half a free sample sachet of it on a very pink, hot-to-touch sunburn on my shoulder as an overnight Hail Mary treatment on a whim. The sunburn that hurt even without moving and radiated heat is like 80% completely gone this AM. There’s just a small pink patch that’s a little warm. The burn had stretched from the top of my shoulder near my bra strap down to my elbow and the full width of my exposed bicep. It’s basically gone now. I am flabbergasted. I put it on last night thinking it would just be a waste, but I have never had such soothing results from any product for after sun care or for general skin care. It’s obviously pricey for after sun, but I can only imagine the wonders it will work on my face now. Surprise Hit for Sunburn Care
