I noticed that my chronically dry, eczema-prone skin was causing milia to form under my eyes, so I picked up a chemical exfoliant and bought this eye cream to keep the area soft. It works really well! I definitely notice a difference on days when I donâ€™t use it. I like using it in the morning and at night. Great for dry, sensitive undereyes
