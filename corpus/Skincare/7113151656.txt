This is my new favorite eye cream! I’ve tried just about everything that says it will depuff and brighten and this is by far my favorite. The consistency is so smooth—thick and moisturizing without being greasy. I’ve noticed my concealer staying smoother much longer without settling into my fine lines around my eyes. I get really awful under eye bags, especially if I have wine the night before or don’t get enough sleep and this eye cream really brightens and depuffs great. The color is rose gold with a bit of shimmer which I was a little worried about because I have a very fair complexion but it blends right in and reflects the light great. I’ll definitely be repurchasing. nan
