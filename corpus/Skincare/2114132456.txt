a shower-less shave was a foreign concept to me but I’m kind of into it. The shave pillow smells very pleasant (herbal/aromatic) and is super easy to apply to the skin. Without water it’s balmy and makes for a clean, smooth shave. I do find that it gets stuck in the razor, which needs to be rinsed while shaving. Otherwise, it’s a game changer for me! nan
