This product smells AMAZING. The jar is glass and the lid is meta, giving the product a very attractive appearance. It has a smooth creamy texture and application is super simple... but. I did a test spot for this product because I have extremely sensitive skin and with in 5 minutes of applying the test spot I was super itchy. I didn’t put the product on like intended because of this. If you don’t have sensitive skin, this product will probably be amazing for you nan
