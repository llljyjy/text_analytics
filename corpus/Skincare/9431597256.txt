This eye clean is fantastic! I love the banana pigment which adds that settle yellowish/tan color to the cream. Not only is the eye cream hydrating, but it is also reducing dark circles around your eyes over time. If you are going for a minimal make-up look, you can wear this instead of concealer during the day and no one would ever know. I absolutely love this product for a summer daytime look!I received this for free for my honest review from Influenster & Ole Hendriksen. Total fan!
