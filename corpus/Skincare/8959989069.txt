Awful - broke me out like crazy. I thought that it was something I was eating or stress, but as soon as I ran out of this product my skin cleared up almost immediately! I generally have dry skin and this is a light moisturizer, so I didnt think it would be a problem but it really really was. Breakouts, Acne, Pizza Face!
