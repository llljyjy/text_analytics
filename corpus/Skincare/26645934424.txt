I just finished using the mini size after getting it as a free sample and WOW! This balm removes make up (even waterproof mascara!) so well, a lot better than any wipe or micro cellular water. A little goes a long way too. You do have to rub on the eyes a little bit more to get stubborn mascara or eyeliner off, but then itâ€™s all gone! Love using this to really get make up off before cleansing my skin! Buy it, definitely worth the money!
