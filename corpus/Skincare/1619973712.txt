I’ve been using this product every other morning for a little over a month now. It is a very pleasant serum that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth after use. I have oily acne-prone skin and this serum is lightweight and doesn’t clog my pores. I look forward to using it when I wake up. My rating is a 3.5 because I haven’t noticed any real difference in my skin since using it. There hasn’t been a change in the look or feel of my skin. It’s not so hydrating that I can skip my moisturizer, so it’s not replacing any products in my routine. I don’t have many visible wrinkles, so maybe this produces better results on someone who does. I was sent a trial of this product for free for testing purposes. nan
