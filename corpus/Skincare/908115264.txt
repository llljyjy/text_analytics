This is a huge disappointment! I was super excited to get this, so when I opened it and put it on, I was dismayed. The tube doesn’t have an end that it can stand on, so I have to put the lid on right away after dispensing it. In the meantime, the very fluid product ran down my wrist. When I transferred it to my face, I was once again surprised to find that it doesn’t spread at all. It’s like all the liquid absorbs so fast that once you rub it a tiny bit it disappears. I had to open it and squeeze some out twice to cover my face. That said, this would be amazing in a pump! I like the way it blended into my skin. It smells like mineral sunscreen, which doesn’t bother me, aside from that I didn’t notice a fragrance which is my preference. Ugh. Tatcha! Just change the package! It’s a good product.
