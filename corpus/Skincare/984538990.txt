I have worn this snowboarding in deep powder, and on sunny days, and mountain biking at high altitude with no cloud cover, and it’s the only sunscreen that rubs in, doesn’t ball up, doesn’t feel tacky, and doesn’t come off with sweat or water, all day. It truly has to be removed with soap/cleanser. I’ve introduced friends who are outside all the time to it, and they love it, but they don’t always love the price tag for daily mountain use, haha. I’ll buy drugstore sunscreen for my body, but my face gets a little better treatment. Best facial sunscreen for sports
