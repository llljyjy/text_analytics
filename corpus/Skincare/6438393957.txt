I mostly wanted to just post a picture of the color of the new Cherry Blossom mask.  If you own any of the other ones, the consistency and effect are exactly the same.  However, after having used it twice now, I find myself being bothered a bit by the strong flavor of this one.  If you’ve ever owned the blue Ralph Lauren perfume, it tastes exactly like that perfume smells, if that makes any sense.  Normally, I’m not opposed to scented or flavored products but it feels like something you are putting on your lips shouldn’t have such a strong perfume flavor though.  Weirdly enough, the scent itself isn’t very strong...  I love all the other “flavors“ of this product (Gingerbread was my favorite, why, why why did they discontinue it?) but this will be my least favorite, to be honest.  If you are looking for a sweet type of scent or something with a hint of vanilla - this isn’t it.  This is more like something synthetically fruity and very lingering on your lips, to the point where you are constantly tasting and inhaling it. Good but will not be my favorite from this line...
