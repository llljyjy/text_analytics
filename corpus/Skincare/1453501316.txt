This product has ruined a ton of my clothes, marble countertops, etc. If it gets on ANYTHING, it legit spreads like wildfire. I threw it out 6 months ago and I am still haunted by it. I just did a load of laundry and threw a bag in there with it that apparently had stains and all of my whites are now yellow. I would not risk it. Stains EVERYTHING
