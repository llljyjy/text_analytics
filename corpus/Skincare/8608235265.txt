Purchased this because it had so many good reviews I’ve been using it for a while and it’s the worst I feel and see no difference I’ve tried different eye creams from Sephora and Nordstrom that feel nicer super bummed I wasted $70 on something so small that has made no difference too many good reviews to be true
