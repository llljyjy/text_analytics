It’s still too soon to speak on results, but so far I DO like this product. It felt rich and luxurious when applied. Due to the thick consistency, a little goes a long way! My skin can get oily, and my skin felt greasy and heavy after I applied it, but I believe I just used too much! The scent is probably my favorite aspect, it reminds me of lemon dessert cookies!! I was so happy that it smelled like more of a bakery citrus, because that’s the type I lean toward. I like that its a moisturizer, brightener, and serum all in one. The vast array of ingredients and benefits is great for someone who doesn’t like using a ton of different products. Mmmmm rich & lemon cookie-esque
