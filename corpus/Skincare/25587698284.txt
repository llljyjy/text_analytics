I love this stuff! I have combination type skin and my main goals were hopefully removing blackheads/impurities and brightening up my dull skin. Originally I didn’t understand the hype about this product since it does leave a bit of an oily residue on the face after use which I wasn’t really a fan of but it soaks into the skin eventually. I also didn’t really see many changes but I kept using it and it did make me purge at first which makes sense because it was bringing out all the gunk from the inside! I broke out for about a week due to the purge but my skin is now at the best it’s ever looked! My skin feels so clear and soft, and genuinely looks brighter! I don’t get as many whiteheads and clogged pores which I usually get around my nose and forehead. I find it works best with a cotton pad as it helps gently exfoliate my skin better. Love this stuff! Don’t be alarmed if your skin breaks out that’s NORMAL it means it’s working! Was skeptical but works so well!
