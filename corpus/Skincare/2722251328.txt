Hmm. I used this for a few months and didn’t see much improvement. I also felt it was a bit heavy. After some more research on my skin type and my needs (I have VERY dehydrated and sensitive skin that is prone to “breakouts“ from being so without moisture) - I realized I may have just been layering products on top of skin that actually needed gentle exfoliation. The thing is...I was too scared to exfoliate because I didn’t want to irritate my skin further. I added in an enzymatic cleanser (Glow cleanser balm - lactic acid) thanks to the advice from a professional, and I think this product would work now. It just was not penetrating the skin! So keep that in mind when using this product, or other products. Good, but should have used it differently.
