very underwhelmed and disappointed. i am very acclimated with the tan-luxe drops for both body and face. i should have stuck w those bc even mixing those w my own lotion gave me a much more even and authentic looking tan. this lotion formulation is super gooey/runny and is incredible splotchy. not my first rodeo with self-tanners and i know how to put them on. save your money and skip this one for sure the worst!
