Iâ€™ve tried a lot of different eye creams in the past year but this one is by far my favorite.  The creamy texture, bare minimum scent, and the fact that it does really work to keep my under eye area super hydrated make it a definite HG product for me now. It works great even under makeup.It only took me 5 days to start seeing visible results using this cream twice a day. I highly recommend it for all ages and skin types. One of the best eye creams available.
