I like that this is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. Leaves my neck hydrated and moisturized. I’m not sure if it has helped to firm, will need more time with the product. And the same is true for brightening. The scent is nice, however, I do prefer my skincare to be unscented as I’m sensitive prone. And to that point, I may be experiencing some slight irritation to this. I do need some additional time with the product, and eliminating some other things to know for certain. My fave thing is the packaging. nan
