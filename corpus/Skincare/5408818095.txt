This is such a cool product. I can see this being excellent to bring along when traveling! I used this without water first to test out a waterless shave, and it worked really well! I wasn’t plagued with razor burn or irritation, the shave was smooth and easy. My skin felt really soft too! I tried it again with water and it was super convenient to just glide it on my skin and get to it. I definitely recommend this, it’s easy to use, and helps to conserve water which is an awesome way to do your part for the betterment of our planet. I love it. I love this
