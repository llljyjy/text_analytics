I received this complimentary from Influenster and Clinique for my honest review. Clinique never disappoints. They make quality products at affordable prices. I really like this cream.  It really does work beautifully. It has a thicker consistency which I like,no fragrance, absorbs effortlessly and doesnâ€™t leave a oily film behind. My skin felt moisturized, supple and youthful. Overall I loved it and will be replenishing it. Love this formula
