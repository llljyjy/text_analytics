I have been using this for the past 2 years.  I’m 54 with sensitive combo/oily skin and this has not broken me out, has not pilled, has not irritated my skin and keeps it hydrated.  I have a morning regime which consists of several serums.  I let all my skincare set and absorb as I layer and this actually replaces any moisturizer and use it as my final step before moving on to primer and makeup.  I have 3 backups because I can’t be without it because I have never used spf until this product came into my life. THE BEST SUNSCREEN/MOISTURIZER EVER!!!!!!
