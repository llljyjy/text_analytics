I got Fenty Skin Cherry Treat conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil free from BzzAgent I gave this one to my 23 year old sister to try, here’s her thoughts. It has the same applicator as Dior lip oil, however can tell a slight difference in the quality of the product. The benefits of owning this Fenty brand lip oil is that it doesn’t dry down, and it conditions your lips, leaving behind a beautiful slight pink tint. You can use this to top lip liner or lipstick for glossy look. My sister owns many different Fenty products, she was very happy to add this one to her collection. So it’s safe to say she definitely would recommend, and as her brother what makes sister happy makes me happy. Fenty cherry treat lip oil
