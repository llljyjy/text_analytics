I received this product as a sample. However, I am highly considering repurchasing this when I finish! A little goes away with this product. Although it initially has a thick consistency, it quickly melts into the skin keeping everything nice and moisturized overnight! I can tell that my skin is much more hydrated after incorporating this into my evening routine and definitely plan to continue using this through the winter months. nan
