There is a smell with the product I believe it may be coconut. Prior to this product I didn’t really have a face regimen but I wanted to start one. I have used this product for a full week now. My face is full of tiny bumps all over. I can’t remember the last time I had any sort of breakout. I was told this was for sensitive skin but I don’t think that is the case. I heard such great things about this line but it doesn’t appear to be for me. I wish I could return but my husband threw away my boxes. I don’t really like how the cleanser and toner feel but I do love how the moisturizer feels. *I will post the same review on the cleanser, toner, and moisturizer because I’m not sure which product my skin is reacting to and I am using all three regularly. A lot of hype but not for me
