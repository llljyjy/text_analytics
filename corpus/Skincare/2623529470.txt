I’ve been using this product for over a month now and I’ve noticed a difference with how moisturized my skin is when I wake up in the morning. It’s a balm that turns to an oil consistency when it melts on your skin. Throughout the night it will absorb into your skin and you will wake up with hydrated, glowing skin. It is fairly oily so a little bit of product goes a long way. I feel like the price is great considering you don’t need to use much.. this jar will last a long time! I would definitely repurchase nan
