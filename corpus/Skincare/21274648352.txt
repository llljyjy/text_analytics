I have enjoyed using this serum and have made it a part of my skincare routine. When I get out of the shower, I apply it first then follow up with moisturizer. It smells nice but doesn’t linger. Goes on smoothly. Dries fast. Doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or sticky or anything like that. I can’t really tell a difference as far as aging goes, but I do think it helps with firming and radiance. Also, I love the luxury of the glass bottle it’s packed in. It is apparently refillable. I haven’t don’t that yet, but I like the concept of being able to. nan
