Honestly, I’m not a big fun of eye creams, because they are usually too heavy and greasy for my skin, but I really LOVE this one. It has rich texture, but you need just a little amount of it so you won’t even feel it on your skin after applying. This cream makes my eyes feel refreshed and lighten my dark circles under eyes also. Will recommend it. LOVE this eye cream
