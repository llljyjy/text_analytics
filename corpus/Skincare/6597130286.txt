I love this product. It smells like a cucumber and spf is my first priority in morning routine. Love the consistency, it is not sticky and doesnâ€™t roll when I apply my foundation on the top. At the winter time in MI definitely not enough moisture for dry skin but for spring it is just perfect Love
