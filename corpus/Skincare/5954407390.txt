I received this item complimentary in an influenster Vox Box. I enjoy using this during the day and the cream version at night. Both have a very similar feeling but the aqua bomb is lighter. There is a slight fragrance, but it is not overpowering. I love using it to prep my face before makeup because it does not pill up or cause patchiness when makeup is put on top. My skin looks smooth and dewy after using this! This and the moisturizing bomb is the BOMB
