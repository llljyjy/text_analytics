Great stuff! I’ve been looking for a simple hydrating toner for my routine. I’ve tried different brands such as Dr. Jart and Belif, but I found that their toners were not hydrating enough for the dry wintertime.I got this as a sample with my reward points and I loved it immediately! After washing my face, I applied one layer of it to my face. It sank in quickly, and left my face feeling soft and moisturized. Perfect for following it up with a serum or if you layer it, I think it’ll be fine to seal it with a moisturizer!I liked it so much that I got a full sized bottle of it. I recommend it to those with normal to dry skin or dehydrated skin! nan
