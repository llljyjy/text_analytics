I love the consistency, it feels quite stiff in jar but once applied it literally melts into the skin like velvet.  I love that you can purchase a refillable tub so less waist. It does an okay job in moisturizing.  I have extremely dry skin at the moment but I feel this would be better for my skin type during the summer months where I dont  need as much moisturizing. nan
