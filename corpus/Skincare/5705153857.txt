I am in love with this cream! I have been using it for the past three weeks, and I love the way my skin looks. I typically have a lot of surface redness, and it is gone. I mean, no redness—I’ve never had that happen. My fine lines are less noticeable, because this cream hydrates so well. I have oily but dehydrated skin, and this cream sinks right in, with no tackiness, and never makes my skin overly oily throughout the day. It doesn’t pill under makeup, and my skin feels and looks the best it has in a long while! Minimizes fine lines
