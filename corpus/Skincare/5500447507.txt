ooooh yes. Love love love. I have fairly sensitive skin and this scrub is the perfect amount of gritty without feeling like I stripped my skin entirely. Super happy with it! My skin is glowing and even though I still get a little bit red after use, it dissipates quickly and Iâ€™m left with very fresh looking skin. I was using WIshfuls pineapple enzyme scrub and this works significantly better in less time. nan
