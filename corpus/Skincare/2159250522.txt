I received a complimentary sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair eye cream through Influenster, and gave it a spin. I don’t have many eye wrinkles outside of smile lines, so I can’t say that I have seen improvement there with use. I haven’t been using the product long, so over time I’m sure there will be a noticeable difference. Clinique is a brand I have used and trusted for years! This product is very moisturizing and lasts all day. I slap it on before my moisturizer and go. I’d definitely buy it in the future to keep my skin looking hydrated and as youthful as possible. Moisturizing!
