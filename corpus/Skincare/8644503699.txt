I use the lotion moisturizer as my daytime moisturizer and it has lasted me an entire year. I decided to purchase the cream moisturizer for the winter months and unfortunately received it almost halfway empty. The formulation of this product is 10/10 and great for soothing my dry/sensitive winter skin, but not worth it if Iâ€™m only getting half of what I paid for. Missing product
