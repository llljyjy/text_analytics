First off let me start by saying I generally prefer IT Cosmetics. The Confidence in a Cream left me wanting more. My disappointment starts with the box and label. If this is “anti-aging armour“ I’d expect the packaging be geared towards the aging. As in, not such a small font I can’t see it. As much work as I spent trying to read the box and the container, I was even more disappointed when once I read it I STILL wasn’t able to discern WHAT the product was supposed to actually accomplish!The application, smooth amd easy!The feel, light and non-greasy!The amount in the container- wow! Did it actually DO anything? I couldn’t tell. I took photos, before, during, after almost 3 weeks. No change. It’s a great basic moisturizer.  I didn’t break out. I didn’t dry up. I’ll keep hunting for the right product for me. Just OK
