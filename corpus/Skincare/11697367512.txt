Its a good thing I got the sample kit to try out becuase this brand it expensive and it did not work for me. I was expecting more luxury feeling products but honestly I was underwhelmed. Also the serum that everyone raves about broke me out. The cream is supposed to be thick and luxurious but honestly it is more light weight then I was expecting. Overall not great Not for me
