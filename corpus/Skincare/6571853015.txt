I have dry/combo skin.  Purchased this on a whim and plan to always have this on hand. My skin is glowing for at least three days after i use this. Obsessed. The scent is not too overwhelming but is a bit fake. The texture is definitely like conditioner which is weird. But Iâ€™ve stopped using my daily vitamin c serum because using this 1-2 times a week before bed does the job for me now Glowing skin!
