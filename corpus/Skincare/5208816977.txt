Beautiful bottle, great cleanser. But am I the only one that had issues with brown stuff accumulated inside the pump? The goo itself doesn’t touch the actual cleanser and hasn’t affected the quality but it’s so bizarre and I can’t figure out what caused it! I keep removing the brown stuff but it keeps reappearing becaude there is more on the inside of the pump that I can’t get to. Pump leaves brown goo
