I tried this product a couple different times to see if I got the same results. I love that this sunscreen doesn’t have that “sunscreen” smell. It did make my skin really shinny when wearing it. It wasn’t heavy, but it did have a slight filmy feel to it. I wouldn’t wear it on my face because of that. I wear sunscreen almost daily, and I would 9/10 wear this (not on my face) for my daily sunscreen. A pretty decent sunscreen!
