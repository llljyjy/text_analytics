This is the only skin product I can wear. My skin is sensitive, dry and very flakey, and I have acne and redness. This product colour corrects and evens out my skin tone without amplifying my flakes or drying out my skin. The formula makes it seem as though I have nothing at all on - even if I go up close to a mirror it’s hard to notice the texture difference. I tried the tower 28 tint but it dried my skin out way too much in comparison to this. Unfortunately I can’t use this product because the colour is too dark and much too yellow on my skin, but if you’re light to medium this colour should work for you. I do not think it would do well for darker skin tones either unfortunately. nan
