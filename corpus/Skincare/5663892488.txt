Please don’t take my review as medical advise. Always consult your doctor.I am someone who suffers from mild to moderate eczema on my face. I purchased this product simply to see if it would work with my sick. Amazingly enough, my sick feels hydrated, and firm. As I had mentioned I suffered from eczema, and I haven’t had a flare up in months. Its not as red and flacky. If it can give more stars I would. AMAZING PRODUCT!
