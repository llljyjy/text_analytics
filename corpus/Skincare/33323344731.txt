This product was given to me for free by Sephora and I was so excited to try! I love affordable products that are clean and vegan. My pores are a spot i’m trying to work on so I’m hoping this works. I wasn’t able to see an immediate difference so I’m hoping that over time I’ll see some change in my skin! It applied very nicely. Unfortunately my box was squished and opened when I took it out of the mailing packaging. nan
