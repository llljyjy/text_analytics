I received this product in my voxbox from Influenster and was excited to try it as a part of a new product launch! Obv I am not expecting miracles after a few days of use, but I haven’t noticed any difference! I will continue to use the entire sample and update if I see any improvement.  Although creamy to the touch, it does feel a bit heavy under the eyes...I’m still hopeful as it is less expensive than my usual eye cream! Not totally sold on this eye cream!
