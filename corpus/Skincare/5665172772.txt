As a combo/dry skin girl I’m in love with this product! This oil has a light to medium texture but doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It doesn’t have a overwhelming scent that irritates my eyes which is a main concern of mine when it comes to SPFs. My skin feels nice a hydrated with a nice subtle glow without looking greasy. Highly recommend for combo/dry skin types. It is pricey but you won’t come across a products like this from any other spf brand. Kudos to supergoop for this amazing and innovative spf formula! It will be my go to for a while! A must try!
