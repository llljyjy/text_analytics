I like this new product from Supergoop! I used to buy the Unseen Sunscreen religiously for several years, but I became unhappy with the odd consistency/balmy feeling of it going on. While this new product is much more of a “traditional” feeling sunscreen, it does not leave a white cast, and goes well under makeup, and does not seem to cause breakouts for my acne-prone skin. Downsides it does pill if you don’t give it adequate time to sink in and I’m taking one star off because it definitely leaves your skin a little shiny/greasy. I have not yet tried this product for an outdoor workout to see if it sweats off and runs into your eyes, but I imagine it does. Overall will purchase again, but does seem pricey for such a small bottle. nan
