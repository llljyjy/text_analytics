I got this product from BzzAgent, and I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite lip products. I use to use the Burts Bees lip oil, but that would dry out my lips. Because of the heat, my lips got really dry and cracked, but after one use of this product, I can see that thereâ€™s already a big difference in the softness of my lips and my lips are more hydrated. The product also smells really good. I think I will purchase this after my tube runs out. nan
