I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.I’ve been using this product for the last year or so and have previously purchased it on my own. My friends consistently recommended this to me and I always held back due to the price point but it’s absolutely worth it! It is such a gentle exfoliator with little to no scent and it’s effective. My skin feels so smooth after use and I especially use it for my nose when it begins to feel rough. I use this about 2-3x and it has transformed the texture of my skin! Must have!
