Although I do not have severely acne prone skin, the blemishes left make it appear otherwise so this was a savior! It is super frustrating after a pimple disappears because then the scar remains and it takes a lot of work for it to disappear - this serum helped so much! not only is it amazing on blemishes, it is super hydrating- I usually use it all over my face and then target the areas where the blemishes are. I have never met a Kiehls product I didn’t like and this is no exception, fairly priced as always and totally delivers. Don’t overthink it and just add to your cart, you won’t regret it Bye Bye Acne Scars
