Overall, this is a good product. I have very sensitive under eyes (literally the only sensitive skin I have) so I’m always a bit wary with new eye creams. But I’ve had zero irritation with this product! My under eye area is normally super dry but I’ve noticed things getting a bit smoother and less dry using this product. There’s no real scent to the product either - normally I like scented products but not ones directly around the eyes. The packaging is really pretty but I feel like they should’ve included a scooper. I like the product and will definitely finish the bottle but I’m not sure if I would purchase again due to the price. The product works but I can get results at a cheaper price point elsewhere. nan
