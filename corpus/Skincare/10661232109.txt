I received this product free in exchange for sharing my honest opinion. I had a baby two months ago and have been finding that between being dehydrated and not getting much sleep, my eyes look tired! This Eye Cream has been such a godsend! It’s a smooth Eye Cream that goes on easily and doesn’t contain perfumes or fragrances. I found that it was gentle, yet super effective. It helped my eye area look more hydrated and supple immediately after use, and over time, it help my eye area look firmer and brighter. This us an eye cream I would highly recommend to anyone from younger folks to more mature skin types, looking for an eye cream that leaves their eye area looking hydrated and younger. Great eye cream!
