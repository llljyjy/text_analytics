First off, I adore Gucci, and just got the Flora perfum from them. I have several of their lipsticks as well, so you can say I’m already a bit biased towards this amazing brand. The GUCCI Brume de Beauté Glow Hydrating Mist: I always pay attention to the packaging, and it did not disappoint. It felt heavy & grippy in my hands, and it didn’t feel flimsy. The glass packaging and the golden cap perfectly complemented each other. The gold trims on the cap is similar to their signature lipstick cap designs. The product itself looked like it had oily parts in it, but upon application it felt super light and absorbed really well into skin. The pump dispenced the product in a fine mist cloud that covers the face evenly. I just couldn’t get enough. The mist itself has a very light scent that I absolutely loved. I have very dry skin so try to get spray primers to prep my skin for the day & the products I’m putting on it, and the GUCCI Brume de Beauté Glow Hydrating Mist was the perfect fot for me. It not only prepped my skin for all the subsequent product, it also provided amazing hydration throughout the day. My skin literally is glowing! I got so many compliments, and my friends even asked what was different. I am absolutely in love with this product! Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves their skin & needs some pampering! Feels so luxurious on the skin!
