The sunscreen itself is good. Goes on smoothly but with all tatcha products you can’t smooth into skin to much otherwise it will pill. The packaging is awful. The covering flakes off and gets all over your hands and then ends up on my face. I finally took some nail polish remover and just took all of the labeling off so I would at least get rid of the glitter that would end up on my face. The formula is nice and smooth. Haven’t really tested to see how well it protects in the sun. ok
