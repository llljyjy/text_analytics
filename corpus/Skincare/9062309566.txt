Absolutely obsessed with this cream. I was using the Sunday Riley Vitamin C moisturizer and I was running though the product so quickly and it was leaving my skin feeling a bit oily so I decided to give this product a try. Best decision ever. My skin is sensitive and acne prone so I’m always cautious introducing new products into my regimen. Luckily this cream is a lighter consistency that doesn’t clog my pores or leave me oily and a little bit goes a long way. I use this during the day before I apply SPF and at night after my serums and there is a noticeable difference in my skin. If you want glowy moisturized looking skin without feeling oily you should definitely give this a try! Obsessed
