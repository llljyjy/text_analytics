I had breakouts that were starting to flatten and I’m not sure if I was allergic or it didn’t mix well with my spf in the morning and it was just too heavy for my skin to have the products layered, but if it didn’t make me break out, it had to have inflamed what was healing. I use it on stretchmarks I have on my legs so I can at least get use out of it. I wanted to love it because it’s such a good deal and I used their products before. Maybe be cautious if you have breakouts, but it could just be a me thing. Wish it worked for me though Wish it worked for me
