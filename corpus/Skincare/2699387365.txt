I really liked this cleaner. This is perfect if you have had a long day out and about running errands. Helps with taking off all the dirt and makeup. I have dry skin and this does not dry out my skin and instead softens it. I use this 2-3 times a week. I like the citrus scent itâ€™s not too overpowering. Not sure if this would work for anyone with sensitive skin. Loved this cleanser
