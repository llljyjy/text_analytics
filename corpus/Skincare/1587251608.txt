I have super sensitive skin so I’m always using mineral sunscreen. This sunscreen doesn’t leave a white cast and soaked into my skin really well, leaving me with a dewy satin finish that is the perfect base for makeup. It also doesn’t have a huge scent so that’s always a plus in my book! Great mineral sunscreen
