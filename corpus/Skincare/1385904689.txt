I received this in exchange for an honest review but truth to be told it’s my 3rd bottle. I’ve already purchased this twice on my own and love it! Doesn’t irritate my skin and it plays nice with other skincare and under makeup. It helps fade my hyperpigmentation a bit faster and overall gives a lasting healthy glow to my skin. Highly recommend. Good stuff
