I have combination skin and no acne issues for background. It has a subtle lavender smell. However, it didnâ€™t really moisturize my skin. It felt like it just sat on top of it and pilled up over the day. I use an eczema therepy drugstore ointment for my son, and it leaves my skin feeling exactly like moisturizer does. I was disappointed with Tatcha. I really wanted to like it. Disappointing.
