So first of all.. the packaging is gorgeous. Beautiful. The bottle itself also feels luxurious and expensive. The cute bee.. I am in love with as well. The product smells amazing!!! It dispenses evenly and adds a cute element I have not seen before. It goes on smooth, not sticky at all. I am very picky about products I use on my face. And this one absolutely did not disappoint. It feels great on my face. I have sensitive skin, and this did not make me break out or anything. I am absolutely loving this, and it quickly became a part of my skin routine. OMG
