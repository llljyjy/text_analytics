This unique anti-aging serum is worth the price. This 96% naturally derived ingredient formulation delivers on the renewing and repairing. Knowing that Guerlain is active in sustainable practices  and nature conservation, makes this product even more appealing.It helps with radiance, pores and lifting. Iâ€™ve received nothing but compliments once I replaced this with my usual anti-aging serum. Texture was dramatically softened and gives a beautiful glow. Also works very well with my face roller and my face looks more toned and than ever. The double serum cocktail is light weight but packs a major punch! Little to no fragrance and concentrated formula. Definitely recommend! Repairing and Renewing to the Max!
