Overall, I liked this cream. While I felt that it was very moisturizing, I did not notice much in the way of anti-aging properties, but it was a relatively small sample and I think more extended use would probably be needed than the amount in the jar I received. It agreed well with my skin and did not pill under makeup, and did keep my skin hydrated. nan
