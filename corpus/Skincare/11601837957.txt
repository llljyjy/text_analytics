This is the only cleansing balm I’ve ever used but I really like it. The only thing is it’s NOT meant to be used on its own and I don’t understand why the instructions or info don’t clarify that. Cleansing balms are generally meant to be used as a 1st step in a double cleansing routine. I personally use a Carave cleanser after this, but any water based cleanser will do the trick. Some people may dislike the smell but I got used to it pretty quick. It’s not a strong scent, it just smells like damp oats or damp cardboard kind of thing. I wear very very water proof mascara that even makeup removers that say they’re specifically for waterproof eye makeup don’t take off and this does easily. Great as a 1st step in double cleansing.
