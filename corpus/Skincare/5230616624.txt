i was gifted by dermalogica this circular hydration serum for my honest review. i am already IN LOVE with this hydration serum. i have very dry dehydrated and sensitive skin. i also recently had an allergic reaction to a skin care product and my skin could use some TLC. the serum feels beautiful going on the skin and makes your face look so glossy and feel hydrated to create the perfect base for makeup! i will definitely keep using it! everything you never knew you needed
