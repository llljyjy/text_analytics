I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First thing I noticed was this eye crème has no smell whatsoever! I actually enjoyed that as sometimes fragrances can blow my sinuses all up. The crème has a nice consistency. It isn’t thick, but not watery either. A little of this goes a long way! I’ve been using this crème nightly for almost 3 weeks now. The only noticeable difference I could tell is under my eyes are much more hydrated. Not a bad result for only 3 weeks of use. Good eye crème
