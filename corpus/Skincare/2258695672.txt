This product actually lives up to the majority of its claims. I use it after I cleanse my face and before moisturizer at night. My skin really does feel slightly softened after just a week using this. I haven’t necessarily noticed a glow yet but there’s still time for that to happen. While it’s a great product it isn’t a holy grail for me which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Surprised
