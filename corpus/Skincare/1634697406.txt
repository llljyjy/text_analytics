I tried this as a sample. I love it. I heard someone say it smells lemony and I didn’t find that. I think the smell is really nice without being overpowering. The cream itself is very rich and luxurious. A little goes a long way! Goes on smoothly without a greasy feel. Complete moisture enrichment! The only downfall is it doesn’t have sunscreen so I put sunscreen on top or use foundation with sunscreen. I have noticed smoother skinAlthough pricey this will last you a long time! nan
