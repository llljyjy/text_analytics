acne prone, oily and sensitive skin here. i’ve restocked this toner for many many times since discovering it in 2020 and it’s the only toner i used now. it’s not rocket science and won’t clear up your skin in a day or two, but might help with clogged pores and acne a lot over time (it did for me!). i love how it contains active ingredients yet still gentle on my sensitive skin and has never broken me out. definitely 5 stars! the rare toner that worked for my skin so far
