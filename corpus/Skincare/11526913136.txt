This is silky smooth and really does add moisture and firmness to aging skin!  I have combination & sensitive skin and this works amazing for me!  It does not clog pores and your skin feels soft in the morning. I tried a sample and was hooked.  The price was intimidating but the container lasted almost a year as a little goes a long way.
