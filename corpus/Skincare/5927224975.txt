I like to take care of my skin and enjoy finding and trying new clean skincare products that work for my sensitive and dry skin. So I was excited to receive the aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream from belief and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This face cream contains vitamin c, which is an active ingredient that’s know for brightening and reducing hyperpigmentation, redness and dark circles. This face cream had a citrusy smell and had a gel-cream like texture which dried to more of a gel. It’s lightweight which would be great for oily, combo and even normal skin. Unfortunately, it’s not something I would use for my dry and sensitive skin. I prefer a cream that is super thick and moisturizing. Also, this contains ingredients that are irritating to sensitive skin. I wouldn’t purchase this in the future. Not for sensitive or dry skin
