First, the packaging is beautiful. The texture is nice and feels very luxe, like a silky but creamy texture to it that spreads very nicely. My skin feels moisturized and not at all tacky or sticky. It also doesn’t make me breakout which is nice. My only thing with this is it’s hard to differentiate between the “hydrating cream“ and “hydrating day cream“ based on wording on the packaging, packaging itself and the texture is the same. However, I do like to use both in my routine and will continue to do so. nan
