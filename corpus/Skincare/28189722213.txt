I received this product for free from Influenster and Gucci in exchange for my honest review. I did not want to fall in love with this product, but Idid. It’s so expensive. The bottle is beautiful. A lovely, heavy, pale pink bottle with a gilded cap and label. The mist is so light, cloud like, and evenly coats the face. For this price it better be, but it was the perfect sprayer. It has a light rose fragrance from some of the rose essence ingredients. It’s not too perfume like, it’s a very light scent that dissipates quickly. I’ve been using it as a setting spray, and it’s my new favorite. It leaves a slightly dewy finish and it blends my cream and powder products together so seamlessly. My makeup lasted for 12+ hours and as it faded gently atthe end of the day, it still looked even and dewywithout excess oil. This might be one of thoseproducts I save for special occasions and buy onceor twice a year during a Sephora sale. nan
