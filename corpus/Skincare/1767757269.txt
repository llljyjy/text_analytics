I wanted to hate this because it was so expensive, but I absolutely loved it. I have super dry skin and wanted something to breathe some life into it when it felt at its worst. This mask does that every time. It smells incredible and makes my skin feel really supple and nice. Definitely going to repurchase, but itâ€™s lasting a while too! Unfortunately I loved it
