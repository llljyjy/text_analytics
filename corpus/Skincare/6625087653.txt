After using this the first time i had a reaction of itchiness all over my face that lasted all day. Washed off end on the night and decided to try it on again one more time to make sure and yes I am allergic this on my face. Also I am not a fan of the smell of tuemric all day long it is very strong. I will be calling customer service to see if i am able to get a refund or atleast report the issue. Everyone is different so this may not happen to you. I definitely have more of a sensitive skin and do have allergies to strong skin product. allergic reaction
