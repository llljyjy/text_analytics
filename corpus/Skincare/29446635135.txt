I received this moisturizer cream complementary from Influenster to give my honest review.  Iâ€™ve been using it for 2 weeks now I love how a little goes a long way and how hydrating it is. My make up sits well on top of it as well. However I am having a hard time with the smell, to me it smells like sour milk from a week old sippy cup left in a hot car. Thankfully the smell disappears pretty quickly once applied to my face. Love Everything but the Smell
