Absolutely love this product on my dry skin. It makes my skin looks so glowy and beautiful with and without makeup. I donâ€™t like to spend so much on a facial oil but this one is worth the splurge. I first tried a sample and had to buy the full sized. Plus, it lasts a while! I love it and will definitely keep buying. worth the price!
