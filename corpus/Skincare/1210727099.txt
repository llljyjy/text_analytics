This face cream was a wonderful and pleasant surprise! The jar itself is made out of a wonderful metal type feel that is a really good size for how much product you get. A little bit of the face cream goes a long way, which is wonderful! It is very light weight on the skin and does not make my skin feel weighed down, greasy, or oily. It also does not clog my pores. I feel like it could be slightly more hydrating, but because it is almost a gel like cream, it is so light weight, I feel it is fantastic for the consistency of what it is. Even after using this for a month I feel like the jar will last me a very long time! Lightweight, fragrance free, feels wonderful
