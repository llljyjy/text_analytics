Quick Summary: I’m giving this a 5 because it does work and match the skincare concern list on Sephora. For someone with very dry skin it gives a nice smoothing finish, even after reapplying sunscreen. It smells very nice, isn’t irritating for sensitive skin, and product goes a long way. However, the cost is a little steep for a moisturizer that isn’t life changing; there are better, cheaper alternatives at Sephora. I wish they could make this exact cream for someone with drier skin. Detailed Summary: I got this originally as a sample at the beginning of summer and I fell in love with the smell as it isn’t strong on my sensitive skin (it’s calming to me), and the light, airy application of it. I purchased it and have been using it for about a week now. I have very dry skin, essentially no oil production and for me this moisturizer is perfect under sunscreen (I apply multiple times a day), but on its own it wouldn’t give me the moisture I need throughout the day. It has a very nice finish, very silky, good for fine lines, and even with sunscreen on top, it leaves my face with a very flawless appearance compared to other moisturizers I have used.
