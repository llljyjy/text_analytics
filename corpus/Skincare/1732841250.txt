I am an experienced retinol user, and was gifted by INNBEAUTY Project the Retinol Remix to test out. She’s definitely a keeper! I love that it combines peptides and tranexamic acid into the formula so this cuts down on my skincare routine. It’s a lightweight formula, where a little goes a long way. I’m looking forward to continuing use and see results improve. I think this is a great choice for both beginners and experienced retinol users. It was not irritating on me. Don’t forget your SPF! Great for both beginner & experienced retinol user
