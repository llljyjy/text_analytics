It feels nice, but it doesn’t fit my face in the slightest. Its cut lopsided. The smell is strong, it feels so gloppy and wet. I haven’t seen the aftermath yet but here’s hoping it looks as good as it feels. The cut of the mask however is a joke. Seriously, I couldn’t stop laughing. Feels good but my face doesn’t fit this mask
