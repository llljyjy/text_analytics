I expected more from this face wash. Just tried it and it was okay. A little goes a long way and it foamed you nicely however for me it smelt very soapy which I hate in a face wash. Also took a while to rinse off probably due to the fact that I used too much. It also leaves your face squeaky clean feeling which is also don’t particularly enjoy. Feels like my skin is being stripped especially because I have dry skin. Hopefully I don’t break out. Will try again though! nan
