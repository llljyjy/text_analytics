I love this product. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I use. This did not cause my skin to burn after application. My skin is dry and I feel it help improve the texture of my skin. If I had one complaint and it is not a deal breaker, it would be the scent. I received this product complimentary from Shani Darden and Influenster in return for my honest review. Great for sensitive skin.
