I loved this niacinamide treatment! When I begun using I had some texture on my forehead that I felt like decreased noticeably over the usage of two weeks. I also felt like my pores werenâ€™t as noticeable after consistent use. It surprisingly didnt try out my skin. I did find that I needed to give my skin about 10-15 minutes for the serum to soak into my skin before applying the next step to avoid it foaming up. Loved this!
