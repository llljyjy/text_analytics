Oh My Goodness! I have never been so blown away by a product before! I know this is pricey BUT so very worth it! I have been battling redness for years and have tried lots of products and only had temporary relief. First, this smells amazing! Second, the feel of this creme is so luxurious that you just want to wear it all over! third, it does amazing things to your face! after a few days it completely took my redness away! Iâ€™m sold!  I even wear it under my makeup and have gone makeup-free most days. Changed the texture of my skin and made me look younger. I no longer wear primer or moisturizer under my makeup base. Wonderful Product!
