I want to start off by saying the packaging is nice, it looks clean and serious. The ingredients are great and I use them as a standalone product like the niacinamide, peptides, squalene, etc. The butters seem to be a little too much for my oily prone areas and the heavy layer it leaves behind is not great for my sweat-prone skin. I can’t speak for the a anti-aging as that would take a long while of using to see. Overall, I think this product would be worth it if your skin can handle some greasiness. I just put a tiny drop on my hand to remind myself of the way it feels during this review and if I wipe off the product my skin is left nice and satiny with a slight heaviness but that would be a waste of product if I had to do that to my face every time. If they come out with a similar product without the butter/greasiness, I’ll definitely try it out! I want to love it but it's not for me
