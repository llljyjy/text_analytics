This is a nice hydrating facial mist. It gives a beautiful dewy glow without looking oily. The atomizer is lovely and fine so there are no large droplets and you can just feel the gentle mist. The packaging feels and looks luxurious with the weighted frosted class and gold lid. I’ve used it on bare skin as well as on top of makeup. It isn’t meant to make makeup last longer, just adds a hydrated glow. It is fragranced, but the fragrance is light and not intense or bothersome. Nice Hydrating Mist
