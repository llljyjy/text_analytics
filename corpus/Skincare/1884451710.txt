i ADORE this serum! i was able to test it for about 2 weeks and i was admittedly a little nervous as i have experience with acids and i do have lots of texture, but i don’t necessarily have acne-prone skin and i feared this would be too harsh for me. to my surprise, the strawberry serum was super super gentle, certainly gentle enough to use every day if you do actually have acne-prone skin. i used it about 3x a week with not a single problem! it felt like a hyaluronic acid serum but quickly dried down first to that tell-tale “active“ texture and then completely, i could comfortably layer my next skincare step within 30 seconds. i expected to like this serum but not truly be wowed by it, but WOW! you got me glow recipe! easy and approachable active acid serum!
