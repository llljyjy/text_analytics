I love this vitamin C+E ultra glow serum! I tried the mini sample version and let me tell you this makes your skin feel so soft! I love the scent of this as well! My dry, sensitive, PIH & Eczema prone skin didn’t react badly at all with this! It feels really great on your skin it doesn’t feel oily or thick at all. It’s a liquid consistency but once your allly it, it absorbs quickly and leaves you a nice finish on your skin without looking really dewy if that’s something you don’t like. I think this is great for all skin types tbh. I think everyone should try it out! Dry, Sensitive, PIH, Eczema Prone Skin Approved
