I absolutely loved the ultrafacial cream and their night hydration cream is magic so i thought Iâ€™d give this one a try, it was a no for me. It is way tooo thick and oily and even when I tried to get over the consistency it just wasnt as hydrating at all. My make up starting cracking because my skin was just always dehydrated after I started using this. Would not recommend :( Unfortunate let down
