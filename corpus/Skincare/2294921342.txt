I have an oily forehead and nose, but the rest of my skin is normal. My skin is resilient (totally okay with Rx grade retinols, strong peels, and I don’t get sunburns), yet sensitive to moisturizers. I get bumps and have resorted to using hyaluronic acid and super light serums only, as they don’t cause me to break out with bumps. I’ve tried almost every moisturizer, from natural ones to expensive ones that are hundreds, and couldn’t find one that worked. I love skincare and still asked for samples to see if I could find one that doesn’t break me out, and after years of searching, this one was finally it. During winter, I need a little extra moisture around the crevasses of my nose and the corners of my mouth, so I use a tiny dab of heavier cream or oil over those areas. This is not greasy at all and wears well under makeup. The only other moisturizer I’ve been able to use in my life was the Perricone Face Finishing Moisturizer, but that was prior to its reformulation in late 2018. I’ve been using it for a month and a half now and still no issues :) A Miracle for Acneic Skin
