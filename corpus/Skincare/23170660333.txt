Hey there. I tested out this Eye Serum for 8 days and I am very impressed with the results I got. I like this one better than the matching face Serum..This Eye Serum is super lightweight and absorbs really well. It only takes a couple drops per eye to sufficiently moisturize my skin. My eyes started looking brighter and more awake. It honestly reminded me of a caffeine eye cream. .I saw a difference in puffiness around my Eyes when I’d wake up in the morning..My eyes had less visible dark circles and less dry skin. The tiny lines in the corners of my eyes were slowly plumping up and Smoothing out. If I would’ve kept using it I know I would’ve seen much better results. .All in all, it reduced puffiness, my dark circles, dry skin and smoothed fine lines. It didn’t make my skin oily or sticky and it didn’t irritate my eyes. My skin was softer and brighter..I definitely recommend this Eye Serum! Amazing Eye Serum!
