I recently bought this product and have used it once so far. I agree with other reviews wherein the smell is terrible but Topicals (on their Instagram) had already stated that this product does have a smell so I expected it. It’s still a very horrid smell though. Luckily, it subsides after a few minutes. I did not break out whatsoever from this product. In my opinion, I don’t believe Sephora had put the adequate amount of information shoppers need to know before using this product. On Topicals Instagram, they stated that you should NOT be using this product in the same routine as your exfoliants (BHA, AHA, etc) and retinoids. I wouldn’t have known that have I not gone on their Instagram and checked their highlights in regards to this product. They also provide more information about the product on their own website. I do believe that if I did not follow their instructions, tips and tricks, I would’ve too broken out. Please go their Instagram and website to inform yourself before making a decision. I can’t wait to see what my skin looks like in a few months and will be doing an updated review. Do your research!
