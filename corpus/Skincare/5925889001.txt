Bought this on a whim during the sale because I love glow recipe’s vitamin c serum and their avocado recovery serum. This ended up being my favorite purchase! It helps so much with texture and stubborn hormonal acne. This is giving the results that I was hoping the Paula’s choice would give, but didn’t. The texture is nice and thick given what the product is and it dries down quickly but doesn’t dry my skin out. If you’re on the fence, definitely do it! Sooo good!
