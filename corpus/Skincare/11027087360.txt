If I could rate it a zero I would. I never write reviews on products but this product ruined my skin. I had finally gotten my skin clear and super soft with Youth to the People’s line and thought I’d try out a different companies mask because I’d heard so much hype. Anyways fast forward…I got a sample of this mask and it broke my skin out wore than ever. I have a rash and large acne spots all of my chin and forehead. It’s now been this way for a week and a half. I’ve never had forehead acne tbh I didn’t know that was possible and my skin feels rough and textured. Be very very very careful with this product and tbh I wouldn’t even try the sample. Stay safe Worst product I’ve ever used
