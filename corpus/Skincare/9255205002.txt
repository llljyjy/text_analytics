I’ve used this now for about 6-7 weeks. I honestly haven’t noticed a difference in the redness I have. The consistency is a bit different, it’s almost gritty in a way. My face did feel a bit dry afterwards, but I just added in an extra hydrating moisturizer. I like the brand, but I didn’t really like this. nan
