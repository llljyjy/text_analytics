I’ll be honest, I was a little scared to try it at first because of the Retinol but man I am so glad I did! My skin improved by the second use and here’s why. The first time I didn’t put it on evenly so when I washed my face in the morning I noticed the new nicer skin on one section. Remedied this the next night and I can’t believe this is my skin! Honestly, it speeds up the process of skin renewal. I had a lot of skin damage from the sun and general redness, this stuff is amazing. The color of the cream threw me off at first but it feels so good on the skin. It’s super light and it absorbs fast! I can’t say enough good things about this. I’ve used it for a month now and it has absolutely given me so much confidence in my skin. Skin Confidence in a Bottle
