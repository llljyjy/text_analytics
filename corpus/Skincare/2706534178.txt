I had all but given up on HA serums in this price point - often too sticky, do not absorb well and result in pilling of makeup. After hearing rave reviews about this line from some folks I trust, I decided to give it a shot and am so pleased! Goes on well, absorbs nicely and really gives my skin a boost! I find a lot of people seem to not understand fully what HA is or how it works, it is not a moisturizer in itself, HA helps your skin retain moisture. Itâ€™s the first thing I apply after washing my face and/or stepping out of the shower, while my skin is still a little damp even, and it works so well! Very comparable to much more expensive product when using correctly. MY only con is the packaging, I really wish it had a dropper or pump, something to help control the amount of product you get. But this is a great buy for anyone looking to boost their skin routine. Game changer at this price point!
