This is a great cream for people who have really dry skin - I have combination skin and personally find it too rich for my face, but I love to apply this on my neck and décolletage at night. I was always confused about whether this has SPF because it kind of smells like sunscreen, but I don’t see it marketed at having any. Good for dry skin
