As a sleep deprived 34 year old nurse, I’ve noticed some changes in my skin - especially around my eyes. Super sensitive skin, fine lines, dryness, sunken skin, and darkness. Concealer sticks to the dry patches and makes the fine lines look like cracks in paint. My skin care is pretty basic but this has earned a place in my AM routine.Benefits:- Clean formula with no added fragrance (so no irritated skin for me!)- Vitamin C brightens under eye- Moisturizing and plumping without being greasy- Perfect with or without makeup (in this photo I have no foundation / concealer on but I’ve tried with makeup and it did not make my foundation nor concealer break up) Worked for my 34 year old sensitive skin
