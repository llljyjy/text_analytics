I received ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I used this product everyday for 28 days. I have combination skin with dry under eyes and an oily t-zone. This product did not seem to do anything special for my skin. This product is very watery and must be shaken well before applying. It did dry very quickly on my skin and I was able to layer foundation and concealer on top of it with no problem. I liked the fact that this product had SPF, Vitamin C and was tinted. I did not care for the smell of this product or the texture of it. I am thankful I was able to try this product and I will finish the bottle, however, I would not repurchase for myself. Just Okay
