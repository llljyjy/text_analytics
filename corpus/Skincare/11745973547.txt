I wanted so badly to like this when I received it complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido. It does soak into your skin quickly although this leaves a bit of an oily/dewy feeling. My issues with this are mostly the ingredients and the smell. The concentrations of some of the active ingredients are higher than the fda recommends. This can cause hormone disruption and increased risk of skin irritation. For me, it caused a rash. Then there’s the smell. It smells so strongly of sunscreen that I ended up with a migraine. I don’t think I could honestly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or with a sensitivity to fragrance. I was disappointed. Good, not great
