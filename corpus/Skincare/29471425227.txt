I gave it a 5 star because the product is great, feels light on the skin, reallh helped moisturize with my dry skin due to change of seasons, but I have to agree with all the comments on packaging. My pump does not work. I have to remove it to get access to the product. But for the price point and the quality of the product, I donâ€™t mind. nan
