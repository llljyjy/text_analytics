I’ve been using this cream for about a month now and I honestly don’t notice a difference in my skin. It’s lightweight which is nice. And a little goes a long way. I received a small sample and I still have plenty left after almost daily use. I like that it is not greasy as well. I would not purchase it just because I’m not sure it does anything for my skin. It's alright
