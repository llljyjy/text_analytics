When I first received the Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm, I wasn’t too sure I would like it. The texture is a lot different than other cleansers I’ve used, or currently use. I hadn’t used a “balm“ before and wasn’t too sure WHAT to expect.In the jar, the product has a faint smell of rose. Once you actually use it, it slightly smells of citrus. It’s actually a nice smell which makes using it a pleasant experience. So this isn’t a cream, a mousse, nor a “lotion“ textured cleanser. It is pretty much as labeled- a balm. Again, it’s different than anything I’ve used before, so it was a little odd for me. I was worried it would leave a greasy residue on my face because it DOES feel thick and greasy out of the jar, but it left my skin clean and feeling nicely moisturized afterwards.  It also rinses nicely and is able to be wiped off instead of rinsing which is great and very convenient. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and will be replacing my current cleanser with this one. I use several other products from the IT line of cosmetics, so I’ll buy this along with my next purchase! unexpectedly fell in love...
