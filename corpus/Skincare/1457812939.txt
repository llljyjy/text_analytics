Bought this twice thinking I was using it wrong.  Followed the YouTube videos and discovered I opened applicator correctly, put it on open and no powder came out.  While powder might be great the applicator stinks.  In fact I never even got enough powder out to try it.   I went back to my tried and true ColorScience. Two Defective Applicators
