I get hormonal breakouts and a lot of the benzoyl peroxide products that I tried in the past were to harsh for my skin so I thought I just had to live with it. I tried Dr. Zenovia and it has worked well for me. I like the system so that I can use just the products that I need on a given day. My only complaint is that the moisturizer size is too small. Iâ€™d happily pay a little more to have a larger size in the moisturizer. nan
