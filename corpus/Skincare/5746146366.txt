Love this! It’s hard to find salicylic acid in a format that isn’t a cleanser or heavy serum. This is slightly oily, but I use it as part of my evening routine, so I see that as a bonus. No irritation or stinging, nipped my hormonal breakout in the bud within four days. I use this with Buffet and 1% Retinol and my skin is the happiest I’ve seen it in years. Love it!
