SO!  I read some of the other very negative reviews and want to contribute mine.  I am over 55 with very dry skin.  I have tried so many “rich” cream moisturizers and kept searching for “the one”!  I tried this cream in a trial size (unsponsored) and was immediately impressed.  This cream is “not” for anyone who does not have dry to very dry skin.  Try the other AB cream.  This cream melts on my face and within minutes soaks in.  There is no heavy residue as some say nor has there been any kind of separation due to argan oil.  My face is smoother, softer and I haven’t even noticed a smell at all.  I already bought the larger bottle on the recent Sephora sale.  So…I think possibly some people might have had different skin issues because this is a dream for truly dry skin. My wrinkles are even less noticeable and softer for sure.   It is now part of my regimen.  Pricey - yes, don’t need a lot though. nan
