Okay I am pleasantly surprised by this product! It feels like I’m using a super nourishing lotion or moisturizer instead of something with spf in it. I don’t feel like it left a typical sunscreen white cast on it so I love that!! This was gifted by Josie Maran but I would order again!! Hydrating and not sticky
