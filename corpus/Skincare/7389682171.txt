Still on the fence about this cream. On one hand it makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated but my skin has been breaking out with some deep pimples (which I normally never have) it’s too early to tell if the breakout is a result of this cream but it did start the same time I started using it. I appreciate that it’s not scented and I love the texture. Overall I’m 50/50 on this cream. On the fence
