This is one of my favorite moisturizers! It is a thicker consistency, but doesn’t feel greasy or uncomfortable. It’a a great way to get an overnight boost of moisture for my dry, winter skin. I also like that it’s very mildly scented, reducing possible skin irritation. I personally don’t love a strong moisturizer under my makeup (with SPF and primer, it’s too much), so I use it in the evening to help refresh and reset. It’s perfect! nan
