My review and post is part of an incentivized campaign. I have received products for complimentary testing purposes. I received my product for free from Influenster and shiseido in exchange for my honest review.The application of this sunscreen was light and smooth. Upon application, the color is creamy and fades as you blend it in. This helps ensure you cover your whole face, ears, etc.I wear cream makeup so this hydrating formula (made with hyaluronic acid) works so well underneath and keeps my skin looking dewy. When I wear this without makeup, my face looks smooth and hydrated all day. Lightweight, oil free and excellent primer! Bonus: Shiseido Urban Environment Oil- Free Mineral Sumscreen Broad- Spectrum SPF 42 is ocean friendly! Hydrating, dewy and smooth!
