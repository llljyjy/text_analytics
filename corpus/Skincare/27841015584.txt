This new product was gifted by Dermologica to test for its launch! I was super excited when I heard all the ingredients and how it had a creamy texture. There was some trial and error with getting it to lather correctly but after that it worked like a charm. It has made my complexion noticeably brighter and smoother in just a few uses. Definitely a new staple in my skin care routine! Love the texture!
