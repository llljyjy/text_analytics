I did not receive this product as a free gift like many other reviews. I bought it myself and I love it. It has a velvety texture and glowy finish. It sets perfectly under foundation. I love it. If you are looking for a mat finish this product is NOT for you. If you have oily skin, this product is NOT for you. If you are after glowy dewy skin, it’s a yes! Love it. I take one star off because it’s so expensive. Love the dewy satin finish !
