Love this oil, been using for over a year and definitely has made a difference in my skin. Wish it absorbed a little better (less greasy) but still absorbs fairly well and apply my moisturizer over it and my spf. Still able to apply my makeup right after without issues. Helps keep my skin clear and hated when I ran out and wasnâ€™t using for about a week. nan
