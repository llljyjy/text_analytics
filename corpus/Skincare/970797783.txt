There is a very “apothecary“ feel to adding an active ingredient when you get this product...which makes sense because it’s Kiehl’s! Mixing the product, which is super easy to do, insures it is fresh. After using this product for one month, I noticed a definite improvement in the sagging skin on my neck and fine lines on my forehead, my two problem areas. Make sure you use it every night! This is a fantastic product for anyone with dry skin. Definitely a recommended serum! Great Serum for dry skin and fine lines!
