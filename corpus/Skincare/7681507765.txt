I’m really conflicted on this, I was very excited to use thewhole line because I’m always looking for clean and simpleproducts, I’m a new mom so I’m always in a rush and wantedto have a few staples for everyday use. I loved everythingabout this except that it broke me out so I had to stop using itbecause I have very sensitive skin, on the other hand myhubby uses it everyday and it worked amazing on his skin. SoI would say do a patch test and if you don’t break out thenyou’ll love this! nan
