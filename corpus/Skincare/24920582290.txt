I noticed puffier dark circles under my eyes so I went for this eye cream. It didnt feel hydrated and only looked brighter in the sunlight because of the shimmer it has in this cream. It could work if this is the only product you put on your face but once the moisturizer and suncreen went on, most of it pilled then noticed orange cream in my fine lines. Wanted to love but its not for me
