Kosas is becoming the next level in beauty. Kosas has a Plump and Juicy Vegan Collagen Spay-On Serum, a total skin reset. I love how colorful and bright the packaging is. Might I add, that it is environmentally friendly? It comes in a beautiful glass bottle that can be recycled. The Plump and Juicy spay is a probiotic for the face and does exactly what it says it will do. I had immediate results. You apply it in the morning and at night after you cleanse your face. The spray comes out as a fine mist that soothes the skin while helping combat the toxins that are o. your skin. I love how it absorbs quickly and leaves my face looking like I didn’t lose a wink of sleep. Even having sensitive skin, I didn’t have even one blemish after using this in the morning and at night. As I said it’s a clean beauty brand, from the packaging down to the vegan ingredients. The amino acids and probiotics work wonders in helping reveal your healthy skin from the inside out. I highly recommend Kosas Plump and Juicy to anyone who wants a beautiful, hydrated, clean beauty brand that actually does what it says. Keep that Skin Plump and Juicy
