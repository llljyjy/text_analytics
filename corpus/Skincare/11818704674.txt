To start out, I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have been using the Tula Bright Start Vitamin C Antioxidant Brightening Moisturizer for a few weeks, close to a month. My first impression of the moisturizer is that it looked nice and had a nice texture. It was not too thick and not too thin. The bottle had a pump up top that dispensed the perfect amount each time. It was really nice not having to open up a tube or scoop something out of a container (if that’s what you want to call it).  The scent was pleasant. Like most vitamin c products, it smelled citrusy but had hints of vanilla. With the product itself, it was very light. I did not see any notices to my skin the whole time I was using it. As I’m writing this review it is December and cold outside. My skin tends to get really dry in the winter and this did not help. I normally use a moisturizer that actually moisturizes… all in all, I did not love this moisturizer but I also did not hate it. I feel like if I used it during the summer time, my review and experience may be different. Not the best but not the worst
