I received this product free from Biossance and Influencer in return for my honest opinion.  To start off, I have always loved Biossance as a brand but have never tried this moisturizer. In order to make my review as honest as possible, I discontinued use of my other serums and moisturizers. I suffer from dry skin or more over, dry patches that tend to catch my makeup and make it look less than ideal. I started using just this moisturizer in the morning and then at night using this moisturizer and then using Biossance 100% Squalane oil on top. My skin has become so much better and I haven’t really been suffering from dry patches since starting this routine. This product is definitely going to be a repurchase and I’m so thankful to have been introduced to it. Amazing!
