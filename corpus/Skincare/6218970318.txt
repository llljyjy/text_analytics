I’m a huge fan of Fenty, Rihanna and everything she puts out. This product was just as good as her others! It’s a nice, gentle, lather and I like that you can use it on body AND face. 2 for 1? sign me up. There is a really really light scent that smells like cocoa butter, but its not super fragranced. I typically like fragranced body wash so that would be the only thing I’d like to see. Besides that, its super smooth and feels hydrating because of the cocoa butter. Very Gentle Soap!
