I really liked this at first, but the texture has dramatically  changed (and over half the jar is left). It’s gummy and thick, and pills up rather than absorbing. Also causes concealer applied over it to pill. The packaging on this needs to be reconfigured to prevent this from drying out prematurely. What a bummer and waste of $$ Dries out & doesn’t absorb
