This was the first time I tried an eye balm in stick form and I have to say, I like this type of application. The benefit of this application is that you apply the product evenly and consistently every time, which saves you products in the long run. The applicator was easy and intuitive to use and the formula left a light creamy and moisturizer balm on the eye lids. For a basic eye cream this is a solid product that delivers. Above all itâ€™s quick and easy to use and reduces the time needed to achieve those 10 step skin care routines. Easy application and mild formula
