I have oily skin and I don’t find this mattifying at all. I live in a humid climate and my skin gets so slick and shiny after a few hours with this under my makeup, even while using setting powder. It also smells very bad. The only good thing I can say is it’s clear spf. Otherwise I will not be repurchasing. not for oily skin
