I received this product from Influenster for free to review. The texture of the product isn’t oily it’s more water like and it’s very absorbent to the skin. It doesn’t make you look greasy when in use. The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because of the fragrance. It’s smells very heavily of perfume and it due to this it did irritate my skin. If you are not sensitive to fragrance then you may enjoy this but if you are you might avoid. it’s okay!
