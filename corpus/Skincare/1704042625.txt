This serum is beautiful — each time I use it, my skin feels hydrated and it has a subtle glow. When I wear it with sunscreen and no makeup, my skin looks really healthy and fresh. When I wear it with makeup, my skin has a natural radiance to it and my complexion products are enhanced. In the photo, I’m wearing Great Skin with sunscreen & concealer — no foundation. When I use the serum, my t-zone doesn’t look overly shiny or greasy either, which is usually a challenge for me. Overall, very happy with Great Skin! A gorgeous serum that leaves skin glowy & fresh
