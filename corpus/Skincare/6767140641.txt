This is my new favorite serum!!! Yes, she is pricy but I think well worth it, especially if you are battling with dry skin in the winter like I am. It has a very cooling, hydrating texture and my skin feels noticeably refreshed and tightened upon use. I would definitely recommend and repurchase, especially for my dry skin girlies. nan
