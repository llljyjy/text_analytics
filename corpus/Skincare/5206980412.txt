Normally I just use a tiny bit of the Jet Lag mask as my moisturizer, but after my skin got more dry during winter + from pregnancy I picked up this so I could have an extra layer of hydration. I expected it to be more like a serum, but I’d say it’s closer to a light moisturizer. Feels amazing and silky on the skin, and really seals in moisture. A new staple to my skincare!
