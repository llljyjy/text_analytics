I have had great results with Mount Lai Calming Repair Balm. First off, a little goes a long way with this product. I take a small amount at night, about the size of a dime, and apply it using my jade roller that I keep in my freezer- it’s a really luxurious spa like experience. After three weeks of continuous use, my skin is noticeably more moisturized and my fine lines are less noticeable. Since this is a “clean” product it does have a very medicinal smell, but it fades quickly so it doesn’t really bother me. I will continue to purchase this product since I have been seeing such awesome results with it. For those who say it’s greasy, I recommend you use less! nan
