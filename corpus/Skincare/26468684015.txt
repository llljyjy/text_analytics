I got the opportunity to try this product and I tell you, It work wonders! For me, 2-3 drops is enough for the application as it tends to make your face oily if you put on too much. The efficacy is spot on and it doesnt smell that bad which is a plus for me. The only reason why Iâ€™m giving this a 4 star is because I had an acne breakout on my forehead the first 2 weeks of using this product. nan
