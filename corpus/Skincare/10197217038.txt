Wish the clear weren’t packaged with these way-too-pigmented, grainy textured colors.  Sephora should strongly consider selling the clear lip balm solo. The price point for 3 was appealing but wish they were all clear.  It just doesn’t last long enough to justify $20 per tube.  Otherwise, I’d buy no other lip balm for the rest of my days.  Hard pass on the colors though! I gave them to my mother, who actually wears lipstick. love the clear; not at this price point
