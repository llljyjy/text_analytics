This product works well as a makeup remover or precleanse. First I apply it on a dry face and later add a little water to create a milky emulsion. I always use regular face wash afterwards because water alone leaves behind an oily residue. You don’t need a lot of product so the mini is a reasonable size.One thing I don’t like is that my eyes become irritated easily if the product comes near them, which usually doesn’t happen to me.For the price, I would say that this product is not a must-have. Unless you really love the feeling of a balm or oil, there are many other more affordable products that do the job. Nice but not a Must-Have
