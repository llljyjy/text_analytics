No cast on my medium-type skintone. It also seems to hydrate my skin since I noticed if my moisturizer still left me with dry-feeling skin, this would help. The big negative for me its not sweat resistant, so if I put it around my eyes, and I sweat even a bit the solution seeps in my eye and then it hurts and I have to remove it. This is the only reason I will not buy this sunscreen again because otherwise it was fine! Other sunscreen products did not cause this sweating issue. Iâ€™m still going to finish it but apply it on my neck and whatnot. nan
