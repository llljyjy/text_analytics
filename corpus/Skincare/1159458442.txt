I have been using this tinted moisturizer for years. I have attempted many times to replace it with something new but have always ended up disappointed. Gives me a dewy glow. I just put it on with my fingers. You don’t even need a sponge or brush. I never set it with powder and it stays pretty well all day. I think I’m going to stop looking and stay with what works!!! best tint with spf on the market
