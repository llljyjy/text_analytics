I got a teeny sample bottle with points a while ago, and I was so impressed I asked for the $55 bottle for my Christmas present! I notice an overnight difference when I use this oil. It is pricey so I save it for when my skin is looking its worst or once a week as , and usually I will wake up in the morning and there is a huge improvement in texture, brightness and sometimes acne, depending on what stage it is in. It is a retinol so using consecutively might cause skin irritation and breakouts because that is just a sad side effect of most retinols, but I have never had a problem with this one. I do use it sparingly so that may be why, but it is so nourishing that I have not felt any irritation or sensitivity the next day. I will continue to repurchase (especially since I recently spilled some on my carpet... tears were also spilled) nan
