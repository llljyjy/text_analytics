I sprung for this after my previous favourite gentle-exfoliating toner was discontinued. This bottle of beautiful-smelling magic didn’t disappoint. I primarily use it at night before serum and sometimes on its own. It leaves my skin soft and smooth without causing dryness, flaking or irritation. It’s a beautiful toner that acts as a gentle smoothing exfoliant and essence at the same time. I pray this never gets discontinued! Liquid Magic
