This balm is definitely quite good at brightening and cooling the eye area. The cooling effect is awesome, a nice treat in the morning. I was surprised how quickly it brightened, it seems to have the slightest shimmery pale blue-ish pigment. It isn’t intense though, even when I went over the area a few times. It dries quickly and works well under makeup, I didn’t find it too moisturizing though. Will probably buy this again since it helps brighten my dark eye circles! Brightened and cool undereyes!
