I received this complimentary for testing and reviewing purposesâ€œShiseido makes some of my all time favorite sunscreens! The Clear Sunscreen Stick is my holy grail when mixing California sun & makeup. I have purchased and repurchased the Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion for years! The Fresh Moisture Hylauronic Acid seems to set in better than the Oil Free version, kind of odd... But aside from that this leaves a white cast and can not be blended in. But most importantly for me, neither performed well under makeup. They broke it down, had it fading MUCH faster, and had me looking shiny not dewy. The newbie is not for me
