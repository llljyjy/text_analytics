So $38 for .5 oz of product is a lot, however, it’s the best $38 I’ve ever spent. This oil left my skin feeling and looking nicely hydrated without an excessive oily feeling. It didn’t have any scent to it as far as I could tell, and it’s just a really nice face oil overall. Def recommend Worth the money!!
