I was excited to try this as I love the other products by this company. However I was very disappointed at first use. It was very thick, and greasy.  I followed the directions and after rinsing my face felt very greasy/oily. I had to rewash my face twice with a different cleanser. My face broke out for a month afterwards.  I donâ€™t know of the product was defective or compromised.  I prefer the other cleansers in this line for there lightweight formulas what a let down
