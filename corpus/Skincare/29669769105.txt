I received this product for free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest opinion. I used this product for about 2 weeks before reviewing so I would be able to see if it made a difference. Unfortunately for me, I did not see much change at all. I know some people said it made their eyes burn and I did not have this issue whatsoever. If anything it was just a added moisturizer to my under eyes and eyelids. Iâ€™ll probably finish out what I have but I definitely would not pay $60 for it. Subpar
