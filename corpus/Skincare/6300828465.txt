Really wanted to like this face wash since it’s so popular but after using this face wash for 3 weeks I started breaking out all over my face. It’s been a month and I’m still trying to get my skin back to what it was before Tatcha :( My boyfriend loves it but I guess my skin just isn’t meant for this. Not For Me
