I’ve tried plenty of lip balms and I love the consistency of this product. I was hesitant to purchase due to it being pricier than some I’ve tried but this is easy to throw in your purse and apply throughout the day. It smells amazing and I’m not really into lip stick so the little color it gives I love. Best lip balm ever
