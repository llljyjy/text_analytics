I really enjoyed this cream!  The texture is nice and smooth.  This really felt like I was doing something nice to my skin.  I have combination/sensitive skin and it doesn’t always respond well to richer product.  This product didn’t break me out and moisturized my skin well without being greasy.  The only thing that wasn’t my favorite was the scent, it is strong, but if scent isn’t an issue for you this will work for you! nan
