Love Love Love this stuff. I have lips that are constantly dry. I am always applying lip oils or balms through the day. This stuff is meant for night time but I use it all day and love it. Silky and smooth, it leaves a shine on your lips and keeps them moist for hours! I have several of the ’flavors’ and they all smell delicious. I keep the small size in my purse and the large one at my bedside because I use it at night too. If you have dry lips, this stuff is the bomb! Dry lips need this stuff! Lip heaven
