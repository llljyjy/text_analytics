I love how Clinique’s cleansing foam really works. Within the first week I noticed a difference of my acne disappearing. The reason I took off two stars  is I can’t stand the smell. I’m surprised no other reviews mentioned it. It reminds me of a cleaning  solution when I was a kid in school. If they add a better scent I might buy it again. Good Product but Bad Scent
