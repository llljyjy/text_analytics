Absolutely love this cream! I used belief aqua bomb for almost 2.5 years and loved the cream when i first started using it. I’m not sure if they changed ingredients but recently it’s been making me break out. Got a sample of this cream with an order and cleared my face in a week. Went back and bought the mini to see if result would last. So far my skin has never been clearer.  The price is a lot but it’s also allowed me to cut out using multiple different serums since this cream is super hydrating. LIFE SAVER!
