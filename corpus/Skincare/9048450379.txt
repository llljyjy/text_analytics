I wanted this cleanser to work for me and my combo skin/hormonal acne because it has such great reviews and is at an amazing price point, but unfortunately all this did for me was create a few weeks of insane purging- like, the worst acne I’ve had in my whole life. On The Inkey List’s website they have a whole page dedicated to purging and they acknowledge that this product can cause it, and they essentially advise just powering through the purge for clearer skin after a few weeks. I understand the science behind purging and I know that eventually this should work and my skin will look better than before, but I’m ultimately throwing this away today after about a month of twice daily use because the breakouts are horrific and just keep getting worse and I would rather use a cleanser that doesn’t cause more acne than it treats! Ultimately my advice would be if you know that salicylic acid works for your acne then this might be a good fit for you like the five star reviews say, but if you haven’t used it before/recently then to proceed with caution. I also didn’t love how much this burns if you accidentally get it in or close to your eyes. This is not it!! The purge is real
