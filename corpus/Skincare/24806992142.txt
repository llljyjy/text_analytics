The texture of this eye concentrate is lightweight and it’s easy and convenient to apply. You only need to use the smallest amount and makes the cream last a long time!Reduces puffiness, brightens up my eye area and smoothes the skin. This is especially noticeable in the morning. I found only one not very significant con - smell… I prefer scented cosmetics, but I don’t really like scent of this concentrate… good thing - it’ quickly disappears on the skin.I highly recommend this  𝔼𝕪𝕖 ℂ𝕠𝕟𝕔𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕣𝕒𝕥𝕖 ℂ𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕞 for dark circles and under eye bags! Perfect for my dark circles!!!
