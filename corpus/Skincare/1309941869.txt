Just started using this eye balm a couple weeks ago, when I received this in the mail from Influenster, and it definitely has a cooling effect after you apply it. It’s easy to use, but I don’t love the stickiness from the product. It also looks like there’s some kind of shimmer or something coming from the product that I also don’t love. I will continue to use the product to finish it but I don’t think I would repurchase it. Glow + get it eye balm
