Good coverage for everyday wear was really natural and lasted throughout the day.  Definitely recommend for an everyday foundation or if you are looking for a lighter coverage to even out skin tone. Did not oxidize either which was great seeing it has SPF. I have no had the product long enough to know if the skin benefits are true but it did not break me out and felt very light on my skin. AMAZING!!!
