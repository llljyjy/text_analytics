Love the product. I smear it all over my face after putting my makeup on (I’m dry as flaky and don’t know what else to do) and this works like a charm bringing my skin back from lizard town. It has a citrus smells I personally enjoy however I experienced the same problem with the bottom wheel just breaking to pieces. The packaging needs work but the product is quite enjoyable great idea poor execution
