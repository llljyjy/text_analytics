I really like this mask! It feels so good, the little beads rub in quickly and the mask is light but packed with hydration and makes my skin look really nice. I have dry skin so I appreciate the extra moisture while I’m sleeping. It smells really nice as well and I would likely buy this (it was originally gifted). The only downside to me is the package is very small and I feel like would go quickly. The container makes it look bigger but in reality  it’s quite small and would maybe last 1-2 months with regular use. nan
