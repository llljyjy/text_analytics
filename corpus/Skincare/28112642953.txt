This eye cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide is amazing! I’ve been using it morning and night and I love that it is multi-corrective. I apply it before my moisturizer tapping alittle into my undereye area and my eyelids. It isn’t greasy and is fast absorbing. I have more of a brightness while feeling refreshed! Great product!
