This sunscreen is my most high maintenance sunscreen. It only works well if you have the right actives or moisturizers underneath. I am often trying new products and Iâ€™ve found a 50% success rate. The wrong serum or moisturizer and the sunscreen starts pilling like crazy, becoming impossible to use. It also likes to converge in the corners between my nose and cheeks, eventually flaking off throughout the day. Not good for those with dry skin. This sunscreen just requires too much maintenance and is too much work. Also has a slightly orangey pink undertone. One shade fits all which is certainly not true. Pills like crazy
