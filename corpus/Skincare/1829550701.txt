I absolutely love JLO so I was super excited to when she came out with a skin care line. I like the cleanser but as others have stated the packaging is horrible. It leaks out and you waste a lot of product. For the price and packaging I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing. If they changed the packaging then yes I’d consider because I like how it doesn’t dry my skin out. Hate packaging
