I love these so far! Although the packaging was a bit strange. The first pack only had one in there so I cut it in half to use on both side of my face. The second pack had three somehow, one was barely visible, then one was thicker than the other, and another one was hiding. They sit well and I havenâ€™t had any issues with sliding.
