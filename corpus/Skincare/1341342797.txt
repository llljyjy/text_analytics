I received this as #freetrial with #trywithtopbox.  I loved this product especially for the harsh winters when I suffer from excessively dry skin which flakes and peels.  I love that this product has hyaluronic acid which is the only cream I buy now because it locks in the moisture for the whole day.  The green tea seed is supposed to lock in the moisture.  I would definately buy again as it is comparable to another one of my favourite creams from clinique.  Thank you topbox. A must have for dry skin
