I think this is the best peeling mask I’ve used so far which is a lot! It has a very slight  lemony smell and feels super light on your skin, another thing i loved about this product is it is so quick and easy to use it only takes 2-3 minutes so you have time to use it anytime, and it peels off and exfoliates really easily compared to other products I’ve used in the past. would definately reccomend this product and purchase in the future. Great skincare product
