I received this product from a tula/influnster voxbox for my honest review. This is the second time I received Tula skin care products. I absolutely love that they are a vegan brand. I received the rose eye balm in my previous box and find in comparison to be much better. This does hydrate well and doesn’t leave your skin feeling clean. There is no issues with makeup on top. Does exactly what it’s supposed to.. hydrate. Not cakey!
