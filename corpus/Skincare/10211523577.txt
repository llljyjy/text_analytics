This is a great sunscreen if you are able to afford it, it does remind me of the Cerave sunscreen so I would go for that. It goes on like a moisturizer and does not have any sunscreen smell to it, most importantly it did not break me out. Would recommend if you’re not on a budget, otherwise it’s just a sunscreen. No break outs!
