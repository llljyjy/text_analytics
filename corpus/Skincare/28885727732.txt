I know that sunscreen is an absolute must, I do, but I have hated every sunscreen I have ever used. For YEARS I have searched for a good sunscreen, one that was light weight, but effective, and didnâ€™t make my oily acne prone skin upset after 2 hours. Well, I have found my holy grail. This sunscreen is amazing. It is thicker than I would normally like, admittedly, but that is OK because it does not FEEL overwhelming! It feels amazing and I feel protected. A definite MUST HAVE! BEST sunscreen I have ever tried
