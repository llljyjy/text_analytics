I got this as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. I am a die hard double cleanser, and I wanted to love this stuff, but it’s awful. The texture is thick, which was okay, but it’s SO greasy and oily. It will take off makeup, but I had to wash my face twice with my gel cleanser to feel clean. The residue wouldn’t go away, and I felt like my face had a waxy coating on it. I used it three times to give it an honest try, and every time it took two washes to get it off. There are better oil cleansers out there, skip this one. Too Greasy
