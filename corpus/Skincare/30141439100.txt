I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. At first I wasn’t sure how to use the product because there was no real instruction on the sample, but after finding it online I used it morning and night after washing my face. The first time I used it I woke up and my face was super greasy and broken out. I have an overactive sebaceous gland so I have to be careful about things making it worse. After that my oily skin really started improving! It wasn’t crazy shiny or oily at all. My skin was just moisturized.. I also have large pores on my nose and cheeks and the look of my pores has improved as well! Trust the process
