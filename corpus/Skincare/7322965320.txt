I received a sample of this for my birthday and I am quickly falling in love!! I use it in the evenings to wash my face. I have paired it with the dewy skin cream and my face feels so good at the end of the day. It also doesn’t sting, which is something I’ve been dealing with. So I’m guessing that means it’s gentle?? It’s nice to have a calm face for once! Hoping to see more benefits as I use it. The sample will probably have me make a purchase if things continue this way! Falling in love with a cleanser?!
