Before I even used IT Super Sauce,  I looked it up to makesure that it was non-commodogenic. Sure enough, it was. It is a very rich and hydrating moisturizer.  The scent is very light and minimal, which I like. Ireally love the packaging of this moisturizer. The outer box is very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing but the container for the moisturizer itself is absolutely gorgeous.The colors would be comparable to the inside of a conch shell, or something like that, just gorgeous! Absolutely wonderful!
