I love Tula products. I love that I can look at the packaging and know that it is free of multiple products, is cruelty free, and is vegan. I buy Tula products mostly for this reason. This night cream comes out of a pumper, which is super convenient and hygienic, but part of me hates the extra plastic and I feel like it distributes more than I need creating waste. It is a very heavy night cream that I will save for the winter time, but overall a great feel! Thick night cream
