The bottle is nice and high quality, but similar to other reviews, the pump should be taller so you don’t have to tilt the bottle to use it. I have only need one pump so it will last quite awhile and it has a light lavender scent which is nice. I have only been using this product for a little over two weeks so haven’t noticed any difference when it comes to fine lines or minimizing pores. It does do a great job cleansing my face but I don’t know how hydrating it is for me. I have noticed a lot of dryness on my chin. This could just be from dry winter air but seems to have increased since I started using this. I will keep using this since I like the product and see if I notice any increased benefits after more time. nan
