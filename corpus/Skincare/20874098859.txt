This formula has a very watery consistency, so be careful when getting some out, as it’s easy to get way too much. That being said, I really love it. It isn’t greasy/oily, nor does it irritate my skin. It doesn’t have a scent that I can detect either. Very lightweight, I plan on purchasing it, once I run out of my sample size. Great for sensitive skin!
