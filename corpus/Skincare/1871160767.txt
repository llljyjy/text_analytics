I love how you prepare the serum yourself by mixing in the retinol with the rest of the product.  It’s a little grainy but it also feels slightly exfoliating so I enjoyed that.  A little goes a long way and my skin felt super soft after I applied the serum.  I think it’s a great product by a great brand and I would recommend giving it a try. DIY Night Serum
