Kiehl’s normally delivers a great product but I was left greatly disappointed. I used this serum, religiously, every single night for about 12 weeks and could never see any difference or improvement. Dark spots on my skin still remain and have not lightened or lessened. Serum applied nicely and didn’t cause any breakouts so that’s why I have two stars. nan
