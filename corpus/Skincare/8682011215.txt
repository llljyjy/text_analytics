one of my favorite lip balms ever! itâ€™s so soft, so moisturizing even through a super cold dry winter, tested in IL, CO, and TX winters and it held up beautifully, definitely had to reapply more in CO and TX compared to IL but that is expected with the lack of humidity. the flavors are very nice as well :) LOVE
