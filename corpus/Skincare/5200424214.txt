OMG I am officially obsessed! I have been testing Canopy for a month now and it has changed my Skin. I first used it when I came back from Vegas (My skin was so parched, my cuticles were bleeding, and my sinuses hurt after all that casino smoke air) I immediately set up Canopy and within 24 hours could tell an immediate difference. My skin was more hydrated and my sinuses did not hurt, were no longer dry! I had no idea humidifiers could have so many health benefits. I keep mine in my office and I love it. The water tank lasts forever, is gorgeous and so well designed. I keep it on auto-and let it do it’s thing.I am also not an oil person but I love the unwind scent, very soothing, and surprised myself how much I am reaching to add the oil to the puck. Overall, I love the design and chic look, my Skin feels more hydrated and plump>> I notice a difference with how my skincare soaks in and lays. I can’t believe that I waited this long to get one! I love mine so much I am going to gift one to my Mom! Forever fan over here! HYDRATED SKIN >> Savior post Vegas
