In comparison to the other sunscreen  that’s oil free, I like this one more. I felt like it was moisturizing and it provided sunscreen. I’m not sure what the cost is but based on the brand I probably would only use this for my face. I think I saw a review mentioning that it wasn’t enough for one beach trip...I don’t believe this is meant for full body coverage. I mean of course if you left you sunscreen home use it but I feel like this is for the face and décolleté area. Take it as travel size or to reapply before going out but I definitely don’t see it for full body use. It would be done in like a day if it was used that way. nan
