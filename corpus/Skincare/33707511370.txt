I have never tried something like this before until now. I was expecting something better but was slightly disappointed. It wasn’t very soothing to me and it didn’t hydrate my skin like I thought it would. It didn’t leave it dry or anything, but it was hydrated either. And the smell was also more than I could handle. It wasn’t nauseating but it just wasn’t good. If it hydrated more and had a more subtle smell, it could be great Okay
