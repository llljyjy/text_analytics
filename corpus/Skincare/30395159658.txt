Add this to your morning skincare routine! It’s a perfect moisturizer- not too greasy or thick, and it works great under sunscreen. I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t ruined my skin at all. I’ve heard that Paula’s choice products are great for sensitive skin and its my first time trying out their product, so far so good! It def leaves my skin healthy looking and brighter! In love! Morning skincare routine!
