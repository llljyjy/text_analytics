I honestly don’t feel like this did anything for me. Everyone’s always saying that niacinamide is amazing and it’s awesome, and everyone I know loves it. So I tried this because maybe a mask would force me to use it, and it would be nice to alternate this between another night mask that I use.. I’m not sure what the hype is about this. I used this three times. And it was not what I expected. First of all, you need to add a secondary moisturizer on top or a thick one underneath. this has no moisture at all so don’t expect it to plump your skin at all. I used this in conjunction with retinol oil. And in the morning my skin was dry, all gone and not nurturing at all. secondly I didn’t see any difference in my skin. what’s the hype? Honestly I really wanted to like this. for reference, I have normal skin, 31 years old, no wrinkles or fine lines. I’ve tried different thickness of layers each time I used it and I still can’t say that there was any difference to my skin. I honestly only leave reviews for things that I love and hope my review could convince others to love it too. But I’ve gone out of my way to leave a review of this product because I just don’t understand it at all. not what what the hype is
