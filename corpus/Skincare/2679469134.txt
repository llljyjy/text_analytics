A very good, hydrating eye cream. I love that it’s a gel consistency, it absorbs very fast and doesn’t seem to cause millia as often as eye creams do after a month of use. I am younger and do not have a problem with wrinkles but I do feel it helps with dark circles and bags, it’s cooling and depuffs. Despite it saying it’s a night repair, it’s good for day and night use. nan
