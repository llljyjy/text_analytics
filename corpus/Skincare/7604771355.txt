This was a complementary from Influenster and Estee Lauder in return for my honest thoughts on the Supercharged repair eye gel. This product has a great application absorbed quickly and did not burn when sweating during the mid of summer living in the south. Which is great for southern bells. However the product did not provide any notice changes using it every morning and night over a 3 wk period so Iâ€™m giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. Supercharged? Not so sure....
