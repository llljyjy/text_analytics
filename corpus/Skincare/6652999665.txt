I have very dry skin, and I have repurchased this serum three times after switching from hyaluronic acid. It is super hydrating and plumping, and if I doâ€™t have it for a few days, my skin is noticeably less plump looking/more prone to flakes. I use this after my retinol serum at night and on damp skin in the morning, followed by moisturizer in both AM and PM, and it helps tremendously. I notice that many people use this as a primer but personally I have noticed some pilling when I apply cream makeup over this without waiting - your mileage may vary. The smell is odd but not off-putting, and the texture is thick - not watery like many hydrating serums - which makes it feel extra soothing. Super hydrating serum
