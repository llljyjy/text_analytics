Love the EADEM cloud cushion Airy Brightening moisturizer!!  that was gifted to me by EADEM. My face was dull and dry before using this moisturizer. After using EADEM for a few days, the skin on my face was much softer and noticeably moisturized. My face has a subtle and natural glow. I like the airy texture of the moisturizer and the nice & clean fragrance free scent. I highly recommend it! Received it as a gift from EADEM. This is my honest review. Thanks! Very nice moisturizer!!
