I have found the new staple in my skincare routine, this stuff is amazing! I have been using it every day twice a day and I have noticed significantly less breakouts. I am one who suffers from breakouts in general, especially hormonal acne but this stuff has reduced it drastically. I use it after I wash my face and it has a slight refreshing tingle. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars was because I couldn’t open the bottle. I like many others tried everything and it still wouldn’t budge. I had to wait til the holidays when my family visited and had my uncle do it. Despite the packaging I will be repurchasing. Hopefully by then they will have fixed the issues with opening the caps. Amazing product,  horrible packaging
