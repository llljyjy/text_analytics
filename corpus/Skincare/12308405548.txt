I received this product as a free sample. So I am 30 years old, with combination skin and minor wrinkles around eyes and lips.From very first day of using this serum I noticed my skin being nourished and hydrated. The smell is amazing, it is so fresh, you feel like you are applying luxurious product. The serum itself applies very smoothly. Straight after applying I fell my skin to be very gentle. After an hour I felt shine that comes from inside of your skin. It is beautiful. I apply only in the evening. In the morning aaah the skin so fresh, so nourished and rested. And after 3-4 days of using even my husband noticed that my face was looking so good. It really feels like I have visited a cosmetologist. And the greatest plus of this serum is that it is made of 90% natural ingredients. Recommend! The best serum I have ever used, believe me I have tried lots and lots.Dior is as always the best! It is just perfect serum!
