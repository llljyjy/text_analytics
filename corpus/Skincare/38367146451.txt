I received my water-lock moisturizer as a complimentary from Tara Harper skincare. I’ve been using it for a week now and I’m already starting to see little results. I was so happy and I will definitely repurchase. The best thing is that I only need to buy a refill, reducing plastic waste and being environmental friendly. Sustainability is a big deal for me. The silicone free formula makes my skin feel smooth and fresh (feels natural and not artificial). Texture is perfect for me, very light and gets absorbed by the skin in seconds. It’s lightly scented! It’s a little pricy but the quality of the product and the packaging makes it worth it! Clean and amazing!
