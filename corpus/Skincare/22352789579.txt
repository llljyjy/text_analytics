I received this item free for testing purposes and honestly wasn’t a fan. I had high hopes that this would be a new exciting product I could incorporate in my routine, but it was a let down. The product smelled chemically and the packaging was plain. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin either. So I wouldn’t recommend it. Wasn’t a fan.
