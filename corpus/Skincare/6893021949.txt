It does not melt is cakes. Does not absorb, sits like a top inconvenient layer interfering with the rest of your moisture routine. Have to ready run it around the eye area which leaves the skin feeling sore. Although their other products are great, this is a solid disappointment and waste of a lot of money. Disappointing! Not worth you money.
