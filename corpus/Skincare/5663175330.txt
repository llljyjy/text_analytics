Love this product, hate the price ! It’s not that In the span of a year, I have used so many bottles of this SPF; bought my last one less than 24 hrs ago. I honestly cannot afford it, BUT it’s the one sunscreen with a decent cast ( if you are dark skin and say this doesn’t give you a cast at all, you are not applying enough) that doesn’t break me out. My skin has gotten more annoying and comedone-prone in recent years and this sunscreen is God-sent. I also suffer from hyperpigmentation from the acne and spots, so I absolutely need a physical SPF. Please don’t discontinue! nan
