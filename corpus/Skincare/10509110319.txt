I love this serum! It’s such a luxurious brand, and for the price or sells at...I’m glad it does its job.I’ve been using this serum everyday (at night) with my skin regimen routine, and I can tell a difference. My skin is dry, but this serum has helped restore that moisture back into my face, and noticing more of an even skin tone.It did take my face a few days to adjust when I first used this, because my face got a tad red, but it’s Def worth letting my skin adjust to it.Such a fancy product and cute bottle, but it Def works wonders.
