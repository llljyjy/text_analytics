Gifted by Josie Maran. If you have oily skin this is not the sunscreen for you. I’m more on the dry side and i typically like more emollient products but I still found this to be an incredibly oily sunscreen. That being said it does wear well under makeup and it doesn’t LOOK bad it just feels very heavy. nan
