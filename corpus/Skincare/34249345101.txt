Although it’s a great moisturizer I didn’t really notice any other results from it. I don’t have huge pores so maybe that’s why. I didn’t notice a glow to my skin either. I did use the entire tube because of the moiture it gave my skin which I was very pleased with. I won’t be purchasing it in the future because it’s just not for me and didn’t deliver the results that were said it would. Not saying it’s not any good but it just didn’t work for me.
