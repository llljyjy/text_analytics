I purchased a discovery set from the brand’s site that included a deluxe sample of this mask and have been using it once every 3-4 weeks for the last couple of months. This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. I love how this mask leaves my skin soft and smooth in as little as 2 minutes. The ingredients in this mask, including the AHA, is gentle and effective at resurfacing my skin. I did not experience any dryness, tightness, or irritation; just soft, smooth skin. The mask itself is absolutely beautiful inside and out - the jelly texture is lightweight, easy to spread, has a lovely amber / rust hue and is infused with thin pieces of saffron. It makes for an aesthetically appealing presentation - both in terms of how it looks in the jar and its results. Baby smooth skin. I’ve heard that there’s a honey scent to this mask and as lovely as that sounds, I did not pick up any scent from the mask. Resurfacing masks are often effective but also potent. This achieves that fresh faced, satiny smooth skin in the most gentle, irritation-free way. Highly recommend. Beautifully presented mask and beautiful results
