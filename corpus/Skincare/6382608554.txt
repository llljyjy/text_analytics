This is my favorite product of the line so far. I love the texture and the way it sinks into my skin quickly. I love using gel moisturizers in my morning skincare routine, but not all gel moisturizers work well with my skin or under makeup for me. However, this has been such a great experience and looks great under makeup. I got this sent for free from Influenster to try out and give my honest opinion, but I will be repurchasing a new bottle once I run out of the one I have!!! LOVEEEEE IT!!!!
