First of all this product is amazing!! I love and use many lip balms and chap sticks. This one beats them all, seriously! I tend to always have dry and flaky lips. The first time I used this it completely changed the texture of my lips. When you put it on it feels like it actually sinks into your lips to keep them moisturized, not like other products like vaseline that just sits on your lips. For those saying there are other cheaper options out there I don’t believe them. This does not feel like vaseline. It’s way better in my opinion. I like to wear this for a sleeping mask at night and also for daily wear. I will definitely purchase again once I run out. Amazing!!! No substitute.
