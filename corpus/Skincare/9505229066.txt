I thought this product worked really well with my skin. I have dark spots near my jawline from picking at my acne through the years and I’ve noticed really great improvements. I love the velvety consistency and I usually mix it with either a lotion or oil at night. I don’t normally use it during the day, just because of the ingredients mixed with being in the sun, but I highly recommend. Great for my scars!
