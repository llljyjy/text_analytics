This Dior recovery and repair balm is very good for putting moisture into your skin. It goes and very smooth and creamy and immediately you can tell it’s moisturizing your skin. I like it because it does not have any strong scent to it. I’ve used it mostly on my face and neck and have noticed less dry flaky skin. My daughter used a little as a hand cream and she thought it worked really good on her dry hands. However I haven’t noticed that it’s done anything to help with my redness on my face. nan
