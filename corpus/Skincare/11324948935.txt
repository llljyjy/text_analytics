My main skin concern is hyperpigmentation and I use this almost every other day or three times a week with the Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid and my skin tone is fairly even the next day. The results were pretty immediate. I’ve also started using the neutrogena retinal SA in between the week for dark spots. So all together this has improved my skin tone. Holy Grail.!!
