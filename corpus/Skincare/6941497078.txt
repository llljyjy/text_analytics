Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.This was my first time trying an Origins product, even though I have heard about it before and my sister actually recommended it for me. It creates a lot of foam with a tiny amount of product, and leaves my skin feel like “squeaky clean“ but still very soft and smooth. If there’s one thing I don’t like about this face wash is the smell, it’s kinda too “soapy“ for me, but it’s not that strong, just my preference, maybe because I’m so used to my very gentle face wash now, my boyfriend said he barely smelled anything. Overall 9/10. nan
