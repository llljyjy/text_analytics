I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. And thank God I did because, before I tried it, I never would have purchased it. I simply thought it couldn’t be as good as all the hype. I was wrong. First of all, this comes in the loveliest glass jar. The kind of lovely jar my grandmother had for her beauty creams and powders. It’s so pretty and just feels expensive. The cream inside, on the other hand is very modern! Probably the best cream I’ve ever tried for my dry skin. The first time I dipped into it I notice how thick it was and when I smoothed in on, it actually felt a little occlusive but that feeling disappears almost immediately. You are left with fresh, very dewy looking skin and that look lasts for at least six hours. While you are wearing it, it plumps up fine lines and has a brightening effect, something I really didn’t expect. It promises a long term brightening effect, but I haven’t had it long enough to attest to that. The only thing I don’t love about it is the rose scent. That’s more of a “me” problem though as a lot of people love that scent. I will say that it is very faint. In fact, I’ve been wearing it about two weeks and I barely notice the scent now. In spite of that, I will buy this myself when it runs out and when you pass me on the street you’ll wonder how I look so young;) #MagicSkin #MagicCream @charlottetilbury So Worth It!
