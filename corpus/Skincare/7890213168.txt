This is expensive but it works. I tend to get really bad breakouts and rosacea across the front of my cheeks, it’s really hard to cover up and it breaks out in sensitive, painful little red spots on top of the rash. The amount you get in this kit is very small, but a little goes a long way. These products are a “less is more“ kind of thing. I apply the serum (3 drops) then the cream, then the cover. The green cover transforms into a beige pink so it actually masks my redness very well. I layer these. The cleanser is the only that doesn’t break me out and I’m about to order another cleanser to match this set. The cover cream does dry me out if I don’t wear a cream moisturizer like the one that comes in this kit or the Ceramidin Cream also by this brand. Those in combination are one of the only things that reduced the redness during a flare-up. I used to just use a petroleum jelly but I developed a sensitivity to it, which is why I tried this line and it’s really working to clear up my patchy, red skin. My redness is not only embarrassing, it’s super painful so I love that I can get this and clear it as well as cover it. Makes a difference in my patchy redness
