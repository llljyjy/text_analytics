I have normal skin with large pores on and around my nose and some blackheads. I use this 2x per week at night as part of a minimal routine (cleanse, exfoliate, moisturizer) and Iâ€™ve seen a noticeable difference in my pores after only about 2 weeks. My skin looks SO SMOOTH and the poor are much smaller. Blackheads are mostly gone. I would definitely recommend this product. I apply it with a cotton pad, wait about 15 minutes and then apply Siseido moisture 5 stars for normal to combo skin
