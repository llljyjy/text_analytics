This moisturizer is entirely non-greasy, and feels very hydrating on the skin. It absorbs very quickly and has a scent that smells like fruit snacks. The pump on the bottle is a flat top, push-to-dispense mechanism, which is great for when I want to mix my retinol into the cream. One thing to note is that the moisturizer did initially break me out, before my skin got used to the formula. nan
