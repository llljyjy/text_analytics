The serum evaporated so rapidly like 3 seconds after I applied it, and my skin even felt dry. I’ve never used a poor serum like this. I didn’t expect much from it given the price. But it wasn’t even moisturizing. Isn’t that the basic of a serum? A normal toner would do a better job than it. Overrated serum NOT even moisturizing
