I tried a sample last night after layering on the kombucha treatment essence and two serums, and it did not pill like others were saying. It was light weight, creamy, and lovely, and was absorbed immediately into my skin and made it feel very relaxed and bouncy. I woke up this morning with calmer skin that is much less red than usual and it is incredibly smooth. It’s the best moisturizer I’ve tested in recent months especially in dry indoor weather in NY with the heater on all the time. I wonder if this works better for aging skin (I’m in my mid-30s so I can see that if I had used this in my 20s where my hormones were a lot more different and my skin was a lot oilier, that it might not have worked). FYI I have normal/ slightly dry and sensitive skin and i do not over-exfoliate or use AHA, or use a lot of foundation. No acne issues. Moisturizing and soothing
