I received this free for review. I don’t think it was an amazing moisturizer - I definitely have better moisturizers. I also wasn’t a huge fan of the scent, it smelled a bit like cough syrup to me. However, I did like using this as a makeup primer. I’m not sure if that makes it worth the cost, but it does work quite nicely for that. Meh
