I have used this product for a week now and find it to be one of the best creams for my skin.  Especially in the winter, my face tends to become dry and loses sheen.  This product goes on lightly and absorbs quickly.  There are no harsh smells or chemicals, so it does not irritate my skin.  I love how soft my face felt after just one application.  It protects my face from the harsh wind and cold weather and I am able to maintain a healthy feel and glow all day long. Super absorbent and hydrating
