This product isnt for me. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I just dont think it does much of anything. While the ingredients are great and the packaging beautiful, the results aren’t anything special. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I just don’t think it does much of anything. The consistency is very liquidy and doesn’t seem to absorb at all. I feel like I’m putting brown water on my face. It doesnt make my skin look “glowy“ or feel moisturized. I wanted to like this but sadly I will return. Just OK
