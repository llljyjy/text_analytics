I started using Clinique smarBirthday!! Clinical repair about two weeks ago so that I could review it. I recived this complementary in exchange for my honest review. I used it every morning and evening along with my normal skincare products and in place of my normal moisturizer. I really like that it is truely unscented. Some products claim to be but have a slight scent sometimes. The texture is very nice also. It is light but not gel like and smooths into skin very easily. I donâ€™t think that two weeks is long enough to determine if the product works to correct wrinkled as it claims but during the two weeks I did feel that my skin was moisturized and feeling great. I would love to try the full size and continue to use and I would 100% recommend this product. Great moisturizer!! nan
