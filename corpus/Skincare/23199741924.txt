My go to sunscreen during my pregnancy! It doesn’t clog my pores and I haven’t broken out once with this product-even with my sensitive pregnancy skin. Also it’s one of the only mineral sunscreens that don’t make me look like your neighborhood friendly ghost. 10/10 would recommend for my fellow Carmel gals. Yay for no cast!
