I’ve been using this product for the last month during my night time routine. I started to notice result after the second week, my skin was glowing and the texture was smoother than before. Overall I’m really pleased with the peels performance and results. I would definitely recommend to anyone who has had issues with irritation from peels before, as this one is very gentle, yet effective if you’re consistent. Great peel for sensitive skin
