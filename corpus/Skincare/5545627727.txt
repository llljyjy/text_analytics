I love the slight glow this lotion gives me! Wore it out on a walk today under some tinted moisturizer and was very happy with the texture and feel. It has a slight scent but not one that I mind. I was a little concerned by the tan color (darker than my skin) but it blended into my skin really well.  Complimentary from Cay Skin. nan
