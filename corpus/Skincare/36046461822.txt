I love that this product does more than hydration! its very comforting and soothing for my skin!  Pros-lightweight, non-tacky on the skin (despite the hot weather) -absorbs quick and doesnt feel heavy on my skin -Silky finish after it sets in -Hydration that lasts long-Soothing and comforting for my skin which helped a lot when I over exfoliated!-lux packaging too!  Cons -30ml clearly isnt enough! I need MORE-a bit pricey but def worth it Tackles dryness and soothes skin!
