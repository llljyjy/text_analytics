I’m really glad I didn’t read the mixed reviews before buying. I LOVE this cleanser!!! I don’t notice a bad smell at all, just smells like a cleanser to me. What I love about it is the tingle. I will usually put it on with no water, so it’s nice and thick, then I leave it on for a minute like a mini AHA & BHA facial. Then lather it with water and rinse. My face feels SO clean and not too dry. I have noticed a reduction in a big acne cluster on my chin and some fading of my scars. Love it so much. Try for yourself, it's GREAT!
