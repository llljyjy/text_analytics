The only product I’ve ever bought a second jar as a gift while still using it. I have extreme combination skin with my t-zone being so oily I have to wipe it down before I go on Zoom meetings or the glare would blind people. At the same time, my cheeks are rough and dry and feel scaley. This is the first cream that felt like it was fully moisturizing me without leaving me as an oil slick. When I opened the jar it felt completely lux and the scent is that perfect blend of rose without it being overpowering. The cream glides on without a greasy feeling and is soaked in quickly leaving it feeling soft and dewy.The first two weeks it was all topical, my skin did feel softer after application but that was about it, now the 3rd week is when I noticed some of the uneven tones and hyperpigmentation soften. They were still there, but they seemed to be less and I need to use less foundation to cover it.The fourth week in is when I noticed the fine fine lines under my eyes starting to look fuller and less deep. My MIL asked me if I was getting more sleep. That’s when I fell in love with this cream, she’s not one to give out compliments so it was a big deal for her. I ended up buying her a jar and I hope she loves it as much as I do. Foundational Cream that does what it says.
