I was experiencing dry, red, flakey patches on my face and I had no clue what it was from. I assumed it was from a face product but turns out, my sensitive skin wasn’t handling the winter months very well. I decided to add this to my skincare routine. I personally use it after cleansing and before moisturizer/sunscreen. It cleared up the patches in just a few days and they never came back! I am so thankful for this oil because it saved my skin. I only use a small amount in the AM, not even a full pump. I try to get about 1-2 drops out and pat/press into my face. At night I use half of a pump on my face and I wake up with hydrated and supple skin. I haven’t tried it on other parts of my body or hair and I don’t know how it’ll work in the summer months but I’m sure it’ll still be great. I noticed a lot of people said they use it as the last step in the skincare routine. Maybe it’s all personal preference but I’ll have to try that and see if it makes a difference. Saved my skin
