#freeproductI love this reformulated version! I think the option of being able to use it as a daily nighttime moisturizer instead of a weekly mask that needs a morning rinse is a big advantage over the older version. It’s been a while since I used the old formula so I can’t speak on the difference in effectiveness but it’s worth noting I didn’t have any negative side effects with the addition of the new ingredients. I have combination skin which dries out easily in winter and I have been using it as a daily nighttime moisturizer for over three weeks now. Much like the older version it has a smooth texture and absorbs quickly without leaving any stickiness or residue. I also tried it for a week as a mask applied on top of different face creams, serums and oils. It seemed to work well in all combinations but I saw the most improvement with daily use as a moisturizer. Loving the new formula!
