Got this after rave reviews. Disappointing. I have normal to dry skin. I had to use three times the amount recommend to even have my skin moisturized and after that skin still felt dry. I used a Caudalie serum underneath and it did not moisturize. I tried using this when my face was not yet fully dry and it didnâ€™t work either. Caused acne to appear on my chin. Stopped using immediately. Disappointing and caused slight breakout
