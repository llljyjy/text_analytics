I’m a long time user of the midnight recovery oil so when this came out, I wanted to try it. I was NOT disappointed! I have combo skin and this is the perfect amount of moisture for my skin. I’m very surprised at how quickly it absorbed into my skin even though the texture is pretty thick. But I like that it absorbs and doesn’t just sit on top of my skin. This is perfect for my nighttime routine! nan
