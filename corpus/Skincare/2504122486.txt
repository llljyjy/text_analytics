I was very underwhelmed with this. I found it really difficult to get eye makeup off and I was left with a sizeable amount of makeup left on my face. I was having to double cleanse with oil and then twice again with my cleaner to get my face fully clean. This also meant that I went through the product quickly so I didn’t find it worth my money. Also, the packaging was terrible, the pump didn’t work smoothly on mine so it was hard to measure out partial pumps. not really for heavy makeup removal
