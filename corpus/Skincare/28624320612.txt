The pads are larger than others I’ve used in thee past making it feel like they are targeting a greater area. I have really dark circles and I wouldn’t necessarily say they helped them but they definitely hydrated my eye area and woke up the skin. I wore these before applying make up for a night out and my under eye concealer looked AMAZING after this. Definitely recommend! But more for a quick fix for a night out not for a long term fix to dark circles. Love them!
