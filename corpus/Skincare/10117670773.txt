This moisturizer is ok in my opinion, it’s pretty thick in the container & doesn’t glide as smoothly as I’d prefer, I think it’s more suitable for dry skin, it has a slight smell, my face looks pretty moisturized after I used it, I’d recommend if you want to try it but I’d say get a sample first. Ok
