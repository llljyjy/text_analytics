I love the idea of this product and was excited to try it. There’s no fragrance, which was unclear from other reviews. I have very fair skin and I use a lot of skincare products that give me a glow, including my SPF. This product was undetectable on my skin, but not in a good way. I tried it as a primer and as a highlighter. It didn’t show up at all. Maybe it works as a highlighter on darker skin tones? I prefer Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Filter and Auric’s Glowlust, and those both come in many shades. Doesn't do anything
