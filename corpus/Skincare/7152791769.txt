This product has a bit of a learning curve, but it is perfect for no makeup days. Dot it all over your face and pat (not rub) in. Sometimes I apply a second layer over problem areas and blend with a sponge. If you have larger pores it can settle in them, so a primer is recommended. It also can cling to dry patches so use sparingly. It’s not a replacement for traditional sunscreen, but again it is a great color corrector! I would give it a 5/5 but it unfortunately doesn’t agree with my skin and causes breakouts when I use it consistently. A finicky product but works well!
