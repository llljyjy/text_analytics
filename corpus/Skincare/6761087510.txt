I received a sample as a #freeproduct from Topbox Circle. I used this serum in the evening and found it absorbed into my skin fast and don’t leave a sticky residue like some serums can. It didn’t have a strong scent and was easy to apply. I would be interested in trying this serum again to see if it makes a difference in the wrinkles I have. I am new to serums and have only tried a few so far Fast absorbing serum
