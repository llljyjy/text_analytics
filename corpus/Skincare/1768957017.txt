I recently started using prescription strength Azeliac Acid which has left my skin drier than usual. I opted for a gel moisturizer because a cream didnâ€™t layer well with the Azelaic Acid. This moisturizer does a good job combating the dryness for me! It looks like a gel in the jar, but moisturizers like a gel-cream hybrid which is perfect for me. It layers well with other products and feels nice on the skin. Overall I recommend this for anyone who is combo/lightly dry skin. Great Gel Moisturizer
