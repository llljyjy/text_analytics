Thanks to Influenster and Shiseido for this deluxe sample. I was really surprised that this worked out for me. I figured it would give me the dreadedwhite cast as the other sunscreen did. I waspleasantly surprised. Not only did it sink inflawlessly, it also left me with a bit of a glowwhich was so nice and unexpected. I really likedthis. This will be nice to wear in those makeupfree days outside but still wanting a pretty glow. Not bad for dark skin
