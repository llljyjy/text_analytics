The Sephora EnzKom Targeted Dark Spot Serum is a must-have. Since I’ve become a mom I’ve had issues with hyperpigmentation along my neck and chin and I’ve yet to find a solution until now. When selecting a product for my skin I like to use clean or vegan products whenever possible and this one checks both of those boxes all while being affordable. It’s not an overnight miracle product, but I did see a reduction in the intensity of my dark spots over time. It works, just give it time
