This is an excellent moisturizer. I have sensitive, aging, reactive skin, and overall, Iâ€™ve used this for about ten months with no real complaints. I live in an arid climate, so I wish it were more hydrating (hence the four stars). I would recommend anyone who has acne-prone skin to try it. My go to moisurizer
