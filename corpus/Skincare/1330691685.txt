I rotate this cleanser in my morning and nighttime routines. It always leaves my face feeling clean without any stripping. The cleanser is tropical-scented, comes out as a light and creamy gel, and turns into a frothy lather when activated on damp skin - I can feel and see it working. A little bit goes a long way. The squeeze tube packaging feels like an extra step in my routine. Itâ€™s a gentle cleanser.
