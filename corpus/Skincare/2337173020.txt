I was hesitant to purchase as it’s pretty pricey but I am so glad I did! I love this! It’s so easy to quick and easy and o apply it was an easy addition to my skin care. I’m 51 and have sensitive skin with large pores and dark spots. I notice my texture is so improved, my pores have shrunk, and my dark spots have improved. I have to attribute this to Essence as that’s been my only skin care change so I really believe it’s helped my other products work better! I plan on never going without this product ever again! Tried It and Loved It!!!
