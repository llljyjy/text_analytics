I initially got one for myself 6 or 7 years ago but like some other reviewers I also can’t stand the smell. I really love the smell just don’t like any scent on my facial skin. My husband picked it up and ended up using it up and asked for more. And more. He is on his 4th bottle I think. He recently put it on my 6 yo’s mild sunburn on her cheeks it helped quite a lot. I am very impressed. Definitely recommend trying a sample first though. Husband and kids approved
