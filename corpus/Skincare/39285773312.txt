this is my fifth or sixth bottle and one of my essentials. i wear it on top of my regular lotion spf and it helps me remember to reapply before i go out (i keep a bottle by the front door). i’ve tried all the scents and love them all. i have a shaved head and also use this to protect my scalp. leaves a dewy finish, not greasy or sticky. highly recommend—especially if you struggle to reapply throughout the day or are just looking for an extra layer of protection. as long as you like the fragrance, it will make spf a truly enjoyable (and easy!) part of your routine.
