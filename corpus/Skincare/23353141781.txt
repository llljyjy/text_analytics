AB is the only skincare I will use on my face. If the price scares you, the ingredients in other skincare brands should scare you more. First, AB uses ECOCERT/COSMOS certified glass. The fact is that even the purest skincare products can fall victim to chemicals leached from plastic containers, meaning that not only the skincare product, but harmful chemicals such as Biphisenol A are applied directly to the skin. I’ll gladly pay more for glass. Second, AB uses safe and clean ingredients. Go ahead and download the Yuka app, pay the $8/year so you can search for products, then search for this serum. It rated 100/100 and is excellent quality. Then search for the serum you’re currently using, see where it stands next to this one. The sad thing is not even all “clean” brands rank 100/100. And a lot of high end brands, such as La Mer, rank 0/100 and contain hazardous ingredients. The bottom line, with consistent use you will reap the benefits of using AB products. Excellent Serum
