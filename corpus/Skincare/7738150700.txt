This product is absolutely incredible.  Paula’s Choice kills it with their products.  My favorite part of Paula’s Choice is the amount of antioxidants they pack into their formulations, and this product is no exception.  Antioxidants in this product include bakuchiol, burdock root, THD ascorbate (vitamin C derivative), vitamin E, plant source of resveratrol, oat kernel extract, and hesperidia methyl chalcone (UV-protective ingredient).  I also love that this product contains a strong percentage of bakuchiol- I don’t think bakuchiol is a retinol replacement but I think it’s a fantastic antioxidant and supplement to retinol for collagen support (it’s also an antioxidant).This product is packed with antioxidants and soothing ingredients like licorice root, willow bark, oats, and allantoin.  I will say this product does sting sometimes if your skin is sensitive.  Also, they recommend applying 1-2 pumps and that is such a tiny amount that it makes this product difficult to spread since it’s quite thick.  It’s like a thick lotion consistency.  So sometimes I add a tiny spritz of thermal spring water to make it a little more fluid. A staple retinol in my routine
