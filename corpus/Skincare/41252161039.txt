I really love this cleanser. Leaves my skin feeling super clean but not stripped. I apply 1 pump am/pm but it lathers so well I could probably use 1/2 pump with the same results. My skin is combo and this cleanser eliminated my oily T zone and has minimized my pores. Iâ€™ve been using it about a month now. I love that they make a refill! Has become a staple in my routine...
