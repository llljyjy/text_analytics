After using this product for a week I can confidently say that I would recommend it to friends and family. They weren’t kidding when they named it “Instant Glow Serum“ because it does just that! The “slick“ on this product is very interesting to me. It feels like a hybrid between an oil and a serum, probably why they say you could use it before moisturizer, like a serum or after moisturizer, like an oil. I love it. It feels great on my skin and absorbs incredibly well. So happy that Merit has joined the skincare game!! Merit skincare = no brainer!!!
