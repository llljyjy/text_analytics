I have been using this serum faithfully for the past 4 months and am so disappointed in the results,  or should I say lack of results. I have taken pictures weekly and honestly there is no visible difference. The ingredients are listed but you cannot find the retinol strength anywhere. My opinion is its extremely low. So, is it worth the hefty price? Definitely not!! Worth the price?
