I really like this stuff.  It does a great job breaking up makeup and sunscreen, etc… if you follow it up with a gentle regular cleanser it’s awesome for a double cleanse.  It’s a cleanser, people!  for removing stuff that other cleansers alone don’t work on.  Follow it up with a regular cleanser to remove all residue. This stuff is the balm (pun intended) #dblcleanse
