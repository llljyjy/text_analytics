I appreciate the pump format, which I feel all creams and serums should use these days. It makes application convenient and sanitary. The cream itself is a somewhat thick texture, but spreadable on the skin. It absorbs pretty quickly, and I would say it is a medium-weight cream. I prefer to use it at night, as it can feel a little too moisturizing on my combination skin for the daytime (as I use a heavy layer of sunscreen which already provides moisture). However, if I give it enough time to soak in, then I can layer my sunscreen on top-- though this will depend on if I’m in a rush. Overall, the cream itself I do find non-irritating to my sometimes easily irritated/acne prone skin. This has not caused breakouts and I feel my skin does look less red in the morning when I’ve used this at night. Overall a good cream, but does not replace my current night nor day cream. I think the product is priced too high-- making it something I would not repurchase-- perhaps if it was at half the price. Soothing and hydrating
