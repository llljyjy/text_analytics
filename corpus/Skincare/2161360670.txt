I love the smell, i love the packaging, but the pilling.. God the PILLING!! I honestly wanted to give it 2 stars but I’m waiting to see if the benefits really make up for the pilling. I have to really work it in my skin to get rid of it, but i look at my hands and all the pilling ends up there. Kind of makes me think like I’m removing product and not really benefiting from the ingredients. Thankfully it doesn’t pill through my makeup, another reason why i gave it a third star. I’m going to finish the bottle, but i won’t repurchase. The Paula’s choice spf is WAY better. You just slap it on and no cast, no pilling, doesn’t feel greasy, you won’t ever have to worry about it if you’re a girl in the go. Hope this helps. It’s the pilling for me..
