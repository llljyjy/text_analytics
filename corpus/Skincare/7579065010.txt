To preface: I wear sunscreen every day, and have done so for a few years now. My preference is chemical sunscreens, and my HG is Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence.I was sent this sunscreen for free, in exchange for an honest review.The packaging is nice: a squeeze tube, with a pump, and then a cap that can cover the pump. The only issue I can see with this is that it’s not suitable for travel, as the cap doesn’t click securely and can pop off easily. The product itself felt nicely moisturizing and went on opaque white, that sheered out as you rubbed it in, and then became sheer/clear. I didn’t notice much of a white tint (or any at all, after a few minutes). The finish was a satin-glow, that leaned more towards satin. It stayed on nicely through my day, and required a double cleanse to fully remove - which is great in a sunscreen, staying power is awesome. It wasn’t greasy at all, but really did apply like a lotion, which I enjoy very much.The major issue I have with this is that it smells of mineral/zinc sunscreen, which I can’t handle. It doesn’t smell strongly, but the scent is noticeable to me so it’s unlikely that I would wear this often. Maybe for beach days when I need a mineral product that’ll stay on for hours, through swim and sun and play. Nice mineral option; just not for me
