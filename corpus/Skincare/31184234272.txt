I really like the smell of this product. It is smooth and glides on the skin. I did start to see a change after using the product for about 3 weeks. The change was for the better. The lines in my face have slowly started to thin out a bit. I can tell with continual use that they will keep improving. The bottle is not to heavy and I think itâ€™s really pretty. Overall I really like the product. Lancome has a winner
