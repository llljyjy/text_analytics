I donâ€™t expect my face wash to solve all my skin problems, just look for skin wash that cleans my face without stripping. But this cleanser blew my mind, been using it for a year, not planning to ever change my cleanser again. I use light foundation and makeup most days, it cleans all up, leaving my face soft and smooth. Very comfortable to use. Love the texture. My search is over. This is the best face cleanser I have ever used. For me it cannot get better than this. best cleanser for face
