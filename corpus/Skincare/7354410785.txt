i liked this moisturizer a lot, and how it contains hyaluronic acid, poly glutamic acid, and lactic acid :) the bottle was great to use as you just need to push the top to get the product out. i’m usually fine with little/no smell products but this one doesn’t smell the best.. this gel went into my skin nicely. i do have to use a bit more as it absorbs quickly but my skin feels very plump after using it! nan
