Very easy to blend into your skin. Consistency is more on the runnier side. Kinda reminds me of body sunscreen a bit. There’s a slight scent that I don’t like, but it’s light enough that it doesn’t bother me. Only downside for me personally is that it was a bit hard to blend my concealer after because it made it separate. nan
