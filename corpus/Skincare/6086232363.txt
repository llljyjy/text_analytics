You only need a small amount of product to produce a rich, foamy lather. I used this with my Foreo Luna Mini 3 facial cleansing brush. The scent of this cleanser is strong and powdery/floral, which personally doesn’t bother me but I also don’t think it’s the most pleasant scent.  While my skin felt clean after use, it also felt like it had been stripped of all moisture and was tight and dry. nan
