I was actually very excited to receive this ice cream. I really like the little container it comes in and it’s one of my favorite colors purple of course. Since I have been experiencing some puffy eye issues this was the perfect item to come to be reviewed. I decided to start they night I received this cream and I have been using every night as it stated in the directions. The cream went on nicely as once it was there and blend it in well with the skin no residue no stickiness. Around the eyes can be very sensitive so I was happy that there wasn’t any irritation or strong smell to the cream either. I think this cream did a good job making the area around and especially underneath the eyes balance with the rest of my face. This is a cream I would consider for purchase. Nice Cream
