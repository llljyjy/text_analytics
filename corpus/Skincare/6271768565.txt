I’m so bummed. I really wanted this to work, but after two bottles and 4 months, I haven’t seen the slightest change.  I still have hyperpigmentation (and lots of it), both sunspots and from acne.Two stars because the I like the formula - it’s not sticky, it plays nice with my moisturizer and makeup, and it smells good, but that’s about it. I won’t be dropping any more money on something that isn’t doing what it claims in the label.(Pic on the left was taken 12/10/21, pic on the right taken 4/16/22) Doesn’t work for me
