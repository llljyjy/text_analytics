I had high hopes of this product based on reviews. It felt nice upon application, but the finished result was barely and I mean barely noticeable, was splotchy and patchy and my face felt extremely oily all day. I will be returning. Just not what I expected. Using my self tanning foam on my face with a kabuki brush is much more effective and Iâ€™ll stick with that. Not what I expected, not worth the hype.
