I normally use the Peter Thomas Roth vitamin C serum which is my holy grail. I thought I would see if this was as good as…or better with benefits of saving $20 and this being clean. To compare the two…this isn’t as moisturizing so maybe it’s better in the Summer. It doesn’t provide the “glow” like the PTR. I agree with others that it doesn’t absorb as well and changes the look of my foundation. I tried mixing it with the DE peptide cream and that seemed to help. It didn’t irritate my skin which is good. I don’t know if it compares to the skin ceauticals but the PTR is superior in my opinion. I will only use this when I’m feeling oily on no makeup days. undecided
