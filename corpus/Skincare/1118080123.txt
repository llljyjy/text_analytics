I needed a new night-time eye cream and bought this on impulse because of the hype around this brand and the aesthetically pleasing packaging. It says it’s suitable for AM or PM application, but I was caught off guard by the gold sparkles it left on my skin. Glitter is not something I want on my face for a night-time routine, so I can’t speak on the effectiveness of the product as I only used it once before deciding it’s not for me. I’m sure it works fine as a daytime cream but unfortunately, that’s not what I’m looking for. I’m bummed to have to return, but I can’t justify keeping it just for display on my skincare shelf.
