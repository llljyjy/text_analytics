I’ve only been using this product for a couple of days now so I’m not sure how great of a review this will be, but it says it’s for sensitive skin which I know for a fact is true. I also had my husband try it. He has very sensitive skin all of my skin care products burn on him this one, however, was very calming. We can tell that it does even out your skin tone when using the jar of cream it does moisturize however, we don’t have super red skin. We’re using this mostly for color. Correction, I will keep you posted. Very mild and great for sensitive skin
