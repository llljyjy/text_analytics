My skin: acne-prone (hormonal and clogged pores - dirt & oil builds up very easily); daily tretinoin user; redness prone; freckle-prone; no fragrance sensitivity generallyI love this sunscreen. This is the one for me that has finally got me using sunscreen every day.Recently wore it out in the sun for hours on a double-decker bus tour and I was the only one in my group who didn’t burn as the rest just used spray sunscreens with poor coverage.Pros: blends in to skin and spreads so easily - texture is like water; scent is very subtle and relaxing - not like sunscreen at all!; gives skin a really nice glowy look and smooth texture; plays nice with other skincare, doesn’t pill up over other serums/moisturizers;Cons: none for me personally - but you may not like this if you have super oily skin or are sensitive to any fragrance at all; price is a small con but  I will be stocking up at future VIB sales! New holy grail sunscreen for dry acne-prone skin!
