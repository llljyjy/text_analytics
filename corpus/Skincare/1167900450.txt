I bought this from Sephora last year. I literally thought it was a room spray. After 2 pumps into the air in my room it immediately calms me. The scent stays in my sheets for a few hours. Take heed tho.. it is a woodsy almost masculine scent even. I’m haven’t worn it on my skin as a personal scent yet but I may try. I would give 5 starts if it had a crispier finish. My husband and kids actually like  this scent too I would recommend this fragrance. interesting blend but pleasantly surprised
