*i received this product free for review from influenster and charlotte tilbury*i’ve been using this for a little over a month now and i’ve really been enjoying it. i’m not new to retinol and it doesn’t bother my skin too much, but my under eye area is pretty sensitive to it. i started using this every other night, then moved to every night, and i never experienced any stinging or bumps like i have with other retinol products. i have slight dark circles under my eyes and a few deep lines. i noticed that after a week or so, my eyes looked brighter in the morning. i have yet to see a noticeable difference in the lines under my eyes, but with a low amount of retinol and only a month of use, that’s to be expected. i’m excited to see what kind of results i get after using the whole jar. i love that it’s refillable and the amount you get will last you quite a while. the only issue i have is that the directions aren’t quite clear. if someone isn’t obsessed with skincare, i doubt they’ll know that retinol products should be used at night and to use an spf bc retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. but overall, i’ve really been enjoying using this and how fancy it makes me feel. boujee and effective
