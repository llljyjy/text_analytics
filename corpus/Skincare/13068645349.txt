I’m about 1/2 way through this tube. I’m not impressed. Was trying to avoid paying to get a couple dark spots removed and applying this daily. Some smaller spots have faded but a large spot next to my eye remains, bold & unchanged. So if you have little cute freckles you want to fade, maybe that’s what this is for. But if you have anything larger, even at the top dollar price tag, it’s not going to help. Shoulda saved the money and did the laser therapy I’m going to have to do anyway. Expected more for the price
