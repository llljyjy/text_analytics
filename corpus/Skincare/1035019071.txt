This is my official fall/winter sunscreen. I haven’t had the chance to try it in warm weather yet, as I bought it in October. Let me explain my I’m loving it right now, though. I use two Rx products to control adult acne, so I experience surface dryness and flaking that comes and goes. It gets worse in the winter, and sunscreens usually make it more visible. Not this one though! This stuff is moisturizing, and slightly glowy on my fair skin, though that dissipates as it dries down after application. There’s no stinging or irritation, even when my skin is a little raw, I have found it very soothing. It hasn’t clogged my pores, and there’s no white cast. It almost seems too good to be true, since it’s clean on top of everything else. I tried the version that has more tint/coverage, but it was too visible on flaky patches. So, I repurchased this one. If you have difficult skin, I recommend giving it a try. Adult Acne Friendly
