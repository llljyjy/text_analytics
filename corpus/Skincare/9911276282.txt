I don’t know why folks are giving this a hard time . It works and it’s cheap. Oh it’s gritty ? Big deal sometimes I like it rough. It didn’t irritate my skin but that’s probably because I use retinol already. My skin is though I guess . But im gonna keep this in my routine . Great results for a cheap product . It’s great if you don’t have sensitive skin
