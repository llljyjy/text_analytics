Used in conjunction with the #PTREvensmoother serum my skin has seen improvement with brightness, texture and clarity.

If you have sensitive skin the resurfacing pads are gentle enough to use in an alternating manner with the serum. I received this product complimentary  from Influenster for my honest review.
