This moisturizer has been salvation for my skin during the winter months.  A little goes a long way and a heavy hand can lead to your face looking and feeling greasy.  I donâ€™t know why someone states that this pills, it most certainly does not.  I use this during the day and then Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair at night.  I will never be without this. Must Have during Winter Months!
