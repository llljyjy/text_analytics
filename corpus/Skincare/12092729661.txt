I received this for free from Bzzagent in exchange for a review. I love the texture of the product, and the results leave my skin smooth feeling as long as I moisturize. With a name like cookies and cream I would have thought thereâ€™d be a nice scent but I smell nothing. I wish it was a leave-on or overnight mask, I almost never use wash-off masks. Not too shabby
