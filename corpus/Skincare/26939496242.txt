I went to Sephora bc I had hooked up with a crusty dusty League of Legends player and my skin broke out really bad. The skincare assistant I spoke with recommended this to me to help with my angry broken out skin, and she told me to forgive myself LOL. Anyway this product is great and I always look forward to using it. Will Forgive You For Your Sins
