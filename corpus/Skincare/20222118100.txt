I really love this product! I have been using it AM + PM for about 2 or 3 months and I do feel like it has reduced my acne scarring. Mind you, I can still see my acne scars so it didn’t completely take them away as some people claim it did for them! I think it depends on how old/new your scars are- mine are pretty bad. From the photos, you can see I have some pretty deep, old scarring. So it will take some time to see results. You have to be patient with it! The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because of the amount for the price. The bottle is very misleading as you think you are getting maybe 30mls of product, while in fact you are only getting 15mls. While the product does work, you get about 3 months worth of product and then have to scrap the sides to get the last bit of product. In my opinion, it’s a steep price for the amount, but I do recommend it if you can afford it! Great step to add in the skincare routine if you have acne scarring. Effective but expensive for amount in bottle
