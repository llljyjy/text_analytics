I liked that this product smells much better than any other self tanning lotions, but I ran into the same problem as I do with other brands. The orange streak on my feet, knees and elbows.  I noticed it does improve after showering a couple times so maybe accessorize with a tanning glove to apply. If you are going to get a gradual tanning lotion, this is the brand you need.  Especially because it doesnâ€™t have a funk! Smells nice
