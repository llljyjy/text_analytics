I liked this sunscreen because it is lightweight and smooth. I find that this goes perfectly under makeup unless you do not wash your face before hand. There was one day that I did not wipe my face with the micellar water and after I put on this sunscreen it pilled up on my skin.This sunscreen when first applied also leaves a white cast. I did not notice it once I had applied the rest of my makeup but I am not sure how this would work on people with darker skin than me. I have light-medium right now in the summer.
