If you looked at my skincare lineup you would see majority FAB products and this is definitely added to my lineup of them. This sunscreen works great with my eczema prone skin, doesn’t make me itch or cause rashes like other sunscreens do. FAB products truly do uphold their “for sensitive skin” quote. This product does have 2 major downsides and for me that’s the smell which does disappear and it does leave a slight white cast on darker skin as it claims it does not. You REALLY have to rub/blend this stuff in to get rid of the white cast and even then there’s still a white cast around like in my hair edges and on my forehead. This is something they definitely need to work on. Overall because it works with my eczema after many tries of looking for a sunscreen that does I will be keeping this on my roster. Works with Eczema!
