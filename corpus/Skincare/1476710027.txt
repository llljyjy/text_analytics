I got this product for free from Influenster and Sephora. It was a very small sample size, so I can’t speak to the results as I don’t feel I had enough of the sample to see any. I will saw that the product is very creamy and left my skin feeling super soft. It has a light scent but nothing overwhelming. I feel like it would have great results if used long term, but I didn’t see any due to the size of the sample. Lovely Product
