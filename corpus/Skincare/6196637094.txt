It seems that most of these reviews were from free products. I actually bought this and I think it’s just ok. It’s non-irritating and decently hydrating with a slight fragrance; it works about as well as most other hydrating masks of this price range. One huge issue that prevents me from buying this again is that a bit of mold/mildew seemed to start growing on the wooden cap when I was about halfway through the bottle. It’s probably not a huge problem if your products are kept mostly dry, but my wash-off mask bottles can often get wet during my routine. The wooden cap looks cute but it’s not super practical. I do have another Caudalie mask with the same cap and it’s completely fine, so it might be a rare occurrence. Decent but mold can grow on cap!
