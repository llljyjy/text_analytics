This cleanser has become a daily staple for my sensitive/combo skin from being so dry. First I use Laneige’s Vitamin Brightening Cleansing miceller Water before cleansing a 2nd time with the Milk Oil Cleanser. I add two pumps to damp hands, then emulsify in palms before massaging on my makeup free, dry face. Along with Sephora’s grey teardrop silicone cleansing tool to thoroughly cleanse my face and neck. Skin texture improved + pores look nonexistent
