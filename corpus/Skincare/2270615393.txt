this sunscreen is next level … gives you that perfect dewy look without being greasy, excellent UVA protection, awesome ingredients — it checks all the boxes! however, the packaging is god awful. i’ve had this for around a month and it already looks like this!! ridiculous for a $60 sunscreen to have such poor quality packaging amazing sunscreen, horrible packaging
