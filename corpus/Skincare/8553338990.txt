Absolutely love this mask. I have combo skin (mostly sensitive and dry) and I get occasional acne that is hard to treat because my skin is pretty dry already. This mask is great! It does exactly what it says it will, and it doesn’t overly irritate my sensitive skin. I’ve noticed a great difference in the texture and dullness of my face already, and I’ve only been using once a week for a few weeks. If you have very sensitive skin, be careful! Always spot test first, of course. nan
