I received ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 mineral Sunscreen from Pinchme in exchange for my unbiased opinion; with that being said, I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it. If you don’t read instructions, but read reviews, do make sure you shake the bottle before every use, it’s supposed to have powder inside that must fused with the liquid to give that dewy coverage. I loved the packaging, it’s so sleek but really nice and the pump corresponds with the shade you have. I use it with no makeup on top because I just want light coverage to protect and make my skin pop and this does the job. If your pocketbook can handle that $60 price tag, definitely give it a try. Beautiful packaging
