44 year old male, normal skin, new to skincare.  I deal with mild signs of aging.  I bought a bunch of ordinary products over the past few months and have been slowly working out a routine that is best for me.  One thing I know for sure is that this needs to be at the centre of the routine!  It is amazing.  Of all the skincare products I have used, this is the best.  My face looks and feels younger.  It glows.  I used to joke to my wife that my skin was better than hers despite me only using Irish Spring.  Now my skin is even better.  I have thought about dabbling in something a bit more luxury but I am worried I would be paying for hype.  This works great. The Highlight of My Routine
