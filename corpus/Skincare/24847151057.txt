After using this Lancôme night crème for few weeks now, I can definitely see changes on my face. It’s texture is not too runny but melts in skin in just secs. The good point is it doesn’t leave greasy feeling. It hydrate the skin and looks plump n radiant in morning. Not sure about fine lines and wrinkles, as it may take lil longer time just like any other luxury crème. But as of now I love the feeling of freshness in morning on my face. It’s fragrance is also awesome, very light n classy. Although it’s lil expensive but I think it’s worth. Overall I definitely look forward to this crème and will recommend everyone to give it a try. Really loved it! My new favorite
