Excellent cleanser with terrible pump. I’m using it as a normal facial cleanser, not for makeup. You only need a little, it foams perfect, smells great and your skin won’t feel dry afterwards. The only con is the pump.When dispensing pump hits back, it will drip too many cleanser out of the bottle. The liquid will become jelly soon after. It’s a waste. Excellent cleanser with terrible pump
