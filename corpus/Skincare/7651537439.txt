Eczema. Dry and irritated skin around eyes. This oil is amazing for eczema. Used more expensive creams, lotions, even doctor and dermatologist recommended. Nothing brought moisture and relief back as much as this. A flare up can be taken down to zero (or near zero) overnight. A little goes a long way. I add a bit on a q-tip for better control. Seal it with a thin layer of Vaseline and you are all set. I wish I would have found this earlier, this is gentle and gave me better results than anything else. As winter approaches I find myself oiling my face to protect it for my morning outside exercise, before gentle cleansing. To wash eyelids I would recommend J&J no tears baby shampoo (the original yellow bottle). This was recommended by other eyelid eczema sufferers as well as my doctor and dermatologist. VERY little goes a long way, and does not irritate my eyes. Lather in fingertips and gently wash. Eczema relief
