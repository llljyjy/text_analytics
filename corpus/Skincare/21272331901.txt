I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. A little bit goes a long way and even a small amount made my skinnier super soft. It absorbed nicely into the skin and wasnâ€™t greasy at all. The scent was nice and light, not overpowering at all. My skin was definitely more hydrated! Super Smooth Skin
