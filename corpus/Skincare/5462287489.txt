As someone who wears SPF and a full face of make up daily, having a good make up removing balm is very important to me in my skin care routine. I’ve been using the Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing balm for 4 years and have been afraid to stray away, yet I was always hoping for a cheaper alternative. At Sephora, one of the ladies recommended this to me and said it was very close to the Farmacy one. I took the plunge and am so glad I tried it!-The formula is slightly thicker than the Farmacy one, but it still spreads easily on the face once you rub it in. It rinses clean with just water and does not leave any residue. (I always do a double cleanse regardless but my face would feel fine even if I did skip it.) It removed all of my SPF, foundation, eyeliner, and eyebrows just as effectively as the Farmacy one!I have been using it for two weeks and haven’t broken out either which is a great sign. I will buying this one in the future instead of the Farmacy one and my wallet will be so much happier. As good as the Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm!
