have combination,scared,discoloration and aging skin.The moisturizing cream I had seemed to make me more oily and make my discoloration appear more.I recently got the IT Cosmetics confidence in a cream and after a month of trying it,I can see a change! My crows feet arenâ€™t so profound and my balance of oily and dry is so much better! I love that it helps and hides away my discoloration and is even helping to get rid of some of my acne scars.I love the size of the jar and how it leaves my skin feeling.Overall an amazing cream I use 2 times a day Amazing
