This cream is lightweight, moisturizes my skin. It has a subtle scent which I love. I wear under makeup during the day under sunscreen and makeup. I also wear it at bed time. It’s been more than two weeks with continuous use and I’m impressed. My skin feels so much softer and looks healthier. I feel like my dark spots look a little lighter. I enjoy this product and I will continue using it in my skincare routine. I love Dr.Dennis Gross products
