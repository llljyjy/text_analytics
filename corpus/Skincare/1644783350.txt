I love this! Exfoliating toners are one of my favorite skincare products and I like to try new ones every time but this one is one of my absolute favorites and one that I’ll actually repurchase! It’s not harsh and it doesn’t leave any sticky residue like their Kombucha one does. It’s really effective at keeping breakouts at bay and keeping my texture smooth. This one and the Farmacy one are the best toners I’ve tried. nan
