Iâ€™ve had a little congested pore (whitehead pimple) underneath the tender area right below my eye. I started to apply this cream for a night or two and seen it finally start to dry up after being there for what seemed like forever. The ingredients are good, and this product is effective. Definitely recommend. And as far as the smell some people complain about, it literally goes away within seconds. nan
