Applied religiously mornings and nights for a month.While the product was slightly effective in reducing the fine lines and crepelike lines around the eyes it didn’t do so drastically. I’m happy with the results and may consider adding to skincare routine. This may not be the holy grail but it works for those that don’t have many or deep fine lines. Pretty effective but not magic
