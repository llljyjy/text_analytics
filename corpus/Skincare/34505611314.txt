I love how I can use this SPF mist over my makeup and just pop it in my bag wherever I go. Smells absolutely fantastic and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Doesn’t irritate my skin at which I have experienced with other SPF mists. I love spraying it on right before I go on my afternoon runs. I highly recommend trying an SPF mist if you haven’t and this one is the best one I have tried yet! nan
