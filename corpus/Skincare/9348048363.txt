I received this multi-use balm complimentary for my honest review.  I have sensitive skin and mild roseaca.  This cream felt so luxurious on my skin.  I applied it all over my face, neck and elbows.  It has a light, creamy and satin texture to it.  Itâ€™s great for sensitive skin and is fragrance free.  I love that this balm is a multi tasker. Luxurious Balm!
