After trying the extra strength tester I decided to buy the full version. When I looked into what the different peel options did for the skin I decided that the universal would work best for me.I love this product, it works really well and is easy to use. I was a little hesitant at first because I donâ€™t like using pads/cloth on my skin, but when I tried this it made my skin feel great. After a long day of wearing makeup and with how clogged my pores feel I use this and my face feels clean and refreshed. I only use 2-3 times a week instead of daily, excessive exfoliation can cause dry skin - I found that this product works really well when paired with a hyaluronic acid serum after, for extra hydration. nan
