My favorite part of this is how easy it is to use. So, I’m very new to self tanning and I wanted something really user friendly and unintimidating- this is it. You apply this just as you would any other lotion and the tone develops over 4-6 hours. Once it’s developed you can add more if there are uneven parts. I applied one layer, did not touch up, and I feel like it looks really nice. A sunless tan! The tone isn’t TOO warm. I really just feel like I look like I’ve been in the sun. Easy to use
