I was a little unsure about this product since it has fragrance in it, and I try to stay away from scented skincare products. However, I like Dior and I trust the ingredients so I gave it a try and I love it! I use it every morning now and it only requires a very very small amount since it foams up and lathers on your skin very generously. The smell is really lovely, very fresh and luxurious. I think the cleanser does a great job of washing away oils/impurities gently while not drying out your skin and that’s really important to me in a morning cleanser. The packaging is interesting, as it’s very wide and thin, which does make it easy to slip into a makeup bag for travel, but I will say it would be nice to see this cleanser in a pump form. Overall I’m very happy with this product and have had no reactions since using it, but it certainly makes my skin feel fresh and clean. I’m not sure I would re-purchase at the price point since I do think there are other cheaper cleansers out there that provide the same results, but since you only need to use a tiny bit at a time, it is probably worth it as it will last quite a long time! nan
