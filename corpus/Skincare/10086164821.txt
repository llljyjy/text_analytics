I’ve only been using this product for a week and I can already tell theres a huge difference. My skin is softer, skin tone looks much better and brighter, and a little goes a long way. You really don’t need more than a dime-size because it’s both a toner and serum, so it’s a bit thicker than regular toner. I am normally picky on anything skincare that I try because my face is in the sensitive dry side but this hasn’t irritated my skin at all which is so important to me! I now plan to incorporate this in myskin care routine! You won’t regret it!
