So, I love the ingredients in this. The combination of retinol with hydrating and soothing ingredients is perfect for those who may be on the fence about trying retinol.I’ve been using this as a part of my nightly routine and didn’t experience any irritation or discomfort. It’s very hydrating, has a light floral scent and absorbs almost instantly. The tube is equipped with a very small nozzle which makes it easy to control how much product you use. This works well for my combo-skin and I love that it can even be used around your eye area. I’m loving it so far. Love it
