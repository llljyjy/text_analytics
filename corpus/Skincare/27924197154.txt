Horrible packaging. It leaks so you’ll end up with no product. I won’t b buying the inky list. I would stick to the ordinary and good molecules for similar products. I didn’t get to see if it works since the product it’s always leaking. I should have read the reviews before buyingapparently a lot of people had the same problem. nan
