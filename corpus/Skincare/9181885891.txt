I recently quit birth control and my skin has been oily and breaking out. I used the ultra repair cream religiously for years but it was too much for my new oily skin. I just washed my face and used this product. I can honestly say my skin in MATTE right after use. It’s so soft and light. I’m used to my skin having a greasy look because I’ve been using moisturizers that are too heavy. This is perfect. If it causes any irritations it’ll be hard for me to tell since I’m already breaking out due to my hormonal levels decreasing. I’ll update if needed First Impressions
