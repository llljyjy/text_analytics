This is a very lightweight but hydrating moisturizer. It makes my face feel clean and moisturized without any greasy or heavy feel.Don’t leave home without this. I like it very much for the summer. I’ve been layering this over my vitamin c and sunscreen, it’s been a great addition to my skincare. I keep coming back to this product. So simple, so effective! Works so good!
