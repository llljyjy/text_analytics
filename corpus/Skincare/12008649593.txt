CHARLOTTE’S MAGIC SERUM CRYSTAL ELIXIR ***Disclaimer I received these products for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.***The Magic Serum claims to “Awaken your skin’s potential with the power of potent ingredients, featuring REPLEXIUM® for younger-looking skin, Golden Vitamin C for a brighter-looking complexion, and hydration powerhouse Polyglutamic Acid – a supercharged skincare ingredient that’s over 4X more hydrating than Hyaluronic Acid.“ The Vitamin C and Polyglutamic Acid in this anti-aging serum help reduce the appearance of dark spots, fine lines, and wrinkles while visibly brightening and plumping your skin for a flawless makeup application.I am so excited that I was able to try this product and really enjoy it! I think this product will be best for those who have dry skin and don’t really have a skincare routine yet. This is a great product to add moisture to your skin and its easy to use.  I personally loved the way my makeup sits on top of this product. It helped everything just bond for a smoother finish. I also enjoyed the scent on this its like a clean scent with a hint of soft florals. Furthermore, I loved that the bottle and dropper are both made of glass. If you have oily skin or already have an attachment to your skincare routine with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide, then you can probably skip this one. Like Magic
