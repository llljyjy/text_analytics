After 1 week of use, the pregnancy acne, bumps, and redness I’ve been struggling with for months are nearly gone. Yesterday my husband said I’ve got the “glow”! I apply two pea-sized amounts all over my face after using a glycolic acid face wash and before an oil-free unscented moisturizer, and have not experienced any pilling or other side effects. My pregnancy acne’s finally gone!
