I love Shiseido’s Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream with SPF20. I have used  Shiseido creams before and I am in love with their products. The day cream gives the perfect hydration and moisture to my skin which makes my skin feel fresh throughout the day. It has SPF 20 which also protects skin from sun damage and i don’t need to apply another layer of sunscreen. It feels so light on my skin/ non greasy yet gives the dewey finish which i like. My skin is a little dry and it gives the perfect amount of hydration my skin needs for. It also helps to reduce pores and fine lines. I will highly recommend this cream.   IIt’s perfect for my skin and its my new go to! Hydrating day cream with SPF
