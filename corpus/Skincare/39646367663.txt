I’ve been using this product consistently for a little over a week now, and I’m very pleased with it. I have combination to somewhat dry skin It is very thick, but it absorbs nicely after I work it in. I also find the smell of it pleasant, but not overpowering, which is surprising due to my sensitivity to certain fragrances. My skin feels smooth and hydrated after using it. Overall I’m very happy with the product. Pleasantly surprised
