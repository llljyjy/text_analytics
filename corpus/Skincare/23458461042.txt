Okay, so when I bought this lip balm it was great. My lips felt moisturized and looked nice. But after a period of time, my lips were drying out. I didn’t know why and was confused, but this was the only new thing that I had bought and was using on my lips. So, BINGO, this was the problem. I stopped using it for a couple of days and my lips feel normal again. I mean I’m going to finish it as I spent $18 on it, but would not purchase it again. Nice... when I first got it
