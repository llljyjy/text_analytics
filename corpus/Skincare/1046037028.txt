Wow. Orange. I am an experienced sunless tanning product user and THIS made me oompah loompah orange. I used the medium and since I have used many “dark” products with no issues, I never thought this would develop into such a warm deep orange. I used quite a bit. It’s orange and streaky and am in the process of trying to exfoliate it away. I was embarrassed at work today. So bad. orange
