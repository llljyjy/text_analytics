This has been a savior for my skin. My mature, sensitive, combo, acne prone skin has faired very well from incorporating yet another fabulous Drunk Elephant product into my routine. I did have to learn the hard way that less is more with this bad girl. But bad girl as in, my pores are less congested, my texture is evening out. My GF complimented me apx 2months after I started this that my skin looked more glowy. I was like, that right there justifies what I spent on this for looking glowy W/OUT wearing bronzer or highlighter! Best plant based retinol ever
