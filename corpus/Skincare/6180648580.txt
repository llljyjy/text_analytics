The first night I used 3 drops and when I woke up the next morning I didn’t notice that much change - three hours after that I looked VERY tan. The next night, I was at a wedding and we all stayed in a hotel - I used 2 drops the night and the following morning everyone at breakfast was like omg how did I not notice that you were this tan yesterday?! I skipped the third night and this Am a colleague was asking if I got a lot of sun this weekend...I have brown hair and in the winter I can be pretty pale but I’m not paper white, so I find it confusing really pale people are saying they only see a subtle change or are using the medium or dark. Maybe it just develops better for some people. Personally I would air on the side of caution and start with a few drops and then build up over a few days. I imagine if I’d put 6+drops I would have been ridiculously tan. The color is great - anyone who mentioned how tan I looked I told them it was a tanning product and they all commented how natural it looks. How I use it:Wash facePixie glow tonicNivea Coq10 Night Cream mixed with 2/3 dropsHonestly one of the best tanning products for the face that I have used (San Trope Best face tanning - but use caution with amount
