I have tried other skincare with similar ingredients and Dr. Zenovia Skincareâ€™s Acne Cleanser  did not stand out among the others, it does work - just as those others do. I was intrigued to give this a try as also contains hydrating ingredients like Aloe. It was NOT as drying as some of the other products I would compare it to, which is why I would give this 4 out of 5 stars. I also loved the packaging and the feel/ texture of the cleanser. I would still recommend this product to anyone facing acne skin issues, as a better alternative to the systems that dry out skin completely. It works
