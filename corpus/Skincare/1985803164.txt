It took at least 3 months of consistently daily use before I saw any results.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did lighten sun spots on my face.  Some of the lighter ones are now almost gone.  My skin did get irritated after a few months of daily use, so I had switched to using it every other evening, alternating it with a vitamin C / retinol serum on the other evenings.  Overall, the results have been good and I continue to see gradual lightening of the spots. It works, just be patient.
