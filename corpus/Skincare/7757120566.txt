I have been trying out this sunscreen for a few days, and I think itâ€™s a pretty good option for a minimal to no white-cast sunscreen. I have fair skin, and was not able to detect a visible white-cast on my skin, though I will say that it does take some time to blend in. I think it wears well under makeup throughout the day, neither too drying nor too greasy. The only negative for me is that this sunscreen is not water resistant. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. nan
