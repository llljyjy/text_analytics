Iâ€™ve been using this as directed. I started off using every other day with small amount without experiencing any irritation or sensitivity. I now use it every day once a day and have not had any issues. My under eyes feel hydrated but have not seen much difference yet, but I will continue to use. Also make sure to let it completely sink into skin before applying makeup over it. Nice but not sure if I need it yet
