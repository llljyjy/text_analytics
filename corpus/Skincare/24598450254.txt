This luxuriously creamy gel actually brightens my eye dark circles! I love how this contains a high amount of bifida ferment lysate The bifida is suppose to repair the skin barrier and decrease sensitivity. This eye cream does have a bit of white petroleum jelly to create that nice gel consistency but it is important to provide an occlusive layer for skin to repair and reduce water loss. nan
