This cream is really nothing special. I would not buy it again. It’s literally like any other lotion.It claims to do all sorts of great things for your skin but I finished a jar with no results. I also know this would definitely not be moisturizing enough for the colder months. I’m not sure what the hype is about, it sort of reminds me of the neutragena hydro boost cream (which is actually better than this one IMO) nan
