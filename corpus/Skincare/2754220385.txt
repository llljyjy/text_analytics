Needed some desperate help for my face. Uneven coloring, super congested with tiny whiteheads my chin, dry, texture. Found this clean product new at Sephora.Fun packaging, good price, love the ingredients!! I purchased 2/9/22, as soon as I got home I immediately used! Applied all over face and neck, serum felt nice and soothing. 2/10 am I did see a difference on my face. 2/11 am huge transformation! My skin feels amazing, addressed my concerns and more! No foundation for the past 2 days.. got on my Sephora app look at all their products!! LOVE Love love!!!
