This is the best serum I have bought in 2022 without a shadow of a doubt. I got a sample from Sephora and after using it for a week, I was sold. It really is a great not only for the overall appearance of the skin but also hyperpigmentation, skin texture, level of hydration and of course fine lines. The price point is great and itâ€™s 100% worth it! It is now one of my staples and I have bought it twice since trying it out. Fave product of 2022
