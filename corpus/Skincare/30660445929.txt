I had never used a chemical exfoliant prior to using this BHA, but all I can say is I LOVE it so much. It helped even out the discoloration on my skin as well as acne scars. This is my second purchase in about a year now. I personally only purchase the travel size because a little goes a long way; I feel that the big bottle would just sit there for a long time. I use it about 3 times a week. ITS CHANGED MY SKIN I SWEAR!! My skin is GLOWING. MAGIC IN A BOTTLE
