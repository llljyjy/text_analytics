This treatment lotion is definitely less of a lotion and more of a serum or toner type of product. The consistency is thin, which helps it not feel super heavy. While it is lightweight, it definitely hydrates the skin well, which is why as someone with oily skin, I’m not the biggest fan of. I think for future use I would only use this as a night time treatment to avoid getting greasy throughout the day. One of the claims is that it minimizes pores but I did not notice any difference with my skin in that regard. This is a nice skin product but it also isn’t anything out of this world that I’m super impressed with. Lightweight and hydrating but not for oily skin
