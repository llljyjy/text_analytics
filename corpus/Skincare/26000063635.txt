I received this essence to try and review from #topboxcircle #freeproduct. The essence has a water like feel and refreshing smell that’s isn’t at all overpowering. I use it after my hydrating mist, by dabbing a few drops on my face. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t at all leave a greasy feel. I follow with my cream and love the results! My skin is hydrated and glowing and not at all oily. I do recommend !! Glowing !
