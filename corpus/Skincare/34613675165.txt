I tried this product as a trial from Peaceout skincare. They sent it to me. I was hesitant at first because my skin usually gets very irritated by almost any new product. I tested a patch first with good results. I did a tril for two weeks and saw good improvement in my skin. I still use it every night, along with some other products. It is smooth, and so convenient to use. I really like that it has no perfume smell. I think it has helped my forehead wrinkles for sure! Thanks peaceout skincare! Retinol face stick
