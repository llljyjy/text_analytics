I‘ve been using the water bank moisture cream for a while now and it changed my skincare routine. It left my otherwise very dry to combo skin feeling amazing. I was nervous about the change to this item since Sephora no longer carries the full size version anymore. I read online this is even better but I disagree. It doesn’t feel as rich or doesn’t let  my skin feel as soft or hydrated. After using it for a few weeks I ordered the original version from the company website. It’s not awful but not as good as the original. Not as good as the original.
