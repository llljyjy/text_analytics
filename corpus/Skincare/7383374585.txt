first off, I use this every single night. it is so sensitive, no scent, and the dreamiest texture. I love it. It has helped my skin truly recover and start healing from my acne scars as well as help reduce the redness to my skin. I recommend this so strongly to anyone who struggle with acne and irritation/redness. ask for a sample if youâ€™re concerned about the price before you buy it. on my second one and I am never looking back! another hit from FRESH :)))) not ad obvs sensitive and redness DREAM SOLUTION
