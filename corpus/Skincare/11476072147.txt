I really wanted to love this, but I don’t. My skin usually loves peptides and ceramide, but I’ve been using this every day for 4 weeks, and haven’t noticed a difference like I do with other moisturizers. It’s a thick consistency, and silky smooth, which is nice. Light scent. Little goes a long way. It’s nice, but doesn’t have that wow factor. It’s also been clogging my pores a bit. nan
