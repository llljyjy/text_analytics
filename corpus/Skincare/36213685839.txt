I have severe rosacea and this is the only product I have ever used that really works, and works well! I’ve given up on “curing” the rosacea and now I just need something to cover it up. This is the thing! It really really works! Feels a little gummy until it absorbs in, but I’m willing to overlook it for how much it evens out my redness. This is my current favorite skincare product. nan
