So I recieved a free deluxe sample and I have used it and even cut it open to get it all out. I struggle with a spf some I don’t like the feel. My fav is the 111 skin but that stuff is so pricey. This will be first purchase from a sample I’ve tried. I love this spf, it feels good on skin, makes you a bit glowy and obsorbs well! A must try Awesome SPF
