#freeproduct.  I got this free sample from a top Box circle survey. My only complaint about this product is the syrup was still a little runny for my liking. There was hardly any odor and my skin felt nicer and wrinkles visibly less after use. If this was part of my daily routine that I added at the night time period definitely worth a try if you donâ€™t mind slightly runny. nan
