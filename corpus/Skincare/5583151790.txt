I used this for nearly a month and no results yet.  The dispenser is awkward with the button on the bottom and kept slipping out of my hands.  I also didn’t like the way you have to mix the powder with the serum because I feel like it did not mix fully throughout the serum.  It didn’t have a strong scent at all, which was nice, and the texture wasn’t bad.  I did have to stop using it though because I turned red and started to peel, which didn’t surprise me at all with retinol.  It didn’t burn or sting, though.  As expensive as I know that Kiehl’s products are, I know this would not be worth the purchase at all. Not impressed :(
