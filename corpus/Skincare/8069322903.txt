First thing first im obsessed, this is my new favorite lip mask (more like everyday lip care for me) yes I use it everyday as my lip balm because I have very very dry lips,! I love how the consistency is like a paste that goes on like a lip balm, has a very light fruity scent and the plumping is not like burning your lips! So good im really loving it. My new fav lip mask for sure.
