I was thrilled to be selected to try Biossance’s Rapid Plumping Serum- I struggle with dry skin especially during the winter, so I thought I could use a product that would draw in moisture and leave my skin feeling plump. Thankfully, the merits of this product lived up to my high expectations! This serum feels good and light on my skin whilst making it feel refreshed and look noticeably bouncier. I’ve used it on my face and neck and have noticed a difference after even the first application, and I especially like that it comes with a dropper to keep things clean and make it easy to dispense the right amount of product. Definitely a winner! nan
