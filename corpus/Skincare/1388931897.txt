All around great oil cleanser, I’ve used it a few times now and it’s able to remove all my makeup in one wash which I’m pretty impressed by. Sometimes it comes out as oil and sometimes balm (solid). Only downside is after working it in around my eyes, my eyesight is blurry for a  few minutes after. Gets the Job Done
