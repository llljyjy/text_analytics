i was worried that this product would be harsh on my skin or drying, but i love that this ia a salicylic acid suspended in oil. it has made my skin super smooth, and after 2 weeks of use iâ€™ve definitely noticed a visible improvement in the size of my pores/blackheads on my nose. its fit so well into my current skin care routine, and has been gentle enough for me to use morning and night (my skin is quite hardy though, so this may not be possible for everyone). i would recommend using a sunscreen with this product. nan
