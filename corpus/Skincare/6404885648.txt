I didn’t notice it was too much of a scrub but it still made my skin feel soft and got unwanted dirt off the surface. Just like their other products I love the packaging and faint smell. It wasn’t harsh on my skin and overall left it feeling smooth and clean! I would definitely try this product if you have sensitive skin! I received this product free from Influenster. Refreshing
