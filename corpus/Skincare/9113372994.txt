I have normal/sensitive skin and this exfoliating cleanser as been a game changer in my routine. Iâ€™m using it about 2x per week and it leaves my skin soft and glowing. I have trouble with sebaceous filaments around my nose/chin and this has reduced their appearance by about 80%. My husband even noticed a difference, which means this stuff really works! Fave Exfoliator!
