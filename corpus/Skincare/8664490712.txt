Pretty standard for a mineral sunscreen. The white cast is definitely there but not the worst I’ve seen. I would blend in small sections because it does absorb/dry pretty quickly. Otherwise it’ll get streaky, the white cast will look worse and you’ll tug at your face. Scent barley noticeable, and plays well with the rest of my skincare and makeup. nan
