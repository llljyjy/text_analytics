I loved this product.  Completely removed all make-up.  My skin felt very soft - not at all greasy like I expected.  My issue is with the false container - it appears to be a lot of product, but if you hold it up to the light there is about 1/2 inch of empty space due to the false bottom.  I believe in trying to reduce excessive packaging.  This makes me feel that if they are willing to trick us into thinking there is more product than there really is, what else are they willing to trick us with?  I would definitely be willing to recommend this to friends if they donâ€™t try to trick us with unnecessary empty space. Great Product, False Bottom
