Paula’s Choice once again out did it with this one. I love this so much to prep my skin after washing my face. It’s hydrating and light. It’s elevated my following skincare. Chefs kiss. I can’t say enough good things about this product. If I’m going in with the BHA or retinol after I sometimes mix it with the CosRx snail mucin bc I find it helps the CosRx absorb better rather than just sit on my skin. On my second bottle. 10/10 nan
