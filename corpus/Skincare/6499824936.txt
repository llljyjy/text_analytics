I wanted to love this product but it leaves a sticky feeling on my face like it’s not fully absorbing or something. My skin type is usually normal in the summer but dry from fall to spring so I’m usually able to pack on moisturizing products and my skin drinks it all up no problem. I loved the smell and the packaging which is why I gave it 3 stars anyway. I had the same feeling about the water sleep mask in this line. Just didn’t do anything for me unfortunately. nan
