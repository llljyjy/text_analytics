I was beyond excited to receive the JLo Fresh Take Eye Cream complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.Upon opening the voxbox, the first thing I noticed was the magnificent, luxe crystal looking packaging of the eye cream! The product claims to, mask the appearance of dark circles and discoloration while visibly reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles. While I can say after several weeks of use, that it does thoroughly moisturize and significantly reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area, it didnâ€™t do much for my pronounced dark circles. If you are one who has mild to light dark circles, this product would most likely blur and perfect that area.  Nice Luxe Eye Cream
