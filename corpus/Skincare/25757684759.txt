This is a great moisturizer that replaced a more expensive my night cream.  My skin runs dry and whenever I use this I wake up with plump, moisturized, bright skin.  However, the packaging is TERRIBLE.  The squeeze tube makes it impossible to know how much product is left and it is difficult to squeeze the product out.  A jar or pump would be much better.  Fix the packaging and this gets 5 stars! Great product.  Terrible packaging
