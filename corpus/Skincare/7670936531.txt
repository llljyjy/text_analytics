I have been trying out a lot of moisturizers lately to find the best fit for my skin and I think I have found it. This cream absorbs like a dream and is just lightly scented enough that it isnâ€™t overwhelming. The hyaluronic acid is doing wonders on my fine lines. This jar will last a long time because a little goes a long way. I feel like it is definitely worth the price and will be purchasing a refill when this is used up. Definitely Magic!
