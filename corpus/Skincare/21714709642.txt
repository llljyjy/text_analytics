When I got this product, I was just excited to be using interesting chemicals on my skin that didn’t burn me - as I had extreme skin sensitivity issues for years to the point aloe vera gel made me completely go red and kept my skin feeling like it’s on fire for months after I stopped using it.I just tried this out since it said on the Ordinary’s website this is great for dullness and works as as an antioxidant. What I didn’t realize is that this works in harmony with vit C to help prevent photo-damage, I was just pleased it worked with everything else in my extensive skin recovery routines for over 3 years now, and felt really nice to put on whether it was daytime or nighttime.After learning more about this product over the years, I opt to use it in the daytime with Vit C and slathering my SPF on my face, and I have never experienced any indication of skin irritation or incompatibility with my ingredient-enthusiast skincare lifestyle.Since for some reason products on the market with vit C and Ferulic together tend to exceed $100 while this nifty bottle exists, I have to say I am very relieved my skin loves it so much.
