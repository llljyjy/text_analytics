To me this product seemed like a highlighter for under the eyes which is not necessary for me. Although the cooling and brightening effects are pretty good, I feel like there are other products out there that can do the same, while also having hydration benefits. For those like me who have drier skin around the eyes, I would recommend using an actual eye cream instead of this. Highlighter for under your eyes
