I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’ve heard many good things about this serum but couldn’t justify the cost. I’m so happy I tried it! I have enlarged pores and some uneven texture on parts of my face. After using it for a few weeks, a couple times a week, there has been a difference. My pores have gotten smaller that even at a facial there’s significantly less to extract. Plus I’ve received compliments on my cleaner skin. My only negative note is just the sticky texture of the serum when I rub it on. nan
