I got a sample of this with an order I made from FAB’s website, I chose it myself because I’m always on the look out for great cleansing oils or balms as the first step in my double cleanse routine and I was interested to see what this brand had to offer in that category. First off I have to say that FAB is one of the most overhyped brands out there with a ridiculously high price point on mediocre skincare. I have tried a few of their products and very few of them hit the mark with me, and I should be a prime candidate for their products since I have very dry skin with eczema and rosacea yet I have been massively underwhelmed by most of it. There are only a few products I do like so far but this one was a HUGE let down! Rarely do I ever give a product one star (the few times I actually leave a review) but this did not feel like an oil nor a balm when in contact with skin. It dries down seconds after you rub it in making you feel like you need to use way more then you should, along with also drying out the skin. I guess it does an ok job in removing complexion products but even then you still need quite a bit of product to do so but it’s horrible at removing eye makeup! plus it stings the eyes very bad and I have to clean the skin extra well with my second step cleanser to get all the residue of this one off and even then I still feel like it sits around the eyes. The first time I used it I was just expecting this to be a pretty decent oil cleanser but when I went to wash my face the next morning I was shocked to see there was still mascara on some parts of my lashes! And I wash my face extremely well at night! I’m pretty surprised that it’s getting 4.1 on Sephora as I do not think it deserves it. I feel like FAB think they’ve gotten so big because of their “viral“ products that they’re increasing prices while decreasing quality. With how many great oil and balm cleansers there are out there I would not recommend this product. Nope!
