So I usually try to use only moisturizers that are recommended by my dermatologist as I break out quite easily . Got this free sample in an order and decided to try it. I was so shocked that I did not break out and my face felt so supple using this moisturizer. I am so happy I found it and use the sample size very sparingly and the regular size is a bit costly. Your skin would thank you. nan
