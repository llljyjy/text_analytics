i simply don’t understand why everyone is raving about this product. i have a mini berry version that i’ve had for a while now. i remember using it at first and noticing that my lips were extremely dry, so i set it to the side and forgot about it. recently, this product has gotten super popular. i pulled it out again and used it for the past two nights and it’s just as i expected. my lips were more prone to peeling and are very dry. i’m confused on why people are loving this stuff??definitely read the reviews first before purchasing. there’s lots of better alternatives in my opinion. this product is overhyped and overpriced for sure! confused on the hype??
