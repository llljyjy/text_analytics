Been using this for over a week now and felt results within the first couple of days.  I have oil/dry combo skin and I feel like it evens it out for me and works well.  It keeps my skin feeling moisturized longer and the formula absorbs quickly into my skin so I can finish my skincare routine quicker which I like.  Has a slight fragrance but I donâ€™t mind it at all.   I just care that it works! New favorite
