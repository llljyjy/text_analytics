I really enjoy the texture / feel of this! Super watery and soaks into my skin well, I’ve had a few instances of pilling — but I thiiiiiink that’s me rushing my morning routine and not waiting for other skincare products to be settled before applying. Would give it the 5 stars but oooof the price hurts. Also feels very similar on the skin as Dr. Jart’s sun fluid (which is another product I absolutely love but would not buy outside of Korea bc of the pricing). nan
