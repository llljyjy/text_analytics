This stuff if pretty powerful. Be careful and start slowly building up to every night. Especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. Also I a stinging feeling using any moisturizer with a fragrance on top of this. As long as I stuck to unscented moisturizer I was fine. After using this for a couple of weeks my husband commented how smooth my skin looked so I’ll definitely keep on using this. Can’t get any higher praise than that! nan
