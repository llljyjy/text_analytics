I like IT cosmetics as a brand but I was very disappointed in this product. I receive this item free for my honest review. When I opened the product it was both a solid and liquid consistency. Makes me wonder if I received old product. The smell of rose is super strong. If you don’t like rose do not get this. It was so strong I could not use near my eyes or they would water. As for how well is cleans not well at all. I don’t wear heavy makeup and this did not clean off the makeup all the way. Definitely need to go back with a second cleanser. I had high hopes for this product and it left me disappointed. Very disappointed
