I love everything Sunday Riley. I recently added her oils to my skin care routine. I’ll either layer with oil serum good genes and then moisturizer or I’ll just use oil and good genes and a moisturizer or serum and the moisturizer. I had oily skin for 20 years I realized I was stripping all the oils off my skin and it just kept making my skin more oily. Adding the oil to oily skin has saved my life it has balanced my skin and I no longer have that problem. Do yourself a favor and try her oils you’ll thank me later. LOVE SR oils
