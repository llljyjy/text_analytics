I’ll preface this by saying I’ve only purchased this once, so perhaps I got a dud. However, after using this twice, I liked it fine and decided to move some to a different container to take on a trip. As soon as I scooped in (with the application wand provided), an air bubble in the bottom popped and I realized that 50-60% of the product compartment was just air. It’s a nice product, but not worth the risk of paying for half of what you’re expecting. Paying for Air!
