My first thought when I received this product was how the package was pleasing on the eye, very appealing. I always test a product on my hand to make sure my skin doesn’t react to a new product, I noticed it was a very thin like substance close to water, this product does need to be shaken up or you it will be very runny. I also noticed it was tinted.. After rubbing this product in tou get a beautiful glow/shimmer left on your skin which I ended up loving. Not only was this a sunscreen but as a 40 year old woman I appreciate the anti aging benefits to this, my skins appearance was left looking beautiful and glowing!! 100% recommend. I did take a star off due to the water like consistency, I wasn’t too much of a fan of that but overall a really good product. Beautiful Creation
