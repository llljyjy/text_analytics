This moisturizer is an absolute DREAM! It feels so luxurious and creamy on the skin, and is just thick enough to feel like you’re drowning your skin in moisture without being so thick that you feel smothered. My skin is the softest it has ever been, and it’s gentle enough to use when I wreck my skin barrier trying new products. I cannot rave enough about this product. It will forever be my holy grail. how is this not viral?
