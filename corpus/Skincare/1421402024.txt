First off, the packaging is the ultimate for me. Any packaging where you don’t have to touch the inside of the whole cream for me, is a huge plus. I love that you just push the top and it distributes the exact amount you need. Second, the cream has vitamin C and AHA’s, which do tingle on the skin and that’s how I know it’s working, so I love that too.Made me have a healthy glow in the AM. I love that this cream basically exfoliates and hydrates while you sleep, so you wake up a new you! nan
