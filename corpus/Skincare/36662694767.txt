I never leave reviews, but thought I needed to let you know that this product is good and bad.  It definitely works in terms of diminishing fine lines under the eye BUT it leaves a white reside.  AND my concealer doesnâ€™t apply properly afterwards.  Was going to return but kept it for days when I wear little to no concealer. Not for me!
