I LOVE this sleep mask!! I had tried a friendâ€™s before buying myself because it is a bit of a commitment, but I am so glad I did it. It is so pretty and the plumping is so subtle and does not sting like others. I wear this during the day because of how soft it makes my lips. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the flavor is very strong and slightly reminds me of grape cough medicine. When I buy this again I think I will try another flavor. SO PRETTY!
