Have been using this for around 3 days now. I use it in the morning after I wash my face. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. absorbs very quickly(instantly). Only need a small amount for the whole face. little goes a long way. so far so good. no breakouts and I have sensitive skin that tends to break out when using moisturizers. Will continue to use and will probably purchase the regular sized product. :) So far so good
