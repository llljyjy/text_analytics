After reading several reviews that mentioned the product had left blue streaks on the skin I was skeptical and expecting a very blue product. Admittedly it is blue but I would say that the product left behind on the skin is at the most a light iridescent blue. It is cooling as advertised though I donâ€™t know how much brighter it left my eyes. Not a product I see myself needing to incorporate into my daily routine. Meh
