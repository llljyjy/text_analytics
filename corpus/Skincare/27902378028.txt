I received this #freeproduct for my honest review from #trywithtopbox. My wife has been using this cream along with the vinoperfect serum for 2 weeks now and here are her thoughts: ✨ There is a  visible difference with dark spots. ✨ The skin has cleared up and is smooth all over. ✨ This does have a brightening effect on the skin✨ The glycolic acid leaves the skin super soft ✨  Skin feels rejuvenated within 2 weeks and works best with the Vinoperfect serum✨  a little goes a looong way with this cream. A tiny bit is enough to cover my entire face ✨  definitely love this product and can’t get enough of it ❤️ Rejuvenates the skin
