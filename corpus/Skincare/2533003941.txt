This is a very thick, super moisturizing cream. Directions say to use a pea size amount. That’s about what I used. I’ve been using this for 3+ weeks. It’s a little thick to spread easily so I always used it on damp skin (use should do that with moisturizers anyway) and/or or sprayed with thermal water to make it a runnier consistency. It’s a whipped consistency, but still thick, if that makes sense. A few of the nights, randomly, I did feel a tingling sensation. This has essential oils and I do have rosacea, but I didn’t have any reaction to it. It reminds me a lot of the Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Repair Cream except this has a lavender scent, (soothing to me) and has a different texture. This is great to use as a last step in your nighttime skin routine to lock in the moisture and helps to plump your skin while you sleep. It soaks in well and doesn’t leave you wet or sticky. I can also definitely see using this as my regular nighttime moisturizer when my already dry skin becomes excessively dry. The price is about $50 and I think that’s more than fair for a jar that will last you 4-6 months with a pea size amount. I can see this being reactive for people that are VERY sensitive to fragrance/oils, so I give it a 4, but I didn’t have that problem myself. I highly recommend trying this. nan
