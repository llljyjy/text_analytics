I was so excited to be able to try this.I’ve been using Kiehls for a little over a month. The serum is like a light cream consistency. I didnt notice much of smell. Which I like since its so close to your eye. I apply as directed, except Ill admit that I only use it at night & tend to skip the morning. I am not a morning person! You only need to use a little bit, so it will last a long time. But it will lay nicely under make up. The Keihls Vitamin C eye serum has really work wonderful for me. Kiehls has decreased dark circles & my morning puffiness. My eyes would look so tired throughout the day, and since I’ve been using this there is no puffiness! Even first thing in the morning. Its amazing. My dark circles are no more. My fine lines are still there, but I do feel there is a real visible yet gradual tightening of skin over all. I would highly recommand!
