Estée Lauder products are always a WIN for me! It is super hydrating and makes my skin less dry. The only thing is, I would say this is more of a night cream because it is pretty thick (texture wise). I wouldn’t want to wear it under my foundation in the day time because of the heavy consistency, but for nighttime, it is 100%. Superb Hydration
