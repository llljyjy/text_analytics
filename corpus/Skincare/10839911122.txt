I’m a huge fan when it comes to cleansers! I’ve always used my makeup balm remover as my first step because no other cleanser would remove my makeup completely. I wear makeup very often for long hours and Keep It Clean is just wonderful, I enjoy using it both on dry to breakaway all the makeup even mascara and wet to make sure everything is gone and enjoy the bubbly formula. My skin is never dry or tight!! 100% recommended, amazing brand and products! nan
