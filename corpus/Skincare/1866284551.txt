I’ve been using this product daily for a few months one and I always keep it in my purse. SPF only lasts so long so I wanted an SPF I could put over makeup or just quickly reapply throughout the day without touching my face or having to use my hands to apply more SPF. I have very fair skin that is prone to sun spots so SPF is very important to me. Every time I take my dog for a walk I spray this on my face really quick, it’s so easy. The spray is slightly scented but dissipates quickly. I gifted one to my sister who is very sensitive with smells and she had no issue using this. Easy and fast SPF application
