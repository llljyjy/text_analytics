I rarely write reviews unless I’m blown away by a product. This one delivers! I have large pores and combo skin in my 40s and this cleanser leaves my face so bright and clean with ample moisture! I pair it with caudelie toner,retinol and the Dr. Gross serum I wake up looking refreshed though I’m sleep deprived from being a toddler mom and working and grad school juggler! Trust me you’ll see smoother skin in days! nan
