SO....This is the first gel like cream that i have come across that i can use all over my eyes and I SIMPLY LOVE IT!!!!! The consistency is so smooth, it is almost gel like and smells like lemons. Now I do wish i had more time to see a difference because my dark circles are very noticeable with my very fair skin but you can tell the difference just from your finger you use to put it on with after....your finger feels sooooo smooth and so different from the rest!!!!!! Plus this stuff goes a loo√¥oooong way with just a dab here and there where ya want it which is all ovet my eyes for me and I dont know of ANOTHER product you can use like that and it not bother my sensitive eyes!!!! This is my eye stuff and I am not giving it up. Thanks for giving me this for free in my buzz campaign!! Multi use and AMAZING
