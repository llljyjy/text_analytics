WOW! The results of this serum was way beyond my expectations! I had a bad allergic reaction/rash on my chick and it was very red and nobody knew what it exactly was. It kept coming back for a month or so. I used some over the counter creams and they made it 10x worse. I used this for 1 day and it was almost completely gone. This was a lifesaver for me, definitely recommend! nan
