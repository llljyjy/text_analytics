After using this for one week I can confidently say I will be repurchasing! This serum is so soft and buttery, it left my skin feeling so smooth but not greasy feeling. Its super light weight but still feels ultra hydrating. I have super sensitive skin and I never know whatâ€™s going to irritate it, and this serum passed the test! Highly recommend it! Soft and Buttery
