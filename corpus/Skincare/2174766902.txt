I love Estee Lauder. I was lucky to be given a trial size of this for free by influenster for my honest opinion. Say goodbye to dry dehydrated skin. The cream is very silky and smooth. It goes on so nice. I like the scent. Itâ€™s not too strong. I put it on at night and in the morning my skin feels hydrated and soft. My skin gets so dry specially around the winter time and this is the best pick me up. I have always been a fan of the Revitalizing Supreme creams and I love that this has hyaluronic acid. I will be buying this moving forward. Silky Skin in a Jar!!
