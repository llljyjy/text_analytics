So I like to buy my skin care routine in Sets. And I thought this would be a great spf to go with the rest of the vitamin c skincare that is from the same brand. But I notice throughout the day, my skin would feel kind of greasy and my eyes would get irritated from the product on my face. I’ve done my routine regularly with no problem until I added this one and realized this is what’s irritating my eyes. When you first apply it, it feels great. Throughout the day, it feel greasy. I don’t think this product is meant to use with anything else. nan
