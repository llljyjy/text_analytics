I did receive this product for free through influenster and the INKEY List in exchange for my honest review. I started using this product as my step 1 step 2 in my skincare routine morning and night for about a month and a half before I ran out. I feel like you definitely get enough product for what you pay for. I appreciated that it was unscented unless I used it after other skincare products just a warning but it wasnâ€™t a huge deal. I do feel this is better suited for more oily skin, if you are in the dryer side if combo skin you might to up your moisture. After using this product I did notice my overall complexion really cleared up and my dark spots faded. Will be making this a staple
