I received this product free for testing/review purposes. This is still my honest review. The product I received was a sample size-I was not able to use for multiple uses to tell a major difference. I will say it has potential. It is strongly scented and goes on smoothly. It is like a liquid lotion. I do recommend giving it a try. Has potential-strong scent
