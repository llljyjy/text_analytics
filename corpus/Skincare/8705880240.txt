Makes my skin look yummyyy!! I accidentally bought this thinking it was the cream! So that’s my fault lol but I still decided to give it a try and I think it’ll be a staple from now on that I’ll add to my skincare routine! I apply it after washing my face and after all my other serums and I also use the Niacinamide dew drops and omg!! Skin be lookin very fresh, plump, dewy, supple, and glowy!!!!! Definitely recommend!! I have acne prone and combo skin and hasn’t broken me out or produce excess oil or anything. If anything it’s helped my dry, flaky spots which I tend to get during winter time! A must have product!
