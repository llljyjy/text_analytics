Rarely do I rebuy products, but this is one I have just repurchased. While it is a small bottle, this lasts such a long time, lasted me just over a year with applying it basically every single day! Works well with all different kinds of moisturizers. Looks very natural and glowy, slightly orange but it’s not so bad. I will say it fades kinda weird, stubborn at fading in certain spots like on my pores on my nose, but it’s no big deal. Summer Glow All Year Long
