First of all, I love that the packaging has a pump top. Makes for easy application! It does go on with a slight white cast but disappears very quickly as my skin absorbed the product. It goes on light, non greasy and did not make my skin break out in any way. I have added this to my daily beauty routine especially now in the warmer weather. I reapply every 3 hours and my skin is still clear and protected from harmful UV rays. Great Mineral Sunscreen
