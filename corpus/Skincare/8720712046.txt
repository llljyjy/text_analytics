This is the best tanner! I usually use Tan Luxe drops because I definitely love the lotion/moisturizer feel rather than a mousse and this is a gradual tanner but it really does give great even color! And all the other ones say they don’t smell but this one actually smells refreshing and I love that you don’t have to rinse it off or worry about it transferring. Will buy again! best tanner!
