I have really bad dry skin, even in the summer. My dry skin creates a very flaky situation and enhances my natural age lines in my forehead, between my eyebrows and around my nose and upper cheekbones. The confidence in a cream really did a great job at keeping my skin moisturized after my skincare routine. I noticed how well it plumped up my lines and kept my dry patched skin from flaking. The scent is very nice and not overwhelming. Definitely recommend for the dry skin peeps! Very moisturizing!
