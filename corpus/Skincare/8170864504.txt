Truly truly I saw a difference in my under eyes overnight. The bags were almost completely gone, darkness went away over a few weeks, and my under eyes looked supple and plump. HOWEVER. I did cry with this on and it burnt my eyes so so so badly. I have to remember not to have a mental breakdown when I have this on. So beware. But it’s so nice don’t get this in your eyes
