My skin is showing some signs of improvement but I’m not 100% certain it is because of this. I also use Tretinoin, vitamin C, and an occasional hydroquinone cream. The smell is not the best. However, my biggest gripe is the feel. It feels so heavy on combo-oily skin. My face looks greasy all day long (I wear it in the daytime because of Tretinoin at night). It’s feels tacky. Pair this with SPF…omg. I instantly want to wash my face lol. I think there are better options with a lighter feel and just as good efficacy. Different strokes for different folks though. Eh, it’s okay!
