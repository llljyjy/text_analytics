This just works! easily one of my favorite moisturizers i’ve used...the hydration seems some how more “significant“..i actually feel the increased suppleness of my skin...it worked well at reducing some of the fine lines and wrinkles,even in only a few weeks time,but for me...the main thing is how well it hydrates....it’s “Rich and oily“ feeling,so you really don’t have to use much,just a dab on your fingers will do....but my skin absorbs this right away,so no heavy feeling. Another nice thing about this cream is the light and pleasant smell..i will be purchasing this in the future and recommending to everyone Great!
