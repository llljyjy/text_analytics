I tried out the Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer recently and am undecided. I currently experience hormonal breakouts, although the medication I’m on helps reduce them significantly. I was hoping hormonal targeted skincare was the final piece of the puzzle for my skin, but this didn’t do much for me. It’s moisturizing, but I don’t feel like it outperformed my current moisturizer. It does smell amazing and luxurious though, which made me give it 4 stars instead of 3. Smells Luxurious
