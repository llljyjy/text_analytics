Thank you Voxbox for the opportunity to test out the Drunk Elephant A-Gloei Maretinol Oil with 0.5% Retinol. I was a bit skeptical adding something with retinol to my routine, so I used one drop and used it on areas with uneven texture and scarring, patting gently until absorbed. Make sure to use on a clean face! It can be used night and day, but would recommend to use a sunscreen if used in the day. Using at night helped to wake up to a more moisturized face by the morning, so a little goes a long way! Moreover, I didn’t expect to see results right away, but I saw irritation caused by rubbing fade as I used it on a problem area of my face. As someone who has struggled with insecurity with things like this, seeing it clear up the scarring helped me feel positive about a product’s claim regarding benefits with fading discoloration and scarring. Another thing I enjoyed was that it didn’t cause any breakouts on any areas I tried it on or surrounding areas, something I struggle with when it comes to face oils. I tested this out over the course of two months, and can honestly say my face appears brighter and smoother in problem areas that other products haven’t been able to target as good as the A-Gloei Maretinol Oil. Will definitely repurchase and continue to use in my skin routine! #gloeidays #complimentary @drunkelephant @Influenster Gloei-r Skin
