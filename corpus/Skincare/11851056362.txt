While using this product I’ve noticed my skin got really sensitive, the directions weren’t to clear.  I was using it everyday for  a week and a half. My skin burnt , the product is creamy and moved easily moved. While sleeping it traveled under my eyes and lids and seriously burnt my face. I quit using for a week to care for my skin , did research on my own and started using it 2-3 times a week, tapping it in my skin and carefully making sure it’s no where near my eyes or cheeks bones (high plain) After now using properly, I can tell my skin is smoother and my blemishes are fading .
