I received a full size tube for my honest review through Influenster. I am 52 years older. This balm (lotion) is very silky to touch. I really liked the product but I am one of those who does prefer a soft scent with my products. This has no scent whatsoever. Which in reality does not keep me from using a product I really like. This is supposed to be used for face AND body. I do not think this is enough product to use for the entire body on a regular basis. But for hands, face, & neck it’s very nice. It moisturizes well…I had no reaction to this cream & I have sensitive skin. I have a different product I use regularly but I did give this a try. I am always open to try something new that might be better. I’ll use this probably til it’s gone & I will enjoy it. It does feel luxurious. But I prefer my regular skin care products & I doing I will be purchasing this later on. Ok
