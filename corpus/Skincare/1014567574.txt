I use Retin-A, and while I don’t exfoliate often, I do like to do it once a week to slough off any flakes.  I was excited to try this because it wasn’t supposed to be super aggressive.  The beads are gentle, yes, but don’t create enough friction to do ANY exfoliating.  My skin was just as flaky as before I used it.  Plus, the scent is really strong and pungent.  I could still smell it after I rinsed it off, and in this case, it isn’t a good thing.  I’m probably going to return this, as I can’t see myself using this again, and I’ll stick with the goop exfoliator (because if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it!). Exfoliating???  Nah.
