I want to say I also used inkny acne cream in the small white tube for like four days with no progress, and used niacinamide serum from ordinary for like three days with no changes that I could tell. I was feeling a little bummed so I decided to use this mask which was a free sample and literally the next morning i saw a big difference! now, the day before i did use all three products three times because I was doing a lot of running around and took three showers. so the other products could have helped as well. but when I went to do my night routine I didnâ€™t notice any difference until i woke up in the morning. So I think this mask helped the most. Literally overnight!
