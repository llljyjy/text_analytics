Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil is a nice lotion with SPF protection without a strong scent. It feels so smooth and the skin looks fresh and hydrated. I used it also as a primer before applying my foundation. The Warm natural tan tint is a bit dark for me. But I think it still would be a good fit for summer. Meanwhile, Iâ€™ll try this product without tilt because I really like the feeling on my skin and I always use lotions with SPF protection. The packaging is also nice and I can easily control how much product do I need. nan
