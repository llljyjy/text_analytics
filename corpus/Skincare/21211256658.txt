It really does feel weightless! I don’t often wear foundation, just concealer, but I found that Nudescreen was a great everyday base! It has a bit of a white cast (I’m very pale, so it melted in quickly) and leaves the skin extremely glowy. The smell isn’t as strong as other facial sunscreens, but it was definitely noticeable when I was wearing it. Feels Weightless!
