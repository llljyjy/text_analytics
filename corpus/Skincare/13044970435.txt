Bought this as a replacement to the ordinary Vit C serum. My entire routine was the same with the only change being replacement of ordinary Vit C serum with this product. Tbh, I found the serum more effective on my skin. This product gives me a tingly feeling on application. Even though it’s something mentioned on the product as “expected” I am not comfortable using it because of that reason and May resort back to their serum. did not meet my expectations
