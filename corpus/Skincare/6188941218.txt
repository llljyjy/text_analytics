This stuffs saved my skin. I have to say Iâ€™ve tried everything even some gentle toners and this is so hydrating. But if your nose is feeling a little bumpy after using this it will be smooth again. It helps with texture and is not irritating at all. No reactions from it and I have sensitive skin great for skin care lovers
