I received this product from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder for an honest review of the product. I have oily skin type. I used the hydrating lotion at night after washing my face. The product is very thin almost like water and only takes a small amount. Your skin sucks the product in so fast and dries instantly. The smell is so fresh and clean. I love this hydrating lotion it is so good. Smells great!
