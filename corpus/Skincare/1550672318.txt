I am taking a star off because of the price of this balm. I was able to try this product through a sampling program and didn’t enjoy it. It does do everything it claims but I don’t enjoy melting oils. I find that they feel weird and leave a film on my face after removal. I always do a secondary cleanse but find that this product is just too expensive in comparison to other melting balms. I personally prefer a micellar water as my first step for makeup removal. nan
