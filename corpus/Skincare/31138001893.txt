Kiehlâ€™s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream was a great product to try. I have very noticeable dark circles and bags under my eyes. Not much has worked for me and I have tried a lot of different products with minimum to no results. Now I received this product to sample and I used it for 2 weeks. I was surprised by the results as it did show some notable differences. I found less puffiness and my dark circles did lighten up, not much but there was a difference. After my 2 week trail I was just ok with the results but not sure if it was the answer I was looking for, for my personal expectations. I did have less puffiness and noticed a little bit of the dark circles did diminish. I am not sure if I would by this product for ongoing use. I would however recommend this product to my family and friends to try out to see what they think. Small improvement but not the right fit for me.
