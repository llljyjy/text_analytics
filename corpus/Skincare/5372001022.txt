I received this product for free from Influenster and St. Tropez in exchange for my honest review. I had used a St. Tropez product years ago and was turned off by the overwhelming self-tanner scent, coupled with the fact that it made me look orange. Thankfully, I had a much better experience with this product! The watermelon scent shines through and almost completely masks the self-tanner scent. I also noticed results the next day after applying, and it was a gradual glow as opposed to an unnatural shade of orange. I will he using this from here on out! Great scent and great results!
