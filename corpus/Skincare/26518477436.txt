I like this balm, but don’t love it. It definitely does what it says it’s going to do, which is remove makeup and sunscreen. Personally, I double cleanse when I wear foundation which is what I did with this. I like that it’s unscented and it didn’t cause any breakouts. For this price point, it didn’t wow me. Id rather get a cheaper oil cleanser for makeup removal since I’ll be double cleansing anyways. If you want a higher end cleanser go for it, it does what it’s supposed to do, but personally I can’t justify spending $40. Does it’s Job
