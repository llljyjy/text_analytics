I like the packaging of the product. I like that the glow on shot serum is lightweight and easy to apply and spreadable. The product does eventually absorb into the skin, but can be oily. If you have dry skin or combination skin, it is great to treat the dullness and lack of moisture your skin naturally creates. I will say with combination skin to be careful with this product as it can increase the amount of oil your skin produces, but it also gives you a radiant glow that many try to achieve naturally or through make up.  also, if you do have oily skin and you choose to use this product, I would just use a cleanser that absorbs oil to combat the increased amount of oil that will be produced due to using this product. Boost of Confidence or Vitamin C?
