I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been using it for a couple days now, morning and night. It’s still too soon for the full clinically expected results, but so far so good! My skin is definitely well hydrated, softer, and feeling smooth. The formula is quite concentrated so a small amount goes pretty far. It’s very soothing to apply, blends seamlessly.  I will keep using this product, I plan to repurchase it, and I do recommend it to other. Must try
