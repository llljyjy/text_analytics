This unfortunately is not a good vitamin c serum. Its packaged in a clear bottle which can oxidize the vitamin c. The type of vitamin c it contains isnt the best and it doesnâ€™t even tell u the percentage. It contains mineral oil and fragrance. It does feel nice and it has some hydrators in it but for a vitamin c serum i would pass. Its a pass for me.
