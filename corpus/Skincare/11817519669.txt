I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. Packaging: first impressions were good. It had a nice sleek look and I love the store upside down design so you always have product available without having to wait or pound it to the top. The beige color of the insert was a little deceptive since the product itself is more of a clear/semi-opaque white. That being said overall very innovative design and I love that it’s refillable. I just wish there was a clearer way to see how much is left. Product: The serum glides on with a nice silky feel. I have sensitive skin and experienced no burning or reactions and I’ve used this product for a week morning and evening as directed. I did have unrelated breakouts during this trial and it didn’t irritate or inflame them. Dispenses the correct amount needed for face/neck. The results: keep in mind that a week is a relatively short period to see results. My primary concerns were PIH and uneven skin tone. I’m very fair and prone to red PIH marks from breakouts. This serum in my opinion yielded visible results in the brightness and clarity of my skin tone in just the 7 days. The breakouts I mentioned earlier seem to not have left as severe PIH as I usually see and cleared up faster. I am very impressed with this and look forward to seeing further results with continued use. I most definitely will be repurchasing. Quick results!
