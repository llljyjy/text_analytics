I love this cleanser. I got the travel size in a gift set and it was by far my favorite part. It doesn’t foam right if the bottle but it does get nice and foam on your face. It smells heavenly and subtle. It made a noticeable difference in my skin and I got more compliments on my skin after using. It doesn’t leave my face feeling dry. I honestly just love it so much. nan
