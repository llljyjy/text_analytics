Gifted by Hanni. I’ve been blown away by this razor. I’ve always had issues with razor burn and I feel like this razor is going to help so much with that. It’s a much closer and smoother shave. I love that it has a cover to keep the razor protected. I also really like the balm because it gives the option of a dry shave without the irritation. I’m excited to see how this will work long term and I really believe that it will be better than the razor I was using before. New Favorite Razor
