After seeing all the great reviews, I deiced to purchased this eye cream in Jan 2022. I even took it one step further and did some research on the actual product and ingredients. I have to say, from all the high end expensive eye creams Iâ€™ve used, by far one of the worst cream I have used. . After the second week, I started noticing the lower eye area fine lines were worse and drier than ever,  it appeared as the skin was burned. To the point that the lower eye area was even puffier and the dark circles looked worse. Based on my overall experience this cream has done the opposite of what the proven results shows on their website. Perhaps it can be that the ingredient are to strong for me. Bad experience with this eye cream
