I used this on my face and neck for a few weeks after reading the excellent reviews. It’s not for me, but it I can see why others might be into it, so I’ll write a few of my thoughts here. Unfortunately this product didn’t do much (if anything) for my extremely and chronically dry skin. It didn’t really sink in - as in, my skin didn’t feel like it was getting any moisture... my skin felt like it was coated in something, but still very tight and dry. This product just isn’t “juicy“ enough for severely dehydrated skin, it’s too lightweight. For that reason, I’m giving this product a low rating because it simply didn’t work for me (the Dramatically Different Lotion+ is a better day cream option for those with skin similar to mine). However, I’m giving it two stars as opposed to one because I think this product could maybe be a better match for those with normal, combo, or oily skin because it’s not heavy. Also, my skin is stupidly sensitive, and I didn’t see any redness nor feel any stinging or burning, so there’s that. All in all, I do not recommend this product for those of us whose skin needs a lot of extra help in terms of moisture, but I don’t think it’s a terrible product. It’s just for someone else. Bad for super dry skin, but maybe good for others.
