Does as described! Very moisturizing and looks great on lips. The only drawback for me is the smell. It has a very strong artificial cherry smell. If you are okay with that I would recommend this but if you are like me and associate the smell with medicine (and do not want to be having to smell that the whole day) I would choose another product. Good, but scent is not for me
