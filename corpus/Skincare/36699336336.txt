This is really great for removing make up and my skin (literally) feels squeaky clean after. However i have dry/dry combination skin and it does leave my skin feeling tight afterward, so I agree with the description saying itâ€™s best for oily or normal skin. It would probably be great for people with oily/normal skin! But for my dry skin, I will be moving on to a different cleanser nan
