I received the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review. I want to say that I love this product but I also feel I must warn those with sensitive or finicky skin! Let me tell you what happened during my testing of the microfoliant. First (of course), I did a patch test and had absolutely no problem.  On day two, I used the microfoliant and y’all my face had absolutely never felt smoother or softer (not even after dermaplaning)! It’s supposed to be a daily exfoliant so on day three I didn’t think much about using it again. There was no sensitivity during the wash. It didn’t burn or anything and again my skin felt so smooth. BUT...when I applied my moisturizer (the same one I use every single night) my skin suddenly felt like it was on fire. I immediately washed it off but the damage had been done and now I have red, patchy, flakiness on my cheeks. I usually do not have sensitive skin so I am not sure if my moisture barrier was just already damaged and the daily exfoliant was too much or exactly what happened. I don’t say all that to scare anyone but just as a word of caution!! And despite the current situation, I do think that I would like to continue using this product but maybe only once a week or so. Not For Everyday...
