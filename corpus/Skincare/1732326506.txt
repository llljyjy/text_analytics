This didn’t work for me with moisturizing well, especially at this price I expected more. The matte finish is unnecessary, it feels more like a plastic film over other ingredients. Also my foundation didn’t sit well over this, tried 3 different foundations to confirm it’s this moisturizer and not my makeup. After using the entire jar I can also add the glass jar is scary to use, dropping it few times and worrying it would break. Overall would not purchase again. dissatisfied
