Hey Everyone,Hope everyone is having a good Independence Day. I have absolutely nothing to do except write this review. Hopefully, everyone else is having a better day, than I. I was a pedestrian (hit and run incident). So…I’m left with right hand and most of my right side mobility. My movement isn’t great. I was in hospitals and rehabs for over 4 mos. I was excited just to get out the rehabs, right now. This cleanser and osea are the best I’ve tried. I love Josie Maran products.Having sensitive, rosacea, and milia this product is a dream. I also have her face wipes that I use a lot. Being disabled, now. I had to relearn everything, even skincare. Self love is so Important. If I’m not washing I’m wiping my face with the wipes. My skin has not been angry, since I tried this product. Moisturize heavily after serums etc. I’m so glad I picked this up online!
