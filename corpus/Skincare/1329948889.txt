I love Supergoop’s Glow Screen sunscreen for the face, so I didn’t even hesitate and bought this product when I saw it in the store. Unfortunately, it is not the same formulation and leaves you covered in glitter that gets literally everywhere. It’s definitely not the same pearlescent (glitter free) glow you get from the face one. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. Will be returning it tomorrow. nan
