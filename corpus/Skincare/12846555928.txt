Iâ€™ve been using this for over a year and I love it! I use it both day and night and as my first serum step after washing & dying my face. Sometimes it has a tingly feeling but thats usually when I have tiny breakouts that are about to form. My tiny breakouts used to form into full on cystic acne but I noticed that it shrinks away as fast as it shows up, almost overnight. Definitely a must add to your routine! My daily facial peel
