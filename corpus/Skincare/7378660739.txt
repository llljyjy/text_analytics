I honestly hate using this product at night. I’ve used a lot of tanning overnight mists and this one is just not it. I wish I would have returned it. It stays so oily/sticky after you spray it on and it gets all over your pillow and sheets. I’ve tried so hard to like this and get it to work but you have to drench your face for it to give you the slightest tan in the morning and just a little spritz leaves you feeling so incredibly oily. Not to mention that any bit of glow washes off in the morning when you wash your face. Save your lines and go buy the St. Tropez face mist. save your money and don’t buy this
