I received these products for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review.Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb and The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb are both gel-type texture moisturizers which are easy to apply. They absorb quickly, there is no greasiness afterwards. The first one is for oily/combination skin which is ideal for summer. However, I have nothing against The Moisturizing Bomb which is for normal to dry skin, it also feels comfortable on oily skin. The silicons and other other stuff make the moisturizers a perfect primer, however, I’m not sure if you would like to use it daily. 10ml isn’t enough for testing throughly
