I really wanted to like this! This product has received nothing but praise. While it didn’t cause me to break out, it made my skin really uncomfortable, especially around my eyes, and I had to wash it off. Not only that, but it didn’t feel particularly luxurious when applied to the skin. I had to use a lot of product because it dried quickly. I have sensitive skin and regularly use cerave night cream or the lord jones moisturizer. nan
