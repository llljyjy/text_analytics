An *honest* influenser review. I have recently started 0.1% tretinoin and this has salved away the peeling face and is incredibly soothing and hydrating. The only “issue” I have is the smell….it’s a bit “soapy” for my liking but the product does work wonders for cracked skin on the face or to use after actives! An amazing counterpart to Tretinoin
