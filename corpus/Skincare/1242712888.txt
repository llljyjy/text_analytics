Not for my skin. I didn’t notice any improvements to my skin while using other than it’s very moisturizing. I noticed a flim/residue on my face while using. I also had 3 bumps appear. It wasn’t a rash. It’s possible the hot weather may have had an effect on this facial cream. I doubt it though. I expect my facial products to be absorbed before leaving the house in any weather. My skin is combination. Sits on top maybe?
