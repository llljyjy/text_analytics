When you go to Sephora, never ask the salesperson for a good toner because they will give you this and you will be HOOKED…I love it!! It’s the right amount of hydration for my oily, acne prone skin!!  It’s kinda expensive but a little goes a long way.  It’s a really good investment if skincare is your thing!! Go ahead an buy it!!
