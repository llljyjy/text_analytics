The texture is very weird in a sense that it is not creamy, also not like liquid, nor like gel. It feels more like oil to be honest, but not completely. And due to this strange texture, you don’t feel like applying the product even though you might have applied a lot. So I really don’t know what the point is making a texture feeling like this except consuming this thing fast without realizing it. I prefer the regenerating serum much better since it is truly a serum, but I am not sure what this is. Strange texture
