I have used this for YEARS and wa so happy when I found the perfect moisturizer. I’m so upset that now they changed the formula I have to go on the hunt for a new moisturizer. Reviews are right about how it sits on top doesn’t feel like it goes into the skin and it doesn’t feel hydrating as it used to. I’m disappointed in the brand. This is a shame. nan
