I’ve been using this only at night time. I have dark circles and I have noticed my under eyes more lighter than usual. It feels smooth when applying and seems like it has a little shimmer too. It feels hydrating! I’ve read that other people have been getting reactions from this so make sure to test it on a small area before. I’ve had no problems with it so far !
