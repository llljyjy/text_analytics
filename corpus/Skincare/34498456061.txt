Sunday Riley’s C. E. O afterglow brightening Vitamin C Cream It’s a luminous moisturizer with advanced vitamin c (THD ascorbat). I love almost all the products from Sunday Riley. This is the advanced version. The texture of this cream is thick and hydrating. It radiants the skin and gives a plumping effect. Lutein in it provides natural blue light protection. It helps to address dryness, dark spots, discoloration and uneven skin tone. I enjoy applying this moisturizer and it’s my favorite one so far. Thank you Sunday Reily for launching such a wonderful product. nan
