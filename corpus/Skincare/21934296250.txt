I was happy to receive the lip balm in the watermelon flavor. The first thing I noticed about the product was how cute the packaging was!I have had dryer lips lately so I immediately put this product on and it does last a good amount of time, but you definitely will have to reapply after drinking/eating or after a couple hours. I did test it out overnight in place of my normal lip mask and it surprisingly lasted through the night and I woke up with soft lips. I think with that and the fact that this product is super affordable at $7.00 I would totally recommend and repurchase this. @sc #sephoracollectionlove Super cute packaging and very affordable
