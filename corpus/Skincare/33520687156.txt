I am 34 and I have combination skin. I was using DekiKate earlier which is good soothing cream however I wanted to have something more moisturizing to my face at night in winters. I tried this product, First thing it’s very thick skin does not absorb it quickly; Second It gave little bumps on my face which were painful and Third It’s very expensive for a moisturizer. I have stopped using it. It May be for someone with very dry skin also I am sure there are many good alternatives in lesser price range. KateCeuticals (For very dry skin)
