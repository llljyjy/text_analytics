I really wanted to love this cleansing balm, and usually do opt for more fragrance free skincare products for the most part, but the two things I really could not get over with this product is that it was really difficult to get off once getting it on, and the smell of the balm was just very overwhelmingly strong, and not in a good way. If youâ€™re sensitive to smells, use at your own risk. nan
