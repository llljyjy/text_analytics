First off, I’m typically not a “review writer” but I am this morning! I came across this night mask one night when I was browsing through Sephoras app, and wanted a nice mask to treat my pregnant self! Those who relate, understand a nice nighttime spa day is essential! The price point honestly isn’t bad given the other price ranges per oz PLUS given the effectiveness of the product. I started my night time routine, washed my face with cleanser, added my night time moisturizer, waited 5-7 minutes and then layered this Night Mask over. Oh my word! If soft velvet came in a cream this would be it!! The product went on super smooth and easy. I did read some reviews that stated the cream was a bit on the oily side. I actually have really oily skin and super sensitive skin too and this did NOT make me feel oily at ALL, nor did it break me out!! The cream absorbs fairly quickly and leaves your skin super soft and hydrated!! Since being pregnant, my senses are super elevated and this has zero scent! The best part, I woke up super early to make my husband breakfast before work and my husband commented on my brightened yet rested complexion. Strange. The man doesn’t even notice when I chop my hair off!! Bless his heart!! I glanced in the mirror after his comment and YES! The first night of using this I could see a change in skin tone, reduction of redness, radiance and my skin was still so soft and hydrated! I am a big believer that after continued use I’ll see a HUGE difference! This product has been permanently added to my night time routine, but I’ll probably only use it 4-5 times per week as I like to use other night product based off my current skin situation. But honestly, I can see that this cream touches and helps all skin situations/problems. Go Buy This!! NOW!!
