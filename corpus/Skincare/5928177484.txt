This has got to be one of the most gentle AHA acid that I’ve tried. Due to it’s large molecular size it does not penetrate as quickly into the skin causing irritations like glyclolic acid. Instead this is a great beginner acid to have in your skincare routine. Minimal irritation, safe to use for sensitive skin. nan
