Paula’s choice has some great treatments for exfoliation but I had yet to try other products from their line. My skin is currently combination with some dry patches due to the winter so I was hoping for a cleanser that isn’t drying. This was so helpful at making my face feel hydrated after washing it in the shower. I didn’t feel like I needed to apply moisturizer right away. I think the hyaluronic acid in the formula must help with this! I also love that it is fragrance free and cruelty free and comes at a great price. nan
