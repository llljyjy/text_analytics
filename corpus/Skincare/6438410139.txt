I love this. It really opens my pores. As soon as I get out of the shower, I pay my face dry and put a generous amount on, targeting my nose. I leave it on for awhile and rinse off with luke warm water and immediately put a nose strip on. So much more comes out of my nose doing it this way than ever before. Something about this mask really opens my pores and then when I rinse it off I can see the blackheads on my nose needing to be extracted by either squeezing wiping or using a nose strip to pull the blackheads. Visibly see difference.
