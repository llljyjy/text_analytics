This creamy moisturizer is a must have for breakouts and acne prone skin. The lightweight formula is infused with squalane, glycerin and 1% of salicylic acid that provides all day hydration and clears acne and breakouts. It is oil-free and exfoliates your skin to unclog your pores and prevent new breakouts. It actively fights acne and blackheads and Iâ€™ve seen a big difference in my pores, especially around my nose. I highly recommend this for tackling pesky blackheads and preventing breakouts Goodbye blackheads & prevents breakouts!
