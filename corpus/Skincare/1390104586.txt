I bought this one a whim. It helped to clear up congestion around my nose and forehead after only 2 uses. I’m really pleased with the results. Since I bought it on sale, I have no regrets, but if I had paid over $100 for it, I think I’d be disappointed as I’m not sure that it does a better job than manually extracting pores. Also, the high frequency scares my dog so I can’t use it when she is around. high pitch frequency scares dogs
