Was able to fit this back into my budget because this peel does add up to all it claims. Pricey yes, worth it hands down. I only use it every 2-3 days to last longer and I also have sensitive skin. I definitely notice a difference in pore size, smoother skin and my serums and moisturizer seem to absorb better as well. My 55 year old face definitely looks far better for using this product. It works! nan
