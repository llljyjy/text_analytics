I received a small sample size (Enough for a week’s use) from Influenster. In that short amount of time I can only say that when I first applied it, it was a little greasy, but absorbed pretty quickly. My skin felt nice and smooth. It also felt very hydrated after use. I can’t comment on long term use unfortunately. I have a feeling it would continue to hydrate my skin. Good product
