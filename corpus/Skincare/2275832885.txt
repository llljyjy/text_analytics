Aside from the smell, I thoroughly enjoyed using this product. I use it once in the morning and once at night before my moisturizer, and it absorbs right into my skin, and layers on my skin care routine so wonderfully. My skin feels so smooth and bright after using it the past 2 weeks. It’s a little pricey at $88 CAD, but I will be putting it on my repurchase list; though it won’t be at the top of the list, the scent just puts me off a little but it doesn’t warrant docking off a star. I would recommend this for any skin type! I am nearing 40 and I think this product worked great! GREAT PRODUCT!
