I received this product complementary from Clinique and Influenster for my honest review. First I just have to say that I love Clinique products and always have. I was very excited to get to be apart of the launch. This product is amazing just like the rest of Clinique products. Itâ€™s non greasy as it glides on. It feels like it a heavier cream but as you put it on it blends right into the skin for a firmer feel. It is full of peptides to help firm and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. What I love about Clinique is that all of their products are 100% fragrance free. Clinique smart eye
