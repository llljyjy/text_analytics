I have been using this product since 10 days now and I believe it has worked well on my skin. I can feel elasticity of my skin changing for better. It is not greasy which gives this product an edge over others. I apply it in small quantities and even that has worked wonders for my skin. This cream does not dry up my skin which is a good feature of this repair treatment. I will definitely continue using it till I see a difference on my skin. Effective repair treatment
