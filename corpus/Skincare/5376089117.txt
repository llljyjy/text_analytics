I really like this cream. I got it free to try and I love it. It made my lines and wrinkles really less noticeable. Itâ€™s got a mild scent that goes away quickly. My skin feels very soft. It did dry skin in certain spots but it could just be my weird combo skin. I will be buying this as my face moisturizer. nan
