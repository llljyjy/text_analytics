Absolutely love the sunscreen formula itself. Best one I’ve tried between the comfort and how lightweight it feels on the skin. Doesn’t dry my skin out like most mineral sunscreens, but unfortunately I’ve had the same packaging issue as other reviewers. I’ve had this for 2 months and the purple part has almost completely worn off. It continues to flake off which ends up getting on my hands and onto my face while I’m applying the sunscreen. Super frustrating and hoping Tatcha can repackage this because I love the formula so much! Amazing besides packaging
