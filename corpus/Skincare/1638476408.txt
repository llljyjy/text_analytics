I received this product for free for my unbiased review. I had high hopes given the exotic sound of the ingredients however that left abruptly after trying the product a few times. I don’t think it did anything bad or good to my skin. It leaves a sticky film on my skin that doesn’t bode well for makeup application. It feels like if you were to squish those kids water beads and rub them all over your face. I’ve used different kinds of abrasive products be it mechanical or chemical and this one seemed like it had no exfoliating effect...or cleaning effect. My skin felt dirtier if at all possible. Now I’ve tried worse products...I went through a stint of giving dollar store face products a try ..that was worse...possibly. but I’ve also had better products on my face that did more for my skin around the $3 mark. So I’d say this product did not work for me. But I can see it working for someone with maybe all over dry skin that doesn’t like a lot of grit or chemical reaction of an abrasive product. Not for me....dry skin consumers maybe?
