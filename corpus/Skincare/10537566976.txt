This eye cream is the perfect consistency. It’s thick, but not too thick. It’s more of like a whipped texture. It wears well under makeup and hasn’t disrupted any of my concealers. I don’t feel like I’ve been using it long enough to see any long term effects. But so far I really enjoy it! Beautiful Eye Cream!
