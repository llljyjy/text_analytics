(I used a clay mask for reference) It doesn’t say this on the packaging, but I wet the mask a little before massaging it, which you could do with your handy dandy tool w/ the other side of the bristles! My back hurts after I wash my face over the sink, so reducing that is a huge plus. It takes a while to massage with the mask I used, but I’d rather take massage my face standing up or sitting down than having to be bent over scrubbing my face away for the same amount of time, maybe even longer. highly recommend! reduces back pain!
