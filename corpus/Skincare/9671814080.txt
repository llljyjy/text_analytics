Of course this is an expensive moisturizer, but I will agree that it is worth it. The cheaper creams I have used never feel great, and tend to just sit on top of the skin. This sinks in quickly, feels nice and airy on the skin, but also leaves it soft. Other than preventing dryness, I could not say whether this product served any other benefit to my skin - it is difficult to tell, as I have a steady skincare routine with good (mainly YTTP) skincare products. The brand overall is lovely and has made a positive impact on my skin. I have now finished two containers of this cream. Expensive but worth it
