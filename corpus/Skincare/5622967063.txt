I received this as a sample through I N F L U E N S T E R for review purposes and honestly it’s hard to give anything other than a first impression. It is light weight and smells good. My skin does feel soft. The sample itself seemed to have inconsistent product so I’m not sure if I was using it how it would be used out of the bottle. My under eyes did feel hydrated but I’m not sure it was smoother. My under eyes didn’t feel much further but the sample I received was only for seven days. Lightweight & hydrating
