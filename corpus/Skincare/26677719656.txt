YESS ONE THOUSAND TIMES OVER. This smells so freaking good it’s my favorite cleanser. Other cleansers kinda smell weird like the Drunk Elephant one which was kind of disappointing BUT THIS ONE DID NOT LET ME DOWN. If you have hormonal breakouts or random breakouts pls buy this. I haven’t had a breakout since using this consistently. The tiny bottle lasted me about 3 1/2 months bc I only use one pump. I’d recommend applying water to your face prior to the cleanser, putting a pump in to your hands and adding a tiny amount of water just to create a lather and then scrub away! My favorite, I swear it cleared up some of my clogged pores and after use I can see my pores are smaller! MY HOLY GRAIL CLEANSER
