I have been using this product for about a month. I immediately noticed increased moisture in my skin. After a month of use Iâ€™ve seen reduced redness and my skin looks less dull. I love the light floral scent but if fragrance bothers you it may be an issue. The texture is light and easily absorbs into the skin. Loving so far
