Can only be used as a top layer for the actual moisturizer (oil, balm, cream or anything else). Used it first night - was happy with texture, it was nice and thick. Woke up with dry lips. Second and third night make it worse. Iâ€™m big fan of Tatcha, but with this one... My lips was much happier without it. Only as top layer for actual moisturizer
