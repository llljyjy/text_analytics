Product itself worked well for me, I found after using it for a few weeks under my eyes looked less tired. However, the pump isn’t great. It worked fine until there was about 1/3 left and it stopped pumping. Have to use a w-tip now to get the remaining product out (which is a fair amount) Worked well but pump isn’t great
