I had never tried a product by belif before, but I will 100% buy this product again. The smell is delicious to me! And it rubs into my skin beautifully. It leaves my skin soft without any greasiness or feeling like there is an extra layer on my face. In the morning (after putting it on at night) my skin is still soft and feels plump!! Love this stuff! Pricey but worth it
