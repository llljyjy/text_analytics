I was gifted this product to try and give my honest review. This is definitely an investment. A little goes a long way and it does leave my under eyes feeling very hydrated. It absorbs quickly and has a nice light scent. If you are in the market for a new eye cream and are willing to make an investment, I do recommend this one. nan
