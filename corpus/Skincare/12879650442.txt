This product is great for nights when my skin needs a little extra moisture and help. My combination skin particularly loves this in dry cold weather. It doesnâ€™t feel overly greasy but is still thick and sinks into the skin nicely. I have topped moisturizers and used it on its own. A little goes a long way. Great when you need some extra moisture
