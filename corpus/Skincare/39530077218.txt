I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honesty opinion and when I knew they were sending it to me I did some research on the Dior Capture Totale Le Serum and the claims were that there would be a significant change within 7 days of using this product so I legit tested these claims out! I added this face Serum to my night time skin care routine (I only used once per day) for 7 days straight. To be completely honest I did not notice a significant difference, the main improvement that I saw was it did even out the lines around the sides of my eyes a fraction. The main thing I was excited about was the claim of adding elasticity back to the skin, I have lost alot of weight over the last couple of years and I have been looking for a product that would help the little bit of loose skin on my neck, but I really did not notice a difference using this product. The product applied nicely and a little bit went a long way! I thought the smell was nice but pretty strong and although scented skincare products don’t bother me at all, I just wanted to point this out in case anyone reading this review might be sensitive to smell or scented products. I am still using it every night to see if there might be anymore improvement but I received the product on 12/14/2022 my 7 days ended on 12/21/2022 and I am writing this review on 12/27/2022 so I have been using it daily for 13 days and I still don’t really see much of a difference sadly. Overall a decent product but I don’t think I would repurchase.... I attached 1 picture after the first use (I’m wearing the lighter Grey shirt) and 1 picture after the 7th use (I’m wearing the darker Grey shirt) for reference. Decent face serum
