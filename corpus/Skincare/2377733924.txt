Love this sunscreen. Texture is light and absorbs great on skin. Doesnâ€™t leave any weird color on the skin and wears amazing under makeup (better than Unseen Sunscreen) . Only issue is with the packaging, it flakes so be mindful of your hands when applying the product. This needs to come to Canada! Fave sunscreen, has replaced my Supergoop
