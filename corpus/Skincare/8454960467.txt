I love that it’s very creamy and hydrating. I have dry skin, so I apply moisturizer before applying two fingers of sunscreen and it leaves my face so smooth and glowy. The glow/shine eventually dissipates but still leaves my skin really soft and plump. It doesn’t pill, sting or makes your makeup look weird. On the contrary, it works amazing as a primer and makes your makeup look fresh, smooth and not cakey AT ALL. It’s honestly a staple in my routine now. If it were spf 50 it would be my all time favorite sunscreen. One of the best sunscreens out there!!!!!
