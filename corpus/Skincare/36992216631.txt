This cleansing balm felt just like lip balm so I was a bit skeptical at first. I applied a small bit to my face and it was able to remove all my makeup and mascara. Washing it off felt like using a gentle cleanser. It left no residue when I was done. After using the cleansing balm, my skin had a soft touch after it dried. I like this product because it easily removed my makeup and left my skin feeling soft. First time trying a cleansing balm
