I received a sample size of this cream from Influenster, and I was really satisfied with the results. The cream was o medium thickness and it went on smooth and absorbed perfectly. It felt very hydrating and did not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. I used it day and night, and my skin was really happy with it. The sample was too small to be able to say anything about its anti-wrinkle abilities, but I think it felt awesome on my skin. @Clinique, @Influenster, #CliniqueSmart Smart Cream
