I love the light-weight gel texture on my skin. I noticed my skin looks brighter and more even tone after the first night. However, I also get tiny red bumps after the usage. I think perhaps it’s a good active ingredient but some of the inactive ingredients cause me to have the reactions. I’m returning this, I’m sorry it’s just not for my skin. I’ll continue to search for products that works for my skin. Does the job but give me bumps
