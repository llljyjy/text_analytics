Mehhhh, it was ok. I’ve tried a good amount of oil make up removers and by far Biossance is the winner. I had high hopes for this one, but the scent was unpleasant and it didn’t remove full coverage of stubborn residue like I expected it. Of course I followed with a double cleanse, but as a first step it didn’t do it for me. Biossance is better.
