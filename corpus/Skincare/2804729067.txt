The relief and resilience treatment has made my skin less shiny & has a more even tone. It does have a unique smell but it isn’t overpowering for me. I apply a few drops on a cotton pad and use it in place of my toner. My pores began appearing smaller after just a few uses. I love that it’s for both AM & PM. A great new addition to my skin care regime nan
