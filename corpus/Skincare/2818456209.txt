I was so excited to receive this sample but was disappointed with the way it looked on my skin tone :(. Very white tone that is definitely not for people with darker complexion. Packaging is nice and has an oily application to it which I donâ€™t mind because it really is not oily. But I cannot look past the tone because I cannot use for that reason. See my picture. Bummer
