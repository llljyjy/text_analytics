Love the product it at hacks the area that it needs to get better, and the fact that it contains salicylic acid. It helps reduce any signs of redness and information, and five seconds at night so I applied at night before bed so far and it has been great. This was gifted to me by Murad Skincare A must have for acne prevention!
