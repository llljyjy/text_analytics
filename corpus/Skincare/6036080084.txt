The oil free sunscreen was decent. I have combination skin and get oily in my T-zone area and sometimes chin. It did have a white residue to it and at first was peeling up a little but overall not bad. The scents are beachy so just be ready for that. I had a slight breakout but after a weeks time it got better. I also have sensitive skin. nan
