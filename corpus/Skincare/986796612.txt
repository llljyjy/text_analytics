This isn’t a bad moisturizer, just not for dry skin. I don’t wear foundation, so I basically use my moisturizer almost like a primer beneath my face powders. This breaks down under my Dior powder every single time, and it looks like my face is peeling. It’s pretty ugly looking. Would be fine for someone with normal skin who doesn’t wear a lot of face makeup. Won’t repurchase. Not For Dry Skin
