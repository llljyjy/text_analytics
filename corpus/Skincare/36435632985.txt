I was excited to try a Dior product as their reputation precedes them and wow it was as great as I had hoped. The OFF/On cleanser foams well and has a creamy texture to it while preparing it in your hands. Once I applied it to my face the scent was lovely and light not over powering and quite refreshing. The feel of the cleanser on my skin almost felt like a cream more than a cleanser and once I rinsed it off my face felt smooth, clean and refreshed. I will be making this part of my daily routine going forward and might have to add more Dior products to my beauty regime. You will not be disappointed in this product. Lives up to its reputation
