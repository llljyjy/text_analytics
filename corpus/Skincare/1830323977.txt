I also found this hurt my skin. It’s a lot better if there’s moisturizer down first. I guess they’re designed for oily skim. But there should be a warning. For pores, I wasn’t impressed, I prefer just a cream or mud mask. But I cut these up and use them on whiteheads. And I actually love them for that. nan
