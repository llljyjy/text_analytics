I was fortunate to be able to try a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum through the Topbox Circle (#trywithtopbox) program. The serum has a pleasant scent which is not overly strong. It absorbs quickly into the skin - making it appear more plump. Due to the size of the sample, I cannot comment on longer term benefits but I have enjoyed all of the Clinique products that I have tried/purchased in the past so would recommend trying. #freeproduct nan
