This is my go-to daytime moisturizer! As my skin changed and got a little drier, this product comes in and restores all hydration which makes it so much easier to apply primer and makeup. Even if it’s a makeup-free day, it’s great to just keep skin well hydrated. I’m a fan Belif’s night mask and lip mask too. nan
