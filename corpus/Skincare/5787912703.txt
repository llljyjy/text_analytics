I have been using this mask for three weeks. HOLY soft skin! If I could, I would re-name this mask to something like cloud skin, yeah, because the skin feels that soft. I have tried so many masks, but nothing like this. This mask leaves my skin feeling clean and soft; what else could I ask? Also, it has no scent, and a little goes a long way. I would buy it in a heartbeat. Softest Skin- Are you ready?
