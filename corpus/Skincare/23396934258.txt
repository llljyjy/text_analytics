The only moisturizer that has worked on my oily skin! I also love that it leaves you looking dewy after. I will say that it isn’t for those with dry skin, since i do have some dry spots around my face and I almost always have to put a second layer on those parts so that they aren’t left dry. I never write reviews but this is definitely THE product that made me feel I had to just to share how good it is. 10/10 Recommend
