I am not able to give this product 5 stars due to the fact that I was not able to use it long enough to see a full result. As I did use it, I liked how the serum made my face feel without making it feel sticky like other serums I have tried have. This serum is nice and light and leaves the skin feeling moist without needing more moisturizer. It did take me a bit to figure out the samples I received for free, but look forward to having some left to take for travel. nan
