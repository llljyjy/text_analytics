YUZU-C Glow-On Shot Serum is excellent for the skin. I received this product from Influenster and I am grateful because it was the first time I tried this brand. This Serum is easy to spread on the face, it does not leave your skin sticky or heavy. On the contrary, it leaves your skin soft. I use it first, then the Waso eye gel, face moisturizer plus sunscreen. I recommend it for people who want to have more shine on their faces! Don't forget to shake the serum before using it
