This eye cream was pretty nice,  definitely a gel, it was easy to apply and absorbed well into the eye area. My eye area felt comfortable and well hydrated after application, but not overly hydrated to be greasy. It was the perfect amount of moisture. Upon application I noticed how well the gel absorbed and how it hydrated the eye area. However I did not really see any improvement in my fine lines or dark circles. This product specifically claims to get rid dark circles as well, but it didn’t get rid of mine over the one month of usage , so I don’t know how beneficial it is for that. I did appreciate that the fragrance was kept to a minimum. Overall, I would recommend this to someone looking for a light everyday gel eye cream, but not so much for someone who’s looking for some strong brightening under eye care or antiaging properties. It was alright
