Have you ever woken up in the morning and the air is heavy and thick with heat, and you dread having to wash your face with warm water? well this face wash will honestly make you want to get up and out of bed. after using this for the first time last summer, i was very exited to use it every morning, or after spending many hours in the lake/ocean. Its refreshing, cooling and dare i say brightening? the smell alone makes me smile. my acne didnâ€™t scar as much either during the months i used this... idk if that has any correlation. its so GOOD HURRAH! YOUTH!
