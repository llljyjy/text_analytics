This was my first time using this product and OMG. I’m so happy I got to review it!! I used the whole bottle until it was completely empty, down to the last drip before I decided to write my review. This retinol serum it A+++++ It’s been a month. I used it day and night. Three drops each time for a full face after cleansing. If you have acne prone skin it can make you have a Pimple pop up here and there byr it’s only for the first few days as your skin adapts to the change. It kept my skin completely clear afterwards. NO surprise pimples. My face is also much smoother & pores shrunk dramatically. I will be purchasing my next bottle ASAP as this is a new staple in my beauty routine. You won't regret it!!
