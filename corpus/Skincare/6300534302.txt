There are many pros and cons to this self tanner. My skin is pasty white on the regular, but when I use this product I always get the colour Dark as I’m able to achieve the colour I want much faster. When you are able the achieve your desired colour, following 24-48 hours of applying, realizing areas you missed, reapply, etc. the colour is very stunning, and it lasts for quite some time. I was worried about initially trying dark because my skin is very pale, but trust me its a very beautiful and realistic colour. You can shower normally, and reapply in areas you think need reapplying. It does not, however, like to stay in areas where your body tends to sweat aka your underarms, underboob, etc. I find after you’ve sweat off those areas, if you try to reapply it without taking it all off first it just doesn’t work, however I’m a sweaty Betty all summer long so that may just be me.Now, for when it’s time to take it off. You will be able to tell when its time as your skin starts to look very speckled, the tan will almost rub off your skin along with your dead skin cells. When this happens, it is physically impossible to try to fix it with more product, you just have to take it all off of you and start again. This could mean a 1-2 day process. Even though there are times when it does somewhat rub off, I find this tanner to be incredibly difficult to remove. I would highly recommend the St. Tropez Tanner Eraser as well as their Tan Build Up Remover Mitt. If you use these two products together to remove your self tanner, it is so much easier. Use the tanner eraser before you shower, in the shower, as well as the mitt. The mitt will work best after your skin has been in the water for a couple minutes, just be prepared to have a sore arm afterwards. The mitt is also amazing for exfoliating your body, even without trying to scrub away self tanner. hate to love, love to hate
