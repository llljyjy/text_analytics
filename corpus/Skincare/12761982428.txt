I am so happy that I finally found a spray that works for me. I have naturally dry skin, but with my hyperhidrosis, it just makes it that much more difficult to find something tailored to my unusual skin type. I spray it two-three times on ea h part of my face before mouisturizer and I’ve noticed a big difference in a short amount of time. My skin is less irritated and inflamed. My face acne hurts less and is becoming less noticeable. I reccomend this spray for anyone with acne, even if you think you’re not compatible. This Has Changed My Skin
