I had the opportunity to try this serum for free in exchange for my honest review. Gah! I am so upset I did not take a before and after photo because this serum is a game changer! It is literal luxury in a bottle and made a notable difference on my fine lines and uneven facial tones! I have incredibly sensitive skin and this product never caused inflammation, burning, dry or redness, etc. While this product is a bit on the expensive side, hands down it is worth it! So ladies- and gentlemen…if you’re in your mid 30 somethings, or older, or even younger, and are looking for a youth renewing and repairing solution…you’ve found it!!! Ask for it for Christmas, your birthday, Hanukah, or any other occasion, or simply treat yourself and ENJOY!!!! Literal LUXURY in a Bottle!
