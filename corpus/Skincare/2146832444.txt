I had been struggling to find a cleanser that was gentle on my super sensitive skin but still works. This cleanser is very gentle and non irritating. My skin looks clearer, less red, and feels clean (but not dry) after using for over a month. I have combo skin and this does a great job of not drying me out or over moisturizing. Love it and will be buying another when mine runs out! very gentle but clean
