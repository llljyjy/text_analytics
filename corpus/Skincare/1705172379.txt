I never write reviews but EIGHT DOLLARS for this actual WITCH MAGIC?! I was super hesitant to buy this since it’s an oil which tends to inflame my perioral dermatitis around my nose and eyelids. I usually can only tolerate aloe vera during a flare-up, but aloe is never moisturizing enough. This stuff is pure gold. I use it last kind of as a sealant after my moisturizer or serum. I love it over my Murad Retinol serum or moisturizer. Normally, I get a little peeling from my retinol, but this let’s my skin regenerate without looking like a crackhead. It makes my skin feel so soft in the morning without feeling oily since I have combo skin. I use it in my hair and on my abused cuticles too! Such a great multi-use product and it simplifies my routine while costing $40 less than the fancy alternatives I’ve tried. Haven’t had any perioral dermatitis since I’ve used it. Perioral Dermatitis approved!
