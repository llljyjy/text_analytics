Got a sample size and tried it for a few times. The texture was the one I like, smooth, not greasy and it’s easy to be absorbed. My skin was on a trouble in this allergic season, and it didn’t make it worse, and my skin feels soft and smooth. However, it’s not hydrating enough for my super dry skin, it may be good for summer, but not winter nan
