I received this product complimentary from Influenser in exchange for my honest review.The sample size product was enough for about 2 uses. I was a bit confused where this was supposed to fit into my beauty routine - I originally used it as a moisturizer but I think I was still supposed to use my moisturizer as well. From what I did see, it was really hydrating and not sticky. Easy to apply and went on well. Would consider purchasing the full size to try it out for a longer period! nan
