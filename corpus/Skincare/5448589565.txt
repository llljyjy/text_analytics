I think this is the perfect product for when you don’t want to wear too much makeup, but still want to look put together. I wore this product with a little bit of mascara when going out to dinner and loved it. I used a primer before applying the product according to the directions and it melted into my skin nicely. As other users have described, the smell is a bit strong but it isn’t a deterrent for me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for light coverage. nan
