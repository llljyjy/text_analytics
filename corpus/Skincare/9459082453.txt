I was expecting this to be more like a serum (comparing to other brands with resurfacing peels) but it is much more like a toner, and in fact, it feels like this product was just rebranded from their previous kombucha/aha toner (the 11%). It works fine, but I donâ€™t notice any major difference between this and the other product that was marketed as a toner. I feel like a little transparency here would be appreciated. How is this different/the same as the 11% AHA that they used to have in their line? nan
