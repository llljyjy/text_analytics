My number 1. I live in a dry climate and my lips shrivel up easily, so I always need a hydrating/plumping/refreshing lip product to start and end my day or after I brush my teeth or anytime my lips need a refresh. I don’t consider this a gloss but a treatment. It IS thick, don’t overapply, and I will blot excess before applying lipstick. I usually also wet my lips just before putting it on so the hyaluronic acid can suck the moisture into my lips. The cap used to be terrible but since they redesigned the cap (plain white tube, late 2021?) I can now carry it safely in my purse and that prompted me to speak up and give it some love! It will make your lips red for the first few minutes (in a good way) but it’s true what people say, if you put it over your lip line it will look dumb at the beginning. I’ve always needed/sought out products like this, (my go-to was Lip Fusion XXL before the company went out of business) and now that there are so many on the market this has shaken out as my hands down favourite, I’ve purchased it at least 3 times. Primarily as a TREATMENT. Followed by lip colour products after waiting and blotting. 5 stars now the cap is redesigned
