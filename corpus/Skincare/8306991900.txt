I honestly thought $10 was expensive for the simple ingredients it has. Boy was I wrong. This has to be the most hydrating Lip balm I own. It doesn’t even feel sticky or thick. I can’t stand the feeling of sticky products on my skin. And it hydrates so quickly. My usual go to is my fresh sugar lip balm. But I think this one is more hydrating. I was scared I would have packaging issues like other reviews, but mine came perfectly intact (as it should). The combination of good ingredients and good application and good results = five stars Not sticky or thick but still hydrating
