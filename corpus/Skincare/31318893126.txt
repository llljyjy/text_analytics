I’ve been using this toner in my morning and night routines for the past three weeks and I am loving my skin. I have hormone acne and dry skin, and this doesn’t irritate my breakouts and makes my skin so bouncy! Of every toner and essence I’ve tried, this is the most hydrating. My skin just drinks it up! When I’m feeling dry, I can use just a layer of this as a nice pick me up, and it gives me a good glow too. Obsessed and will be getting another! nan
