I purchased this looking for a sunscreen different from my usual Colorescience and EltaMD and thought I’d give this a try. I loved the glow-y look and texture, but not the fragrance. Wore it out a couple of times on a sunny day and wondered why my skin was red at day’s end. I checked the ingredients and discovered it had two citrus oils (bergamot & orange peel) in the ingredient list. Citrus oils can cause a reaction when exposed to sunlight, like a serious sunburn! My skin was red and itchy for days. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this sunscreen. So disappointing!
