I was really excited to use this because I love turmeric in my products and needed something for my hyperpigmentation. But this serum is so thick that when I use this with or even without face cream my face feels super congested and my pores feel clogged. Idk how to explain this but it feels like it doesn’t sit well on my skin and doesn’t let my skin breath. I’ve been using this for almost 3 weeks now I think and I still haven’t seen a difference with my skin.. no brightness, and my hyperpigmentation and dark spots are still the same.. won’t continue using this not happy with the consistency
