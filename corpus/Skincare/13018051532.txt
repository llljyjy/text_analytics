I received this product complimentary for testing purpose from Influenster and Peter Thomas Roth in the #PTREvenSmoother VoxBox. I’ve been using it for a week now, I feel my skin smoother and the pores seem smaller but haven’t seen any change in my uneven skin yet, but this probably need longer use to see the results. The first time I applied to my skin felt a tickling, but nothing annoying. The pads are round, very thin and smaller than other brands. The good thing about this pads is that are truly wet and loaded with the active ingredients. The packaging is very simple, yet is completed sealed which is good to keep the pads hydrated. Very humid exfoliating pads
