I usually use Cerave in the evening, I have added this to my morning routine. I like it. It is very smooth and light and makes my face feel silky but not sticky.  I enjoy the light cucumber smell… it isn’t a chemically smell just fresh. I will continue using this in the morning and the spf is a plus! Fresh scent
