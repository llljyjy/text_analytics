I rarely write reviews, but felt I had to after recently learning that Laneige tests on animals. I have bought a few jars and admit the product is pretty good. But not good enough for me to continue giving money to a company that abuses animals. There are other lip masks I have used that are just as good as Laneige, so it’s not really something I’ll have a hard time replacing in my skincare routine. It’s a shame this brand has been promoted so much and not many know about its animal testing. But hopefully reading reviews like this can spread awareness and encourage others who care about animal cruelty to look elsewhere! Laneige tests on animals
