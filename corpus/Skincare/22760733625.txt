I love the packaging! Just the look of everything made me super excited to try it out. The scent and feel of this product is smooth and satisfying. Application is simple and easy. I tried it mostly after my skincare routine and a few times after eye makeup was applied. Either way it gives a revitalizing, cooling sensation that lasts and perks you right up! The shimmer is not overpowering, but adds just a slight something extra to your look. If you like a super subtle highlight, this soothing eye stick is for you! And everything about the product and packaging says high quality. Give it a try! You wonâ€™t be sorry! Soothing and Shimmering - but not too much!
