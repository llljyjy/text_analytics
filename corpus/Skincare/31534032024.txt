I received this product as a free sample for my honest opinion. This is kind of a gel but creamier. It really does moisturize. I was getting a little bit of flaky skin from wearing masks recently that exfoliant and peeling masks just weren’t helping with. After three days of use in the am and PM the area was healed and the skin tone looks more even. After a week of use there was a big difference. I normally break out when starting a new product and that didn’t happen with this. The only complaint i had was it did seem to effect the stay of my makeup but that could be my foundation or setting spray brands while using it. Works for dried or peeling skin.
