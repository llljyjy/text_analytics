I received this product free from shiseido and influenster for review purposes. I really like this moisturizer. It feels creamy and luxurious. The scent is subtle and pleasant. This moisturizer plays well with my tinted SPF I use regularly as well as powder and liquid/serum foundations. I have sensitized skin, and my skin loved this moisturizer. nan
