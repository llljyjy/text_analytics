The reviews saying it’s half full clearly don’t know how little 1.7oz actually is. Its just in a big bottle. You’re not getting ripped off if you know how to read a label correctly. Most sunscreens are in bottles too big for the amount in there so you’re tricked into thinking you got more.  Do your researched and use your brain before leaving a bad review on a good product. (Also make sure you’re not using it wrong before you say it’s bad) GOOD
