I wish I was but unfortunately I’m not joking when I say this product smells like rancid farts. It is awful and I can smell it all day or night when I wear this product. It is a gross consistency, really goopy and it feels tacky once applied which I hate. Other than it being sticky and stinky it also didn’t treat my acne nor did it fade any pigmentation. I used up the entire tube. sticky and stinky
