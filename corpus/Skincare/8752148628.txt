This product made me breakout and develop texture all over my forehead. I’ve never had this happen with any other product my skin is not even sensitive. I think it has to do with the very strong fragrance  this product contains. Not very hydrating either I would apply it in the night and wake up with super dry skin in the morning I would have to moisturize immediately after waking up. For the price point it’s not worth there are better products out there way cheaper as well. The “glow” this product gives you is just borderline greasy and just emphasized my texture Made me breakout
