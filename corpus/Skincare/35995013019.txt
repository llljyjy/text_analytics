Great! I’m sensitive to some fragrances and I’m happy this has none. Also it hydrates without leaving skin oily. I received this #freeproduct from topbox. The sample was so small I wasn’t able to see much difference (used it for just under a week). I love the ingredients and I’m sure if the sample size was larger to get me through at least 2 weeks, I’d see improvements in my fine lines and wrinkles. I love serums. I use it before my makeup and before bed! Would love to try a full size! #trywithtopbox. Great
