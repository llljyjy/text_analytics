The first thing I have to say about this Clarins mask is the texture. When you open the jar, it looks a lot like whipped cream and yet somehow the texture is both whipped and heavy, which makes me glad because I thought it would take a lot of product to cover my face. The texture is interesting, it’s moisturizing, and it leaves my skin soft and glowy. My one beef with a product like this is that I’m pretty sure no cream can contour your face, no matter how much you wish it did. So while it might decrease puffiness, I am personally wary of claims that seem to defy science. I would recommend this product as long as you take some of its marketing claims with a grain of salt, and maybe do your own research. nan
