I was hoping I wouldn’t like this, but unfortunately I love it. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin; most oil cleansers are irritating for me. This one is smooth, has a light scent that’s wonderful (unlike other oil cleansers I’ve used that smell like cooking oil), makes my face feel so soft, takes off my eye makeup, and overall cleanses well enough that I don’t always need to use a second cleanser. Massaging this into my face feels like such a relaxing experience. Please never change this formula! soft, relaxing, soothing
