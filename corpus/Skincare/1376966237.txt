I so badly wanted to love this but after a few days of using it, it made no difference in my skin. My skin is dry to the extreme (teetering on the edge of dehydrated) and this did not offer any relief. If you have normal to slightly dry skin this will work wonders! If you have skin like mine, try another option. Not For Dry/Dehydrated Skin
