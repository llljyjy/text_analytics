I really love this product! Although it didn’t instantly depuff my eye area, it helped hydrate my fine lines immensely. I have dry skin and my concealer usually settle in my fine lines, and after a few days of using this product, my concealer looked smoother, and didn’t crease. It is a little pricey, but it is so worth it! I will be purchasing a new one as soon as mine is gone! I really love this product!
