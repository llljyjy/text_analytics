I received this Peace Out Retinol Face Stick complimentary from the brand in exchange for my honest review on it. First off, I love the stick shape, and how easy it is to store. However, I hate how greasy it makes me feel. I haven’t noticed any difference so far to my skin with use, but maybe it’s too soon to tell. nan
