I used to use this and switched to the Herbivore Emerald oil when I ran out about a year ago. I didn’t realize that the Herbivore oil was causing my breakouts until recently so I bought more of this Honey Grail, and my breakouts cleared overnight. I wouldn’t consider this a lightweight oil like the description says as it’s a bit heavier compared to the Herbivore Emerald, but I definitely think this one is worth it. nan
