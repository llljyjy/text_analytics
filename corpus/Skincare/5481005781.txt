This product takes some finessing to get a good result. I have dry / combo skin and am pretty fair with freckles. The first time I tried it I used too much and really was disappointed all around. The white cast was bad, the texture on my skin felt heavy like an intense sunscreen, and it caught the dryness of my skin in an unflattering way. The second time I tried it, I used a light oil on my face after my skincare / moisturizer to lock in the moisture better and THEN applied a much smaller amount of the Dr. Jart. Also, I rubbed it around in my hands first instead of directly on my face. The overall effect looked really nice and much better than the first time! I will say this is NOT a good product for people with darker skin :/ the white cast will definitely show up in the worst way. nan
