I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. The container is cute, I like that it comes with the applying stick so it’s less messy if you have long nails. The scent is nice. It’s quite thick when you apply it and does leave a bit of heavy sticky sensation. I only apply at night as I prefer a lightweight creams during the day. I did wake up with smoother skin, but does it keep skin hydrated for 100 hours? No. Smells nice but sticky sensation
