I received a week’s worth sample of this product from Butterly. Overall I enjoyed the product which absorbed well and didn’t leave any shine. It had a pleasant scent and was not overpowering. It moisturized well and my skin felt good all day. Unfortunately my skin didn’t show any real improvement with fine lines or firming, but the week I chose to use the sample my skin was temperamental. For a true test perhaps a two week trial would have been helpful? I wasn’t a huge fan of the dual portion of the sample (perhaps the full size is different), as it seemed to be unevenly distributed in the packages. Overall as a serum it felt great and worked well, I’d love to try longer term to see if it helps improve my skin! Moisturizing
