The packaging it came in was simple and I appreciated that. Used on my face and neck the first night and when I woke up the next morning my eye allergies kicked in really bad. I did make sure not to apply near my eye area. Over a few days of trial and error I discovered that I am only able to use the product from the chin down to keep my eyes from acting up. No clue why I reacted this way but even just using it on the small area I can tell it works! No more turkey neck, tightened it right up! And one of my wrinkles next to my mouth has lessened so much! Even my hands look better (after applying to face and neck I rub a bit into my hands also) Very light and pleasant. My 59 year old skin thanks you. “Youth” in a jar!
