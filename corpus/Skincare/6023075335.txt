I’ve been using this serum for a few weeks and am seeing some slight improvement. I’ve used other retinol products in the past and didn’t see any changes in the first few weeks, so I stopped using it. My forehead appears smoother and the texture on my face, specifically in the hollows of my cheeks, has improved. I have used it about twice a week (about every third day), and it hasn’t caused any drying, redness, or flaking. I definitely recommend and plan to keep using. nan
