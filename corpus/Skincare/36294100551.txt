Got a sample of this in my monthly Ipsy bag. I was so stunned by what it did for my dry skin that I bought a full bottle here. I have sensitive skin and everything seems to break me out, but not this. I use it morning and night in conjunction with products by The Ordinary and my skin is looking fabulous. Thank you for this product, it is truly awesome. Wowza!
