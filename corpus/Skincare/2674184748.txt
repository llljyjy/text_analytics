I have to say, I started off loving this sunscreen. It seemed perfect! A mineral sunscreen with no white cast and a moisturizing feel? Amazing! Then, I took it on a trip with me, and I was using it every day. As of that trip, any use of this sunscreen makes me break out in an incredibly itchy, hive-like rash. I wasn’t sure that was this product to begin with, but I used it again this weekend and the reaction was clear--I only broke out where I’d applied the sunscreen. I’m not sure what ingredient is triggering this, but obviously I’m going to to stop using this formulation. I love so many Biossance products, and I don’t want to trigger any sensitivity to other items that are in my everyday rotation. I’m sad to lose this one, as when it was great, it was great! But my skin is clearly saying no now. Makes my skin angry!
