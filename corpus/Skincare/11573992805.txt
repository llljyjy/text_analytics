I love using this product. I’ve been using it for about 1 and a half months and could see that my pores have gotten smaller and there’s a lot more oil control and brightness too since I feel like the lactic acid really helped renew my skin. I also feel that my annoying acne scars have lightened. It smells and feels so good on the skin and has a completely non-oily feel to it, just make sure you’re shaking it well before applying. I usually use this in the PM for extra moisture while I’m sleeping and often pair it with innis free green tea hydrating serum (which I’m also loving and going to be repurchasing since it’s so hydrating on my dry skin). I really recommend this and can’t wait to keep using it to see better results. So far I’m loving it! Here are some pictures that I took in the same room and same lighting. The top portion is the “before” and the bottom is the “after”. I don’t use it continuously because sometimes I’m forgetful but whatever goodness has come into my skin has come through this product! magic for my skin!
