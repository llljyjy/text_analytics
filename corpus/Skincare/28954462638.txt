I really wanted to like this and make it a staple of my routine but it’s just not working for me. I love the texture and the application is super smooth, but I unfortunately breakout whenever I use it. It’s also not very moisturizing during the winter months; I usually need to supplement it with something so I don’t get too dry. It also starts to get weirdly thin once you get about midway through the bottle, and the dye gets a bit runny even after I shake it. Great concept, meh execution
