I have really sensitive skin... before this I could only use aveeno. After getting the mini size for my birthday gift, I fell in love. It not only smells light and beautiful, but it feels amazing on your skin. The best part is that you only have to use the tiniest amount which means it will last you for a long time, so it’s great for the price! It makes my skin rejuvenate and evens out my skin tone. If you’re thinking about getting this moisturizer... do it!!!!! Absolutely Amazing
