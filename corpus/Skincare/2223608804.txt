I loved the original water bank cream and have never tried a Laneige serum but this one is very nice and has the added benefit of Hyaluronic Acid. It also has that awesome Laneige smell without being too overpowering. I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. I love the weight of the packaging it’s very high quality and the way the dispenser comes out is pretty neat. Only thing I would change is the colour- perhaps a lilac or something? The blue I suppose was only selected because it’s associated with hydration and water. Nice serum cool opening device
