I received this complimentary from Influenster. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It helped with my oily skin, but I did break out worse than usual. I got a huge pimple between my nose and cheek that took forever to go away, but I figure it was bringing all of the yuck to the surface. It worked really well other than that. Definitely give it a try. Good for Oily Skin
