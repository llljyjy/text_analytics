This cream is very hydrating for my skin. I enjoyed the pleasent but light sent. This don’t leave a oily residue or a white cast on my face. This feels great on my face and neck. Great for my dry spots on my skin during the winter. I’ll recommend and continue using. Very little is needed to apply to see the results. Long lasting effectiveness. nan
