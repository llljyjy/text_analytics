I really love this moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and don’t find that it makes me too oily and doesn’t irritate my skin causing it to break out. It doesn’t clog my pores or make me break out either.  I would describe the texture of this product as a think, whipped gel. It has a nice light scent. I’m looking forward to seeing the results after use for a longer period of time. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Great moisturizer
