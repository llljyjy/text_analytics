Really enjoy this moisturizer. A little goes a long way despite the thicker consistency and the light citrus smell is not overwhelming.This is an ideal moisturizer for normal to dry skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Also worth noting after applying and allow the moisturizer to absorb into the skin it does initiatlly have a tacky feeling which acts well as a primer under makeup. Perfect Morning/Night Cream
