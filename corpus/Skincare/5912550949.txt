Due to user error I am now wearing the retinol powder but not in the way I hoped. I wasnt sure why my serum was coming out clear even after adding the powder I thought the packaged piece went on top and through the black button not realizing i needed to remove the black button portion entirely and replace it with the powder then swap it back. Well the powder was all still in the little pot thing that was supposed to push in and went all over me. I misread the instructions and should have watched the video which I have to say is not a plus that my skincare is so advanced I need a tutorial. The ingredients seem great and now that some retinol is actually mixed in I hope to see results a lot quicker. The liquid has barely any scent and the scent it does have is clean and it was a nice addition to my nightly routine before I realized I wasnâ€™t actually getting any of the powder. I like the ingredient and Kiehls but had to take away a star because I have to do laundry and it should be a bit more intuitive. A solid 3.5 stars. Watch the video for how to release the powder
