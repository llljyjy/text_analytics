I thought this product was fantastic!  I have tried many dark spot serums and most iâ€™ve seen no improvement.  This one i could finally see my blemishes lightening and starting to not be seen.  While it does take a few weeks to really start to see anything they have been lightened.  I havent really noticed any go away which is why i left it at 4 star and not 5 but i will continue to use this product and hope that it goes away fully! The serum itself is soft and not oily or greasy! very easy to use and doesnt leave residue or any bad feelings on the skin Great product that works!
