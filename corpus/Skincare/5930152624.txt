I tried the Daily Microfoliant by Demalogica because after all the time I spent outside this summer I really needed a good exfoliating product. I needed something that wasnâ€™t too harsh, but actually works. So I tried the first package and mixed the powder in my hands and put the paste on my face and rubbed it in. After one minute, I washed off the paste, I like that there were no perfume smells and literally my face was already brighter! So after days of using this I am going makeup free and I am 38 years old! Love this stuff! This was gifted by Dermalogica sampling and now I want to go buy more! Works the first time I used it
