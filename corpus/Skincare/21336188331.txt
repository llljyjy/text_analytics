I have minor oily, combination skin that has some redness. I was looking for an alternative to heavier makeups for the summer. I found that this cream made my skin very dewy, to the point of looking and feeling greasy. The colour didnâ€™t last very long during the day and I found myself breaking out because of the heaviness. Not great for oily skin
