This is one of the best creams I’ve ever used. After two weeks of using, I noticed the fine lines growing smaller and thinner. The wrinkles began to fill in and grow plump. My skin began to feel hydrated after a couple uses. It was severely dry and after two uses, it felt soft, hydrated, and even. The texture of this cream is not too thick and the scent it amazing. This is Confidence in a Cream. Quite literally. It’s in my top three favorite products (so far). Completely worth it and I would buy again. I’ve recommended it to everyone I know that needs hydration and firmer, plumper, skin. Absolutely LOVED IT Cosmetics
