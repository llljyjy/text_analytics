All self-tanners smell, but at least this one doesn’t smell right away. On application it’s a really nice watermelon scent so I don’t mind putting it on before bed. You definitely get the tanner smell the next morning but can shower it off. It’s giving me a really even glow so far and I like it! Even glow and nice scent
