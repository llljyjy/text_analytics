I’m so sad that this ultimately doesn’t agree with my sensitive skin because it definitely works! I could see a reduction in my fine lines, especially on my forehead after the first week. Sadly, my skin (which needs only the most gentle products) started to get irritated, even when only using this every other night. I really like that it’s a cream consistency rather than an oil, like my current retinol. It smells earthy, rather than floral, which I also like. It also doesn’t leave my skin looking overly-oiled. This is a great product, as long as you don’t have overly sensitive skin! nan
