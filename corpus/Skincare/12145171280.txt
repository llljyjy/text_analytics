Got the chance to try a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair - Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct with #tryitwithtopbox. I have been using this product for a bit and Its been great. The light scent is barely noticeable and this cream leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. There hasnâ€™t been a big change in my skin/wrinkles but it feels fantastic. Lightweight and leaves skin hydrated
