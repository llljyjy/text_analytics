I was looking for a sustainable razor that wouldn’t end up in the landfills, but also wanted one that was relatively affordable. This razor is absolutely amazing! I love the gorgeous pink color as well as how luxurious it feels. It’s weighted so it has a good weight to it unlike the cheap disposable razors.I do recommend watching the video on how to insert the blade in order to prevent injury. Upon first use, the razor was easy to use and did not give me any razor burn or cuts which was a pleasant surprise! Most razors tend to cut up my skin even when shaving carefully and with shaving cream so I was really excited about that. Overall, this is definitely the best razor I’ve ever used and will continue using it! This was complimentary from hanni but does not impact my opinion. Best Razor I've Ever Tried
