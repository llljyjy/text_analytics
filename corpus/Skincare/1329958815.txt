I’ve used the Sephora coconut wipes for years they were amazing they took make up off and left my skin soft and smooth. The new formula is sticky and doesn’t take make up off and the new cloths are scratchy. Really bummed Sephora you took an awesome product that didn’t need to be changed and ruined it. Now I have to find a new face wipe. Hate the new formula
