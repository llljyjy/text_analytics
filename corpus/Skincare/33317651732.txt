I’ve been using this for about a week and have to say it’s one of the only products I’ve tried where I felt a pretty immediate difference. It does leave a slight residue on my skin (it doesn’t totally absorb, in my case) but my skin does feel noticeably softer and smoother in the hours after application. I don’t love the applicator itself, since the product fall out of it without needing to squeeze the top, but I’ve gotten the hang of not losing any of it over the past few days. nan
