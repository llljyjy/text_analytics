Fenty Skin Total Cleans’r; I have so many thoughts. I don’t think I liked anything from this line, and it’s so basic that I would just buy drugstore and save some coin if I were you. It’s too thick for this type of squeeze tube. The click cap is cool but makes surfaces messy. It’s okay on Normal skin and does take makeup away, but slightly dry skin, this is a no go. The scent is strong in all their products and I get sick of scents easy, so it was a bit sickly to me. I used this so many ways, less, more, as a body wash. I just wasn’t impressed at all. So happy it’s finished, but I wish it didn’t take so long. It’s a no from me dawg
