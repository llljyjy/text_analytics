I had very good results with this product. I had some dark spot discoloration along my hairline and by my jaw on both sides of my face. These spots have significantly faded and the skin has tightened. I am 45 years old and have pretty good skin for my age but natural discoloration not due to sun exposure but mild acne. I found if I used this product all over my face it felt nice but around my nostrils where the skin is thinner it did irritate a little. The skin around my nostrils does not tolerate vitamin C very well and tends to break out a little, this was expected but tested none the less. Overall - for me, this product worked well and I will continue to purchase and recommend. I love this product and will buy again.
