this cleanser is amazing!  I got it as a sample and was so impressed with it that I broke down and made the purchase.  I normally would not spend this much on a cleanser but it is sooo worth it...  I have oily skin so I donâ€™t use it every day, but i use it in between days of my other cleanser to as to not strip my skin from the other product.  It is a must have! Buy It!  It is Worth It!
