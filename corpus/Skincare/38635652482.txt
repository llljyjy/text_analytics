I love this, it tints my lips and moisturizes but it can get chalky and waxy. I bought this in watermelon and peach, and the peach seems a bit smoother than the watermelon, I would definitely recommend because it is a good price for the product but if it was a little bit smoother that would be nice. I love how it smells Good but could be improved
