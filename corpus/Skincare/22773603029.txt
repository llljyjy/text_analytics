I purchased a sample through Sephora’s sun safety set.  It lasted me about two weeks with consistent reapplication. I wanted to like it (I did at first) but my skin just needed something different. This SPF feels like a primer, very silicon-like, and I love that texture personally but my skin would get oily 1-2hrs after applying which it hasn’t done in a long time (it’s usually 4-6 hrs or by the end of the day). Even if I used blotting paper or powder and re-apply, it would get oily so quickly again. I concluded that my skin needs more moisture from a sunscreen. I have combination skin where part of my face gets oily the other stays normal but can easily become dry. After days of using this I noticed that the texture changed slightly and the SPF became more gritty which I didn’t like since my skin is reactive + I didn’t like the feeling. Maybe I had a bad product, I’ll definitely try again in the future just in case but so far, I can’t recommend. I Wish it Worked for Me
