I have combination type of skin and this moisturizer is a holy grail. I was skeptical at first because I have such sensitive skin that anything breaks me out but this is on point! I fell inlove. I have been using this product for two weeks and so far the results are great! I have big pores and prone to blackheads and it really does the job of minimizing pores, good job tatcha ! LOOOOOVE
