I was using the Niacinamide Serum and really liked it; I tried this new one because I was looking to shrink pores on my combo-skin and heard SA was good stuff. Noooo. This is meant for someone with DRY skin. It felt so oily on my T-zone that I had to blot/wipe it with a Kleenex. I got instant, painful pimples on forehead, nose, lip area, chin. Iâ€™m going back to the Niacinamide until I find something better Oil slick! My skin broke out!
