This stuff right here has literally spoiled me. I will always repurchase this spray. I bought one to keep at home and I recently bought one to keep in my purse because I love it that much. I spray this on my face throughout all hours of the day: when I do my skincare first thing in the morning as a final step, when I’m at work or running errands and need a refresh, and at night to finish off my nighttime skin care routine. It’s not just good for skincare though. My skin is pretty dry, especially around my nose, chin and forehead. Sometimes not even my tinted moisturizer, foundation, or concealer will look fully blended and it’s just sitting on my skin. I will spray this and let it sink in for around 10 seconds. Then I’ll take my beauty sponge and gently pat the areas that need more blending and absolutely does the job. Absolutely perfect. I’ve gotten my coworkers, my friends, and my mom on this stuff and they’re asking me all the time for a quick spray. My 7 year daughter has become a little extra these days and watches me while i do my skincare and makeup. She’s now started asking me to spray her with the “spa water” lol (I use 2 maybe 3 sprays on her). If you’re on the fence about this and can get your hands on it, just buy it. I’ve used it for 2 years now and it’s been absolutely amazing. (My skin is really sensitive, dry around my nose, mouth, chin, and forehead and more combo around the rest of my face during the summertime or dry everywhere in the winter time) MY. RIDE. OR. DIE.
