This product is a literal game changer. I’ve used products from the new glow recipe plum plump cream to the tatcha dewy skin, but , they always burned the skin around my nose or made me feel a slight bit oily in my t zone when I was never oily. I’ve seen so many good reviews on this moisturizer but was skeptical due to trying the honey gel moisturizer last year and it not working out. Let me tell you, this stuff WORKS  ! It keeps me hydrated ALL DAY and I work out doors lol and it does not clog my pores or cause any breakouts what so ever. I highly reccomend this. the only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is due to me wishing there was more product in there buts it’s definetly so worth the money!!!! SKIN SAVIOR
