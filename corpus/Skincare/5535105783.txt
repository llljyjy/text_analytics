I love this product. I have repurchased many times but always a whole new container due to ready bad reviews on the refill. This last time I thought, how hard could it be to get a refill in? Hard. And it doesn’t work. And you will lose a lot of product in the process and still not get it to fit in. It’s useless and it’s hopeless, i give up trying! Listen to reviews, don’t be like me lol DON’T BUY THE REFILL!
