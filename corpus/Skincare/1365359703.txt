I only write reviews after I’ve used a product for awhile.  And the INKEY Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser? A must have!  I’ve been using it for about a year and for my skin it’s perfect. I follow up with the Retinol a few times a week and the moisturizer (another product I have to review - awesome).  My skin has been consistently calm, looking refreshed, and compliments abound!  LOVE! A must have!
