I love this oil based cleanser because it does not clog your pores. I have tachta oil based cleanser which is $85 a bottle but works wonderfully except I do not believe there is pore protection. This Clinique brand on the other hand has charcoal so naturally itâ€™s perfect for minimizing pores. I love oil based cleansers as I do that first and then use a water based cleanser after to effectively cleanse the skin. The one thing I would have liked is if this came in liquid form due to me not liking to dig my nails into anything. The consistency is smooth and soft balm based and melts right into your face! Effectively melts makeup right from your face Perfect for oily skin, melts makeup away!
