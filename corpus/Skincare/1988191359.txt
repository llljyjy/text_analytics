I can’t really give a HONEST review based on only 4 applications from a very small trial size but, I did like the very subtle to almost unnoticeable smell of this moisturizer. If you are sensitive to strong smells then this is a great option to try. I have oily/combination/hormonal acne prone skin… this moisturizer did not disturb my skin. It has a little sticky texture which I’m not crazy about but it wasn’t too bad. I can’t give a review on results as I only tried it for 4 applications lol. Only 4 applications.
