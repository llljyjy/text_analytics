I received these products for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review.“ I received this product of the Clinique’s smart clinical repair, wrinkle correcting eye cream. It comes in a small but cute deep purple jar with a Metallic Chrome lid. I have been using this since I got it, about 2 weeks ago, every evening before I go to bed. (Maybe have skipped a couple nights but not in a row.) It has a very pleasant smell, actually i don’t smooth and creamy texture, buttery without the oily feeling. I have seen results but I’ve been putting it on my neck, face as well as my eye areas. The appearance of my fine lines and rough texture in certain areas are better now but in no way magically gone. It does, however, seem to “fill in these areas” making my face appear to have less wrinkles opposed to on day one. The only downside is that it’s just a sample, and although I used it on all my wrinkles that bother me, I’m almost out. If they would have given the serum that goes along with this eye cream I’d definitely buy it myself, and I can’t recommend those two together since I only have the eye cream. I would recommend that you try this, I really would. Just go to your local Clinique  and ask for a sample. And if Clinique ever came out with something that targeted “Tech-Neck” I’d definitely be hooked if it’s anything like their Smart Clinical Repair system. Received free for honest review
