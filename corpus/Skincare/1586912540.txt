I had high hopes for this product since it’s from a higher end brand. I’m 41 and am starting to get some forehead wrinkles so I need a good night cream. I really didn’t notice much of a difference between this product and every other night cream I’ve used. I’ll continue to use it and hope to see results the longer I use it. Decent night cream
