I really like this product. I haven’t even been using this product a month and my acne scars have diminished a lot. This is my first time incorporating a retinol into my skin care routine and i can definitely say its non irritating which I was definitely concerned about. Im not acne prone but i did have a break out from eating too much sugar. One thing I’ve also noticed is the amount of oil my nose produces has decreased. I have dry skin but with an oily nose and i always get these sebaceous filaments and im noticing them less and less. I highly recommend
