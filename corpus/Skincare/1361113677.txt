I was pleasantly surprised by this product! Clinique is one of those brands I’ve had a love/hate relationship with since I was 11. I adore some things (take the day off!) and despise others (looking at you clarifying lotions). I’m 40 with skin as dry as the desert and I also use a lot of actives. This moisturizer felt so nice and soothing on my skin. As I’m someone with constantly itchy skin, the soothing aspect is important. My skin felt hydrated and that hydration lasted. Usually I’ll start to feel super dry around mid-day, but I still felt moisturized through the afternoon with this product. Now, if you like beautifully scented products, this is not for you. This is fragrance-free and it smells like the components used to make it. The smell is a little strong in the jar but it fades almost immediately upon application. I hate most skincare with added fragrance so this is a non-issue got me. I’ve only been using yours for a few days, so I can’t really speak to the wrinkle repair aspect, but this is definitely a solid moisturizer that works well for dry skin and doesn’t feel heavy. Great product that feels lovely!
