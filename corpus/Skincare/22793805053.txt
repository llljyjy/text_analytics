I really love the hemp serum, I bought it initially as a gift for my little one for Christmas. I had a really discomforting blemish a while back and she brought it for me to use; with one application before bed it was virtually gone. No discomfort anymore I had to buy myself one. It’s really cheap and great for spot treatment I think it’s under hyped Hemp Blemish Zapper
