I live and breathe for this product! I loved the original moisture surge and now I love even more the 100H! Itâ€™s my tried and true. Highly hydrating almost immediately, fast absorbent, light, never greasy and feels cool to the touch, specially if you keep it in a cool or chilled room. Good for all skin types! Clinique will never die as long as they have this product. BEST HYDRATING MOISTURIZER
