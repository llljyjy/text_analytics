Love the product, but hate the dispenser on the packaging. Or should I say, lack of a dispenser. There’s no stopper on the bottle, and the product has a very thin/watery consistency, so when you go to pour out the product, it just dumps out everywhere and drips over the edge. Pretty irritating. As for the product itself, it’s very light on the skin and soaks in instantly. I find it helps more with clearing existing breakouts than necessarily preventing new ones, but I like it overall. This was gifted to me by Murad Skincare. nan
