I really enjoyed this face cream. While I wasn’t a fan of the fragrance (very mature scent), the cream was very moisturizing and left my face feeling super hydrated. The tradeoff is that it does feel a little sticky and heavy on the face, but that’s not a huge complaint for me. Before I started using it, I was dealing with some HUGE pores in my t zone. But the way they shrunk after only a couple weeks of use was amazing! So overall I’m definitely pleased with this moisturizer. I’ll probably use it more in the cold months. Reduced the size of my pores!
