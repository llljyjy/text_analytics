Wow.  I can honestly say I have not tried this moisturizer before. This is an amazing product.  My skin is not as puffy and swollen as it was a month ago.  My husband has been ill for over a year and I tend to cry more often the past year.  Crying is not great on your skin or your skin routines and for me caused lots of puffiness and blotchy skin tones.  I have been using Absolute Rich Cream Moisturizer for almost a month and I wear it in the am and pm before bed.  I have seen a dramatic change and I love it.  Definitely putting this cream into my REQUIRED beauty regimen as it did not disappoint.  See my Before and After photos below. Wow!  Skin Looks Amazing!
