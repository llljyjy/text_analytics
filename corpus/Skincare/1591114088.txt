This is a rich moisturizer that doesn’t break me out and leaves me with a gorgeous glow. I will say that on its own it does not recover my dry winter skin, retinol dryness and mineral sunscreen dehydration, but it definitely is a key player in the improvement of my skin. When I use this layered under ointment on dry patches, my skin looks incredible when I wake up. I really love that it is rich without silicones so I can layer my products. I love how it absorbs and feels on my skin. Most moisturizers sit and drag over my dry, textured parts but this is incredibly emollient. Also, I love the subtle honey smell and the jar is a bonus. I haven’t found a moisturizer that I love as much as this one and I’ve tried so many. If you have very dry skin and use a lot of peels, acids or retinols, this is for you. Helps winter & retinol dryness without breakouts
