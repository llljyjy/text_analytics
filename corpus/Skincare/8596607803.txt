To preface: I have very dry, sensitive and acne prone skin. I’ve been on the hunt for a moisturizer that will be good for me in the summer, in the winter I need thick creams, but in the summer something that occlusive makes me get horrible breakouts. But I also need something that will be moisturizing enough to prevent flakiness. It’s hard to find products that are just in the middle. This product does just that. It feels soothing on the skin, dries down well (if you don’t put too much) and is very inexpensive. If you are looking for something that isn’t overly moisturizing, simple and isn’t going to cost an arm and a leg you’re in the right place. perfect summer moisturizer
