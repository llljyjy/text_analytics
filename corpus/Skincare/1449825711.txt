I really enjoyed this serum! I received a sample size from Influenster and used most of the product up and would definitely consider purchasing when I am ready for a new vitamin c serum. I can’t speak to the effectiveness as I just didn’t have the product long enough or enough of the product to see results. I did like the lightweight feel of the product and also the fact the product absorbed fairly quickly. Some vitamin c serums will break me out but I had no issues with this one. Great affordable option, especially when Sephora runs 30% off Sephora collection items :) A great vitamin c option
