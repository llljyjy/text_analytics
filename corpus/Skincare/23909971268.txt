I bought this due to a lot of recommendation, but I haven’t honestly seen any difference in my skin. It really doesn’t do anything more than any other clay mask. There are far more affordable (with more product for its price) clay mask options on the marker. Really underwhelmed, and disappointed): I heavily recommend if you’re new to clay masks, to try a more affordable option first. You can save a lot more money and gain footing/experience with clay masks before splurging on lux brands - it really doesn’t do anything different or new unless you’ve never used clay masks before )): Just get a normal claymask.
