I was kindly gifted by INN BEAUTY to try their new Face Glaze! Iâ€™m a big fan of minimal makeup, and this product was the perfect addition to my everyday makeup. This product can either be worn alone, as a primer, mixed with foundation, or as a highlighter - to name a few! I personally loved wearing this product alone or as a primer.  Both ways left me with the perfect glow. A little goes a long way with this product, but it blends beautifully. Would recommend! nan
