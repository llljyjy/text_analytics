This was an item given to me by influenster for my honest opinion. I really like the packaging and thought it had a nice no not too overpowering. I was hoping to enjoy this as I am starting to have mature skin at 35 and I smoke. I live where it gets very dry in the winter so I was really hopeful that this would be a great cream for me. I only used it three times because it made me break out so bad. Perhaps it’s one of those things you just have to push through but I didn’t have a large enough sample that it would be worth it to enjoy the results after acne. My skin is normally very clear so I did not enjoy this product and I would not buy this. nan
