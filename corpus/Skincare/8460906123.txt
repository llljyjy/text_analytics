I feel like ppl don’t know how to use it properly, that’s why they disliked it. You have to use it on dry skin, then emulsify it, and then use another face cleanser (double cleansing). Ppl who use long lasting makeup and/or SPF, you do want do to this to prevent acne, bumps and clogged pores.It helped me tremendously, but if you use it alone, you’ll hate it for sure! A must-have
