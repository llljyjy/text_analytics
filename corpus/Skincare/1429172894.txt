I received this product free from Influenster for a review. This moisturizer has amazing ingredients like  Vitamin C, Mandarin Orange & Tranexamic Acid. These helped to improve the appearance of dull skin & dark marks on my face. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my uneven skin tone & texture. I also love how hydrating this moisturizer is and how nice it lays under my makeup. The scent isn’t strong, and it has a nice texture. I really appreciate the hygienic packing with a pump instead of the traditional tub. I would highly recommend this moisturizer! Highly Recommend!
