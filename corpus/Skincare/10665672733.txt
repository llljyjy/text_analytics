I seriously LOVE this cream !!! Great night time cream to rehydrate your skin while you sleep ! This cream is nice and thick so when you put it on your face you can feel how hydrating it is. It also has a nice smell to it. I love that it contains Shea butter vitamins A and C. I put this cream on my face my neck my chest and also my hands !! My skin is nice and plumed the next morning.  Also really hydrates my dry under eyes. Chef kisses to this cream ! Great night time cream nice and thick
