I tried the Dior Cica Recover & Repair.  It has a nice creamy texture and absorbs quickly.  Doesnâ€™t leave your skin or hands filling greasy afterwards. I was able to tell a difference  using it just a few days on my arms. My arms were more smooth and moisturized than they have been over the Winter months. I would recommend giving the product a try. Good Moisturizer
