This is a very gentle serum good for sensitive skin however the dropper is faulty and you can’t get out everything from the bottle so it’s a very expensive product that barely lasted me two weeks . Also I didn’t see a big difference in my hyperpigmentation either ; I believe you can get a niacinamide serum for much less cost ie: inkey or TO. Faulty dropper too costly
