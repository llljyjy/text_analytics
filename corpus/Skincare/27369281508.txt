I have dry-combo skin and sometimes it can get exhausting to have to layer on products just to keep moisture locked in. This is where this oil comes in! I apply this after face cream at nights only. It takes a while to absorb into the skin but what can you expect, itâ€™s an oil after all. (If you know basic chemistry, you will understand -if you know biochemistry then you know).I would not recommend this to be used in the mornings. If you want plump skin when you wake up in the morning, this product may be for you. Great for layering
