I love the large size of this product. Most high end lux products tend to come in a much smaller size. There is a scent that I am not that fond of, but it’s a personal preference. It’s not overwhelming and it’s a clean scent, so it’s tolerable. Because the consistency is a foam gel it is easy to use too much product. So just make sure you use a small amount. You do not need much; a little goes a long way. Personally, I prefer my Lumispa and the cleanser that goes with that device, but i liked this enough to use on occasion. A little goes a long way
