I received this product complimentary for honest review.This moisturizer is very nice. I’ve been enjoying using it. It hydrates my skin nicely and sinks in pretty well. It doesn’t have that much of a smell. It doesn’t irritate my skin. It’s a very nice product. I also like the packaging. It just looks nice on my counter. I like it!
