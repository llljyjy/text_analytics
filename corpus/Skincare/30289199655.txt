I read some of the reviews before trying this but no one ever mentioned the taste. It’s pretty terrible in my opinion. I only did one day and couldn’t continue on. I’d just stick with my whitening strips. Also, I know it was only one use but couldn’t tell much of a difference at all. I just tossed the rest...sad Be ware of bad taste
