You guys... the fact that I don’t have cotton pads spilling out of my trashcan is a miracle. I used to swear my micellar water. And although I still think it serves its’ purpose every now and again, THIS cleansing balm is the real deal and I will not be going back to any other method of taking my makeup off. I use the scooper and put about a dime size on my hands and it works wonders. I still need to use a wipe or 1-2 pads to clean the hard to reach areas like my hairline, jaw, etc, but this does such a wonderful job at removing my heavy makeup that I’m pretty shocked. I have acne-prone, sensitive and combo skin (oily in T-zone+some dry patches mainly in the winter). I am so happy that this worked for me and I’m going to swear by this from now on. Please do yourself, and your skin, a favor and GET THIS. I've never written a cosmetic/skincare review...
