ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40: such a beautiful, multipurpose product. I love the benefit of a skin tint, spf and skincare all in one. This made my skin glow and beautiful but just make sure you set it. Coverage is not like a foundation and not like a cc cream, but somewhere in the middle. It allows my skin to peak through which I love because it feels natural. I wish there were more shades, but it’s something you can play around with since it’s not too heavy. ilia perfection
