First off, I’m obsessed with glow recipe. I have dry, acne prone skin and their products have been life changing for my skin. When they reformulated their sleeping mask I had to test it. I’m SO glad I was able to because it’s AMAZING. It applied effortlessly onto my skin and felt slightly cooling. It wasn’t sticky by any means and was very easy to apply. I left it on overnight and when I woke my skin was literally glowing. After only a few uses my skin has brightened and looks so much more healthy. It’s smoother, softer and just overall amazing. If you suffer from sensitive skin and have been hesitant to try glow recipe, just do it. The fragrance hasn’t ever aggravated my skin and it’s one of the only skincare that has actually helped my hormonal acne. OBSESSED!
