Didn’t really enjoy this product because I am an oily person I don’t really have sensitive skin but he left me looking like an oil slick within an hour after putting it on a blotted myself and with another hour past it was already oily again typically I only need to block once a day when I put this on my skin I blotted it about four or five If you are oily move on
