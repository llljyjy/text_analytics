I absolutely love this new correct + protect broad spectrum serum! It applies effortlessly and leaves my skin feeling natural, not oily or greasy like other SPF’s. I wore it all through the air show weekend in HB, CA and was the only one of my friends/family that didn’t end up sunburnt by the end of the weekend. I’m so pleased to know it truly protected my skin. Additionally it didn’t give me that white flash glow in photos like most sunblocks do! I also did feel like it helped brighten and correct my skin tone as I did not wear any face make up with it and my skin looked great all weekend. Everyone was commenting that I was glowing (and no I’m not pregnant) and how healthy my skin looked. Most people who know me know I have struggled with acne since I was a teenager. Sunblock tends to break me out badly as it clogs my pores and that didn’t happen at all with this Murad one. I will absolutely be repurchasing this when I run out and would recommend to friends! Break out free on my acne prone skin!
