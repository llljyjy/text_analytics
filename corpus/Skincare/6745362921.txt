I usually use retinol at night, but I’ve been having some sensitive skin issues and figured bakuchiol might be a nice, more gentle alternative. This never aggravated my skin any more then it was.  It’s a very light formula that skins into the skin quickly, yet is effective. I think it’s a great alternative to retinol or retinal products if you have more sensitive skin.  I also love that it is on the more affordable spectrum, meaning you don’t have to sacrifice money for good skincare. Good sensitive skin alternative
