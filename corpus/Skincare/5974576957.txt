I am scared to jinx it, but I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and my skin has DRAMATICALLY improved. I have tried everything, from very expensive dermatologist skincare and treatments to what feels like the entire skincare Sephora page and this is the first thing I have tried where I am happy with the results. After 1 use, my skin was a little irritated (sensitive skin). Since then I have used about 2-3 times a week and my skin texture has completely transformed. My acne has also reduced a lot. Makeup is laying completing differently on my skin. Can’t wait to see if this keeps up but so far I’’m very happy. Go buy this now (for real)
