I just picked up the sample and had never heard of this or the brand. But Im 41 and have super oily skin and breakout all in my t-zone every single day. Even prescriptions havent stopped this. After a few days of using this, I saw a huge difference. Now after two weeks I dont wake up with only skin at all and it doesnâ€™t get oily during the day. I have had maybe one or two small blemishes since starting this, so im super surprised. I had already stopped using my prescriptions months ago because they didnt help. So its just this, and im really happy. Surprised
