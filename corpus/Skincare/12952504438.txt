I love that this cleanser is for all skin type (dry, oily etc) and recently I feel like Iâ€™ve had many events that I had to attend so being able to come home, remove my makeup and use this cleanser has helped me keep my face smooth and soft. This cleanser is definitely in front of my other products and the best part is that it removes dirt and oil (my main issue). My skin feels so clean, refreshed, and hydrated after using the cleanser. Love this hydrating cream cleanser!!!
