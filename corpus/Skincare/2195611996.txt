I absolutely love this face wash. This wash doesnâ€™t contain soap but it suds and leaves your face feeling clean and not oily like a few others do. my only critique is I noticed a tingling when using my moisturizer afterward a few times but that went away fairly quickly. overall a great cleanser. i paired this with a toner and moisturizer. great hydration
