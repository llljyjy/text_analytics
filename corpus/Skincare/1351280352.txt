The Kiehl’s under eye serum is more of a filler and brightener than a serum in my opinion.  It has the consistency of  many primers I’ve used in the past.  It goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long way. It automatically brightens the undereye area and hides slight wrinkles by filling them in.  It’s amazing for under foundation and concealer. I’ll definitely be getting another bottle. Awesome!
