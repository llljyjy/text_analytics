I have never used a specific eye cream before.  I guess Iâ€™m not accepting of my age and realizing its time.  So when i received this product to try i was excited.  It met all my expectations and then some!  It was in a stick so i was worried it would be hard or ruff on my skin, it was neither!  Soft like silk and went on super smoothly on my delicate under eye skin.  It has a little sheen which i loved and a light smell.  It was cooling and made my skin feel smooth.  I loved it and would definitely recommend it! nan
