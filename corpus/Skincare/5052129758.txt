I wanted to love this so much!  But I had to return this cleanser.  The essential oils are WAY too strong and irritating.  Dont get it anywhere near the eyes - there is peppermint and menthol in the ingredients.  I found it to be stinging and burning, not at all a pleasant cooling effect. Bummed. Too Strong
