I have purchased this item twice. I saw the reviews and since it’s almost five stars so I thought this has to be great- especially if so many people love it than it has to be amazing. Not so much. I’ve had the second jar for awhile and don’t even see a reason to use the rest. In my opinion it is no better than less expensive eye creams I have used in the past. It brightens a little and the texture is nice when applying but overall there wasn’t any long term benefits to mention. If it was less expensive I’d may be rate it higher because I wouldn’t expect as much from it but not worth the investment. nan
