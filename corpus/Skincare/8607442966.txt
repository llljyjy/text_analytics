I have pretty blemish-free and smooth skin with my skincare routine but I could never figure out how to minimize my pores. This is seriously a must buy for pore concerns. I recommend applying it with just your fingers because cotton pads will soak up the product. I use this both morning and night on a clean dry face and I’m not joking my pores were so much smaller just after two days of use. Now i’m going on a week of use and my pores aren’t even visible anymore. I SWEAR by this product. Do not listen to the negative reviews haha i never write reviews but I had to for this one, it’s amazing. BUY IT IF YOU HAVE LARGE PORES
