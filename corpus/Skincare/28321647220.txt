One star off for the smell. This formula has worked well for me. Started applying am and pm but after a week shifted to just pm (product has to last a while in this economy!) When I get up in the morning my skin looks the best it ever has. It has an even tone, it’s smooth and soft.  I’m Gen X with a history of cystic acne and some redness from the harsh treatments used to treat my acne when i was younger. I would buy this again. If I could find something to help with my genetic dark under eye circles, That would be the last problem I have to solve! This product is worth a try. If you have a friend who wants to try it, go in together to buy a bottle, save some money. If it does for you what it’s done for me you may find $50 is worth spending to add this to your routine. I did! I was not sponsored or bribed to give this review. Worked for and spent my own money to buy this. No regrets. nan
