This is not for me, It made my skin very greasy and it didn’t work well under my makeup.  When I put on my foundation I could see the white cream in my pores and it made my pores look bigger.  It also felt sticky as well.  I figured I would just use it before bed to use up the rest of the product but it felt too heavy on my face I actually had to wash it off it was driving me nuts. Im glad I only puchraed the mni and everyone’s skin is totally different so maybe this would be better for those with very dry skin.  One good thing is that it didn’t make me break out but I definitely will not even finish the rest or buy again. Not for me
