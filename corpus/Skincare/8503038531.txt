The best spot remover out there. I’ve tried them all- eradikate, Mario badescu pink drying lotion and clear gel, epiduo, murad- but this takes the cake. It’s very powerful but lightweight, so you can wear it under makeup if needed. Best for active zits, so if it doesn’t have a whitehead, it won’t go away as quickly. I also like to use it overnight for freshly popped zits, which probably isn’t the best thing to do, but it seems to help them heal. It’s smaller than other spot products out there, but a little goes a long way. The only problem I’ve had so far is sometimes it wants to peal off around my lips and chin if I apply it under makeup and do a lot of talking. the best out there.
