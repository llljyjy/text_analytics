Wonderful for dry winter skin, it’s been the best moisturizer I have tried. I am really into skin care and have combination skin- I need moisturizer heavily in some places but some products are too greasy for me and make me break out in oily areas. This Benefit cream is a perfect balance, great moisturizing properties but also doesn’t make your skin greasy. Currently buying a full size! Wonderful for dry winter skin!
