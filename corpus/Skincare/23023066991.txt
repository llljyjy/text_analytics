Received this as a gift from a friend and was so extremely pleased with it. The texture of it feels like butter and it leaves my skin feeling so clean and hydrated.  Only negative to the product is its price but I have found that a little goes a long way with this moisturizer and I am seriously considering repurchasing because of how amazing it is!
