I love this cleanser. Iâ€™ve tried numerous cleansers over time including highly recommended ones such as CeraVe and none of those cleansers have suited my skin or cleared it. This one however faded my spots within a couple of weeks and has an amazing texture and lathers in the skin in a perfect way. The only thing that I do not like about this cleanser is the smell, however this means that it has no added fragrances which makes it an even better product. Cleared out my skin
