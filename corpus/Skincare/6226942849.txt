it is really hydrating and has a nice texture on the skin and helps products applied after absorb better. I personally have very dry, acne prone skin and recently started getting clogged pores and whiteheads and i’ve noticed when i stopped using this it goes away. this does have coconut oil in it so that’s possibly why but I wouldn’t recommend for people with acne prone skin but it’s great for really dry, dehydrated skin! nan
