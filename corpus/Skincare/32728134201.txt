The texture is that of a serum and blends very nicely, it also absorbs super quickly onto the skin and doesn’t feel very greasy. I love that it’s noncomedogenic, that makes me feel a lot more comfortable using it as I’m prone to acne. It didn’t make me break out. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and it doesn’t leave a residue. My only concern is that it’s rather small - one bottle doesn’t have enough sunscreen for more than a few full-body applications, so I generally use it as a face sunscreen. It’s also not as spreadable as it appears, making me feel like I have to ration it. I wish I could give this a 4.5/5 because my only issues are that it isn’t very spreadable for such a low-viscosity formula and that there is relatively little per bottle. Note that I received a full-size product to test in exchange for my honest opinion. Great formula, I just wish there was more of it
