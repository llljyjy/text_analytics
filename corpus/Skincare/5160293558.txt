The cream did help with my dryness and was very light feeling.It’s a bit of an unpleasant smell compared to other creams I’ve used but I did see a change in my skin after 2 weeks. Not as dry and more firm.I’m not sure that I would purchase it again because it’s a pretty small bottle plus the smell, however despite this, I’d still recommend it to  my friends because I did see some results. nan
