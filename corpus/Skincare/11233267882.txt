I never leave reviews but have to for this guy! I’ve gone through 4 of these and it’s really such a great moisturizer. I used to love thick creams, but this one is still super hydrating without having to be thick and doesn’t leave a film on the skin like a lot of others do. It seriously does give a great glow, and does not break me out! Probably my most favorite face product I have tried (and I’ve tried like 50 other moisturizers). nan
