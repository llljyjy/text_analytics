I use lots of Biossance products and this is the first one I wonâ€™t be repurchasing. You have to give this cleanser some time to warm up on your hands/face to get the full makeup removing effects as it transitions from the jelly consistency to an oil. It emulsifies well and rinses clean with minimal effort. A good first step in a double cleanse but not my favorite, also not a big fan of the very powerful scent. Just alright
