Honestly wanted to love it because it feels light but it left me really greasy and separated under my makeup. I wore this under the Estée Lauder foundation, after a few hours, everything separated and I looked sooo cakey. It may because of the formula differences of both but since that is my go to foundation, I don’t see the point of forcing it. I use this sunscreen for my arms now (LOL). If anyone is looking for other sunscreens, I recommend the Bondi Sands Face SPF 50 sunscreen and Bliss spf 30 sunscreen. They’re cheaper and dry down matte with no white cast. I’m Indian (light medium skin tone) with acne prone skin <3. Hope this helped someone. separated makeup
