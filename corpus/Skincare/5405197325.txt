I absolutely love this machine and did not receive it for free. This is the closest one can get I feel to a professional microdermabrasion which costs about $150-$250 anyway. I love the different attachments for blackhead removal and for the body, and for the face. I like that different abrasion levels are given so you can see what fits your skin needs. Definitely start off on the gray you will be surprised how effective this is at removing dead skin while polishing the skin. I will say be cautious when using and follow directions. You risk giving yourself abrasions and irritated skin if you are not thorough with following directions. AKA Don’t leave the machine lingering over one spot too long keep the machine free flowing and moving. My skin texture has drastically changed over a month, of course in addition to serums, moisturizers, oils and spfs to protect the skin. Also this product recommends strictly to not use AHAs and BHAs with it. I however living in sunny so cal haven’t had any problems using both and seeing amazing results over my texture, fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, and melasma. A typical session is about 15-20 minutes long. The price is worth it, this machine is excellent! Love it
