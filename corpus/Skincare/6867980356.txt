I bought this set to sample these products before I purchased full-sized versions. The repair cream & eye cream are FIRE - I absolutely love them. Iâ€™m shocked at how well the repair cream works. I have oily/combination skin and my skin LOVES this stuff. It truly locks in moisture after one application and as a result, my face is producing less oil which is helping significantly reduce my breakouts. Pretty indifference about the lactic acidosis resurfacing serum & I did not like the rose oil. I followed the recommendations in the box on how to apply each product and in which order and the oil was just too much for me. My skin was much happier when I eliminated that product from my routine. nan
