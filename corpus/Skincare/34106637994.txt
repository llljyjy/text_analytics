Honestly I was really disappointed. I purchased because of the hype and on the first week it definitely lived up to the expectations. Fast forward 4 weeks later and not a day goes by that there isnt a slight white cast when applying and the immense pilling that occurs is ludicrous! Yes, I wait enough time before applying the sunscreen in between my other face products, as directed! Now I always check myself in the mirror before going to work because I know there will be piling and white cast. I do like that it is lightweight though. not worth the hype
