My 30’s skin had been looking haggard and nothing I used in my skincare routine seemed to make a difference. I washed my face with La Roche Posay only and sometimes felt it wasn’t strong enough to remove my SPF. I took the plunge with double cleansing to see if it would make a difference in my skin’s appearance. Well, since I’ve started using this balm, my skin has been feeling supple, hydrated and looking more even. I use it as a stand alone and as part of a double cleanse, depending on my mood. Although it does have a crumble like consistency, it easily softens into a thick paste in your hands so it’s easy to apply. I love using it to remove my SPF, and the milk-like residue rinses off well enough on its own so that a double cleanse is not necessary. I do have oily/dry and eczema/acne prone skin and this has been a very gentle cleanser that has not created any irritation or acne since I’ve started about 2 weeks ago. I highly recommend for those who want to get all the gunk out and want supple skin afterwards! Luxurious and cleansing
