I really love the kiehls super multi-corrective anti-aging eye cream. As I have gotten older I’ve started to notice loss of firmness dark circles and fine lines around my eyes. I have tried many products that either did not produce results or where two greasy or sticky. This eye cream is the perfect solution. It has made a noticeable improvement in every area that I was looking for. It feels good on my skin it’s easy to apply and for the price you really can’t beat it. If you’re looking for an eye cream that is effective affordable and feels great on your skin I highly recommend you purchase this product. Score!
