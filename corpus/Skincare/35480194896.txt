it took out sooo much dirt and oil and like everything but my pores always came back and i think it also kind of damaged my barrier just a little. my pores didnt become smaller or bigger but they felt the exact same as before i put them on. would recommend if u have a big oil problem because i have dry skin and it still took out oils just ok
