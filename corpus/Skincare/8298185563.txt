On initial thought, I really liked this sunscreen. It left no white cast, it left a nice finish on the skin and worked great under makeup. So I bought the value size and instantly noticed a difference. It’s so greasy and oily. Ridiculously so. No matter how much I work it into my skin or how liberal I am with application, I look like I’ve smothered my face in canola oil. It’s also sooo sticky, hairs and fibres from clothes constantly get stuck to my face. Supergoop do a great job with marketing and advertising, packaging is fun and exciting but beyond that - I would just stick with La Roche-Posay or any Asian/Korean sunscreen. nan
