It’s ok. It’s smooth and light, not oily BUT I still find I have dry skin after 4 weeks of using this. The product stings after a good exfoliation too. I don’t mind the scent, it reminds me of a tanning salon but it’s faint. I wouldn’t buy it again just based on 4 weeks of use and no improvement in my dry skin. Just ok, doesn’t hydrate my skin enough
