Like others here, I had issues with the pump seeming to stop working, even with plenty of product left. I took it apart and realized it might work if I held the bottle upside down while pumping it out into my hand. Much better, and it explains the weird bottle shape. Supergoop added a sticker to shake well before using; they should add instructions for this too. Otherwise, I love this stuff, makes my aging skin look refreshed and healthy. Hold the bottle upside down
