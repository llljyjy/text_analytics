I received a sample of this product for my honest review. While the sample size was not large enough for me to determine the wrinkle fighting effects of the product, I did find that it was a nice lightweight serum with little to no scent, and it felt really nice on the skin. I would definitely give the larger soze a try! Lovely lightweight serum!
