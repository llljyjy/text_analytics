Received a sample of the Ultra Facial moisturizing cream that really impressed me and after reading more about it, discovered this mask. While many other masks appear to sit atop the skin but eventually do some work overnight, this one seems to just rub off somewhere along the way. For the thick, waxy, and somewhat unpleasant scent that comes with the application, I find myself waking up to skin that appears in need of hydration and my forehead expression lines are much more visible off the bat than after using Glow Recipe, Tatcha (HG) or Belif night cream products. Wax on, wax off
