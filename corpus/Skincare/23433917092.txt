I liked the feel of the cream but I don’t see a reduction in my dark circles like others did in 10 days.  There was a tingling under my eye but it was a refreshing one, not bothersome. On my 6th day my eyes burned slightly like it was in my eye and irritated but I didn’t get any in there. If the price point was a little lower I would buy and try for longer to see if it would do better long term. nan
