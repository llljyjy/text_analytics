Haven’t done much skincare recently as well as a recent move to a much drier climate and was noticing how dry and flakey my acne prone skin was looking with so much buildup in my pores. Put this on for the 10 minutes and followed up with my Cetaphil moisturizer, and my face is feeling so soft and all that buildup is gone after one use! Can’t wait to see results of using this weekly! Will note the burn was pretty intense at application, but went away within 30 seconds to a minute. About two hours after and I have slight irritation in a few areas but nothing serious. nan
