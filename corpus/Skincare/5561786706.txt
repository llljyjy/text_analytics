I bought this reading the reviews and Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I am kind of disappointed. The pads are not soaked enough. After working the product in one pad only did half of my face. It seems really gentle because I did not feel any burning after applying. Will have to use more to claim it helps with acnea. My skin felt softer the morning after. It's okay...
