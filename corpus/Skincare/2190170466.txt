I have exceptionally dry and reactive skin and this moisturizer has been a godsend. It’s thick without being overwhelmingly heavy, though if your skin is less on the dry side this may be a little much for AM use. The scent is definitely strong but it’s herbal so it doesn’t bother me the same way a more artificial fragrance might. Overall I would highly recommend this unless you have a strong aversion to scent or possibly are extremely acne prone as it is rich. Great for dry, sensitive skin
