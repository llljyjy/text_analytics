I love slip I have a bunch of their pillowcases and a mask etc. I thought this one was a zip closure but it’s envelope. So it slides around and off my pillow. Other than that the black is very chic. Wash these with special care- silk laundry soap in a lingerie bag on cold delicate wash and it’ll last longer (silk is delicate). nan
