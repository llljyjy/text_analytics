I started using this stuff because I prefer a cleansing balm to a liquid or foaming cleanser.  I have used the Farmacy cleaning balm for a long time and decided to switch things up.  I wish I didn’t. Ever since I started using this product I have started breaking out (I have acne-prone skin but it’s been under control for years) and I’ve had tons of whiteheads on the apples of my cheeks, my nose, and my pores seem irritated/enlarged.  At first i thought this must be hormonal (I’m in my early 50s) so I didn’t think it was the cleanser.  Things have gotten so bad with my skin and these whiteheads that I stopped using this product four days ago, and after not using it my face is almost completely clear now and I’ve had no whiteheads in the mornings anywhere.  I don’t know what I reacted to in this product because it’s a clean product, but there’s something in it my skin does not like and I’ll be getting rid of it unfortunately. nan
