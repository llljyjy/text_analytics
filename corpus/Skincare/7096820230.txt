I have mixed feelings about this product. I like how it makes my skin feel however I am not a fan of its consistency. It is more like water than lotion. I have been using this for a few weeks now and I have noticed that my skin feels more hydrated. I also have very sensitive skin and this product hasn’t irritated it so that’s a plus. Overall I probably wouldn’t spend money on this again as I am not a fan of the consistency Ifeel that for the price I would be wasting a lot of product. Just ok
