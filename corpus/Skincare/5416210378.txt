I’ve used this exactly for a month. I started using once or twice every two days thinking it may be too harsh if you’re not used to bha. Now I use it twice a day and I haven’t had any problems with my skin!!!!  I think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do :) will def purchase again and again and again.  I use this with one of those Clarisonic brushes to deeply exfoliate if needed. I recommend it! excellent!!!!!
