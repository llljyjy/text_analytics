I don’t know why this product isn’t talked about more I never see anyone talk about it! It has literally saved my skin. I’m 30 and have had the worst acne for 10 years. Literally tried every cleanser you name it and my skin hates everything. It’s been impossible. I got the tester size for this as a birthday gift and no my skin isn’t cured but wow it’s not inflamed anymore and no new breakouts so far.. it’s worth the price because you only need a little amount so it lasts quite a while. I recommend you atleast try it! nan
