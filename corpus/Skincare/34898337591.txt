This is a great peel mask! They recommend you use it weekly, which I’ve been doing the past 2 weeks — I put it on before I shower, then wait 10-ish minutes, and then get in the shower and wash it off! My skin has felt super refreshed and rejuvenated - I love it! The product is high quality, and not overly expensive ($18)[Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion] Makes my skin feel very refreshed
