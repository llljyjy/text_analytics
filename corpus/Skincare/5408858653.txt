Pleasantly surprised! First applying the product I thought it would be abrasive but using wet fingertips and gentle circle motions, it exfoliates my skin without irritating it. And I would of never guessed it be so moisturizing after I rinsed the product off! Iâ€™m impressed! Too soon to tell any major differences  but I will def use this as a weekly exfoliation product. Only con is to be aware that this product is a red/orange color can can dye fingers or light colored things like towels or countertops. Pleasantly Surprised!
