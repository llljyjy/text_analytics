I normally tan naturally to a medium level after a summer of leg exposure, but wanted to speed things up a bit avoid baking. Used self tanners in the past with good, natural results. Saw this in the store and decided to give it a try, looked easy to apply.What a mistake. This product turned my legs a horrible shade of dark orange over night. It smells awful, a cross beween graprfruit seed and bug spray. I’m desperately trying to exfoliate it and won’t be able to wear a dress to work until it fades, it’s that bizarre looking.Do not use it. You will regret it. NOPE NOPE NOPE
