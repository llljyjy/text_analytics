I buy it because it had good reviews but I went 15m without my hat outside in the sunlight and got sunburned.  It had never happened to me before with other sunscreenp, so I tried it again a second time, with much more product on my face, but I had the same result.  Red sunburn patch on my face.  Im sending this product back. Didn't worked for me
