Unlike almost every single review I have read, I dislike this cleanser. Your skin feels nice and hydrated once itâ€™s washed but I have noticed my skin becomes super oily as the day progresses. I have tested this out by doing my full skin care routine and also when I just wash my face and lounge around my apartment.  BOTH times, more than once, my skin became oily. Which is odd for glycolic acid being that it can normally be drying. Would totally return it if I could. Uncommon Review: makes skin OILY!
