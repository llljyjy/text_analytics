If this would let me put 2 stars I would. I did not like this product at all. I bought it because I have acne prone skin and very sensitive skin, I thought this would be good but overall I did not like it. the texture was so thick and oily. It was hard to wash off the remaining residue, has like a Vaseline like texture. Would not recommend
