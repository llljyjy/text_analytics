I used this product religiously, morning & night, & saw no results. I really wanted to love this product! It came highly recommended by a staff member. I was told there was no fragrance in it & unfortunately that was not true. They do use some fragrance, & other in-needed items like thickener, etc. Smells great! Doesn’t do anything for the pores or skin texture sadly! Didn’t do the trick!
