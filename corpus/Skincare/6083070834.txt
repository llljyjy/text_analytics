This moisturizer is pure magic. I’ve had extremely oily skin since I was a teen, and this is the only thing that truly stops the oiliness… and for the entire day, no reapplying. Even in the summer! A little goes a long way, and the bottle lasts a really long time. Worth every penny. Oily skin life saver
