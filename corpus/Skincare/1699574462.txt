I used a small sample of this wrinkle cream every night for about 2 weeks.  I really loved it.  First, the texture was so silky and moisturizing without being oily, which I hate.  I did notice a difference in my skin texture after only 2 weeks. It was much more moisturized and had a glow.  I would definitely by this product again to test longer on the overall appearance of my winkles Loved this product!
