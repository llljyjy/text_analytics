I have sensitive, reactive skin. My skin started breaking out and wanted to try this out. Does this dry out your skin therefore dries out your current breakouts? Yes. But it is very strong in my opinion. Again if you have sensitive skin, I donâ€™t think this is the best. It itched my skin and made it really really dry. I had to return :( wish it would have worked out for me. nan
