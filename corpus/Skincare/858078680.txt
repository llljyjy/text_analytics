I was expecting a little more from this product.  My biggest complaint was it is a very thin formula.  I would have liked a thick cream instead for this price point.  It does absorb quickly though and it definitely made my skin feel firmer and more plumped.  It didn’t irritate my skin. The next day after using it one of my friends told me my skin glowed so I’m not sure if this was as a result of the product, but it nice to hear!  It helped make my makeup application easier.  I would have loved if this had an SPF because I had to add that each morning. And I would love to see this in a pump applicator instead so it’s a cleaner type application rather than putting your fingers in the jar.  You can use this formula day and night which is great, so there is no need for extra products. nan
