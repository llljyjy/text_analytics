I received this deluxe sample to review for influenster and Estee lauder. And I have been looking for a new eye cream and this gel creme doesn’t disappoint. It’s so smooth and hydrating for your eyes. I use it in my morning and evening routines. And I can see the dark circles and dryness definitely improving. My nana has used Estee lauder products my whole life and I can see why, they don’t disappoint. I will be getting the regular size when it’s available Smooth and hydrating
