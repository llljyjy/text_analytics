I really dislike the price.  I think it’s too expensive for the amount of product. But, I did jut order it again.  Its a great color corrector.  I have rosacea which I’ve been able to calm with a good, consistent skin care routine but I still have underlying redness and this gets rid of it.  It wears well under make up BUT I do find I need to let it sit on the skin for about 10 mins or so before going in with make up or a primer.  I wanted to try it and convince myself the price wasn’t worth it.  But I will continue to buy it… hoping sometimes it’ll be on sale.  The first bottle I bought was in May and I’m still using it.  It’s low but it has lasted about 6 months. Expensive - but it works!
