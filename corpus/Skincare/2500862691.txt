I hate to say it but this formula genuinely makes me wonder if this product was tested on anyone before it was launched. I’ve tried many, many sunscreens and this one just misses the mark in so many ways - the bottle/pump is difficult to get the formula out, the formula is very heavy and difficult to blend in, and there is a significant white cast even after rubbing the product in for several minutes. After all of this, the product also just feels very heavy and uncomfortable on the skin. I’m disappointed and really would have liked this product to have worked out better! Received for free, would not buy
