#freeproduct #trywithtopboxcircle. I tried this a couple times. I admit I was excited to try this product. I am 30 years old so I need help to prevent those dreaded wrinkles and fine lines loss of firmness etc. Well first off the smell is very strong didn’t like it, nor did I like the fact almost all the oils they have are hydrogenated like why? No wonder I’m breaking out. Hydrogenated oils are not good for you or your skin. Those are the two things I didn’t like about it. Now it did leave my skin feeling nice and smooth. Did seem to maybe help tighten the skin but again it’s probably temporary. Now I don’t want to waste it. So I will keep using it till it’s gone. Maybe my skin will finally get used to it nan
