Let’s start with the cons. If you hate the smell of sunscreen this isn’t for you. The smell is kinda strong. Also it’s does leave a dewy finish in more of a matte person. It leaves skin a bit sticky. Now the pros. It does give really good coverage. It left my skin looking smooth and flawless. I would definitely prefer to put this on my face over regular sunscreen. Good for outdoors
