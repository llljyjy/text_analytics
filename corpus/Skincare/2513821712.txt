I have been using this for 2 weeks now and have noticed the under eye area looking brighter and more vibrant. It’s hydrating without making the under eye area feel oily like other eye creams I have used in the past and you don’t have to use too much product to get it to apply nicely, I think the product will last a good amount of time.
