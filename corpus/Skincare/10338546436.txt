I have 2 kids and haven’t slept very good since I had my oldest. I definitely have some lighter dark circles underneath my eyes and wanted to find something to help with that. I like not wearing makeup all the time and would like my under eyes to look lighter. I feel like this helped get rid of some of the darkness. I get that the price is high, but it lasts a long time and if you have the money to spend and have dark circles then try it out. Kiehl’s dark circle reducing eye serum
