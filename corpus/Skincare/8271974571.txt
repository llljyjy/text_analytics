This cream is incredible. When you open it it looks like a gel, but  it’s actually very thick! A little goes a long way so don’t use more than a pea size!! Once you apply it on your skin it turns white like a heavy moisturizer and as you massage it in it turns clear.  It absorbs very nicely on the skin and it has no scent which is awesome!! This pairs perfectly with my tret and leaves my skin feeling so, so smooth. I’m oily skinned and it’s not greasy at all. I highly recommend it! Leaves me glowing!
