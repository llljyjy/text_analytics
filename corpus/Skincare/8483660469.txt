I received this product free, being part of the Influenster Tula Voxbox. I really like that this is a clean product. It’s amazing for sensitive skin, free from harmful ingredients and it’s non-irritating. I also liked that it didn’t have a fragrance as I don’t like frangrant things near my eyes. However, there’s nothing special about this product. I didn’t notice any difference after 2 weeks of use. It feels like there’s nothing under my eyes, which can be a good thing but can be achieved with a cheaper thing for sure. It just doesn’t do anything… it’s not very refreshing, didn’t depuff my bags. Just nothing. Nice but not a big deal!
