I received this product for free from lnfluenster and Shani Darden in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about a month. Even after just the first night of using it, I saw a brighter, healthy complexion the next morning. I have used products with other acids but never tried lactic acid before. I was nervous to see how it reacted to my skin, but no irritation or breakouts- yay! I feel like my skin looks like it has a healthy glow and smoother complexion. Definitely recommending this tomy friends to try as well! nan
