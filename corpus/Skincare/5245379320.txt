I received this product for free to give my honest review. This products scent is way to strong for me personally. I put this on my face and felt a tingling sensation right after applying. I tried it again by itself with no other product under it and it didn’t tingle, so I don’t know what to make of that. The moisture in this is lacking for me, it’s really thick and silky feeling so I thought it would provide enough moisture but I would wake up the next more with dry patches on my face. Would not purchase or recommend. Nor For Me
