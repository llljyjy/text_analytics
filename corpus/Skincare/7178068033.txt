I was gifted by Algenist in exchange for my honest opinion.  So far I really like this toner, my skin looks great. I’ve gotten a few compliments from my friends too. It has made my skin a bit more glowy. It’s smoother and slightly tighter. I like the texture of it. I haven’t been using a cotton ball, I just put a little on my hands and put it on my face so I don’t waste any product. My skin is a little more red then usual, but I have been forgetting to use sun screen. So that is entirely my fault, so if you use this definitely use SPF too! Love
