I have used this product for years. I live is snow country so my skin is extremely dry. I am 61 and I find it to be effective. My only critic is the packaging. Seems to me the packaging is a large portion of what you paying for when you buy. Wasteful. Additionally, l the jar doesn’t fit in the drawer very well and I don’t care for things left on the counter. Costly packaging is negative
