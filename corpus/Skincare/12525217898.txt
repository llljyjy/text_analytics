I really like this. Definitely makes my skin look younger. It has a relaxing essential oil smell & a little goes a long way! The only thing is, it stains. Because of the intense pigmentation of the color, it gets messy very easily so be careful when applying. Do not drop on clothing items you donâ€™t want ruined! Great Product, Too Pigmented
