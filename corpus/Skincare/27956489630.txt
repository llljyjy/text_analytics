I really wanted to love this product after hearing such great reviews on it but I was left unimpressed. The consistency of the product is nice and I liked it most when I lathered the product before putting it on my face. I didn’t have good results using the product. My skin began over producing oil after a week of using this. It isn’t worth the money for me. Pass this up
