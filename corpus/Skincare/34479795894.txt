Let’s get this straight since you’ve probably seen awesome reviews from others. I personally don’t see any difference about my skin except: on day 10 since I started using every night, my face started to show bumps all over, and felt rough (Repair?). I kept using to see if that would change, and it did. On day 28 my face was back to its original condition when I started using this serum (Renew?).In conclusion, well, for now I think I wouldn’t buy it myself for what it did to my skin consider the price. I would still keep using until I finish the bottle to see if there’s any changes. It’s not bad, but not impressive for the price or does much for my skin besides having natural ingredients. nan
