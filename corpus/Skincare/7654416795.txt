This is a very sticky and oily type of mask. The instructions say to put it overnight but it remains very oily the next day even with a super thin layer. Almost feels like an “oil wrap” treatment for face. Unlike some water-based mask that actually gets totally absorbed by the morning. However, it is very hydrating (if you have super dry and stressed skin) I do recommend it. For people who cannot take something very oily I think its better to wash it off before you sleep. I have only tried it one time so I don’t know the effects for long term yet. good but becareful
