I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. I really like the feel of this product. I have somewhat sensitive skin and didn’t have any irritation. It goes on nicely, has a great scent, and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I haven’t seen much difference in my pores yet but will continue using to see if it helps lessen appearance of pores. I would recommend! Great addition to nightly skincare routine!
