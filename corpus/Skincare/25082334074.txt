The pump dispenser design is very convenient. It feels gentle and hydrating on my skin and has no problem with my face makeup or normal eye makeup. It doesn’t remove waterproof mascara or eyeliner easily  I like that it contains many ingredients to benefit the skin (such as cannabis seed extract, hyaluronic acid and aloe), so it feels a bit like a toner as well.  I also like it’s very natural! Gentle and hydrating
