I love It! Cosmetics so it is no surprise I like the confidence in a cream. It feels so creamy and luxurious when I apply it to my skin at and not at all greasy. Absorbs right away. Even though at 52 I’m often mistaken for being much younger, I’ve been struggling with aging dry skin and could feel the difference with this immediately. My skin feels and looks hydrated! The only negative I’ve found is the scent. It’s a little too much of a perfume smell for me. I would really love if it were more subtle. Great for my aging, drier skin!
