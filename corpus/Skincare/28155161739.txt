Okay, so, I had very frizzy hair. It’s also very thick and somewhat wavy, so it can be hard to manage. There was a point in time when I was just constantly dyeing my hair. I would bleach it, color it, then remove it with a “hair color remover“ which was essentially bleach. So as you can assume, my hair was a dry mess. I started using this oil and I felt an almost immediate improvement in the texture of my hair. Of course, I did have to cut some of the dead ends, but this oil really helps. I would usually take a penny-sized amount and massage it into my scalp, and let it sit for a few hours or for the whole day if I didn’t have anything to do. Additionally, I feel like it could be great for removing makeup, which would be great if you’re wanting to grow out your eyelashes or eyebrows. Maybe don’t do it every night though, because it could potentially clog your pores. One thing I would change about this product is the size of the bottle, but that’s not a big deal. In my opinion, it is still a good value, as it lasted me about 4 months. So Good for Frizzy Hair
