Some things are expensive because they are worth it, this is one of those things. It’s my favorite face wash of all time. You only need to use a little pea size amount so the tube lasts a long time. It’s thick and luxurious and amazing and I can’t say enough good things about it, just buy it. My face fells clean and nourished after use, never dry. Holy Grail
