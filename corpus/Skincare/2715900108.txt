I am a complete snob when it comes to skincare and usually only purchase skinbetter science or skinceuticals from my derm office. I bought this vream on a whim just to see if it would help my dry skin through this winter. Omg I love it. But I will say, dont purchase if you oily or even combo skin cause this stuff is RICH. I am 41, dry and dont breakout too easily so this cream was amazing for me. Amazing stuff
