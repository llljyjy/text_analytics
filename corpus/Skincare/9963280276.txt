I am a lady in her 40s and under eye care is a priority to me. I was excited to try this eye cream but unfortunately it fell a little flat. We have all seen J Lo and her beautiful skin and it is something that we would all like to have but this product is obviously not what she is using. I have been using this for about two weeks and honestly cannot tell any difference. Itâ€™s not drying but I cannot tell that it has done anything for tightening, hydrating or brightening my under eye. The packaging is plastic which feels really cheap in your hands compared to other eye creams in the same price range. Overall this is not some thing that I will be re-purchasing or recommending to friends and family. Not impressed
