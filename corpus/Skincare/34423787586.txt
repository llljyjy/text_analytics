My skin was thoroughly clean and I thought integrating it with an app was going to make it easy to use. There is not much you can do with the app, there is no way for you to manually change the setting- You have to use the app to control it. It suddenly hanged and would not turn off. I thought the app can help with this but the app could not locate the device and was useless in troubleshooting. Bad experience. Malfunction
