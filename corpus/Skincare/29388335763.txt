Very light-weight and doesnâ€™t have an offensive scent. I feel like it does everything it claims to an extent. I have stubborn skin that refuses to cooperate, but I do see an improvement in moisture to my dry areas, added dewiness, and shine control in my T-zone. I think it would be a good moisturizer for someone with combination/acne-prone skin. There are better moisturizers out for more dry skin types. This one overall is a very good lightweight gel moisturizer. Good gel moisturizer
