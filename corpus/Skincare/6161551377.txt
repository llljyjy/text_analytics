I received a small sample of this product complimentary from #trywithtopbox in exchange for a honest review. I like that it didn’t cause any skin irritation. It also quickly absorbed into the skin and wasn’t tacky or greasy on the skin. It was a great addition to my morning and night routine. It left my skin feeling more plump. If I had a few more days to use it I think I would have seen more results. I would definitely recommend this serum. A small amount does go a long way. I wish we were given a little more in the sample. Great Serum
