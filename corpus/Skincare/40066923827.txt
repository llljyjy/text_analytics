The product was given to me as a sample to try. I love the individual packets. Sensitive skin shouldn’t use this every day as directed. After each use, you will notice a difference. I recommend this for anyone that has skin with dry spots. The exfoliant isn’t very harsh, but it does remove the dead skin. Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. nan
