I have very dry skin and I love this moisturizer! I use 4 other skincare products in the morning and use this moisturizer as a last step before my sunscreen and it doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling heavy. It has a very light kind of whipped texture that I find very pleasant. Overall very happy with this moisturizer will definitely keep repurchasing! light, whipped texture
