I was skeptical to buy this cleanser due it being so controversial, but i took a chance and I am SO HAPPY that I did! I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and for me this stuff is amazing! I can already tell a huge difference in my skin after one weeks use. My skin is brighter and it took care of two hormonal pimples I had coming up! I purchased the mini size but I will definitely be purchasing the full size once mine runs out! nan
