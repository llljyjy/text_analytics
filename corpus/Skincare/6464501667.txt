I have super sensitive and dry skin so was hesitant to try this at first but it’s actually really kind to my skin, even around my particularly sensitive eye skin. I definitely feel the benefits of the serum and my face feels firmer and looks visibly brighter. I like to use this especially when I’m not wearing makeup as it just adds some brightness and radiance to my bare skin. Kind on sensitive skin
