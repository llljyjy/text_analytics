I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo & Influenster for in return my honest review. I did like this cleanser. It was gentle and safe on my sensitive skin. I felt it left my skin feeling very clean and not dried out. It didnâ€™t really bother my acne either. I would definitely recommend and would consider using it in the future for my normal skin routine. Would consider using in the future.
