I have loved Dermologica products since I learned with them in esthetician school. This was gifted by Dermologica- Sephora. This is an amazing product and I expected nothing less. It has helped to minimize the appearance of my fine lines especially on my forehead where they are starting to really bother me. I can’t wait to keep using it and see how it works over more time. I think this would be perfect for someone who wants to add something to their well aging routine that will actually produce results you can see. I didn’t experience any irritation but my skin isn’t sensitive either  so I would say start slow if you’re new to retinol. A great retinol serum
