I did receive this product free. But my opinion matters and for that you can take it to the bank.  Before I got it I had never heard of this company. But let me say they have really got me hooked. I use this each morning before I put on my makeup, and it is so nice and smooth and really soaks into the skin. There is just a hint of a fragrance but it is very light and pleasant. Once applied it doesnâ€™t leave your face oily like other sunscreen. I will definitely be buying this in the future! Worth every penny! My Opinion Matters!
