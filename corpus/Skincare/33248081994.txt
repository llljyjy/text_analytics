I absolutely love this product! #freeproduct. I love the beautiful purple glass bottle and it is great that you can turn the pump back to lock position after you use it so not more worries about your product leaking when traveling. I like the light rose scent it is not to strong it is just right. I love the texture of it also you can tell it is water based but not to watery. It feels so silky and smooth it does not make my face feel sticky like other skincare products I have tried before it is also very light weight. I can definitely feel my skin soaking it in. I used it morning and night. I have been using it daily for it least 2 weeks and can already see the difference my skin is much more moisturized and plump. My skin does not looke dull anymore it has evened out my skin texture and has started helping lighten up my dark spots. #trywithtopbox It works great!
