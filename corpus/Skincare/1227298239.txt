I didn’t know what to expect at first, but now I’m obsessed with this. The buttery yet lightweight texture is perfect even for this humid summer. It’s so nourishing and a little does go a long way. The fufu spoon makes it easy to scoop up just what you need. It doesn’t have much slip, but it still feels super light. Not sure how they managed to make a rich moisturizer that immediately sinks into the skin. I’ll be repurchasing! I’m in love
