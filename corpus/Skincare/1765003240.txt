I’ve used this product for a few weeks and I noticed it does lighten some acne scarring I had. It takes consistent use to see change but it does work. For the price I think it should work a little faster lol. My skin looks smoother and a little brighter. Don’t mix it with other exfoliating products! I did receive this product in exchange for a review, but all opinions are my own. Fades dark spots
