The pump dispenser is great, I can easily control how much product is being dispensed. The lotion goes on smooth and does not irritate my skin. Iâ€™ve used it for a few weeks now and I really like the way my skin looks and feels. It is smooth, clear, and even some of the wrinkles seem less noticeable which is amazing! I would highly recommend this product. Great product!
