I love that this cleansing bar is Ph leveled. Tried the Peekee bar as well, and still repeating it. Juju bar was not the best match for me, as it felt a little tight afterwards on my normal skin. I do recommend it, the scrub is gentle, love the cute elephant on the logo. Good cleanser, for oily skin
