This moisturizer is AMAZING! I am a very tough critic on all products that touch my skin, but especially my face, and this moisturizer passes the test. It has a nice consistency - it is thick, without feeling like you’re smearing butter on your face; it’s not galloopy. It has a very pleasant scent, and quickly sinks into your skin, leaving it feeling soft for hours. It is not greasy nor does it just “sit” on your skin like some moisturizers. It does an impressive job of moisturizing while still containing hydrolauronic acid, which keeps your skin looking young and vibrant. 10/10 recommend. 10/10 recommend!
