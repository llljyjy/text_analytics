I use this mask once a week at night or whenever I feel like I need my pores to not exist. Results are more noticeable when you get the sebum out your pores first. I usually do that a day before I plan to use the mask. When I say my pores are gone the next day. No dots at all. Add this to your skin care routine ASAP.
