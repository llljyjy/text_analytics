I received a sample of this from Topbox Circle for review and testing purposes. I only received one sample of this serum so my review is based only for how long the sample lasted for me which was basically 2-3 days. It really absorbed fast into my skin. It had an irredescent light pink color to it, blended out right away. I found it very nice and subtle on my skin. It paired very nicely with the other cream and eye cream that is apart of this same smart clinical repair line. My skin felt nice and hydrated, I would repurchase this serum. I wish my sample was a bigger size so it could have lasted longer! But nonetheless I was happy testing it out! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Very nice hydrating serum!
