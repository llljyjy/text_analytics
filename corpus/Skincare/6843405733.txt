I absolutely loved the Shiseido Sunscreen. It felt great on my skin and was extremely easy to apply. I hate two things about this sunscreen. The first one was that it had to be reapplied after 40 minutes of swimming. I only made it 35 before I needed to reapply it. The second thing was that its SPF was 42. We like a good 100 to feel extremely safe. Although I shouldâ€™ve known that the SPF was low given the re-application time being so soon. Loved it!
