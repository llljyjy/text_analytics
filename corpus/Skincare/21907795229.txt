Almost 30 and loving my skin! I’m a licensed Esthetician and Dr. Dennis Gross products are my all time favorite! Here’s the secret: 1. AHA line every morning.2. Retinol line every other night. 3. Lactic acid line every “other“ night. 4. Add masks as needed. And don’t forget the Dennis Gross sunscreen every day! Be consistent with this routine and await the results. :) Best Routine for Flawless Skin
