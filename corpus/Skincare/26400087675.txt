I bought this in store by mistake, I thought I was getting a mini of the regular Magic Cream. Honestly, this is just like heavily scented vaseline. I don’t know how this could work on anyone’s face without causing break outs unless they were truly drier than the Sahara and not sensitive to fragrance. I didn’t want to waste it because it’s so expensive so I ended up using it on my hands at night the way I usually use aquaphor hard pass
