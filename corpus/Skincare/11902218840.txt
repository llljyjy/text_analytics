I really like this product because it’s affordable and it’s gentle on my sensitive skin. It has kept my skin well hydrated too. The only thing I would warn people about is that it can be a bit sticky, which isn’t a huge deal to me. Still works well under SPF moisturizers and make up. Affordable and gentle of sensitive skin
