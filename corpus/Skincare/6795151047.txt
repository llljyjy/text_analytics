My skin hasn’t looked this good in years. Even my boyfriend noticed. I’ve struggled with acne for 15 years with no end in sight. But this has been amazing.It does have a weird reaction to other serums. It will kind of pill on my skin so I try to not use it with other things if I’m going to wear make up later. But for working from home and sleeping, phenomenal. I’m so happy Sephora is finally carrying this. GAME CHANGER
