This mask helps my red dry skin in the winter. Itâ€™s a jelly consistency, and very light on the skin. I put on  twice a week before bed in winter time to help my red skin. It calms my red skin and feels great on. I can feel my skin soaking it up instantly. In morning my skin looks and feels great! No break outs or irritation from this either. I have super sensitive skin and the mask is an excellent addition to my routine. sensitive skin approves!!
