I received this product in exchange for my honest review.This is a wonderful retinol night serum. As a first time user of retinol, it was pleasant to use and it was slightly tingly for a few times. After a few weeks of usage, my skin looks brighter, less acne scarring, and more toned. It did not irritate my dry, sensitive skin at all. Highly recommend! And donâ€™t forget to use a sunscreen after usage. Great Retinol Starter
