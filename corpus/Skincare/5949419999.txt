So, naturally with SOO many products out there you get skeptical trying a new one. I will be purchasing this forever. After 2 nights you can see a difference. I know skincare isnâ€™t a instant result type thing but this serum did wonders to my complexion and I have melasma from hormones. Highly recommend if you want a smooth brightened wrinkle free completion. 10/10. Worth every penny. Holy Grail!!!!
