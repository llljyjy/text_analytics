This moisturizer is elegant and absolutely luxe. I have combination skin so I was hesitant to use it during the day under makeup at first but it was just as great feeling as overnight. It keeps my skin hydrated workout feeling greasy and goopy. It has a faint smell of roses which doesnâ€™t irritate my skin at all. I have already recommended it to several friends and will definitely be buying more! I would definitely be interested in buying a formula that included some spf in the future.
