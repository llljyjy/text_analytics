Iâ€™ve been trying to find a new retinol serum or oil to add to my routine. This oil is so easy to apply and absorbs into the skin easily. I definitely noticed a difference after just one use. My face was noticeably glowy and the texture felt better. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to add retinol into your routine nan
