Disappointing. I really wanted to like this product because I have loved all Glow Recipe items I have tried. However, this sunscreen just doesn’t work for me. The formula does not sink in and pills terribly both alone and under makeup….like to the point where it’s embarrassing if you don’t notice it before you leave the house. Now I just use it on my neck and my ears where the pilling isn’t as noticeable. Nice scent though.I’m so sad because all of their other products are great. disappointed
