After applying serum, I top this moisturizer on my face. It does kinda feel heavy for me, (I have a combination skin) so it takes time to soak it in. Only tiny amount of product is enough. It’s very creamy and thicker. Also I live in a humid weather. So maybe I will try it out again during winter time. I stopped using all the products before trying these products. However, it didn’t make a much difference. I have redness around my nose. That didn’t make any difference but it didn’t make my skin worse as well. Skin felt softer and brighter. This may work for dry skin. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review Didn’t see any difference
