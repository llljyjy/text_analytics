I usually use check-and-balances frothy origins cleanser but they sold out at my local Sephora. No big deal! So one of the Sephora ladies really recommended to me this face wash and totally hyped up the product. Super excited to try it out and see how it went. First time I used it I felt like it just wasn’t doing it for me. I thought that I shouldn’t judge it for using it once. So I gave my self a week and then two weeks….well, it was a total disappointment. I seriously couldn’t tell you how sad I am to have spent $34 for a face wash that just feels like I’m using a bar soap on my face when I could have spent $25 for origins and really get my face nice and clean. I will say that it doesn’t dry up your face so I’ll give it that. But if you have oily skin/normal skin or have to watch out for blackheads/pimples this ain’t it. Meh, don’t bother with this stuff
