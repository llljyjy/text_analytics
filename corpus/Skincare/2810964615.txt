I’ve been using this cream for about two weeks and I am actually quite surprised at the results I am seeing already. The best part about the cream is how thick it is and how little it takes to cover my entire face. I still have a lot of the cream left and I intend to keep using it. I am self conscious about the lines I’m noticing in the mirror. I try to use sunscreen and moisturize but it’s not enough to combat time. The “Confidence in a Cream“ gives me the ability to reverse some of the signs of aging that I worry about. My skin feels so soft and smooth. The lines around my eyes seem to be more shallow and not as noticeable. I was really concentrating on my eyes although I did smooth it around my whole face. It doesn’t leave me feeling greasy at all and It leaves my skin hydrated all day long. nan
