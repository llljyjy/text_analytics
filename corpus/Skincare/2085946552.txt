I didn’t want to like this because of the hefty price tag…unfortunately, I love it! It’s not a thick cream, if you were to tip the jar the product would run out. But it’s the most lush gel cream I have ever used! My skin feels so incredibly soft after using it, and it sinks in immediately! I’ve tried a lot of high end skincare and nothing compares to this experience. Lush, soft gel cream unlike any other!
