Hated it. Left my face sticky and feeling gross. Did not help and do not recommend. I did my homework this time and now I have a way better idea what Iâ€™m getting when I return this disaster of a toner..I just wish I could still find my first love when it comes to toners.Origins United States Balancing TonicI highly recommend it if you can find it. It worked amazing and If I could still find it locally I would not be looking for anything else. Not a good toner. Very sticky.
