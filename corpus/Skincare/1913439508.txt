While it is mildly brightening and I typically love anything from this line it is not the intense moisture you want or need for your under eye  area. It is a bit underwhelming considering the reviews. It’s mildly brightening but not enough for anyone with deep blue/black dark under eyes circles. If you have normal under eyes area that isn’t dry and isn’t very dark this may be a good fit for you however. It’s also ok for makeup prep but I wouldn’t rely on it for your main eye cream when doing your skin care routine. A great example of what a good under eye cream should feel like is Keihls avocado under eye cream, it’s extremely thick and and has a consistency almost like a runny glue and it’s extremely moisturizing.. Not moisturizing/brightening enough
