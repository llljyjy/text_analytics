This neck serum has a velvety feeling and feels hydrating. Doesn’t fee heavy on the skin and neck feels noticeably smoother in the morning. Long term, I’m not sure if it will “fix“ my deep creases as they have already been formed from years of looking down at my phone and old age but I think it helps with finer lines. nan
