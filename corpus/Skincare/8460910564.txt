I feel like itâ€™s not that hard to get a serum spray right. For me personally i used it as extra hydration at the beginning of my skincare routine after toner or throughout the day. There isnt any extra added fragrance to this serum but it kind of smells like mario badescu rosewater spray. While i didnt notice any significant changes in my skin with this product it is nice to have around. I think people who dont care for an extensive skincare routine will like this because its just a quick spritz and then you can apply your moisturizer right after and not feel like youre skimping out too much on your skincare. Any skintype can benefit from this, I wouldnt call this a staple product in a skincare routine but it is a nice novelty skincare product. nan
