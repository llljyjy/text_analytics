Definitely going to be a staple. It’s inexpensive, yet nicely packaged, and a little goes a long way. I’ve used this mask three times since I bought it, and it does really help with congestion from maskne, and makes your skin feel really clean without that tight stripping feeling you get with other clay masks. The texture is super smooth and velvety, and it has a slight minty tingle that’s gentle and pleasant. I think I’ll be using this once a week from here on out! Loved it
