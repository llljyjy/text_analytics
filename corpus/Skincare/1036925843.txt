This lotion is great!  Goes on smoothly and absorbs into skin very quickly even though it has the texture of sunscreen.  My skin feels smoother after using it for almost a week.  I don’t notice the smell that some people have mentioned.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate me at all.  I like this as an everyday sunscreen moisturizer.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
