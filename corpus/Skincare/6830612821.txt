I bought the mushroom serum only because I needed to spend a few more dollars to get a free sample, wasn’t really looking for anything specific so at $5 I figured might as well give it a try.. kinda blew my mind how nice this is, especially for that price. My skin is already dry and the winter weather is killing me and this little guy really helped with hydration and with the dry, flaky skin. And I feel like it’s helping take down redness on my cheeks a lil bit as well. The pump does kinda suck like others have said, you just have to cup your hand around it to prevent it from going everywhere. I’d actually buy this again, not bad at all! pretty great for price
