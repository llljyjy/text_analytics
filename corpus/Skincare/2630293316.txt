This is the first time I have used a cleansing balm, when I first applied I was worried it was greasy but as I washed off it left my skin clean, smooth and no dryness. I’m not sure if this would have worked for me when I was younger but definitely great on mature skin, no dryness, just smooth and soft! I’m in love and it smells great! Great for Mature Skin
