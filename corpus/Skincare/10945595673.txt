Honestly adore this product; It’s the best mask I’ve ever used. My skin is very oily and acne-prone and I find that this mask mattifies my skin and reduces redness of pimples. The scent is pretty strong and it does have a very “Vicks“ smell and effect if it’s too close to the eyes, so just be aware of that if that’s something that bothers you. Great to throw on when you have a flare-up!
