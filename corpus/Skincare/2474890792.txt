I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I am using it as a balm mask every night to intensive the moisturizing of my skin since it does get dry in the winter.  My skin is looking plump and moisturized every morning.  The balm has little to no fragrant smell, it would work well with any skin type.  This product will become part of my skin routine. Hydrating for your skin
