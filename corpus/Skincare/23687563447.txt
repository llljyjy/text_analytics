I received this product as part of a promotion to try for 7 days. I have always had issued with dry skin under my eyes. I could definitely tell that this serum made a difference on my skin. It feels very light and it smells amazing. My undereye looked glowy and moisturized after every use and even better the next morning. I definitely recommend. Good eye serum
