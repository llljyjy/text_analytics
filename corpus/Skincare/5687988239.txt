I am really liking this cleanser. I have been using it 2x per day for over 2 weeks straight and have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin feels like it has smaller pores and less blackheads and I have experienced a little less breakouts since I started using it consistently. I really like how it makes my skin feel clean and healthy without overly dried out. I also have not had any irritation and I have sensitive skin.  I definitely plan to continue using this product as part of my regular skin care routine. The only con I have is the texture. It is kind of runny, but it lathers very well, a little goes a long way and it doesnâ€™t have a strong scent. I definitely recommend. Really love this cleanser
