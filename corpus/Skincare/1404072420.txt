I really had to let this stuff warm up in my fingers to get it to spread evenly, and even then found it a bit difficult to spread. Also, whenever I used enough of the product to actually get the full SPF coverage I looked really greasy, and I don’t have oily skin. I think it looks nice if you apply a smaller amount, it gives a nice glow, but you’d need to make sure you had another SPF on underneath... Not my favorite, but gives a glow
