Iâ€™m super impressed with this cleanser.  I got the deluxe sample size in my Birthday Gift from Sephora (thank you).  I really look forward to washing my face with this everynight since I got it.   You put it on your dry skin and then you add water.  It really takes off all my makeup including eye makeup and it does not leave my skin dry at all.  For reference I have super dry and sensitive skin.  Now I am going to buy the full size because I love it so much! Super Impressed
