I have been using this for a few days now! It makes my eyes feel wonderful and has a cooling effect. Not a strong smell which is nice. It is a balm so it is easy to apply. I don’t like that I need to apply it several times a day so I have been applying it in the morning after my shower and before makeup. I also apply it after I wash my face before bed. Overall, it’s a nice perk-up for my eyes when they are feeling and looking extra tired and quick enough that I don’t have to wait for a mask or use it regularly for results. Easy and quick eye perk up
