I really like this sunscreen so far. There’s no smell at all and it sits well on my skin. No greasy feeling at all on my combination skin and no breakouts. I do agree with others that I’d rather this come in a pump as it’s very runny. I feel like I have to use quite a bit to adequately protect my face but I attribute that to the thin consistency. I’m not sure how long the bottle will last me but I do like the formula considering it’s spf 50 and most mineral sunscreens are spf 30. I like the sleekness of the bottle for flights as it won’t take up much room in my liquids bag but I’m seeing reviews saying that the bottle becomes flaky. This a hasn’t happened to me yet but mine is very new. Overall I’d say if you prefer a mineral sunscreen that is scent free with high spf, you’ll probably enjoy this if it’s within your budget. great spf but not perfect
