so easy to use and refreshing! Left on for 10 minutes as directed and woke up this morning with small pores, well hydrated skin! I love it, I also used the Ole Herkinson moisturizer because my skin gets really dry in the winter and it was the perfect combo! silky smooth skin! I will be using this once a week from now on :) i love it! must have!
