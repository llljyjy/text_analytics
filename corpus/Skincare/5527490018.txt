I would describe this producat as more of a tinted moisturizer. It’s fairly lightweight and the formula feels hydrating. It melts into your skin and there’s no sunscreen smelll like some of the other products I’ve used. I have fairly dry skin so this worked well for me, I’m not sure the oily folk will love this. My only issue is the colour range! The difference between cool and warm is so significant there needs to be in between colours. The packaging colour is deceiving. Lovely formula, needs more colour range!
