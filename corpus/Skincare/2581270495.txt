This is my favorite daytime moisturizer! It is great for combination or oily skin since it dries matte and is very light. It has a “primer like“ texture and almost blurs out your pores so I love to wear it under makeup. This is my holy grail, I have repurshased it 3 times over the last years. The bottle also lasts almost a year for me so that’s a great bonus! Overall I would recommend it to everyone unless you have very dry skin as it’s only downside is that it doesn’t hydrate as much as other moisturizers. nan
