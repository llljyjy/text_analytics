I love using this in its own after a light gel moisturizer. It seems to really help with raw skin. I have sore areas from over using retinol and other drying acne-fighting products as well as from picking. I find this works wonders to hide and soothing irritation. Just add some brows and maybe a little blush and you’ve got a beautiful, natural look. It’s only been a few days but so far I’m obsessed. It’s a different consistency than what I normally use for either skincare or makeup but I really like it. Make sure to only use very small amounts and warm it up between your fingers first for best results! soothes my raw/sore skin and evens complexion
