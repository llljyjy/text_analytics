I received a one time use sample from topbox circle. The serum is little bit thicker compared to other serums that I have used but it absorbs to the skin completely and does not give an oily appearance. Gives a little bit of tinge sensation on skin which is common to other retinol products but it resolved pretty quickly. Hydrating and refreshing
