I really like this moisturizer, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the smell. It’s not horrible but it’s definitely not the best smell. But the product itself is great. It feels very hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It doesn’t pill with sunscreen either! I recommend it if you can get past the smell. nan
