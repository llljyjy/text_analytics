The salve is an excellent product for the amount you spend.  I use it on my eyebrows after waxing as I get very red.  It helps with the redness and swelling.  I have also used it on mosquito bites as it reduces the urge to scratch.  I have put it on a burn that was on my mother-in-law’s arm and it did not leave a scar.I ♡ it!!! Multiuse Salve
