Obsessed with this!!  I found when I used it on it’s own my skin looked a little flat, so I dot a half-pea size amount on my cheeks (where the redness is) and then dot a pea size amount of Pixi H20 Skintint (in color “Warm“) on cheeks, forehead & chin then blend everything in with a flat brush. The result is less redness and a beautiful soft glow! Holy grail combo for my fair, sensitive, combination skin. Amazing for redness!
