I adore this, and it has done wonders for my skin. It is very liquidy though; think the constancy of milk. I use this evening and night, but I usually apply an additional moisturizer over top (except in the summer) just because I want to lock in the moisture (I have very dry skin). All in all, really great and I will continue to purchase and use this product. Awesome light weight moisturizer
