Great sunscreen for a decent price! I have an olive skin tone and white casts happen easily for me with a lot of face sunscreens (zinc oxide based ones make me look purple lol)- but this does not! It blends right in, has a very light smell that isnâ€™t bothersome, and provides good coverage. I tend to use mostly Korean skin products and my go to one has become incredibly difficult to find, so this one has become my new go to!! nan
