I received this product to try, and had never heard of the brand before. When I saw the box, I assumed this would be an eye cream in a tube, and was surprised to find the interior packaging looked like a lip balm stick. When I tried it, I liked the concept of a solid balm that you can really control in application. I did feel that my under eye area especially was moisturized after using the product, but I can’t say I noticed an impact under makeup. I usually use a very light application of cream concealer in my under eye, which went on just fine. Perhaps that is testament to the quality of the product - while I didn’t notice looking more plumped or hydrated, my concealer also wasn’t sliding around. What makes this unique is definitely the balm stick formula. It would be excellent for travelling in place of a liquid tube or pot of eye-cream, and replaces the need for separate day and nights products. I actually plan to take it on a trip overseas in a few weeks. The only real complaint I have about this balm is that it does pull slightly on delicate under eye skin when first applying, as it needs a little time to warm up and glide smoothly. Nice little product
