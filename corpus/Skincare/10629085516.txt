I’ve been using HABIT SPF 41 as a primer before I apply my makeup and a facial sunscreen. I love how well it sits on top of my makeup, giving the appearance of dewy glass skin! Ever since I started using HABIT SPF, I’ve been much better at applying sunscreen daily in my skincare routine :) Will be repurchasing in the future! My second bottle :)
