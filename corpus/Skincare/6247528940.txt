Really bad experience with Habit. I commented on instagram that it made my skin appear and feel very oily, didn’t provide enough protection for me, and caused me to breakout. The social media team deleted my comments and then when I emailed the team instead, they wouldn’t address that unethical behavior. I wouldn’t have tried this if I knew what to expect (but I didn’t see any negative comments from others bc Habit deletes them!). nan
