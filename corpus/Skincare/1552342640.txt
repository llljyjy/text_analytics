I wonder why there are bad reviews for this? This is truly the greatest face cream I have ever used. I am in my 40s with dry skin, and this truly moisturizes and plumps my skin. It is very noticeable. It smells a bit like, natural, maybe? It kind of reminds me of dried mushrooms or soy sauce, but it is a very mild smell that goes away after a few minutes. But honestly, I would use this cream even if it smelled like a toilet. It is extremely effective. I have used other Clinique products in the past and have never thought much of them, but this product is very different. I love it. Best moisturizer for firming and plumping skin
