I think it’s an amazing product, a little thick for my taste, but retinol is usually like that, it doesn’t have a strong smell, and I like that, I haven’t seen much change in my skin yet, but the times I’ve applied it I haven’t I have felt no type of irritation, and that just a month and a half ago I had a chemical peel and this product did not irritate my skin, I have high expectations!!!  The only bad thing I would say is that I feel that it is difficult for me to spread it all over my face and neck, I have to use about 3 pumps. I love it!
