I am so intrigue when I saw this on Tiktok and everybodyâ€™s like it so since my Purito suncreen is already empty why not trying a new one. My issue with suncreen they all clumpy when I apply them after moisturizer ( thats why I love the other brand it doesnt do that ) and this one does that too, tried it different ways like applying it after 5 mins after moisturizer still the same thing, i dont have issue with scent I love the watermelon but it fades pretty quick and it just smell like a regular suncreen. I will continue using it as its also kinda pricey. I will still use it!
