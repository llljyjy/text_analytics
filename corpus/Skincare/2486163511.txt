I love love love this product! It’s become part of my daily skin care routine. I have normal/dry skin & have been noticing my face feeling moisturized. It’s very late & doesn’t leave any residue. The smell is pretty light & the packaging is a work of art. I’ve always been a fan of this company & I will continue to use it! Prettiest serum I own.
