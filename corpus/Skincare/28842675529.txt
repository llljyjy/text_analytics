I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this for over two weeks now and have seen a little bit of brightness happening on my face where I have scarring. I found the product to be a little sticky when putting it on and has a strong orange scent to it but the stickiness does go away once its rubbed in and the scent does as well! I would recommend this product if you are looking for something to brighten your skin tone because it has helped with that in just two weeks! I also have seen the redness in my face has gone away slightly on my cheeks and chin as well which is nice. The only downside is the packaging and I wish the squirt part of the bottle was a thinner cylinder shape instead of big and thick. Brightening Moisturizer
