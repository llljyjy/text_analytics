When I got the item, I was very excited to try it. Upon opening the package and reading the Directions for Use section, I was a little shocked to see I was supposed to use this on clean, dry skin and to follow with my skincare routine.  To me, a light cream would be the step of a moisturizer . I reached out to my friend who then found the How to Use screenshot from the website, which confirmed that this was to be used in the step of a moisturizer.  Package instructions are wrong and need to be fixed. I proceeded to use this product per the website instructions, and have been for about a week. I have to say, I’m not a fan! I’m not sure if it’s my skin, or this light cream’s incompatibility with non Augustinus Bader products, but this pills. I have noticed that stuff kept rubbing stuff off of my face.I am also not a fan of the bottle. While I like how it’s recyclable. I’m don’t understand why this is a round-bottle container. This thing cannot stand on its own!! Not a fan…
