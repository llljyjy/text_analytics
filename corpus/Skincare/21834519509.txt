Unfortunately this was extremely harsh on my sensitive skin. It completely broke my skin out-on & around all areas applied. I was given this to sample by BuzzAgent & I’m thankful for the opportunity to try this product. I can understand more what my skin can & cannot tolerate. Just because it didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean it won’t work for you. Kiehl’s has amazing products. You just have to find the right serum & face products for your skin type. nan
