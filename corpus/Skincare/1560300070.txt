I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Pinchme.  First the shade looked a little too dark for me, but it showed almost no tint on the skin.  Instruction said to shake well and tap/not rub.  I used it for the first time during the summer and it was a bit too glowy for me.  So, I am saving this for the colder month where I need more moisture.  I work from home a lot, so this will be the day I wonâ€™t wear much/any makeup, but use it instead of sunscreen. Mmmmm
