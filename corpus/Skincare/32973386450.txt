I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It’s claimed that this mask reduces oil, extracts blackheads and removes dead skin cells. I received only one mask so I used it once. It was a bit difficult to put it properly on the face since it’s a bit thick. After using it, I felt like my skin looks brighter. However, as I only used it once, I’m not sure how well it would improve the skin overall. nan
