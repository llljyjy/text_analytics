I have been using Dr. Dennis Gross SkincareAdvanced Retinol + Ferulic Triple Correction Eye Serum along with the Advanced Retinal * Ferulic wrinkle cream. I am a skin care junkie and besides braking my bank these products don’t work at all.  My dark circles are darker and the skin is almost translucent. So disappointed. It contains retinal so does that mean I can’t use other skin products with it? So Disappointed Dr Dennis Gross  I trusted you!
