I received the wrinkle correcting serum as a #freesample from #topboxcircle in exchange for an opinion of its use. Serum is a bit thicker than some I have used in the past but, make no mistake, the serum leaves your skin luxuriously soft & well hydrated. I used the serum in the evening as part of my skin care routine. I will buy a full-size! Love this wrinkle correcting eye serum!
