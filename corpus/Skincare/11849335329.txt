I absolutely love my gua sha! I keep it in the fridge and it feels incredible on my skin—I’m only rating 4/5 because I wish it retained the cold a little longer. My boyfriend even asks me to use this tool on his face now. It’s a nice addition to my skincare routine, morning or night. Keep it in the fridge!
