I’m genuinely upset at how much I like this product. I received a free sample of this to review and it’s now become something I can’t live without. It makes my skin feel so smooth and doesn’t feel heavy under my moisturizer. I have super dry, sensitive skin that can be prone to breakout with new products and this didn’t make me break out! Will definitely be repurchasing I’m upset
