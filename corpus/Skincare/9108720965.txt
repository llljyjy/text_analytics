I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and it’s made such a difference in my skin! The redness has gone down drastically and my skin holds moisture so much better. I layer this on top of my hyaluronic acid pressed serum nightly. It’s a little too much for daytime use for me, but perfect for my night routine. It has zero scent which is nice. I’ll definitely keep this as a holy grail skincare product. Perfection in a jar
