Sad to report that I too had a similar issue with the product not coming out of the tube! Just like most everyone else who has made a review I absolutely LOVE the product, not sticky or tacky, perfect amount of moisture that stays throughout the day. But again my tube stopped dispensing the product about halfway through use. I ended up throwing it away as well. I stuck a toothpick down to see if it was just buildup but it still would not come out. Not sure what happened but if new packaging is formulated with this product I will definitely be buying it again. Needs Different Packaging
