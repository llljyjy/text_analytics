I received a small sample of this for my honest opinion. I like how the scream is nice and thick, I feel like it does moisturize my face and absorb leaving a velvety slightly oily feeling, which makes my makeup application easier. Due to the size, I can’t attest to any tightening or firming. A good moisturizer though, I can’t say anything about long term effects Moisturizes, but too early for any other claims
