I need a morning eye cream that helps make me look more awake/well-rested/hydrated but also primes the skin for fairly heavy under eye concealer. I find that this cream toes that line quite nicely - I like the sensation of applying it, I like how it sits on the skin, and I really love how well my makeup goes on overtop. However, I do get slightly squicked out by skincare products in pots, so this canâ€™t be a five-star product for me. Nearly perfect!
