I have used the daily microfoliant gifted by dermalogica sampling for 2 days now & really like it! I’ve never used. Powder exfoliate before so that sort was a little strange to add the water but it’s worth it. It has my skin feeling so incredibly amazing! My skin just feels so smooth & soft. I am very pleased with this product! Love this product!
