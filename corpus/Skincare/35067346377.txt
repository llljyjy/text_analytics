This is definitely worth the price! I noticed a definite change in my skins texture, the few wrinkles I did have are essentially non-existent, my acne scars started fading, and the few spots I did have shrunk down and disappeared after just two applications! I’ve been using it for about three weeks every night after washing my face before applying moisturizer and my skin looks and feels amazing! I definitely recommend this product, I know it’s expensive, but it’s so worth it, your skin will thank you! Best serum ever
