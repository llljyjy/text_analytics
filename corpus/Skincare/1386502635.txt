iâ€™ve tried several other spot treatments and this one has been the most effective for me. I keep coming back and it works best when you apply multiple times over the blemish. So I apply it then once it dries I reapply it about 3x. It can dry out the area slightly but nothing terrible and it helps expedite getting rid of the pimple. simply the best spot treatment
