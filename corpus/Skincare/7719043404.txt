I have a number of wishful products and when I heard about this product I want to give it a try. Of course the packing is beautiful as the rest of wishful products. I expected this product to smell like cherry but it doesn’t have any smell at all. I tried this product so far for 3 nights and I really like it. It gives really nice deep hydration to the face. The consistency of the mask is similar to petroleum gel, so if you don’t like thick products or if you like sheer/light products this is not for you. Otherwise I highly recommend it, I feel it will help a lot during winter time too!! New product added to my nigh routine!!
