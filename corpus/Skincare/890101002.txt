Maybe. The texture is nice. Feels good on my skin. I’ve used my sample consistently for about a two weeks, in the morning only. Works well under foundation. Can’t see any immediate results…. That’s why only three stars. Otherwise it’sa fine moisturizer. I’m sure if it was used A.M. and P.M. you could see benefits. My skin drinks up moisturizer in the desert, soo the sample wasn’t big enough to use day and night. Just ok, but nice
