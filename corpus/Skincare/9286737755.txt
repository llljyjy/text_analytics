I’m really enjoying this spray. I use it both before and after makeup and its so refreshing. It has a great scent and absorbs so well into the skin. I love it as a setting spray as it keeps my makeup flawless all day. The bottle itself is really pretty and luxurious. The sprayer sprays such a nice fine spray that it doesn’t feel too overwhelming. I really enjoy this and definitely recommend. Love
