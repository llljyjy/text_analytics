I used this serum am/pm and found it was lovely to use. It was a fluid serum that absorbed quickly into my skin. It did not ball up or pill and sat well underneath the rest of my skincare and then makeup application. As with all Clinique products, it was unscented and did not irritate my skin or eyes. My skin felt soft after application and left my skin feeling like it had just received a drink of hydration that lasted all day and into the morning after night application. #freeproduct #trybeforeyoubuy #CliniqueSmartClinical Beautiful hydrating serum
