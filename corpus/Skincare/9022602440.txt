This is a very hydrating eye gel/cream combo. Itâ€™s hard to find non-cream under eye products that are super hydrating, and all the cream ones give me milia after using for a while. I really enjoy this product and a little goes a long way. I only took a star off because the price point is still pretty high. nan
