I had not tried Confidence in a Cream in the past because I remember reading that it was mainly for dry skin. I have mature skin (55 this year) but my skin is still pretty oily on most days, however I feel that I need a good moisturizer to keep aging at bay. IT Confidence in a Cream is definitely moisturizing, it has a great texture, melts into the skin and fragrance is light but not overwhelming. Since using this the past few weeks my skin definitely feels less oily during the day and in the areas I had some dryness these are feeling less dry. I would definitely consider re-purchasing and will recommend to my friends! My Oily/Combo Skin Loves This!
