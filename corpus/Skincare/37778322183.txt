I rarely use anything in my skin as a man, but I had a bad breakout and just so happened to receive a sample with a. Cologne purchase. I used it and got little bumps. I almost stopped using it, but looked at a review and found out it was called purging where it was actually flushing out all the oil and bumps in the process of being formed. I bought a small bottle and continued using it. After a week, my bumps have cleared, and some big pores on my face magically disappeared also. I would not recommend using this if you have less than 2 weeks before a trip or so. The “purging “ will continue but afterwards my skin is clearer than ever.  If you are African American like me, please use the mattifying sunscreen also Stick with it if you break out initially
