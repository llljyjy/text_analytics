I love this balm!! It creates a protective barrier and turns my dry, red winter skin soft and plump and moisturized. It’s a thick cream but it does but feel oily and absorbs relatively quickly. There’s also no fragrance, which makes my sensitive skin happy. I definitely recommend this if you have dry, sensitive skin or live in harsh climates. nan
