I love this mask so much! It’s unscented, thick and hydrating. I got the small sample with purchase and I think this is such a good calming face mask. It feels kinda thick going on, but soaks in soooo quickly. I don’t think this would be a good option for oily skin, but it’s fantastic for dry skin! Definitely a win in my books! Unscented, lovely face mask
