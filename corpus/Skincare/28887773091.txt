After using this product for a few weeks, I can safely say that I havenâ€™t really noticed a difference in my skin texture. If anything it just dried me out and did nothing else. The packaging is also very leaky, and when you pump it, it sort of sprays out randomly. This would be better packaged in a dropper. No difference, meh packaging
