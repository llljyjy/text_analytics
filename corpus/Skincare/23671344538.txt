After using this product for almost a month I don’t know how to feel about it. I don’t hate it and I don’t know if I like it. It seemed to clear up some of my acne (I think) but it also dried out my skin which I only say that because I stopped using it for about a week and the dry patches cleared up. I’ll post before and afters so you can be the judge. Not so sure
