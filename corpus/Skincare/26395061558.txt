This Wake Up Honey Eye cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve always had problems with using eye creams. Firstly, I have horrible bags under my eyes that I can never find a solution to. Secondly, my under eyes or so sensitive that whenever I use an eye cream or gel they either start to dry out and develop a rash or it doesn’t absorb properly and starts going to my eye. With the Wake Up Honey eye cream I see that a little goes a long way because if I apply too much then the latter happens to me. After using it for a few days, I feel like my eyes do appear brighter but it didn’t do much to change the bags under my eyes, which I didn’t really expect for it to happen. If you’re looking for something to just brighten up and hydrate the under eye then this might be a great product for you Brightening and Hydrating
