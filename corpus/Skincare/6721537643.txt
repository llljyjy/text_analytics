I have been using this product for about 2 weeks just as a spot treatment on one acne scar I have beside my nose and I can tell a difference already. This one scar is textured and looks like a small hole on my face basically, and it is already becoming more flat with my skin and making the scar go away. I will be repurchasing this product when I run out, but since I am using such a small amount and this bottle is so large for the amount you need, I really donâ€™t expect to run out anytime soon. Very impressed!
