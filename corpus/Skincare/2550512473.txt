I’m a licensed esthetician, so I’m always on the hunt for the perfect products.  I’m in my late 30s, and for sure having signs of fine lines, dryness, and dullness - which I rely heavily on good products to fix haha.I’m never usually affected by smells.  Products that other claims have an odor don’t typically phase me.  This does have a weird smell to it - you can tell it’s derived from the honey, but it’s just weird.  And I can understand why it would be off putting to some customers.I’m a big fan of dermal layering in terms of products.  Until a company comes out with a “one size fits all” product, layering my products will still be part of my regimen.  Unfortunately…I haven’t been able to figure out which part of my routine this one goes in.  I’ve tried as a first product…but once I apply the rest of my serums and creams, by the end, I’m getting “pilling” and the products are clumping and rolling off.  I put it on last, and at that point, it’s not being absorbed.  So perhaps it’s better suited for someone who’s NOT product junky…because this one “doesn’t play well with others”.  So if you’re one of those who likes to use different products targeted for various issues, this wouldn’t be a good one to add.  However, if you’re more low maintenance and apply minimal products, this one way work.  That being said - I do think there are better hyaluronic acid products out there then this one.Due to the fact that it doesn’t work well with my other products, and the fact that I feel there are other better hyaluronic treatments … wouldn’t reccomend this product unfortunately.  Gave it 2 outta 5 because it’s a small group of people this would work well for. nan
