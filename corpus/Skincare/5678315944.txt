I received this product complimentary from @influenster and @guerlain for my honest review.I have been using Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery oil both day and night for 3 weeks on a freshly cleansed face. I love the silky texture of this lightweight watery oil. I love the look of the Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery oil bottle. It is so perfect on my vanity, so luxurious looking. I love the gold microbeads in the bottle. The eye dropper makes it very easy to use.  First I shook the bottle to make sure I got the correct amount of golden microbeads. I only had to use two drops warmed up in my palms, a little goes a long way. The microbeads just melted easily into my palms. I smoothed the oil into my skin with the palms of my hand starting in the middle of my face and then moving outwards. The oil absorbed into my skin fairly quickly and did not leave a greasy feeling. I fell in love with Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery oil. It is made with 95% naturally derived ingredients. This distinctive formulation has the richness of an oil, the lightness of a lotion, and the power of a serum. I loved the subtle floral & honey scent. The black bee repair technology self-repairs my skin nine times faster for more youthful, plumed-up, smoother, and more luminant skin.I love the extra boost the Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery oil gives my skin leaving it more radiant and heather skin. I noticed an improvement in my fine lines. I will keep using this magic in a bottle and I have included it in my skin routine. Magic in a Bottle
