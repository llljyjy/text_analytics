LOVE this self tanner! It’s clear so I haven’t had any trouble with it staining my clothes/sheets! I love the color and it seems to stay on longer than the St. Tropez or My Loving Tan and also wears off without being splotchy or sporty! Also, loved that when I rinsed it off that a lot of the product still stayed on (except for my face ) which is something I really like. 10/10 would recommend! Fav self tanner!!!
