I appreciate being able to try this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. With my personal skin care, I have to revolve around being a mom first. Sometimes it’s hard to find a go to mask that works after a long day and your skin feeling yuck. I’ve tried different masks ranging from scrubs to peels; you’d think that your skin feels “clean” or looks “clean”. But with this mask it actually has a nice after feel that actually clarifies your skin, there is always that bit of dryness to your skin after taking the product off as usual. But In addition I love that the cute tube is recyclable and has an adequate amount of product. Truly unique mask
