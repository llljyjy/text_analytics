This serum is a great addition to my morning/routine. I can’t see myself not using it! It has made my skins texture so much smoother and it absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave my face all sticky like other serums i have tried. It is a little pricey, but worth the $$. I definitely recommend this product! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Great serum!
