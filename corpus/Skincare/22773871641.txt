I thought this would be a great product, but it ended up breaking my chin out. I don’t consider my skin sensitive at all so I’m not sure what’s in this product that caused the breakout. I also wasn’t thrilled with the smell, but it did disappear pretty quickly. I’ll be returning unfortunately. Not for me
