This is a wonderful cleanser. It removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. It rinses off my face more easily than any other cleanser I’ve used. It doesn’t bother my sensitive eyes, either, which is incredible. I bought this on a whim and love it  way more than I expected to. I’ll definitely repurchase and would highly recommend to anyone in need of a good cleanser. gentle effective cleansing
