I’m a Fitzpatrick 1-2, 19, with dry/combination skin. I currently use differin adapalene, and also TO BHA AHA peel once a week. I use this midweek for an extra boost, before I apply differin, and it really does help. Be cautious, esp if you already use actives. Your moisture barrier ain’t no joke. Definitely smells like watermelon candy, so if smell is a sensory ick for you, this might not work. Texture is like water/watermelon juice lol. I def prefer the texture of this to the PC BHA exfoliant. TL;DR: good for pores and a glow, good texture. Be careful with sensitive skin obvi. Great for pores and glow
