Before I bought this I was reading everybody’s reviews and they were talking about how amazing it was so I just had to try it for myself. I think in life very rarely to things live up to the hype but THIS DOES! It’s beautiful on its own, melts into the skin, evens out skin tone and even softens enlarged pores which I thought it may emphasize them due to the natural glow/ highlight component but IT DOES NOT! The dewy glow that this glaze leaves on my face is everything. I don’t wear a lot of skin makeup and this provides a beautifully light and airy feel to blur to imperfections while also giving me that full glam glow. Just buy it. You won’t be disappointed. The best primer/ highlighter/ moisturizer
