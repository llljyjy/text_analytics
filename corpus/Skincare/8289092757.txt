Silky soft formula. I love how hydrating it feels and how smooth it goes on. Doesn’t feel like it just sits on top of the skin but that it absorbs so well. I couldn’t give it a full 5 starts because I only received a small sample size so I can’t fully see how the results are, but from the first impression I really like it. Silky and moisturizing
