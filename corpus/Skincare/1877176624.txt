My first review ever because I truly think this product is amazing. I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I purchased this because I had over processed and damaged my skin barrier with to many active ingredients which led me to having even more severe clogged pores and more frequent breakouts.My skin was flaking, yet oily as it was trying to overcompensate for the lost moisture. Only 4 days into using this stuff and my complexion has completely cleared, no more flaking, and the redness has reduced significantly. I hardly have any more clogged pores. Honestly never tried any product that had this noticable of an effect on my skin. Amazing this stuff is miraculous
