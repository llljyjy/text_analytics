I love me some Clinique!! Clinique is a classic! I literally remember my grandmother using it back in the day.  The moisturizers even looks the same as back then! I got to try out this wrinkle eye cream for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really like this cream so far! It goes in nice and smooth, is nice and thick but doesn’t Leah you feeling greasy at all.  It’s perfect!  I didn’t notice any certain smell it’s just pleasant and light.   I haven’t used it long enough to see if it will remove any wrinkles but I will update you guys as needed! Thanks Influenster & Clinique! You guys are bomb! Super thick creamy wrinkle cream! Clinique!
