This is my first review on a product because I felt the people just needed to know. OBSESSED! I got a free trial size with a sample bag, and immediately went to buy the full size. I have acne-prone and oily skin, and I normally feel like masks just don’t do anything for me. I also have pretty sensitive skin, so I was nervous this would be too harsh for me with BHAs. But I could feel the difference immediately after use (so freaking smooth), and I could SEE the difference the next day (visible improvement in my blemish problem areas). And I haven’t had any irritation to my sensitive skin whatsoever. I only use maybe once or twice a week, but I’m obsessed with the results! If you’re debating buying this mask - DO IT!! Absolutely obsessed with this mask!!!
