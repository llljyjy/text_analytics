Hands down best toner I’ve used and always so excited to for my skincare routine when I jump out of bed. Immediate first impression: smells great and soothes my skin. For the few weeks I’ve used it, I’ve noticed my skin texture improve and some redness disappear. However, since I have really sensitive skin, I can only use it a couple times a week or every other day since it is an “exfoliating treatment”. I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review Tatcha Tonic
