Received the 7 day trial for @clarins and I really enjoy this serum, I found my skin is firmer and very stable during the time I am using it. It is quick-absorbing and doesn’t feel like oil at all. The fragrance is a bit strong when applying in face but fortunately it do not last. It doesn’t affect your makeup performance as well. Super easy to use, i highly recommend this product to anyone needing a face pick me up! Definitely made my face feel healthy, firmer and over all just incredible nan
