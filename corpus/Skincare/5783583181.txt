I was very curious about this brand, so I have put the Niacinamide Night Cream right away to the test. It has been incorporated into my nighttime skincare routine and it seems that my sensitive combination skin is been tolerating it well. It has a thicker consistency, so I like to massage it well into the skin, no particular smell and it feels hydrating on. To be honest, one night I have experienced pilling from this moisturizer, I think it did not work well with another product I was using. I honestly have mixed feelings about this product, wish it would be more hydrating for my skin. Mixed feelings about this one...
