I recieved this complementary for testing purposes, the serum it light an silky it applies like it will be oily but absorbs quite nicely..  I dosnt seem to make my face oily after I add my makeup.  I have very sensitive skin around my eyes an will usually get little red dots all over will most eye serums or creams, glad to report not dots... very pleased... an highly recommend. Silky an smooth
