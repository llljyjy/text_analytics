I received this product to try out in a voxbox. The main thing I really like about this product is the applicator. It’s elongated oval shape really lets you get in there and the grooves help to make sure you’re evenly distributing the product. The applicator is made of metal which gives a cool massaging feel when applying serum.The serum itself has a good consistency. It’s not runny but it’s not thick either. The fragrance is very light and not overpowering.While using this product, I did notice some slight smoothing of the skin in terms of fine lines with n my under-eye area but not to the degree that the packaging makes it seem like you will experience. My eyes never appeared larger and my bags did not appear lifted as the product claims. I definitely would not spent the $80 this product retails for based on my results. It definitely feels like they’re charging more for the name than actual performance/serum results. I like this product but I don’t love it. Like But Don’t Love
