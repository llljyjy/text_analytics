After only one night I have found out that THIS is how your skin is suppose to feel after a peel. My skin is remarkably rose petal soft and smooth in appearance. I was even able to follow this up with my tretinoin .25 after allowing it some time to work. After moisturizer I topped it all off with The Ordinary B oil and loved my skin in the morning. It worked so well I do not feel the need to apply it again. I will wait until the softness gets dull. A little went a long ways as I only used about 6 drops for my entire face and neck so this oz should last quit a while. This is the BEST exfoliater I have ever used! I wish I would have tried this sooner!
