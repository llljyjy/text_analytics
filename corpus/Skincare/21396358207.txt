You need this Serum. I already own many of the YTTP products and thought that I didn’t need to add this product to my skin care.. But I absolutely love it and it has become key to hydrated skin. I apply before my moisturizer and it does a great job at keeping my face nice and plump. Make up applies beautifully. I’ve tried other serums and it makes my makeup patchy. This one doesn’t actually my make up looks better with it. Love it!!!
