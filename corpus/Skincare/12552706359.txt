This is a really nice cleanser that takes off everything you have on for the day. I donâ€™t use makeup but it did well with skincare products. one thing to note is that I have dry skin so when I washed my face, my skin felt taut - similar to other cleansers that I have used before that were stripping. Sounds lile it would be great for more oily skin. In addition, the scent is really strong - I put products on top of it and I could still smell it. I wish they came with a fragrance free version that is more suitable for drier skin. A Great Product
