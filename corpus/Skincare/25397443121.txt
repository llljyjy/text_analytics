I’ve used the ole henriksen banana bright eye creme for a long time and I think this eye cream from the inkey list is much better for an instant brightening effect. They both contain a pearlescent that provides that light reflecting instant brighten but I think the inkey list performs better in that aspect!I haven’t been using the bright-i cream for long so I can’t speak for it’s long term effects just yet. A better brightener than Ole Henriksen
