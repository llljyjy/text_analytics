I love the brand but if you have super sensitive skin you may wanna avoid this one. I was using both this and the moisturizer and started to get some really nasty break outs so I stopped using both and let my skin calm down a bit. I did eventually try this face wash again but it made my breakouts even worse. I have very sensitive and more dry skin so if you also have that, I wouldn’t recommend but my friend with more normal- dry skin that isn’t as sensitive loves it. Not a bad product just not for my skin
