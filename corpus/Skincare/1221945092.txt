Had this about 8 months now. I really like it. It’s hydrating and not greasy, though I sometimes need to reapply mid day if it’s really dry in the house. I like it better than Daily Greens from Farmacy because it’s less tacky when you put it on and the tackiness goes away a lot faster (2-3 minutes vs 10). nan
