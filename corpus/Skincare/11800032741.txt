Let me say that this is one pricey serum and smells really nice. I used this serum every morning and night as part of my skincare routine. I didn’t really see any difference in my skin but I did notice that my face was very soft and hydrated when I woke up each morning. It like have a spa in a bottle and feels great to have as a collection because Charlotte is my favorite makeup brand but skin care brand would take me a bit more convincing because I had better result with less pricey serum. I like that the packaging was secured and the product itself it’s heavy since it’s made of glass. Not only that it’s has a dropper with a gold trim around it which make it looks luxurious to me. Other then that I would have to used this product at least 3 month to see result because I have combination skin and most of pricey products don’t really work well unless I used it consistently. But for the price to be honest, it’s too expensive for a small bottle and I can never afforded it because of how much it’s cost. Like $80 is a lot for a serum and I rather used Rihanna because it’s like half the price. It was great to try and I thank my fellow Influenster company for the gift. Love ya xoxo.
