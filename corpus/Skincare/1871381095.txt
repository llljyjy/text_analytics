I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review from Influencer and Est√©e Lauder. I have a dryer skin type, on the rougher side, that lacks a glow. Overall I like this serum. I used the serum for almost 2 weeks. A little goes a long way. My skin in slowly felt hydrated. After that time period, My skin looked more glowing and felt smoother and hydrated. The only downside is it has a strong fragrance  of Waterlily Flower, which I find is very nice but for those who are scent sensitive my be discouraged. I would like to purchase this full-size product to see the more lasting affects. nan
