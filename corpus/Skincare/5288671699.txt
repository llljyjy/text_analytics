Iâ€™ve been a licensed esthetician for many years and love products that not only feel and look great, but improve the health of your skin. Kosas really delivers in this area and it has become a favorite brand of mine. Needless to say, I was very excited to try this new lip treatment! Rich butters and oils combined with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid makes this super nourishing to the lips. My favorite thing I noticed about the product is the perfect texture. It has just enough stick to stay put and feel it cushioning your lips while still remaining soft and never sticky. This has helped to relieve any and all lip chapping when used twice per day. On top of that, it has a beautiful shine that looks like a subtle gloss on the lips. This is a great prep to use prior to applying lip products as well if you dab of the excess before applying. My only complaint (if I have any) is it does not taste great, but for me, this serves as a good reminder NOT to eat my lip products! Overall, this is handsdown one of my favorite lip treatments and I highly recommend! Best lip treatment
