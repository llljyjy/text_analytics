I have atopic dermatitis and realized that the self-tanner I was using on my face was making it worse.  I was really glad to find this product, and I’m happy to report that there is nothing in it that irritates my skin.  In fact, it has many ingredients that are soothing and moisturizing.  It gives great color to my fair skin pretty much after just one application.  I only use it about twice per week because it’s so expensive, but that works for me.  Taking off one star due to the price. Great For Sensitive Skin
