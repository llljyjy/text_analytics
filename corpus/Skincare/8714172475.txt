I bought this on 7/31. Only had it for 3 weeks, started using day 1. This oil was BEAUTIFUL in the beginning, clear deep blue color. My face has completely cleared up now. Zero acne, did get a few bumps on my forehead before my period but that was it. However I’m giving this 2 stars - I had read about the mold precaution and didn’t want to believe it. I have kept this in the fridge since day 1 of use so try and prevent any mold from growing. Lo and behold, about 2.5 weeks in, the oil is no longer clear - it got cloudy. But still I pressed on - never even touched the dropper to my face. Unfortunately, this morning I was sad to find the yellow residue buildup at the bottom of the bottle. When I inverted the bottle it just did not look right. The residue would mix with the oil but remain suspended in the middle. It didn’t sink and it didn’t float to the top. It definitely looks like bacteria or mold or something is growing in this oil. I’m sad because now I’m going to have to return this and I loved this product so much.I would still recommend this but they gotta fix the mold thing… i love this oil BUTTTT
