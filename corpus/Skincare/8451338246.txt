My new favorite lip balm. It doesnâ€™t absorb right away and stays on my lips for hours. Has the perfect amount of scent. I love putting this on before bed and using it as an overnight treatment. The consistency is similar to the laneige lip sleeping mask or jouer lip enhancer balm. Definitely a new holy grail. looooovvvveeeee
