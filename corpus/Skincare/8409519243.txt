I don’t love this product. Firstly, the spray is very diffused so it ends up getting all over the place. I have to spray it while standing in the shower because I find it gets everywhere and will leave a sticky mess on your floor. A lot of wasted product which is unfortunate. Secondly, it does not fade well! I have used their tanning drops in the past and loved those- they faded nicely. This tan fades in patches and started to look patchy after 2 days. This oil mist is not as long lasting as the drops. Third, it doesn’t dry down very quickly. I had to stand in my washroom for about 10 minutes before I could put on a loose black t-shirt. Fourth, it realllly broke out my skin! On my body it wasn’t bad, but around my chest and face it caused some breakouts which really sucks. Fifth, it does smell. I don’t get the people claiming that it doesn’t smell like fake tan, because it absolutely does. It’s not super smelly, but it has the distinct fake tan smell that lingers on your skin until you shower. Not impressed
