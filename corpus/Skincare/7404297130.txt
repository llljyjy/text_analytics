i wear this every morning before the rest of my routine -- it does smell like pool water but it really calms my skin down and ive barely gotten any pimples or acne after using this. during my period, i usually get big pimples that are deep and cystic but after using this, my period pimples were super manageable and not very painful or deep. yasss
