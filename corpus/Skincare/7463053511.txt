Works pretty great. After spending too much time washing dishes, this worked well to moisturize my hands. They felt smooth and helped relieve the dryness on my knuckles and back of my hands. It is sticky after removing the mask but after a few minutes it settles and hands are left smooth. Scents and patterns are cute and fun, especially for a spa day! Would definitely recommend. Works great!
