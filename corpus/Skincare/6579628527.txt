I received this #freeproduct for review from Topbox Circle. I have always loved this product. This version has really knocked it out of the park for me. This version is definitely more creamier then the previous gel formula but i find it also was more hydrating. I LOVE that laneige also includes the tool for scoop out the mask. I don’t know why more high end brands don’t do this, you can contaminate the product so easily with your fingers. It is scented but did not irritate. I will be buying this again.
