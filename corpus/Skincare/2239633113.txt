Good - but not great. I wouldn’t say this is a true “jelly” consistency. It’s pretty runny once on your face. It felt like it did a decent job exfoliating the first time I used it, however the next day, I had skin pilling on my face. Like others, the scent is rather strong. I plan to keep using and update my review if the results improve over time. Otherwise I may use as a hand scrub as part of my manicure routine. :) Okay
