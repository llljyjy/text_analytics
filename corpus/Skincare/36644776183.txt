I don’t wear a lot of make up… like ever. I work from home so my work attire usually consists of pjs and a robe so I use this product strictly as a cleaner and face mask. Either application is amazing. When using as the mask application, your skin feels so soft and it is so soothing. When using as a cleanser, OMG, the freshness my face feels is second to none. I love most of IT Cosmetic’s products as I have tried several and this one does not disappoint. nan
