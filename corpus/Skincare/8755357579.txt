I love this product so far, I’ve been using for three weeks now and can see a difference in the deeper wrinkles I have around my mouth and on my forehead. Smell is light and goes on skin smooth and easily. Only problem I’ve found is it is a little drying and I recommend using a good moisturizer after applying the Shiseido. Works on deep wrinkles!
