The reviews on this are so dramatic. It doesn’t smell awful it literally smells like rose water. If you despise the smell of rose water then you won’t like the smell. That doesn’t mean it smells like death, so I would ignore some of those complaints as a personal preference. Texture wise it’s super rich and sinks in nicely without leaving an oily finish. For such a thick cream it seems to have more of a matte finish. I’ll probably use it more for winter months as it’s far too thick for sweaty days, in my opinion. The price is high but it’s got nice packaging and personally I think it’s worth it. Lovely texture. Smells of roses.
