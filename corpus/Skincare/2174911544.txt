I received this through influenster and was very excited to try it. At first I didn’t notice anything too special about it but switched back to my usual face lotion and definitely noticed some dry patches had returned to my face. The balm is scentless and very creamy and I love that it’s a clean product. I did try it as a hand cream a few times and it helped with my super dry hands. I'm a fan!
