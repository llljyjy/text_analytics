The smart clinical Repair wrinkle correcting creamâ€¦is just so so.  It feels nice and my skin os left soft, but that is the extent of it.  It is light and has no fragrance, which i like.  I cannot speak to the long term effects of wrinkle correcting, as it would take months to see results, if any.  I feel the price is too high. so so
