Let me start by saying I actually purchased this moisturizer, I did not receive it free for review. It wasn’t on my radar until I found it in store and tested it. It’s thick enough to be super hydrating to my dry/combo skin, but not sticky, soaks in well, and layers well with other products and makeup. One of my favorite night creams was La Mer, and while this is very different, I like it just as much. There is some floral fragrance, so if that bothers you, beware. I like that the jar is refillable. So far my skin seems soft and plump, and it’s only been a week or so. I’m really impressed with this and am glad I bought it. I’ve used it both morning and evening to great effect. nan
