This product was on my list of products I’d like to try since a Sephora employee recommended it , I was super excited when I received it from Influenster in my vox box in an exchange of a review. My skin is a little on the dry side so I really need to moisturize all the time . I love the texture and that it’s long lasting and very smooth , I love touching my face after applying the cream. Personally I don’t mind the smell at all.my skin feels so much younger .As a mom of young kids, my face looks tired but I did feel the difference using this product. nan
