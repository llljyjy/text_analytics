This was ok. But I question if there really is 1oz of product. Using only 1 pump and only 3x per week, it only lasted 4 months. It takes me longer than that (6+/- months) to use up 1oz of foundation and I use 2-3 pumps 5 days a week. The math just doesn’t add up. Also, this product was too drying on my skin, even with my usual moisturizer. (Combination leaning dry skin) Question bottle’s true amount of product
