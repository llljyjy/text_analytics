Caudelie is one of my absolute favorite skincare lines there are.  So I was only too eager to try this new face serum.  The Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum felt so nice on your skin, and absorb into the skin so fast. Leaves your skin feeling refreshed. My skin looks youthful and firm. I adore Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum. The only negative I could find is that Iâ€™m not overly fond of rose fragrances, however I love this product so much that I could easily get passed it. youthful and refreshed
