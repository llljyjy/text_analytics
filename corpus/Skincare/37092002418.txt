Not the products fault but this was recommended by one of Sephora’s “experts“ for me.  I told her I had VERY dry skin and my age.  She recommended this product - it’s just the wrong product for my skin - it’s actually somehow making my skin dryer and feeling parched.  I’ll just go back to Oil of Olay at least my skin’s not tight with their products. Wrong for dry skin
