I received this in exchange for review and I’m not going to lie when I saw it was Goop brand I was skeptical lol. I haven’t ever purchased Goop products and I don’t follow Goop or Gwyneth. I started using this at night before my moisturizer and my skin tone was noticeably more even after a few days. It tingles a tiny bit when you first put it on but it doesn’t last and I have sensitive skin and wasn’t bothered my it. My arm scars actually started to lighten after the first week or so and I do feel like this made my skin glow! I deducted one star because it did cause some minor breakouts for me. I think with extended use my skin would adjust and be fine. I am actually considering buying this when my bottle is empty. Noticeable Results in DAYS
