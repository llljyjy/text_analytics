this is a great mask and definitely helps with cleansing out pores and overall skin health after repeated usage. What I love about this clay mask is that itâ€™s very gentle and the texture is so light and smooth going on. I have some clay masks that feel sticky and drying during application and can be a pain to wipe off afterwards. I definitely would put his in my favorites for clay masks. nan
