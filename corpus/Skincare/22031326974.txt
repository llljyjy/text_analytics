I am an isle of paradise loyalist. This product is just ok - only gives a very slight glow (much less than the light tanning drops). I like it in the winter but is definitely not dark enough for a summer glow! Only other issue is that I have traveled twice with it and both times the bottle leaked (even though the cap was still on?) and turned all of my things brown!!!! Light glow, bottle leaks
