I was super excited to be selected to try this out. I’ve used it for the past week and i’ve been loving it. I have acne prone skin that can’t handle super thick creams sometimes but my needs the extra moisture in winter. This was super moisturizing even though it soaked right into my skin. Even got rid of some dry patches I have. For the price i’m not sure if I would repurchase but trying this out has been nice. 4 stars because the packaging  is not travel friendly, the cap does not close securely so if it was placed in your bag it will probably open up. Good for acne prone skin.
