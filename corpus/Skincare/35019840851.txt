This is the second lip sleeping mask I’ve tried. The first was from PCA Skin. This one got very enthusiastic reviews so I thought I’d try it. It’s no better. If anything, my lips look drier in the morning after using it. They don’t improve lip dryness better than Burt’s Bees lip balm. Maybe it works better on young lips? I don’t recommend it for older women. The emperor has no clothes
