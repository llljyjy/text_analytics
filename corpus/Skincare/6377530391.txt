I received this product as part of a free sample program.On my first impression, I loved the smell! It’s strong, but not over powering. It’s a great size for the price, lots of product. It’s minimal looking, but cute. It lathers up really well, no issue getting sudsy all over. However, after using this soap on my face I felt stinging immediately. Even hours after I could feel the stinging on my cheeks. It made me red and caused lots of red bumps on my face for the rest of the day. I believe this is due to the fragrance. Though I do have particularly sensitive skin, I would advise against using this on your face for anyone in general. Despite that, I find it’s still okay for use on my body. It leaves a nice feeling to the skin, it is hydrating. Not for sensitive skin.
