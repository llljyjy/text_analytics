When I received this product gifted by Dermalogica Sampling I was sceptical due to it being a sample size and how much would be in it, but there was plenty, i used a little less than the whole pack every other day for a few days. It completely changed my skin, and was exactly what I was looking for, I definitely want to repurchase in the regular size. It made my skin feel so soft and helped with my pores; the texture of it changed for the better, my skin feels so bright and hydrated after I finish my skincare routine with this added. Must have!
