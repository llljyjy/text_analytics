I have sensitive skin, so a lot of exfoliants end up irritating my face after a few uses. I found the Daily Milkfoliant to be much more gentle than others even with daily use. My skin is feeling and looking much more vibrant after a few weeks of continued use. Iâ€™ll be using this product regularly going forward. @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Milkfoliant great for sensitive skin
