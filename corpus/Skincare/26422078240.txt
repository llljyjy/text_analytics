I was really excited to try this mask, I love clay detox masks. I noticed my t zone was less oily after using this twice a week for two weeks. I primarily focused on my nose and forehead to rid oils and black heads. I think this works great for clearing blemishes and oils. However, I didn’t like the clay beads. The packaging says to rub mask on face until the beads are dissolved and the mask is a darker gray, doing this felt like exfoliating and that’s not what I was looking for in a clay mask. The second time I used it I mixed it before applying it to my face and I enjoyed it much more. Overall it is a good product, I would recommend it to someone looking for a gentle detox mask and would definitely buy for myself! Great Detox
