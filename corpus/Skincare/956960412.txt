Wow. I bought this out of desperation after developing some type of dermatitis that began around my mouth and moved towards my eyes. I was in agony as I was waking up with sore and crusty eyelids. This balm immediately brought me relief. It’s only been about five days… but I will like this had already cured me. what a relief!
