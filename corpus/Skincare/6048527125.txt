The first time I used this I thought I had food crumbs on my lips.. then I realized it was tiny bits of plastic or something??? I had to use tweezers to get the tiny pieces off my lips, THEN the product was nice. What are these weird little bits in the product? Feels soooo weird on the lips like crumbs lol Plastic or glass bits in product
