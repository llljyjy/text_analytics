I received this product for my honest review from Influenster. I actually really enjoyed this cleanser, I feel it gave me a deep clean. However I think it is more for normal-oily skin as it says on the bottle, for my more normal/dry skin it was a bit drying. As some other reviewers mentioned my skin also became bright red after using, especially after the first few times of use. It wasnâ€™t uncomfortable but was a little startling to see. Otherwise the consistency of the cleanser is nice and smooth and feels good on the skin! Red face but good clean
