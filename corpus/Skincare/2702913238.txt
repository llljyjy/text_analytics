This eye serum is gentle enough to go around my eyes; It never stings. While I feel that it has improved the texture of my skin around my eyes and it definitely appears more smooth, it doesnâ€™t seem to improve under eye lines and wrinkles. Half a pump is all I need, and It took 6 months to finish a bottle; I will perhaps try one more bottle to give it another try. nan
