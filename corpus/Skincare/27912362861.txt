This sunscreen mist is very easy to apply and re-apply throughout the day! It’s really moisturizing on my face while also protecting it. My only con is the smell is really STRONG and could affect those with really sensitive skin. But as someone who has oily and mild sensitive/acne prone skin, it doesn’t break me out or irritates my skin in anyway. Definitely a product worth trying if you’re not into sunscreen creams! nan
