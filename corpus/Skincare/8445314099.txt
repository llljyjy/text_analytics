I usually use a Korean skin care routine and double cleanse. The first time I used this on a full face of make up, I followed up with my normal oil cleanser and used a white tissue to see if there was any residue. Indeed there was not! Once I felt like I could trust this to remove my make up, I’ve been using it every day. I don’t always wear a full face, but I have found that it does remove make up well. It leaves my face feeling more smooth than my normal oil cleanser. I follow my normal skin care beauty after I use this (so foam cleanser, and then toner and moisturizers, etc). I have normal, maybe even dry skin, but I haven’t found the project to be too drying. I did add in a heavier moisturizer but I often do add that in in the winter and I just hadn’t done it yet. I don’t have acne prone skin but some products do cause me to break out - and I’m happy to report that this one does NOT. Really happy with this and will likely buy it after I finish this jar to add to my skin care routine. It comes in a beautiful purple jar. It’s firm but I scoop some out and melt it a little in my fingers before I apply it onto my face. Used in place of my normal oil cleanser
