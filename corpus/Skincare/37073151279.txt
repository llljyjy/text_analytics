If you hate the feeling of shaving creams (you bet I do) you will LOVE this product. For the longest time I’ve been using bar soap to shave as it’s less messy, but dries out my skin. This product leaves a gel like consistency like bar soap, but is designed to be used to shave and is moisturising too. To those who have an aversion to fragrance, this product does have a fresh, spa-like smell. However it is quite mild and goes away when you shave the product off. Best Shave Ever!
