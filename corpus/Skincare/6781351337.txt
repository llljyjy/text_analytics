I received this product as a free sample from Influenster for my honest review. I typically don’t wear eye serums, but honestly after trying this one out, I think I should do it more often. This product felt so refreshing and smooth around my eye. It was very creamy and just glided so nice. You would think it would be oily, but it’s really not its fast absorbing, plus it smells good. I definitely have to purchase the full size after trying it out. Refreshing
