I Definitely Loved How Soft The Mask Left My Face. It Felt Incredibly Cooling Without Any Burn Like  Some Other Exfoliating Masks Do,, I Would Give It All Stars The Only Things Is The Little Granules Im Not A Fan Of Those For They Can Cause MicroTears If Not Careful But Definitely Worth A Shot ! nan
