I have been testing out this sunscreen and have really been enjoying it. It is a super light weight formula and I find it does not smell like typical sunscreen and instead smells like skincare so I do not even notice it once it is blended in. This makes me love it so much. It is really easy to blend in if you do a little at a time because if you do a bunch it can take some work so I spread it between my hands and then apply. It does not leave a white cast on me however I think it may if you have darker complexion so keep that in mind! This product is super easy to use everyday without a hassle because it is so easy to apply and once it is on it is not noticeable. It has not broken me out or caused any extra texture when I am applying my makeup overtop. I do sometimes feel dry through the day when I use this though so it is not the most hydrating. It also has a pump!! Which is amazing and I love the packaging. nan
