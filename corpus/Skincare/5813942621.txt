I am on my 2nd bottle of this serum.  I am using it for dark spots left from acne.  Also uneven tone from sun exposure.  I only use one pump as part of my evening skin care routine.  For me it took a while to see results, but I have not had any reactions to it.  I have rosacea and it doesnâ€™t seem to be bothered by the serum.  I can see results.  I gave it 4/5 stars because it took awhile for me to start seeing results. Dark Spot Help
