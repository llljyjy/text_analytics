I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I chose the Laniege Water Sleeping Mask. I have been a fan of this brand because I really like their moisturizer so I decided to try this one. My skin has been really dry this winter and I needed to get it’s moisture back. The texture is light and not heavy on my skin. I usually use this after I wash my face at night and leave it on and wash it off the next morning. I have been using this for about 3 weeks and I can see the difference! My face is definitely softer and hydrated. I am also very sensitive to smells and to me the smell is not strong. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue on my face either. If you have sensitive skin, and need some hydration, I would definitely try this product. A Sleeping Mask for Hydration that works!
