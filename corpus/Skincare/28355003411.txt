I liked this mask quite a lot. A lot of jar masks I have used don’t spread very well or evenly but this did not have that problem. It goes on well, doesn’t dry out my skin, and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I don’t think this is doing anything for my skin long-term but I do like it for the self-care aspect of a refreshing mask. nan
