This serum was interesting and unique. I have never used a serum that puts 3 different serums into one. The consistency was a little thicker than what I am accustom to but I liked it. I do feel like it moisturizer nicely and helped even out my skin tone. I however do not like that you canâ€™t see how much is left in the bottle and the fact that it has a 3 chamber bottle makes me feel like there is more of a chance of it breaking or you not being able to get all your product out of the bottle. Overall I enjoyed using it and I felt like it did help even and smooth over time Triple ingredient serum
