I got this product for free to write my honest review. I think this is a good product, but not a great product for the price. After using for 3 weeks, I have noticed a reduction in dark spots. I did break out initially, but my face seems to adjust. Good texture that obsorbs, but I don’t feel this product has helped with hydration or fine lines at this point for my skin. Overall, it’s a good product, but not great. Good product
