This mask is not only super cute and smells so good, it is very moisturizing and hydrating. I used to just put my normal chapstick on at night several times before going to bed, but with this mask it keeps your lips hydrated for hours, and until the morning if you want to get the most use out of it, using it as a lip gloss is a great idea! Just put a bit more on than you would at night and your lips will be very glossy! Day and night care
