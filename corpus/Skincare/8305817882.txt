Omg!!! The packaging caught my attention the first! It’s so adorable and convenient to use. Super hydrating and moisturizing. I suffer from dry patches here and there on my skin and I see so much improvement only a week into using the product. I took one star off was coz of the scent, it’s a bit too strong for my liking, and for scent sensitive folks it might not be ideal. But all in all kudos to the vegan brand with amazing products! Great product! just the scent bothered me a bit!
