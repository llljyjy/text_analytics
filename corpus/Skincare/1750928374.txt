I got a sample of this a while back and Loved it! With the weather changing my face had dry patches every where! Using this is so cool you just squeeze out a quarter size amount and start putting all o er your face in round circles the dead skin starts balling up and then you rinse it and wipe off with a warm wash cloth! Skin never looked better! My son and husband love it too! Exfoliate your face the super cool way!
