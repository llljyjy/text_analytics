I have been having the worst issues with my skin since moving to Arizona this spray serum is great for just after cleansing to calm and soothe the skin also a great prep for all skincare that follows infused with —Vegan Collagen great for firming-Peptides for plumping and lift-Hyaluronic Acid HydratesThis serum spray nourishes and supports your skin’s PH making ingredients more bioavailable and effectiveI have noticed a huge improvement in soothing and calming of the skin from the ingredient effect of the Artemisia ExtractI use this twice a day and love the smaller molecules you receive from a spray application. I hope to see more skincare from Kosas*THIS IS NOT A SETTING SPRAY NOR A REFRESHING SPRAY in my opinion**This review was created through an educational promotional event hosted between the brand and beauty experts.** Holy grail skin prep
