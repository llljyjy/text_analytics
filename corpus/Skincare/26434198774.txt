THIS stuff is amazing! It came in a gorgeous bottle where there are 3 holes for the products inside to come out and be mixed together. The smell is sort of perfume scented but it a nice way that lingers on your skin. The scent itself kind of gives you a mental burst of happiness. When I applied the product, I used it all over my face and neck. While it didn’t help with my pores, it did help with my fine lines. The texture is really smoothe and a little goes a long way. It didn’t leave my face tacky feeling but it did leave it moisturized feeling. Moisture in a bottle
