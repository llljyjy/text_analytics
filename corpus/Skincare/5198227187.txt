I really wanted to like this product because I LOVE so many of Glow Recipe’s products, but unfortunately it broke me out. The texture is so soft and it definitely gave my skin a more plumped appearance so I’m sad that this didn’t work for me. I would definitely suggest trying a sample or purchasing a mini size before committing to the full size of you have sensitive skin! nan
