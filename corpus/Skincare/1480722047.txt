I received a sample of Dr. Zenobia Peptide+Ceramide Repairing moisturizer as a sample from PinchMe.  I really like this moisturizer itâ€™s soaked in my face really well and I felt like my face was moisturized and it also made my skin feel smoother. I would recommend this product for sure. Works good
