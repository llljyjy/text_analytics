I bought this cleanser last year and I LOVED it. It foamed up and made my face feel clean, removed all my makeup, and didnâ€™t leave my face dry or tight. The couple tubes I bought this year are not like the previous formula I loved. These new tubes did not lather or foam at all. No one bit. The consistency was much firmer too. It almost seems like they got the cleanser & the moisturizer mixed up. The new tubes are exactly like the texture of a moisturizer and how it would not foam or lather once water is added. Mine is like a lotion-like balm and my face feels greasy after rinsing it off. Anyone else get a defective one like this??? Not the same formula I bought before
