I am 48 and have worn contacts since the 4th grade and undereye wrinkles are a concern for me. I loved this eye cream! I feel like it instantly made my undereye area smoother and reduced the appearance of lines and wrinkles. It soaked in well and when I applied my makeup, it didn’t pill and made my makeup appear smoother. It’s a lovely whipped texture. This will definitely be on my must-have list. Loved it!
