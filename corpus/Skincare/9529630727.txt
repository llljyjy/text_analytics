The Shave Pillow has definitely leveled up my shaving routine! I originally used body wash to shave but occasionally that caused burns and cuts.. Since using it in the shower, with a small amount of pressure it leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. The gel allows the razor to glide smoothly around my bellybutton ring and intimate areas. I’ve also brought it along on trips and now it’s a must have if I ever need a quick touch up. xx complimentary from hanni Must-Have on Trips!
