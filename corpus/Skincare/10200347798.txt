I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I’ve been loving it! I love the packaging and you get soo much product!! This has some weight to it, which I personally love in a product. The texture is lightweight but so creamy and moisturizing. I’m not a huge fan of SPF in my moisturizer because of the smell, but it’s almost nonexistent so I don’t mind using it everyday. Overall, I am going to keep using and would purchase with my own money Worth It!
