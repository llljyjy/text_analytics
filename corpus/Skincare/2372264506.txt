Iâ€™ve been using these lip balms exclusively for years. I loved the creamy texture, shine and sheerness, and found them to be very moisturizing and long-lasting, which is a really hard combination to find. I recently restocked four of my staple colors not realizing that they had been reformulated. As a few others have commented, the new formula leaves a matte finish (previous formula was more shiny), feels dry on my lips  (previous formula felt creamy), is not moisturizing and starts wearing off in less than an hour (previous formula lasted for several hours). So basically, all the things I loved about these balms is gone. :-( I will not be repurchasing and will begin my search for a replacement that I hope I love as much as I did this one. New formula - repeat buyers beware
