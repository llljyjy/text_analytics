Not worth the hype. I’ve really wanted to like this since I bought it a few months ago but I never find myself reaching for it. The few weeks that I did use it in my routine it left my skin feeling extra oily, tacky, and less hydrated than when I chose to skip this step. The smell is nice and the bottle is pretty but that’s not why I buy skincare. It feels like it just sits on top of my skin instead of absorbing into it. There are so many brands that make better hyaluronic acid serums and I will not be buying this product again. Unfortunately, not worth the hype :(
