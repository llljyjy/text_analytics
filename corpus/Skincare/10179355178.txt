I got the mini version and only use it when eating out. I’ve found myself not getting nauseous or bloated afterwards. I’m actually going to commit to the large/regular size. As someone who’s gluten and lactose intolerant, I still eat a lot of cross contamination. I find this helps a lot when I’m eating food that I haven’t prepared myself. Wouldn’t say I would try to eat a slice of pizza and think this would work, but for the little stuff my body can’t handle I would say this works amazing. 10/10 would recommend
