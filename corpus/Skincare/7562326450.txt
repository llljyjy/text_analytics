This is by far the BEST oil I’ve ever tried! I stand by the claim that’s skin barrier strengthening and soothing! I have acne-prone, oily-combo skin so I was a little hesitant to try, but it truly helped to reduce my active breakouts and blemish/red areas. The texture is very lightweight and does not leave a greasy feeling on the skin! Great for even acne-prone, oily-combo skin!
