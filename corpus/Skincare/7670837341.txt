This has completely transformed my skin! I’ve been using tretinoin for over a year now and my skin did a 180 with that alone. But since I’ve introduced this, my skin has never looked so smooth!!! I can’t remember my skin ever looking this good. I alternate with my tretinoin. Sometimes I skip days depending on how my skin reacts with peeling. At night after putting the peel on, I use purito unscented centella serum and then cosrx oil free moisturizer. I will def purchase this again and again! Worth every penny. EFFECTIVE!
