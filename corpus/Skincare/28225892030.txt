Ok, to be honest, I wasn’t really expecting to like this product. It didn’t seem very high-end to me nor did I think that any of the ingredients or things on the bottle itself really excited me. Also the first time I used it, I must have had some kind of other moisturizer or makeup on my face because it was definitely pilling, which is a huge no for me. However, I’m so glad that I decided to keep trying it because the next couple of times and every time after that I had no problems and I actually began liking it more and more. I think the pilling was due to me not exfoliating.As I begin to use this product more and more I really liked the way that it hydrating my skin and made it softer. I’m so glad I gave it a second chance because it really grew on me. The sun is very light and not overpowering and the product itself is not too thin and not too thick. I think that I definitely would invest in this product! Nice!
