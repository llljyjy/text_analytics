I have dry skin, and love using the night as a way to help my skin really recuperate. This night cream was really perfect for hydrating my skin and providing moisture at night. I’ve been using it for multiple weeks 3-4 days a week and haven’t noticed any skin breakouts — my skin always look smooth and glossy the days after I wear this. I often apply various serums/treatments under my moisturizer at night, including retinol and exfoliation treatments, and I haven’t had any negative reactions. The texture is somehow both thick and gel-like, and the cream is easy to spread but then still creates that lovely, hydrating layer on the skin at night. The thing I really appreciate about this product is that it doesn’t feel greasy. The only thing I don’t love about this product is that it is a little fragranced, however I find the scent to be less strong than some other luxury products which I appreciate. Great night cream for dry skin
