I am a first-time user of the Kiehl’s multi-corrective anti-aging eye cream. I decided to throw my reservations to the side and see if this product could help with my under eye issues. Let’s face it - we all see flaws when looking in the mirror. I am no exception to the rule!! After trying the product, I found myself pleased that I did not experience any breakouts, the product smelled great, and I think my fine lines were a little less defined. Definitely a great ’pick me up’ product to add to your makeup arsenal. nan
