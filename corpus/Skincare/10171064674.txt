I love this product. I have mature, sensitive skin and I struggle to find any face cream that does not react to my skin. Usually the first container of product will be fine. After repurchasing a product, I start to notice redness and skin irritation. This is one of the few face creams that I have now finished a second jar of the product and there is no skin irritation. My skin is soft throughout the day. The product is light and smooth, not greasy at all and smells lovely. The tea scent is light and I love that it is not a floral scent.   The texture of my skin has improved. I love how smooth it is and I believe there is a more even skin tone. The claim of firming I cannot confirm. I don’t notice that at all in my skin. However I would highly recommend this product. It is expensive but I find a little goes a long way and as someone who struggles to find products that work on easily reactive skin, it’s worth the price to me. nan
