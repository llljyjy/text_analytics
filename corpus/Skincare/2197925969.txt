I donâ€™t write reviews very often.  This product has definitely earned it.  This got rid of my milia.  I used it nightly and I could not believe how well it worked to get rid of the little white bumps and texture in my skin.  It does have a tingling sensation when applying it, so sensitive skin beware.  My skin is usually quite sensitive but it tolerated this product well.  I love this product! Got rid of my skin texture!!
