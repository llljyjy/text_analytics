I got this product for free to try. I like the pump bottle and the packaging is super cute. The smell is odd, I can never decide if I like it or hate it but it smells like those rocket candies you get at Halloween. The lotion itself worried me at first because I worried if would be too heavy but I really love it! Definitely moisturizing and firming. Would definitely consider buying again! nan
