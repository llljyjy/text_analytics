I LOVED the Water Bank original moisturizer. It was truly skin saving and my skin had never looked better. I had heard about the reformulation and was hesitant to try it because the reviews weren’t great. Well, the reviews aren’t great because they’re accurate. My skin is dry, patchy, and so so acne ridden. I lost it  today when I looked in the mirror and saw just, total redness. Will never buy again. Terrible reformulation. Look elsewhere.
