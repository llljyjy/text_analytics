I LOOOOOOVE this sunscreen like everyone else the packaging is problematic but only bc it peels. I love the shape. It is easy to put in my purse. I have recently had multiple surgeries that require me to use sunscreen every hour plus my face is seriously burned and damaged. This sunscreen has kept me from any type of burn in the hot FL sun. It has protected me completely and the ingredients have helped no question. The packaging is annoying but the product is so so good I have rebought many times already. nan
