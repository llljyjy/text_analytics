I don’t think it’s necessary to have or that it improves my skincare routine at all. I think cheaper brushes exfoliate just as well. & it doesn’t come with instructions. But it is a really nice brush. If you are a skincare addict like me you would like this as a gift or splurge on one for yourself. I don’t personally like the vibrating but I love it as a brush and I wish there were a cheaper version of this that was just a brush. I love the shape for getting hard to reach places like under the eyes and nose. & the bristles are very soft. Yes and no
