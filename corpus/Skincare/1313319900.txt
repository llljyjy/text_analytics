Giving this product four stars AS A HAND CREAM. I ordered it online and didn’t realize it had such a a strong fragrance. I tried it once on my face and had to immediately wash it off because the smell was too strong for me. I knew if it left it on I would have triggered a migraine. I really wish it was un-scented because I love the texture and the way it dries down so quick. The cream is thick but not greasy. I didn’t want to toss it, so now it’s a hand cream. Hopefully my hands soak up all the benefits. If you’re scent sensitive like me, it might be a pass on your face. nan
