I was gifted this serum complimentary via influenster in exchange for my honest review.I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and still have no idea what it is supposed to do. I haven’t noticed a difference, but it feels good and smells nice. The name and packaging do not provide enough information about what it does or what skin concerns it addresses. If I were in the market for a new serum, I would not pick this up because I’d be confused whether this was for me based on the name and description alone. nan
