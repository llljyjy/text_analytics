I really need a new makeup remover . This is super easy to use I love the pump feature so I can dip my cotton pad on top and I’m good to go . It took my full face of makeup off and it didn’t leave me feeling dry at all . My only complaint is I’m not a fan of the smell but luckily it’s not super strong . Easy and fun
