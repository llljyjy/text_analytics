It works as a moisturizer however, is it really 50ml?? I could not believe how quickly it ran out so i took the container apart.. real shock!! All empty at the bottom only small on the top container...if this is really 50ml, why do you waste so much plastic??  It is so annoying when they are trying to deceive by packaging in a huge container. Shame on you when we are all trying to limit the foot print!!  I only gave you one star as i did not have a choice to give a minus 5 stars. Is it really 50ml??
