I received this complimentary sample from Influenster and Inkey list in exchange for my honest review. love this product. It’s slowly becoming  a staple because of my combination/breakout prone skin. Once I learned to layer the product properly  alongside my existing skincare regimen my  skin changed for the better. If you have dry skin you might want to layer it with a good moisturizing product. I’ll definitely purchase it once it runs out. My pores look smaller. This summer, I started to struggle with intense breakouts, then around the end of summer, I included this in my nightly routine. At first, my skin got a little worse for a couple days but seriously, adding niacinamide to my skincare routine is one of the best things I’ve done to improve the overall texture appearance of my skin. Highly recommend!
