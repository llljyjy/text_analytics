This serum is a great consistency. It isn’t too thin or too thick. You get a nice even coverage with just a tiny amount. I noticed a difference in my skins texture, evenness and my fine lines and wrinkles in one overnight use. It isn’t a sticky formula. It dries clear. Super easy to use dispenser and I love the packaging and colors Kiehl’s chose. Within a couple weeks my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. My skin is smoother and has less unevenness.    I highly recommend if you like faster results. Quick work!
