I switched from the drunk elephant vitamin c serum to this and I like it better. It has a nice consistency and spreads over the face really nice and evenly. I’ve read the review of it leaving a weird finish on your face but I feel like you shouldn’t just be using this as your skincare routine…. With a spf moisturizer or both a moisturizer and a sun screen on top of nova it leaves your skin the perfect finish wether you want to go with or without makeup. Strong earthy smell but nothing that really bothers me and it goes away right after application. great vitamin c serum
