With upcoming travel I was looking for a travel-friendly shave option and in the process discovered the HanniShave Pillow Moisturizing Body Gel. Firstly, love the convenience of it being in a deodorant style container! It has a slick, gel solid texture that truly allows the razor to glide smoothly reducing the risk of razor bumps and cuts. It provides such a close, clean shave and leaves my skin feeling soothed and hydrated. Great formula and super convenient!  *Gifted by Hanni Clean Shave!
