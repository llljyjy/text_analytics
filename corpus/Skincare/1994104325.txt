So I bought this roller a couple years ago- within the first week it launched on Sephora Canada. I use it on and off as I have been sticking with other tools. So I haven’t used this roller in months. Today I though it would be nice to try it- as I took it out of the box. The handle fell apart from the rollers on both ends. I wasn’t rough, it wasn’t stuck in the box. I’ve never submerged this tool in water. I’ve always stored it in the box, in a nice dry area. But yet it fell apart unexpectedly. It’s a beautiful roller and it did last a couple years, but I think I’ll be going for a different kind of roller next time. The other tools from Mount lai, that don’t contain moving parts are great! But now I don’t trust the rollers. Unexpectedly fell apart
