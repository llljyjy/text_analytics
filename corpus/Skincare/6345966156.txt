I don’t normally write reviews but just don’t buy this lip scrub. Even on sale it. It leaves a yellow top, doesn’t melt or blend it, the scrubs hurt and it smells like a knock off lipsmacker. I thought maybe I’ll putIt on before bed but didn’t help my lips at all! They forgot it on my order so they sent it later. I think the packer was doing me a favour. leaves yellow, doesn't melt into lips
