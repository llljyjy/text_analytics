for starters, this is a really silky, not greasy nor sticky balm to oil without being abrasive at all, completely free of fragrance so good for all sensitive skin people (such as me)I find that this absolutely melted all my makeup, I used it on a VERY long lasting liquid lipstick and eyeliner... I was shocked when I saw both completely removed within 45 seconds of circular motions!!! usually I have to cleanse a couple times because the makeup will mix with my oils and make it a lot harder to come off, but I had no problem with that!!!my skin felt soft, clean without feeling stripped of everything and ready for bed.overall this is a amazing product and I highly suggest trying this out. I will definitely purchase when I run out. NEW HG!!!
