I enjoyed the Confidence in a Cream moisturizer by IT Cosmetics. My skin is on the oily/normal side, but this moisturizer worked great without making me too shiny. It absorbed pretty quickly and was only slightly tacky afterward, although I don’t have much patience to wait between layers. It was glory and quickly ready for makeup application and made my skin look smooth and firm. It also is noncomdogenic, and I didn’t have any issues with breakouts when I switched from my normal Cerave to this to try. I would probably not buy it again due to the price and because it does not include SPF. However, I do enjoy it and I’m glad I got to try it! I haven’t seen any obvious reduction in my fine lines, but I’ve only tried for about 10 days. nan
