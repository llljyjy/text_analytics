I really love these masks! They are very hydrating and make my skin feel very plump after I use them. I left mine on for about 30 minutes. I felt like they had a cooling sensation, and I really enjoyed that. I would recommend these to others and the price point is pretty good for a product from Sephora! Great! Love these & recommend!
