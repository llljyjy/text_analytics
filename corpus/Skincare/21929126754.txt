I love isle of Paradise productsâ€¦ I would say I am a bit disappointed in this one. First my tan took forever to develop and I even slept with it on over night. I woke up to a horrible fake tan smell and felt oily all over. The color was not dark for me. Personal I would compare it too lurching the light color. This is my color after 18hrs. I am showering off tonight. Not Dark - bad after smell
