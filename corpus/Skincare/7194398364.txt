The Hanni is very pleasing to the eye, and it has a nice feel to it, but the shaving experience for me was poor. I had to go over certain areas multiple times to get that “freshly shaved, smooth look” which caused much irritation a few days later…especially with my underarms. Aesthetically pleasing, horrible with hair removal
