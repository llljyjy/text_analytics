This is absolute best self tanner I have ever used. All of them for the most part turn orange and streak and you can totally tell you used self tanner. This self tanning water spreads evenly, does not look orange and does not have a terrible smell. I am not sure what people are talking about in terms of uneven color and streaking, as I have never experienced that using this product. I lotion my knees feet and hands prior to use. The sprayer can be difficult but you can just spray directly onto mit and rub into skin which works perfectly! It gives you a nice natural looking golden tan and you cant even tell you put on self tanner. Another tip: Use the self tanning drops as well, drop a couple drops into your favorite lotion and use to blend self tanner into the more difficult areas like ankles, feet etc. It works like a charm!
