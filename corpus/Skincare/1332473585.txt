When I first applied it, I loved it, then hated it, then loved it again. - applied easily and I felt I got good coverage. - smell is not strong as expected. - eye area felt slightly irritated, I tried hard not to rub my eyes. - woke up at 4am and the SMELL! It was the typical fake tan smell. I couldn’t stand it, so I washed my face, applied moisturizer. And then I woke up to a very subtle natural glow on my pale skin! I’ll be using it again, but unsure about if I can keep it on all night unfortunately. Wake up with a Glow
