Absolute luxury product! Ok first off when they say hydrating they mean it! Be careful with how much you apply because you do not need much at all. I literally use 1 drop as a moisturizer. Also it can be used in so many different ways! You can use it to boost a moisturizer or you can use it as a hydrating mask overnight. You can even add it to your base makeup. I noticed after my first use that my skin was glowing and looked more even. After a full week of using it morning and night as a moisturizer I noticed my pores looked smaller and my skin was shinning without adding anything else. This is a game changer. But I cannot stress enough how little you need. If you use too much it will leave your skin looking and feeling greasy. Otherwise itâ€™s super lightweight and you skin should soak it up. I highly recommend this if you have dry, dull skin. Absolute luxury product
