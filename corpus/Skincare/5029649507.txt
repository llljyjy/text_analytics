I received this product for free through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have very dry sensitive skin so this product is not exactly made for someone with my skin type. However, it did not make my skin any dryer and I could tell that if I used this during summer time, it would probably be perfect. I did not notice any pore minimizing effect, but I also didnâ€™t apply makeup after using, so maybe it helps with a more even coverage like a primer would. It has a light, natural fragrance and did not irritate my skin. It did seem to take a little while to absorb, so you have to wait some time to apply makeup after using. nan
