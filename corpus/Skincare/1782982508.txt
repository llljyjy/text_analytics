Oh my God! I’m sad it took me this long to discover this product! Best face self tanner by far! It’s a very fine mist and somehow it goes on evenly every single time! it gives you a glow almost if you were just out in the sun! It almost looks a little bit like a reddish tan, so natural!I am buying the body spray version  right now to try! :)I know it’s expensive, but it’s definitely worth it! I’ve used the crap out of it this week, spraying myself every other day. And the amount hasn’t really diminished. Holy grail product !
