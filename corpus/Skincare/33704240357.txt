I bought this in november of 2021, i’ve used it everyday since, i’ve re purchased it 4 times now. in the beginning i definitely saw changes fast, within a month with old acne scars and pigmentation. but not enough to make them fully go away, they’re less noticeable but still there if you look hard enough. i find it works best with fresh acne scars and pigmentation, it felt nearly nothing after a week of it appearing on my face which is great, but not what i was hoping for this product. nan
