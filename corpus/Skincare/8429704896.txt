This product was nice and it looks nice. The packaging is amazing and has a nice weight to it. However for me this sank in very fast and didn’t really do much for my skin. I do have oily skin, but I’ve used other sleeping masks that have left my skin feeling better than this one. The texture is nice and it has little beads in it so if you don’t like that kind of texture stay away from this product. I might recommend this product if you have normal skin. If you have dry skin this might not do much to give you hydration. Nice
