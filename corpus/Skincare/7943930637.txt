I received this as a complimentary product from Influenster to review and I really like it! At first I was nervous as I have sensitive skin and rosacea, and some exfoliators can be very rough. This one is gentle enough to where I had little to no redness after use. I also love how soft and smooth my skin felt after using it. I would say I have been using it for about a week now and have noticed a reduction in my black heads and pores as well! While it might be on the pricier end, I do think this product is worth it and I highly recommend it! nan
