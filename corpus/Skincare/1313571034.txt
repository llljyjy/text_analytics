I have mild rosacea and, after wearing this once, I crossed over into the not mild anymore category. This caused my rosacea to flare up to an extent that has never happened before. And it took 4 days to calm down and clear up. Itâ€™s a shame because I love a multitasking product, and this was moisturizing along with the sunscreen without being heavy. nan
