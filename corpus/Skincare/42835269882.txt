I have used this exceptional product for over a month.  Unfortunately or fortunately, my results of gunky water were negative. The water was hazy, perhaps due to my older age.  However,  i still have large pores on my nose and after a few uses, my nose looks clean and normal.  The rest of my face has a clarity and smoother look. I am so happy with the results, and I receive compliments on my skin now. Clean & clear
