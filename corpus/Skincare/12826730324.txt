I’m really disappointed. I don’t have huge eye bags or dark circles, but my under eyes do need to be brighten and better yet even with this small simple fix there were no results. If you have darker circles or bags I do not recommend. Even if you want to simply brighten and smooth out the lines under your eyes, I still don’t recommend it. The price is expensive and the product didn’t do much. Disappointed :/
