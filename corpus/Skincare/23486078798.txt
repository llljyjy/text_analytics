I received a sample of this to try and wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. I was impressed by how moisturizing it was for my skin. My skin felt softer than it does with my normal moisturizer. The repair balm is thick so a little went a long way. I used it at night and had better results that way. Overall I was happy to try it out and with continued use hope to see good results.
