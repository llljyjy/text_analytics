This Dior Foaming Anti-pollution foaming face cleanser with purifying french water lily is such a pleasant cleanser to use. It has a mild fresh scent, so make sure you’re okay with having fragrance in your skincare product. I usually lean towards skincare products without fragrance, but I do like this one, and so far it hasn’t given me any breakouts. If anything, my skin actually feels more even/less oily but not too dry. It also lathers great, and a little goes a long way. Would recommend this product! nan
