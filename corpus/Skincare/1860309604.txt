I’m not a fan of the packaging and that’s the reason for my rating. For starters, I almost broke it on the first try because I’m used to tubes this shape having a screw top. This one pulls off. Next, it’s a struggle to get the product squeezed out when holding in the upright position. And when you do get product dispensed, you have to maintain that squeeze or else it goes back in. So in order to apply, you have to squeeze, maintain pressure, dab on both eyes, then relax your hand and actually smooth it in with the metal applicator. Which, I will admit, feels lovely. But then the cap will only go on if it’s facing the right way. The whole process of using this just adds a bit of extra stress to my morning and that’s not what I need in my life right now. I’m not commenting on the product inside because I haven’t used it enough times to see a difference. I received this product for free from Influencer in exchange for my honest review. Packaging isn't user friendly
