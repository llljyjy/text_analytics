It’s okay. I don’t feel like it actually penetrates or hydrates your lips. It feels smooth when you apply. The sent reminds me of a pool floaty, like a mix of plastic and vanilla in a good way. The main reason it’s a 3 stars is for the SPF. It’s my go to when I’m in the sun. Not sure if it actually protects, but it’s nice to know 30 SPF is in it. Overall, just eh. I don’t think I’ll buy again, but I didn’t hate it. Eh
