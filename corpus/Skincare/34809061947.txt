Sephora gifted me this product, but all thoughts an opinions are my own. I love this De-Puffing facial roller and I love that it has two different sizes so you can easily access large areas of your face, like your forehead, or smaller areas, like around your eyes. I love to keep mine in the refrigerator so it feels even cooler against my skin when applying it. It also come with a nice bag to store it in too! The Best De-Puffing Facial Roller
