This moisturizer is fine. Nothing special. For the price though, it’s not there. I feel like the price is mainly for packaging. You don’t get much quantity and the quality is lesser than that of some moisturizers I’ve gotten for half the price at a drug store. Definitely will not be buying again. NOT WORTH THE PRICE
