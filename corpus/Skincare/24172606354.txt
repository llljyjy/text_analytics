I received this product for free in exchange for a review, I’ll say I love it and definitely will buy again! I was a little turned off at first because I thought my face felt greasy after but I never had an issue after the first time. I enjoy the smell (it’s light) and the thickness of the cream I’ll definitely buy again!
