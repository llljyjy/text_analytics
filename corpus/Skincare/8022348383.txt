Ive tried so many moisturizers with SPF. Tried super light Moisturizers THEN a sunscreen after. and somehow ALWAYS felt so greasy.  This one is very light. No scent. doesnt break me out. No white cast either (i am medium tan. South East Asian).  Of course i wish i was cheaper, but i do not mind paying $70 for a product that protects my skin from UV rays and does not make me feel like a greasy mess. BEST moisturizer with SPF ever
