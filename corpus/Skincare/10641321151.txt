iâ€™ve noticed brightening from this product almost instantly as well as some scarring lightening. i got a sample of this product and immediately bought the full size. it does have an orange scent but it goes away quickly. i have not noticed any pilling with this product which tends to be a concern with vitamin c serums. aside from the brightening i have also noticed my pores look cleaner and less enlarged. definitely my go to vitamin c from now on. love it nan
