I received this product for free from Influencer and belif in exchange for my honest review.I have super dry skin and even though I wish this was more moisturizing, it still has a good amount of hydration.I LOVE the dewy finish. I feel so glowy. Once again, a dry girlâ€™s dream. However, there is no greasy feel as the dry down is satin to the touch. I can see this working for a lot of people unless you have something against dewy finishes. Light weight & no white cast! So good
