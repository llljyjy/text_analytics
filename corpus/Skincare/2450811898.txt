This for me was just “okay”. The constancy is strange…very chunky and watery. It also does not absorb well into my skin. I have to work this on for a few minutes before my skin doesn’t look white. Maybe it’s just my skin. Maybe this is different for other people...but I won’t be purchasing again. This is a meh
