This is a great hydrating serum especially for my dry winter skin! The hydration lasted over the full day and my skin never felt tight towards the end of the night. It spreads well and doesn’t cause any pilling. The only issue I have is that the bottle is super tiny which makes me believe this product won’t last that long, maybe a month max.
