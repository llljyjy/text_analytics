This product has changed the game for me. I love that it’s a creamy cleanser and doesn’t strip my face of the natural oils. The texture is super unique and I love the little beads in it. It’s super hydrating and feels like it gives my skin a youthful look. It feels incredible and I have been using it morning and night. It gives a cooling sensation but also is super effective in cleaning my face. It seriously is awesome and I will 100% be repurchasing it. Game Changer!
