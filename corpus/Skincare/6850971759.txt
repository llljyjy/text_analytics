Serum was a weird hot dog smell to it, which I got past after the initial shock lol. Effects are decent. I saw better results with the Klair’s vitamin C, which unfortunately oxidates quickly so I wanted to try a more stable formula. Bought this one and liked it enough to not return it, but the bottle is ALWAYS leaking. You can’t travel with this at all. Yesterday I left the house for a couple of hours and forgot I left this bottle on the bed, and at least 1/4 of it spilled out. So yeah, for $50 I would expect better packaging. Won’t be re-purchasing, but 4 stars for the product, 1 star for the bottle Decent product, terrible packaging
