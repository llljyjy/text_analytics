I was gifted by Farmacy the Wake Up Honey Eye Cream.  First of all I love it! The vitamin c and the honey works very well. Using it for 2 weeks straight you can tell that it reduces those fine lines and it has brighten my dark circle.  I also love is you don’t need much of it just a little and it works great. I do recommend using it more on the night it observed better. The thing I don’t like is so small bottle. But it’s okay it’s worth it. Good
