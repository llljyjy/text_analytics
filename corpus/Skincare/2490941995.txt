Hands down—best moisturizer I’ve ever used thus far. I’ve got stubborn combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks, but this product does an impressive job balancing that. I use a tinyyyyyyy amount per use and I watch my dry patches instantly disappear and my oil mattify so a little goes a long way. It also looks great under makeup! The bottle malfunctions sometimes so you’ll have to keep pumping until the product comes out, but hopefully this can be improved someday. I’ve seen significant improvement in my skin since I switched to this moisturizer and can rely on this product for all-day moisture. Thank you! Worth it!
