No, no and no for oily skin. I have extremely oily skin all my life and bought this based off all the 5 star reviews. This makes my face even more oilyâ€¦my face is so greasy that strands of my hair stick to my face after just a few hours. Gross. My goal was to control my oil better, not increase it. Hard no for me! nan
