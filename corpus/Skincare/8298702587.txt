The concept of this is great however the color comes out quite a bit orange and not tan at all. I have tried adjusting the amount of drops, how it is applied, and even tried the other lighter drops but it all comes out orange. I even had my daughter and mother try incase it was my skin tone or something I was doing wrong but nope it was orange on them as well. My daughter is very fair skinned and she was more orange than even my mother and I were. Sadly my high hopes and excitement for this product were short lived. Great concept but too orange
