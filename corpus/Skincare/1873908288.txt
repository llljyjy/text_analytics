Bought this as a cheaper substitute for Farmacy Green Clean but wouldn’t repurchase. The cleansing power of it works well but the consistency is much different than green clean. Feels more like a thick gel than balm and takes a while warm up in your fingers before working into the skin, which makes it feel like I’m pulling my skin by using this. Not worth returning. As long as I have the budget for Farmacy I’ll stick with that. Works well for the price
