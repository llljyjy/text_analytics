I will hum what others have written about this moisturizer. Hydrates lavishly without leaving you greasy. Personally, I have sensitive and combo skin. I’m always searching for a hydrating moisturizer that won’t break me out and this the real deal. It has a silky and luxurious feel when you put it on. I hope they continue to sell it at this price point for the long haul. Glad I gave this product a try. A holy grail in my book. Hydrates lavishly without the greasy feel
