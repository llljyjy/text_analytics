Lip balms were my favorite thing to collect as a kid, so I’ve gone through a lot of them. However, my favorite so far has been this! It gives the lips a beautiful, juicy shine and is actually moisturizing. The moisture lasts a while too, I only have to reapply every 2 hours if I don’t eat or anything. I use this in the AM, and the lip sleeping mask in the PM:) FAVORITE LIP BALM (and I own a lot of lip balms)
