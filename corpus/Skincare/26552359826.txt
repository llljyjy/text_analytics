I have oily, prone to acne and redness, and overall not very attractive skin. I use this every night with a serum and I wake up with pretty, moist, lovely skin! I hardly wear foundation anymore because I’m much more happy with where I’m at with my skin. I love the texture the most. It’s thick enough coming out of the container while becoming super absorbent on the skin. Extremely comfortable and soothing for bedtime. Give it a try :)
