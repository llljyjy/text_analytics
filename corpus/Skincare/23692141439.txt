I received this product complementary from Influenster. I really do like this cream.  It is very silky to the touch and applies really smoothly to the skin.  My skin felt soft on application.  As it is mattifying it left my skin feeling non greasy during the day.  I also love the fact that it I fragrance free. If I had to knock the product, it would be for the packaging.  The shape of the package does not allow you to sit the “tube“ right side up, instead to get it to stand you need to sit it on the head. Nice Product
