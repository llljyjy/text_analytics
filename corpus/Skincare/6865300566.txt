I love this eye cream. I’ve had dry patches around my eyes for so long and applying this cream makes the skin around my eyes feel so soothed. It’s so hydrating and a must-have eye cream before bed. It’s not an eye cream that helps with dark circles though! Would recommend a caffeine eye cream for that instead. But this one is definitely soothing and hydrating! Hydrating eye cream!
