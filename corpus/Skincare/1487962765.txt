I too am a devout YTTP fan and this cream surprised me. When this is officially released, this will be my new go-to moisturizer. My routine consists of all YTTP products. I cleanse then use the oasis serum followed by the caffeine serum then the air whip moisturizer. When I tried this cream I wanted to use it without serums to see the actual results of only the cream, and I was impressed! I did not need the oasis serum to firm or lock in moisture. This cream is amazing for my skin. nan
