I found this eye serum a bit better than the regular serum- absorbed better, and more of a noticeable difference (brighter eyes looking more hydrated!). That said, on super humid days, my makeup on lower eyelids tended to melt. I would still recommend trying it, but just being prepared for how it functions in certain climates. Could go either way
