So beware, this product is NOT for SENSITIVE SKIN. I bought this for the intention of my clogged pores. It does do its job but do not over do it. I accidentally put all across my cheeks and it instantly turned red and my face got warm. Lesson learned. Use in moderation. Only focus it on the nose and chin area is where I use it. And only 1-2 times a week. Do overdo it or you will burn your skin. May not repurchase. be mindful
