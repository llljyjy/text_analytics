This moisturizer has been incredible for my skin! During my 2 week trial I definitely saw a difference in terms of suppleness as well as brightness on my skin. It feels great on, has never caused any sort of redness or reactions even on my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin and I love using it day and night. The difference has been visible in even a short period of time during my 2 week trial which had been very impressive. I appreciate that it doesn’t have any added fragrance (like all Paula’s Choice products) and the texture is lightweight and quick to absorb. It has played well w all other products in my skincare routine and I absolutely love this product. Incredible, must-have moisturizer!
