I have dry sensitive skin and bought this product a few years ago. I’ve been using it since - it is by far my favourite product in my skincare routine! I use a few drops after applying my serum & cream at night. My skin appears a bit oily/shiny after application but it fully absorbs throughout the night. I wake up with the smoothest hydrated skin. Last year I had finished a bottle and was waiting to receive my new bottle, I couldn’t use it for about two weeks and I could see that my skin just didn’t look as smooth. Totally worth it, for the price and the bottle lasts forever! Holy Grail of Hydration!!
