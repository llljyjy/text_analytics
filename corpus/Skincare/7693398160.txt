First, I was surprised how lightweight this sunscreen is! Thanks to the hyaluronic acid, this sunscreen is super hydrating while providing protection from the sun. I appreciate that it was dermatologist-tested and is non-comedogenic. I also love that this does not have the typical sunscreen fragrance, it is very subtle. The only downside is that the water-resistance does not last as long as I would like (40 minutes). Lightweight & Hydrating
