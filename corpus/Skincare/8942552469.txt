I’m amazed !!! I’ve been struggling with hormonal acne on my shoulders, chest, neck, and forehead, since coming off birth control 8 months ago. This is the only stuff that’s worked and I’ve tried dozens of treatments! I will say it does burn at first and dries out my skin. But I moisturize and that helps after. I only use once a day, at night. It bleached clothes and sheets so wear a white tee and use white pillow case. It’s all worth it when it clears up bad breakouts within less than a week THIS STUFF WORKS!!!
