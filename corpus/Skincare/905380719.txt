For years my dry sensitive skin loved this stuff this was my holy grail moisturizer Until there was a formula change about 4 yearâ€™s ago So disappointed with new formulation it is in no way moisturizing enough for for my very dry skin instead it made me drier and irritated my eczema also made me breakout Not worth the price when I found similar products  with better ingredients that are closer to the original formula I loved and work great for cheaperJust search goat milk moisturizer on Amazon lots of options most have same basic formula For around 20 $ Better products for less money
