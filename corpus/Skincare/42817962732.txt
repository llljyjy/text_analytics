I have been sent a small sample of this serum from Topbox circle in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I used this serum in the evening before my night cream. The liquid texture is pleasant and absorbs quickly. My skin felt hydrated instantly and very soft. Would definitely recommend it to my friends. #freeproduct nan
