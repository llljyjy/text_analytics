I received this moisturizer from Influenster and I couldn’t wait to try it out. The packaging is neat and eye-catching and doesn’t have any gimmicks (fancy pumps and/or spoons, etc.). The cream looks like it would be heavy but is pretty lightweight once you start to work it in. It doesn’t really have a smell which is fine by me! I’ve been using this product daily for about 3 weeks and I’m hooked. I love how moisturized my face is without feeling greasy/sweaty. I like to add a tiny bit more right before makeup application just so everything looks good and isn’t flakey. I have combination skin that leans to the sensitive side and this was perfect for me! New Favorite!
