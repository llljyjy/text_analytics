I bought this because I was experiencing dryness, redness, and flakiness around my eye area. I was hoping this product would help repair my moisture skin barrier around my eye area. It’s easily absorbed and not at all heavy. It instantly moisturizes and the cucumber smell is refreshing. However, I used this nightly for the last few months but it did not improve the issues I was experiencing despite the ingredient list containing some soothing ingredients. You also only have 6 months to use the product after opening, so I find it’s quite expensive. nan
