I purchased this shortly after the launch. I was super excited to try it and needed a sunscreen. I have super fair and combination skin. I used their plum plump moisturizer (which I love) before applying this making sure to let it set, I brushed my teeth I got some coffee, then I started applying this and it pilled horribly, I swiped and then patted it in. I washed everything off, completely started over, and applied this sunscreen with nothing underneath. IT STILL PILLED!! I don’t know if I got a bad batch, or if they need to reformulate. But I returned it to Sephora, and the woman that helped me with the return said that niacinamide and sunscreen always pills, she didn’t know the science behind that, but just knew from experience of using them together, so it’s kinda silly that they created a product that includes both of these ingredients. I’m super disappointed, but I have faith they will figure this one out. Pills Horribly!!
