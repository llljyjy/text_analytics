I received a sample of the Absolue Rich Cream moisturizer, as part of a campaign. I love the moisturizer. It leaves your skin radiant, soft, supple, and glowing. It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny. I get so many compliments on the radiance of my face. A little goes a long way, and it smells so good. When my friends ask what is giving me a glow, a vacation or spa? No, it is the miracle moisturizer in the jar. It is called Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer, and it is wonderful. Miracle in a jar
