I’m not new to the exfoliating toner game, and have tried everything from drugstore cult favorites to luxury spa brands. I’m not giving this five stars lightly; here’s how it stacks up - many aha toners leave a sticky, tacky finish. This goes on very light with no residue - I’ve been dealing with some redness lately and this has made a noticeable improvement - pleasant herbal scent - my skin feels smoother and leans matte after use- has not irritated my sensitive skin My only beef is that after about three weeks use 2x/day, the bottle is looking about halfway empty. It’s going to be an expensive habit if it goes that fast, but overall, yeah. This toner brings something new, and if you haven’t found an aha toner you like, maybe give this one a try excellent - does what it says
