I really liked the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer. It made my skin feel plump and hydrated and stopped the flakiness I was experiencing. I also liked that it was not greasy or sticky at all and quickly soaked into my skin. I have very sensitive eyes and this did not irritate my eyes at all. I was impressed that it was cruelty free and used mostly recyclable materials. My one negative was the jar packaging.  I much prefer a pump or tube, which would protect the product from light, air and bacteria. Great Moisturizer
