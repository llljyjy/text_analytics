This left my skin super soft and smooth! I also tried it on my husband because his skin was looking really dry and flaky and it got rid of the flaky dry look and left his skin super moisturized. I also liked that this a light fel- like texture which is easy to remove and not too messy to apply. Overall I would recommend! It works
