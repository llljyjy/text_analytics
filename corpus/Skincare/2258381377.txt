I first tried this product in the old packaging/formulation and I LOVED it. I was so happy to see it being offered in glass packaging now since it’s more sustainable, but I was disappointed in the performance of the product. I found it just did so much more for my skin than it does now unfortunately. Old formula was so much better…
