Well im too lazy product to leave a review about a product unless it is mindblowing(never commented before.means nothing has impressed me so far). First thing first, i am giving it 4 stars as everybody can tell.Smell of course. It so much reminds me of L’Oréal Nutri Gold Extraordinary Oil Face that i used in the past and triggered my rosaic skin.the smell of these are excatly same.but this formula is clean and has nothing harmful to our skin.it does magically relief your redness.i cant say that it takes all the redness away but up to 40 percentage it fades it away.apart from that i had red bumps on my skin but no acne due to my rosacia. Due to this product it all is gone.However i combine it with ultra repaid intense hydration cream and i think they work fab.ly together.i .d higly recommend everyone Highly recommended
