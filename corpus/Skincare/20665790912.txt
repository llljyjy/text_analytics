I received this free for testing purposes from Influenster for my honest review and I must say I’m impressed. I love the facial cleanser. It left my face feeling so clean. No harsh scents which I love. The scrub is ok but could work better. The vitamin c serum kinda burns but it isn’t too bad and that moisturizer is lovely! I’m overall happy with it. Not to bad
