So…I was super excited to try this product. I love oils and have been wanting to incorporate Vitamin C into my routine and I know turmeric is good for the inside so why not the outside? This oil is not bad per se. Pros: feels nice, did not sting, did not cause breakouts, imparts a glow because it is an oil. Cons: glass bottle, did not notice skin being any better, cost compared to comparable products, can stain things, I did not become a CEO after using (just kidding). I know some like a glass bottle…it is pretty, feels pricey, and glass has a nice heft to it. But seriously unless you have Lady Gaga money and built a separate carpeted room with a ginormous vanity station to house your elixirs and smooth them onto your epidermis there is a risk it will break. And at 80 bucks an ounce that would suck. Also, it is nice to have products in containers that you can throw in your bag or carry on easily. I did not see any results except me in the mirror reaching with both hands and cringing every time I grab it, for sure that this time I will drop that bottle either on my foot or the tile floor. Nice but not nice enough…
