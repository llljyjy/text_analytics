I have always wanted to try out this sunscreen because my aunt uses it all the time but the price was a bit much for me considering how small the bottle is so when I got this to test out I was so excited. The bottle itself is pretty light weight and small which is convenient to carry around. The sunscreen itself is very liquidy and has a slight fragrance. I use it on top of all my skincare but I feel like it just sits on top. It’s oil free with hyaluronic acid so I thought maybe it would sit better with very minimal skincare products on my face and it did absorb a little better but still sat on top which is a pet peeve of mine. I’m really pale so I personally wasn’t able to tell if it leaves a white cast or not. I’m sure it works SPF wise but it’s just not for me unfortunately. The price, the size, and formula don’t really match up with my interests but overall it’s still an okay product. I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase though could be better
