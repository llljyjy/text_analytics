For anyone fair skinned…BUY THIS! After one use, this product makes a noticeable difference in my skin color. It’s also the first self-tanning product that hasn’t made my skin break out. I’ve also been using this as my moisturizer and I would say my face feels more hydrated than any of the moisturizers I’ve tried. I typically use isle of paradise on my body and then this cream on my face and hands. Definitely one of my all time favorite products! Fair Skinned Game Changer
