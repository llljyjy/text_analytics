I don’t know how to feel. This felt like butter and super hydrating under my eyes (mind you I have never used eye creams soo my under eye are dehydrated!!!) this made my under eyes feel soo smooth and hydrated but after 1 minute it started to feel like intense heat under my eyes and then it magically went away after about 3 mins. I have to keep using it to see if that keeps happening. But I think it’s hydrating and a good eye cream I just don’t like the fact that my under eye may be sensitive to it. Also their is shimmer on this which i do not personally like. hydrating but irritated
