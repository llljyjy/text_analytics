This cream was happily gifted by The Outset. First off, I am always looking for clean (better for you) skincare and this delivers on that front for sure. The packaging is beautiful and looks great on my counter. There is minimal smell which is very important for me as well. The texture is very smooth and light. It does not pill which is so important for me. I wake up in the morning with glowing skin. I do have very dry skin in the winter and this might not be thick enough for the cold winter months. It is better for spring/summer when I am not as dry. Beautiful clean beauty
