I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I was initially put off by the amount of product but was pleasantly surprised that a little goes a long way. The smell is pleasant and the texture is creamy and not at all greasy. I have noticed a difference in the puffiness of my underlying are and believe that after prolonged use I will see even better results. Overall I am satisfied with this product. nan
