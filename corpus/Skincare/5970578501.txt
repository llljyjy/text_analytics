I normally donâ€™t buy expensive skin care, I use brands like the ordinary and inky list, this product is defiantly worth the price. It has completely changed my skin and is one of my favourite skin care products I have ever used. I have acne prone, normal to oil skin. it has cleared up my acne and reduced the appearance of the scars along with tightening my pores. I love this and would highly recommend it! It's worth it I promise
