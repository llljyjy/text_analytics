I was skeptical about these single sheet face masks but I’m coming to realize Dr. Jart+ does wonders for my skin. I have very sensitive combination skin, and this is the only face mask that hasn’t made me breakout afterwards. The oil was minimized after this, so I will be buying more! It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and so soft afterwards, with no powerful scents or tingles in my experience. Face Mask Converter
