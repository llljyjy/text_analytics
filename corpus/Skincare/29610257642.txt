Very solid moisturizer. Deeply rich formula, but doesnâ€™t feel too heavy on the skin. I have extremely oily skin, so I only use at night. Have not seen too much of a difference in skin texture, but nice formula to try. Will keep using and think of purchasing if seeing desired results. Solid product
