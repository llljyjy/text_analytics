This Moisturizer definitely hydrated my skin. It made it look even hydration wise, but I am sensitive to certain fragrances and this one gave me a headache, made my face sting a little and broke me out. I am very disappointed because it actually smelled good and wasnt super overpowering. I would recommend this one to someone who needs hydration but doesnt have super picky, sensitive skin. May work better for others
