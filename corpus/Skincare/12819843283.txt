I bought this for a simple reason. Just wanted something to use for my night time routine that would be moisturizing and also help my skin with anitaging. I don’t particularly have skin problems. But this I bought I want to say more than two weeks ago. I honestly do not see any kind of difference. I don’t really like that it leaves my face with a greasy feel even if I just use a little bit also it’s kind of sticky. Maybe it’s just me. But I really am not a fan. Wanted to love but not what I need.
