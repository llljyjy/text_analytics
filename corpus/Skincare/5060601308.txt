I am not a person who fears oils, but this is too much for me!  It does separate, which isn’t so bad because you’re going to rub it in anyway, but it leaves a thick film even after a lot of rinsing.  It is unscented, so there is just nothing nice about the experience except that it comes in a tube.  I wish more cleansing balms would. I guess it does break up makeup and sunscreen.iiunscientific Not for me
