I personally love this sunscreen! I have sensitive skin so I’m always wary with skincare. I honestly vaguely remember thinking this had a strong SPF smell. Which I personally don’t like. I’ve been using this now for a while and I can’t smell it anymore. I guess I’ve gotten use to it. I also like that it’s not greasy and it’s moisturizing. I still use my moisturizer with this sunscreen and it works great for me. I already purchase a new bottle. I would say the con is not knowing if you’re running low. That’s why I purchased the new bottle because I can’t tell how much I have left. Hydrating and works with my sensitive skin
