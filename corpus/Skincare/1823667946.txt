Goop is a good product . Itâ€™s got a great look to the bottle . Easy to use. For me I think I may need to try one more time as it felt a little extra drying out for my skin. But as far as the product itself was easy to apply and wash off. Silky and smooth . Smell was very appealing. Overall would be great for anyone to try. I think it could provide a radiant look when used. GoopGlow
