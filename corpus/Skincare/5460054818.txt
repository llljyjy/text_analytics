Having combination skin its challenging and different season of the year skin changes . With this being said trying new moisturizer during vacation can be challenging for skin with sun exposure my skin become dryer. I used Estee Lauder moisturizer day and night as part of my skin care everyday for 2 weeks . Skin looks hydrated and more toned , make up went on great on top, with time my skin feel more moisturized definitely repurchasing this product in a future . Love moisturizer
