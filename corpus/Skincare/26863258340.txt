Gorgeous sleep mask. I have extremely sensitive, combination skin that is so frustrating as it leans towards being super dry but still with breakouts. I also get eczema on my cheeks and around my nose. Lately, I have not had as many issues with zits and my skin has been unbearably dry. I would moisturize three times a day with thick, rich creams, and they were not helping. This mask leaves my skin so plump, soft, and hydrated each morning and it lasts all day in conjunction with my regular moisturizers. Iâ€™m obsessed! It is also so, so gentle on my sensitive skin. nan
