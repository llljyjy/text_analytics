I was disappointed in this product. I used it twice a week for 2 month and did not notice any changes, differences, or improvements really. My pores still look the same. My skin does look or feel any different. The exfoliation was light. Definitely not worth the very high price for the very tiny bottle you get. I did received this product as part of a free sample program. nan
