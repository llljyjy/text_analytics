I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have extremely dry skin, so I really thought I would love this product.It’s nice and thick and I like that, but unfortunately it leaves my face feeling greasy. I also think the price is too high. I’m thankful that I was able to sample it before I spent that kind of money on it though.I won’t be buying it but I’ve read that many women really like it.. So there you go. It really depends on your preference. It's not what I'm looking for.
