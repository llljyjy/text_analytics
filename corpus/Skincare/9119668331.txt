I love how much my skin soaks up this serum, and it really does “plump“ it up!  Very minimal scent, which makes it versatile and my hubby can also use it because of that! Isn’t super oily like other serums either wilchich is important for my 30+ combination skin. I apply it twice sine the first drops sink right in, then my skin has the perfect glow. Most absorbing serum ever!
