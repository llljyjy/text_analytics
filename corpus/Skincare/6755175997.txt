I received this product for free through Influenster. I have been using it for about a month now and haven’t seen crazy drastic results but my under eyes do seem more hydrated. I like how this product doesn’t have a heavy scent and applies on silky and smooth it doesn’t leave my under eyes with a yellowish tint so it’s definitely one that I would recommend Night cream
