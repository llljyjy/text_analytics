Like several of the other reviewers, this cream made me break out with small whiteheads. I used to use Good Genes by Sunday Riley at night, but thought I’d try something new. I wanted to like this since it got such good reviews, and Tatcha is a widely liked, high quality brand. It’s too thick for me though and just seems to be clogging my pores. I will say it’s good for dry skin since it’s so thick, but not worth the breakout. Sadly, Not for Me
