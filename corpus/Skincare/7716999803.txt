I did not see many non-incentivized reviews so I decided to write this one. I purchased myself full price to try it. This is a really amazing product if you are going for the k-pop dewy/glowing “glass skin“ look! That’s basically exactly what this does. It makes your skin look “glowy“. But not overly sparkly like a twilight vampire. It looks almost “natural“, almost. It has a slight shimmer almost like a super subtle highlighter. I have medium-tan skin and it looks alright on me, its translucent so it can sorta work with any skin color. Shimmer color itself is more of a cool “white“ on my skin (or thats how it looks on my skin), but it doesn’t look bad. However, if they offered more color options I’d definitely go for something a little bit more tan/bronzier since I think that would better compliment my skin tone. I don’t think wear this just as a highlighter by itself, its too subtle. If you are just looking for a highlighter this isn’t really that, its more for for allover glow. It’s definitely a look, so if you don’t like looking dewy or shiny don’t buy it. If you are a fan of the “glass skin“ look or just want to try that look out, you will probably love this product. Took off one star for lack of color options. I hope they see this and make more colors. "Glass skin" look
