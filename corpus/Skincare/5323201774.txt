Was recommended this product and absolutely love it. I started having dry flaky skin that wouldn’t go away. Since it’s made of sugar, I opt to scrub away on dry skin then cleaning off with warm water. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. It clears the flaky skin and I can move on with putting on make up without seeing the cracks and flakes. nan
