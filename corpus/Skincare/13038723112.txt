This moisturizer is great for everyday use even for my oily skin.  I normally use a moisturizer specifically for mattifying my skin and a separate spf.  If I don’t use a matte moisturizer my skin normally becomes an oily mess by the end of the day.  Not with this moisturizer.  It soaks in to your face easily and using this my makeup was still perfectly in place at the end of the day.  I highly recommend this moisturizer if you are looking for a moisturizer thee as t does it’s job but does not feel like you are wearing a thick or greasy lotion.  Would definitely repurchase this! Great moisturizer with spf
