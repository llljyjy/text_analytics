I received a very small sample of this. I was able to get about 5 days and nights worth of use from it. I do love that it has no scent. It does moisturize and my skin felt tighter and more plump. I can’t speak for the long term benefits, since I didn’t get to use it long enough, but my first impression is good. I like the ingredients also. Good first impression
