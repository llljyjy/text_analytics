The Shiseido Urban Enviornment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen with Broad Spectrum SPF 42 is literally so good! I have been looking around for a sunscreen because sun protection is so important, especially since i live in Los Angeles where the sun is super hot. I am fair skin and this did NOT leave a white cast, which i always have problems with sunscreens. I wore it alone for 8 hours and it was so lightweight. I reapplied every 2 hours and my skin feels so soft. I love sunscreen in general because it makes my acne scars go away. This formula is so smooth and the fragrance is not too strong. If you have enough to splurge on a good sunscreen, I recommend this! nan
