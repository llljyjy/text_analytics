Really wanted to like this but I haven’t seen a difference at all in my skin. It definitely doesn’t clean out my pores like other toners I’ve used. I have a hard time getting past the texture/bottle. It’s so pretty but it’s incredibly sticky and constantly leaks everywhere when I use it. don’t recommend
