Been so excited to try out this Capture Totale Super Potent eye serum! The large cold metal tip soothes puffy skin the morning and the serum feels silky and luxurious. It has niacinamide, which helps hydrate and protect the skin.  I do wish the cap was easier to place back on and that the bottle wasnâ€™t as firm to squeeze. I received this complimentary from Influenster and Dior Beauty in exchange for my honest review. So cooling in the morning!
