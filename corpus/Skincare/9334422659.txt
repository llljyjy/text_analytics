I have dry skin and get redness in my face. When I put this serum on and my face moisturizer over it, my redness goes away and I don’t look oily. Overall, I am quite happy with this serum. I recommend it for people with the same skin concerns as me, and for those who are looking to buy a good serum that doesn’t cost a fortune. I like it a lot
