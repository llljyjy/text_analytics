I like how this product feels and makes my skin look but I feel that that packaging is an issue. I always shake it well before I use but it seems that I’m getting mostly the brown/ bottom product and the top/ gold oily product remains. When it first arrived it was about 75% brown and 25% gold and I’ve been using it for about a month and the gold hasn’t gone down but the brown is about 50% now. So yes I do like it but am I getting the product out of the bottle as it’s intended to be used? I don’t know. nan
