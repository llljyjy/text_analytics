I received the chance to try Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution thru  Bzzagent for free in exchange for a review.  Upon approval of my profile, the package arrived within 3 weeks.  Once I cracked the box open, I noticed a light floral scent that was not overpowering.  Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution instantly is absorbed and leaves your skin feeling hydrated.  Being a skin picker, I noticed in a months time that my spots were getting lighter.  At first, I thought it was just the lighting but when looked in a random cars mirror, my eyes were not deceiving me.  I can’t wait for my skin to clear up 100 % .  In the mean time Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution will be a main staple. Dalmation Less
