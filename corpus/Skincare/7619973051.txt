I received free complimentary of Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This moisturizer has a rating of 31 out of 100. The main ingredient, phenoxyethanol, a preservative, has a moderate risk. It can cause irritation, if you are sensitive. 9 other ingredients are low risk. Aside from that, the consistency is some what thick but it feels very nice applied to clean skin, leaves your skin soft and hydrated. I do at times have dry skin, but I don’t have any problems the next morning. I will say i do prefer to not use daily and every so often just so i don’t have problems with clogged pores, its a personal issue lol A pea size is a perfect amount, maybe more on your neck, don’t neglect your neck! Product goes a long way! Haven’t noticed any changes after a months use, but I wouldn’t not recommend. Smells divine! Influenster Review
