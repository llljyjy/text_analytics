This is my first “higher end” sunscreen and I’m in love. It spreads really easily and left no white cast. It’s SUPER light and it gave me a nice dose of moisture without the stickiness that other brands do after you go out in the sun. Plus it smells heavenly! I received this for free from Influenster and Shiseido in return for my honest opinion. Smells heavenly
