As the parent of an 8 month old, not only am I sleep deprived (like lots of people) but I had to stop wearing glasses and switch to contacts because of grabby fingers (probably not the reason for a lot of people). Unfortunately the sleep deprivation makes my eyes really puffy, so itâ€™s hard to get my lenses in. Enter this product! I had never used an eye cream before but this one is a game changer. I keep it in the fridge and 5 minutes after applying I can get my contacts in much easier than I could have before. Will definitely be keeping this on hand as long as they make it. The dark circle reduction is a great bonus. a new must have
