I bought this clay mask like a week or like 2 weeks ago and have only used it like 2 times. I haven’t really noticed a difference but I’m pretty sure it’s because I have only use it like 2 times. I wanted to wait to write a review once I noticed a big difference but I couldn’t wait. It’s such an amazing clay mask and it just feels so so so GOOD. When I first was reading the reviews a-lot of people were saying it has this cooling affect and when I had it on I didn’t really feel a cooling affect only a bit but once I like took off the face mask OMG MY FACE FELT AMAZINGG!! I feel the cooling effect so much after the mask is off. I feel after more uses I’ll be able to see more of a difference in my skin but I was reading this like article like reviewing some products and in the article it said I could use this as a spot treatment and I have had these stubborn little bumps on my chin and I wasn’t expecting it to get rid of them because they have been there for so so long but the next day OMG THEY WERE literally  GONE like there is still 1 or 2 bumps but this stuff is amazing as a spot treatment and as a mask. LOVE THE FEELING AFTER AND A GREAT SPOT TREATMENT
