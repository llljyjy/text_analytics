Honestly a pass for me. It seems to work fine but nothing magical. It does not sit well under my sunscreen or makeup. Also the bottle is awful. Every time I’ve tried traveling with it, even if it’s just taking it on a short drive to my bf’s house, it leaks and spills al over the place, making a mess and wasting product. Also the hot dog smell does not fade. Nothing special, terrible packaging
