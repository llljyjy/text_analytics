This product threw me off a bit at first because it has the consistency of a toner vs. a traditional facial lotion. It has a mild fresh scent and I apply at night. Itâ€™s gentle so you can use in combination with other products with active ingredients. This product is ultra hydrating and leaves my skin looking renewed in the morning. I have noticed a reduction in my sometimes red T-zone since I integrated this product into my routine. I absolutely plan to repurchase this product once my sample runs out as it has quickly become a part of my bedtime routine. Hydrating toner-like product
