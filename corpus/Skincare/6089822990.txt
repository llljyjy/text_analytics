I came here pretty much just to say that the packaging is absolutely horrible. As soon as my hands are even slightly wet or greasy from the rest of my skincare routine, it is IMPOSSIBLE to open the tin. There’s no grooves in the lid so you have to like pop it off. There’s not enough room to get a good grip to be able to open it, so my hands just slide everywhere. I know it comes in tube form as well, but you pay the same price for half the product.The product itself is also just ok. Basically fancy Vaseline, it doesn’t really offer any hydration, but it does make my lips look nice and shiny. It’s pink but there’s no tint. You only need a small amount so it’ll last a long time. Honestly there are better alternatives out there, regular lip balm can do a better job at a fraction of the price. Horrible packaging
