Honestly, I was skeptical, however I have to say that this product lives up to the hype. Was it a miraculous overnight change? No. But after a couple of weeks, I definitely felt the difference in texture on my face, it also made my skin look brighter and I could see my skin tone evening out. I have sensitive skin and dry patches and during the time I used this product, it definitely became less of an issue. 10/10 would recommend! nan
