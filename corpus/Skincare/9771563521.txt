I received this deluxe sample of the Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from Topbox in exchange for my review. I used this every morning after cleansing, along with the Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream and Face Cream as part of my daily skin care routine. I found the product to be scentless and very quickly absorbed. As the samples were so small, it is impossible to give a review on the performance over a longer timeframe. Would be interested in trying a full-size sample to use on a longer-term.  As I have enjoyed using Clinique products in the past, I am considering purchasing this one. Love Clinique products
