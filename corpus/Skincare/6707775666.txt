If you love the All Day Hydrator moisturizer but just wanted it to be a tiny bit thicker and richer, look no further! The product has a beautifully whipped texture and is thick but does not feel heavy or greasy or LOOK greasy on the skin. It is definitely dry skin friendly and even goes well under makeup. It wears well throughout the day also. I would absolutely repurchase this Not too thick or thin but just right.
