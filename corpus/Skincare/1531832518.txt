I recently overhauled my skincare with a few of this brand’s (expensive) products, and I’m happy to say it is worth the money! I use this cleanser every morning; my skin is clearer and brighter. I kinda wish I had taken before and after photos. I would definitely recommend to anyone with oily/combo acne prone skin. This is an amazing exfoliating cleanser!
