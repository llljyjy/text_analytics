I received this Dior on/off foaming face cleaners from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a really nice facial cleaner. A small amountgoes a long way. It makes a nice silly creamy lather and smells nice without being over powering. It removes my makeup easily. My face feels clean afterwards without feeling tight anddried out. This is one of the nicest facial cleansers I’ve used and I’ve used many. Rich and creamy facial cleanser
