This sunscreen doesn’t contain zinc, oxybenzone & octinoxate. Which is awesome! This is more of a daily sunscreen. It is white but with no cast. It blends in easily, and is very hydrating. I never can use sunscreens due to my allergy to the ingredients mentioned above and this hasn’t irritated my skin at all. I also love the packaging it’s almost 2 oz. GET IT
