Can I give this like 10 stars??? I wanted to hate this— but I can’t. I’m not one to skimp on my skincare or makeup, I will PAY for something I really love and it totally gets me in trouble. Soooo, I didn’t want to like it— I LOVE IT!! This serum is one that I have actually seen a HUGE difference with. My pores on the inner sides of my cheek and down the sides of my mouth have always been large— ugh. HOWEVER, this serum has totally been transforming them. I notice them shrinking, or looking less noticeable. My dreaded forehead wrinkles aren’t quite as Grand Canyon-y. It smells amazing. One pump goes a long way. My skin feels and looks a million times better than before. Thank you for choosing me to review this. Guerlain has a new customer. Liquid gold? Bottled magic? Perhaps.
