This was complimentary from Hanni. I have tried to shave out of the shower before with soap or lotion or oil and it never worked well. I don’t understand how or why this works but it just does!!! I’m a huge fan. It has a nice subtle scent. I haven’t tried it in the shower but honestly don’t know if I will feel the need to now! Love love love the flexibility and convenience and also the saving water aspect! Great shaving option!
