I really enjoy the scent of this — light and similar to yogurt. Seems strange to say, but it’s enjoyable, I promise! It’s easy to apply and a little goes a long way! It applies light and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy residue. It left my skin feeling moisturized and oh so soft and supple! Really love this and would definitely recommend it!
