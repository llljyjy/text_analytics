I received this  Pro Strength Retinoid Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. This retinoid treatment is very gentle on my skin . I have sensitive acne prone skin and this helped my skin so much . I love that it has vitamin A,C and E . The formula is lightweight but hydrating on the skin . I use this after cleansing and follow up with a hydrating moisturizer. My skin looks clearer and brighter after 2 weeks . This is a very good retinol product. Canâ€™t wait to see more amazing results . Amazing retinoid treatment for sensitive skin.
