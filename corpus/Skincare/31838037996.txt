I always bought the Laneige night lip sleep mask in the original jar so naturally when they made it available in the gloss tubes I was super excited. The Gummy Bear flavor has a totally different consistency, texture, everything is just off from the other flavors. I also have the Berry flavor in the tube and it is softer, smoother, not as thick and goopy, it is very similar if not exactly like the original lip sleep mask in the jar. Gummy Bear flavor was definitely made differently.
