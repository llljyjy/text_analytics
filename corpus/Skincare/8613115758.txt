this lip balm... it’s a work of art. i have a pretty extensive lip balm collection but this one takes the cake (and it SMELLS like cake.) the lip balm keeps you hydrated for hours. it has the prettiest tint as well. the only issue i have with it is that i can’t leave my house without it now... i’m attached. chef's kiss!
