I don’t usually write reviews, but I had to write one about this product. I’ve tried A TON of moisturizers in the past that have been fine, but don’t really do anything extraordinary for my skin. This moisturizer does it all. It hydrates and plumps, leaving a beautiful, healthy glow that doesn’t feel or look greasy. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this product does a great job of hydrating without irritating it. I use it in conjunction with The Inky List’s retinol serum in the evening and wake up with my skin feeling supple and soft. My skin has never looked healthier. This has definitely become my primary moisturizer! BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!!
