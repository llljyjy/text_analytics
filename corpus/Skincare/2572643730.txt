Really lovely scent, and gives a nice little boost of hydration, but I dont think it should be mixed with a lot of other products (pills if you do this), better off if used before a moisturizer, with a light spritz around the face and then pat it in, helps with absorbancy. Nice and refreshing, dont use too much!
