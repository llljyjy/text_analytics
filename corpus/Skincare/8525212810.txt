I received these products for free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. First of all, I was so excited to try these products out! I absolutely love this brand, and these products did not disappoint. The Layla Retro Whipped Cream feels so good on my skin, and itâ€™s very moisturizing without being too much. My skin has never felt this soft and smooth. I highly recommend! When I run out, I will definitely be purchasing! In love
