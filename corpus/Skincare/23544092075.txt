I enjoy using this to clean off makeup. Leaves a bit of an oily layer when washing off with just water (I don’t mind it since I’m trying not to dry out my face when washing) but can be removed with another cleanser. I quite like the smell and enjoy using it. A tub of this really goes a long way. nan
