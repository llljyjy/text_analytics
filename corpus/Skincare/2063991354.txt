I overall have a great experience pairing this with the Serum. I used the serum in the morning and the Glycolic Cream at night, after wasing my face. I noticed a difference about a week and a half into using both it. My completion is more clear and my skin seems much clearer. I do use the Cream every other night as I tend to be sensitive to Glycolic. The creme leaves no sticky reside and melts into your skin. The formula is thick and you need very little to cover your whole face. I also love that its vegan and not tested on animals. #FreeProduct #TryWithTopBox Leaves skin bright and moistured
