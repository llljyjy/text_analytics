I came across the Dr. Zenovia Scar Gel because I have a few scars I’m trying to get rid of and have tried everything but seemed like nothing worked until I tried this and my scars are not gone but have lightened dramatically and I have only been using it about 6 weeks I’m sure if I continue use they will go away. It’s a wonder gel and it’s worth the try! Great Scar Gel
