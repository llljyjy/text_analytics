This cleanser has a cream base and provides adequate lather, but it does not have a pleasant odor. It’s more like a doctor’s medicine or a regular avocado - I don’t like either of them.Apart from the smell, I liked it for the first 3-4 days. But then I started breaking out. I had to go back to my glow recipe blueberry cleanser (which is the best), and thankfully, all of the acne has dried up. To be honest, I prefer the blueberry cleanser because of its nourishing and glowing properties, as well as its soothing fragrance. I am a huge fan of glow recipe products as my entire skincare routine is filled with them but I believe that this cleanser is simply not a good fit for me. Simply not a good fit for me!
