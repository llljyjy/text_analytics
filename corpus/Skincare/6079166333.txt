I LOVED this moisturizer and when I saw it returned after disappearing for a year at least. I rushed to buy it and was a little bit disappointed. It does not have the same rosewater scent as the original. The feeling is mostly the same, still quite a bit of moisture. But something is definitely missing, it just doesnâ€™t feel the same on the skin. nan
