Iâ€™ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now and it has improved the look of my pores. My skin is smooth and less dry with noticeably smaller pores, it does cause some redness but my skin is sensitive so everything does that to me. When you first apply it tightens the skin but not uncomfortably thought, I would repurchase. so far so good
