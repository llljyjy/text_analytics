The first few times I put this on, it smelled really bad like cigarette ash or something musty. Someone in the reviews said they didn’t notice the smell lingering, but for me I still get whiffs of it for many hours after applying. The smell has grown on me and now I weirdly like the scent - it’s hard to describe. The packaging is also not ideal for this product. It’s a thinner viscosity than the type of products that are usually in aluminum squeeze tubes, so too much comes out and it dries in the cap. I wish it were a thicker cream for the price so I could use less. On the plus side, this list of ingredients in this is fantastic, and it does work about as well as a non-rx dark-spot treatment can. Tranexamic acid and these type of ingredients work best when used consistently over time and work well to prevent redness/dark spots before they occur as well as treat hyperpigmentation. Smell lingers, bad packaging, but works great
