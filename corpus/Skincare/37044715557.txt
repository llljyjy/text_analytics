I was lucky enough to received Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serumas a part of the #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have tried it for the past few days. I was happy to receive this product to review and it seems to work great!This product has really made a difference on my skin. Very hydrating, super rich complex that still manages to feel incredibly light. My skin feels so hydrated and soft after using this serum. I also love how smooth my skin feels immediately after application. It feels a bit like a high end primer. It leaves a nice glow to the skin. It plumps everything up and gives my skin a nice subtle glow. The wrinkled skin has life breathed back in to it, and feels incredible. I also did not experience any irritation while using this twice per day for a week. I really liked this, it made my skin more even and cleared up a little of my acne. Highly recommend! Great Serum!
