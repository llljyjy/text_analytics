Overall I am pleased with this moisturizer.   I received a small sample to test for free in exchange for my honest review.  After using it regularly for a week I noticed a small difference in firming my skin and smoothing out the wrinkles around my eyes.  I feel that with regular use I would see more results, so Iâ€™m going to purchase more and give it a longer try. Nice and light feeling moisturizer!
