Iâ€™ve been using this retinol for about 2 months and I am loving what it is doing to my skin. I have forehead wrinkles and crows feet wrinkles around my outer eye area and this has visibly reduces those wrinkles and has helped my pores look less noticeable, especially my acne scars. Highly recommend. I also have sensitive skin and this has not irritated me at all. Amazing Retinol!
