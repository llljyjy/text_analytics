I have never used the La Mer products before and this I concentrate was everything I needed and more. This eye concentrate addresses the dark eye circles that I struggle with. It is a creamy and thick texture that delivers all of the active ingredients that you would need. It is specially wonderful if you suffer from dry skin. The only thing that might wouldâ€™ve added another layer to the product is if it had some sort of hit a fragrance which it does not. Great for Dry Skin
