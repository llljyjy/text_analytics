I’ve been using this for about a month now, and I can already say I’m impressed with it. My skin looks brighter and ‘tighter’ almost. My stubborn pigmentations are still there but my skin looks more even toned and radiant. I used this as instructed; for once a week until tolerated and always followed with some kind of moisturizer. The product itself is a yellow/orange gel and pleasant to spread across my face. It didn’t break me out or cause excessive drying. I love the AHA level in this, too. surprisingly good!
