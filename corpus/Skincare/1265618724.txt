I have oily skin and blackheads. The blackheads specifically is why I bought this. This did absolutely nothing for me and I’m so disappointed. It didn’t irritate my skin so I’m giving it a star for that but I saw absolutely no difference in the blackheads or general smoothness from exfoliation. Truly. Nothing. Disappointed!
