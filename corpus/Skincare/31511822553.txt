I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream as a #freeproduct. I loved this product! It does not feel oily and I was able to see the difference after only a few uses. It does smell a little like chemicals but the smell does not last very long. It was very moisturizing. Great!
