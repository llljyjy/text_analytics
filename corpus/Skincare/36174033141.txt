I have received this product in exchange for my honest review. I tried Tula for the first time, my skin type is oily/Combination & love this resurfacing skin mask, it has all the superfruit enzymes, AHAs & probiotic extracts. I could feel instant change in my skin texture - helped in softening, toning & exfoliating my skin. I would definitely recommend you to try it! Absolutely love it!
