This cleanser feels *luxurious*. You don’t need much (about a dime size or less) for the product to do its thing. It foams up in a creamy consistency and the smell is divine. I will say, if you use too much, the scent can be overwhelming, but like I said, you don’t need much to get the job done. My skin afterwards felt soft and smooth but it was a little dry. The only thing I Don like about the product is the packaging and I wish it had a flip top instead of a removable top. Great cleanser, definitely reccomend if you’re looking for a luxury experience. I received this product for free in exchange for honest review via Influenster. Great cleanser!
