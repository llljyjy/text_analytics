The ingredients are a yes, but the smell is a big NO! I just couldn’t get over the scent of this mask, it made me instantly nauseous. I understand they’re trying to scent it like watermelon but it smells like mothballs to me! I’ll use this up when I’m sick & my nose is clogged so I can’t smell it! Scent makes me nauseous!
