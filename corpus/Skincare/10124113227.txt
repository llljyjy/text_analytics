I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. The cream is very smooth and feels great on the skin, and it takes very little to apply. I haven’t really noticed any change though. I’m not the most consistent with a skincare routine, but I tried hard with this stuff. Maybe when my infant sleeps more at night I’ll see a difference, but for now it’s just a nice moisturizer for my eyes. Received from Influenster for my honest review Not impressed
