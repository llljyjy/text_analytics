I bought this on a whim and I am impressed. It took 2 days to remove acne and half the bottle to fade away old dark spots. I am on my third bottle and the best way to use this is with moisturizer since it can be dry on my combination skin. I love to use this before make up too. Perfect spray for acne and dark spots.
