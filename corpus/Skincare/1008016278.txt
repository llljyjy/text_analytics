I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and it felt so nice on the skin. I like the ingredients used and feel it works best for dry skin. It is very moisturizing and not heavily scented. I prefer to use this at night as it feels more on the heavier side on the skin. I would recommend. Nice moisturizer
