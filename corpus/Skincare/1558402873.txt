Very moisturizing, rich and on the heavy side. No real scent, which I like. I purchased looking for that heavier cream to only use at night and if my skin is feeling dry. It definitely fits the bill, but to be honest might be too heavy for me. I have been trying to find that perfect fit for me - mid 40s and combo skin. But the best I’ve found so far is cetaphil’s night cream, which is pretty cheap. So while I really like this product, and would recommend for those with normal or dry skin, wanting a rich moisturizer, I don’t think I will purchase again. Good for rich moisture
