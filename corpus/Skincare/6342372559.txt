I thoroughly enjoyed this eye cream. It has almost a cooling effect when you put it on. I don’t have puffy under eyes so I didn’t notice any difference with that. It did hydrate my under eyes as well as brightened them up! It looks great under makeup and doesn’t have a weird reaction like other products do. Beautiful Undereyes
