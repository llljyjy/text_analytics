I had a sunburn pretty bad on my face when this arrived for me to try. I was hesitant to put it in but I had to get to work trying it out to post my review. So I went ahead and applied it every day sunburn and all and my skin never peeled with the burn; I wad left with soft healthy skin that was both hydrated and smooth. My deep lines from natural aging appear so much softer and my skin has a health glow . This anti aging serum is my new go to!
