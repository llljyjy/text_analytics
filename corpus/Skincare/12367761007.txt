Honestly if it were the old packaging I would give it a 5 star. But this new packing is just horrible, it’s hard to get out, and when you do get some to come out it’s way to much and you have to use it because it’s not like you can put it back. PLEASE BRING THE OLD PACKAGE BACK THE INKY LIST!!!!!! The moisturizer it’s self is great, it’s light weight and makes my skin feel amazing. But if your going to make crappy packing couldn’t you at least lowered the price? You go from something that feels high end to something from the end discount display at Walmart or dollar store. BRING BACK THE OLD PACKAGING!!!!!!
