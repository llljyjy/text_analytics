I received this from Influenster & have been using it for just over a week, I really enjoy the texture of it and it’s perfect for before makeup! I feel like it makes my face feel a little more plump, texture is nice and the scent isn’t too strong which I prefer. I did end up with a break out shortly after starting it however I can’t confirm if that was directly related to this. Testing from Influenster!
