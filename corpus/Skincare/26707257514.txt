I received this product complementary from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Surprisingly, I have never used an eye cream before. This gel creme feels hydrating, smooth, and moisturizing. After using this product for about a week I immediately started to see a difference in my under eye. My under eye appears to be brighter and honestly feels healthier just from using this product. Hydrating!
