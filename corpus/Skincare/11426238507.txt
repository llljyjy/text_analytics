These drops are so hydrating! I have eczema prone skin and also sensitive, but I mixed 6 drops of this with my night cream and woke up a few shades darker so now I match my neck and chest area and I feel like I donâ€™t need as much foundation! I would like to try this out as a contour with a brush! This is going to be a must have this summer nan
