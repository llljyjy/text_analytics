I was intrigued when I received a sample of this to review. The consistency is extremely watery unlike many other serums of the same type which makes it harder to gauge how much you are using. I did find that it makes your skin very soft upon application after drying so it definitely has some great skin conditioning ingredients in it and was definitely more moisturizing than other vitamin c serums I have tried. I really saw no difference in my skin as I had already been using a much stronger vitamin c serum but I could see this as a good option as a multi tasker serum for those who need hydration and brightening/hyperpigmentation lightening. Lightweight and moisturizing
