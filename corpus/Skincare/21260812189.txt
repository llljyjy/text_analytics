I bought my mum the  24K mask from this brand for Christmas thinking it would be some luxurious good-quality mask. My mum always had clear skin and all of a sudden she started noticing hormonal-looking painful pimples on her face. She stopped using the mask I got her because that was the only new thing she tried and after a week or so her skin improved. I thought that was just a coincidence and that she must have been allergic to something in it. A few weeks ago, I received a free sample of the pumpkin enzyme mask at Sephora and oh boy.. I’ve been taking accutane for a while and managed having a crystal clear skin for 5 years until I put this on my face. The mask has a burning tingling sensation when you put it on and it smells good, but the next day I woke up with a bunch of pimples. I didn’t realize this was the cause so I used it again after a few days and it only got worse. Now I have painful pimples all over my face and I regret trying this. I do not have sensitive skin whatsoever so I’m not sure what ingredient is causing this. Do not recommend Horrible
