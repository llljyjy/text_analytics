I received this product for my honest review. I only used this product as a cream after washing my face. I do not have sensitive skin, and this did not bother me at all. I love the cream as it fies not have any scent to it. It is a thick cream but applies nicely and soaks in quickly. My face didnâ€™t have a tacky, sticky feeling afterwards either. I would recommend Nice feeling unscented
