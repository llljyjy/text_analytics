I love all the skin-healthy ingredients in this product! For me, it’s heavier than typical BB creams I’ve used in the past and gives my skin a dry look. The color I received is way too tan, even going with my usual light/medium. The SPF 40 earns this beauty product it’s three stars! Love a good level SPF in my makeup and skincare. Heavier than a BB Cream
