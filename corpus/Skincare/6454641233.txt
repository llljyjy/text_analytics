Over this toner is OKAY. I wish I would have noticed that the majority of the reviews were incentivized. The packaging is nice and I like the size of the bottle and how much comes out when you pour. Now for the actual product. First and for most, this toner smells awful. It’s almost like putting vinegar on your face. Secondly, it’s tacky feeling. It doesn’t matter whether you put it on dry skin or damp—you will notice it’s still there. My skin has cleared up some using this toner but honestly I don’t look forward to using just because the smell. I was hoping to find a replacement for glow recipe, but 100% this is NOT it. That smell though
