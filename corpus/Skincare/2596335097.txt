This is a beautiful moisturizer, however I do not feel it did much for my skin. I have combination skin which is acne prone/very sensitive and while this product didn’t cause any irritation and was pretty light consistency, I didnt notice any more moisture than with my current skincare routine that I am happy with. To be fair I had only trialed the 5ml sample which was nice for the time being, but in the few uses I was able to get I don’t think it will be a product that I would swap into my current routine, but it might be a great fit for someone looking for something new !
