I received this cloud cream from Bzz Agent in exchange for my honest review.  I have to admit I have fallen in love with this product. It smells like a fresh field of relaxing lavender. It is thick and creamy in texture but sinks into the skin wonderfully. Unlike many other products I have used it does not leave behind any residue or an oily feel. The cream sinks right in to do the job intended. My face feels so soft after use. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a night cream. Elite Skincare from the Clouds
