This is a strange product. I can’t say that it’s too thick. It’s not jiggly but a little more firm that kiehls one with the white pot. What is strange is the smell & the fact it doesn’t go into my skin. It smells almost waxy? Like bees wax? Idek it’s weird. I bought this to use at night. I seriously don’t feel it go into my skin. I used it just now & walked around my apartment. It make my skin feel warm & almost sweaty like it just sat at the top of my face. strange & returning.
