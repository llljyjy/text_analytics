This is my first time trying out a BB cream. I decided to give this one a try because it combines concealer, moisturizer and SPF all in one product. I like how it’s lightweight but you can build up the coverage. It’s super easy to apply so I recommend starting off with just a pea size and applying more if necessary. I did an 8h use test and it didn’t crease or smudge. At first it looked a little orange but after 10min or so it blended more with my skin tone  I definitely recommend buying this product if you’re looking for something with buildable coverage but that still looks natural.
