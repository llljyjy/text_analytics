Summer Fridays gifted me their vanilla lip butter balm and I’m not exaggerating when I say this is my favorite lip balm I’ve ever used. It’s so hydrating and makes my lips so soft and smooth, and it also gives the appearance of plumper lips. It’s not sticky at all and the scent is so yummy! I’ve purchased this product on my own many times and will continue to do so! The best lip balm!
