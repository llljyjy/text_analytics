First of all- The packaging component is so frustrating and stupid- it’s hard to tell when you’re running out or if you have really used all of the product. I wish it was just in a tube or a jar. I’ve repurchased several times (and it’s expensive) but I hate this component so much that I don’t think I will anymore. The product formula itself is great. Really good for hydrating oily skin when it’s feeling sensitive or after a treatment. nan
