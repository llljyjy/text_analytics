I’ve been using this products for a few weeks now, and the results are fabulous! Easy application, and it feels so nice on my skin. Not sticky or too liquidy like some moisturizers. It’s very creamy. I have extremely dry skin, and this works so good on keeping my skin feeling hydrated. Absolutely love every product I’ve tried from Youth To The People. Highly recommend! Must-have Moisturizer!
