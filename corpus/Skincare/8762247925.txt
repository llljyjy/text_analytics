I got this because the salicylic acid cleanser would dry my skin out after using to where I’d have to immediate put hyaluronic acid on, so I figured this would be a decent alternative and wouldn’t dry my face out. It wasn’t drying, but I feel it didn’t also do much of anything. It doesn’t lather well, and I didn’t feel or see much of any difference. It’s just not for me, but I’ll sure others would find it great. So-so
