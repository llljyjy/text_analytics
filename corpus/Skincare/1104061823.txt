Used under my eyes.  This did tighten the skin but I was unable to find ANY way to use it in which it did not leave a very white and powdery residue once dried.  I did not use under or over makeup just clean and moisturized skin.  When I attempted to gently remove the residue the effects of the tightening were gone instantly.  Returning this today. fine chalk layer
