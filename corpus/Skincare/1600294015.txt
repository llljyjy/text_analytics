I don’t know why I was surprised that I ended up loving this product.  Everything I have ever tried from Kiehl’s has been a rockstar product. This retinol is no exception.  First off, I’m 41 years old and I have combination skin.  It’s really hard to find products that are actually effective and that penetrate my skin.  My skin drank this stuff up!  The packaging was VERY intimidating at first but the instructions were super easy to follow.  Once I got it “put together“ I fell in love with the packaging.  It makes it so easy to get the exact amount of product I want and there is no waste or product contamination.  BRAVO Kiehl’s!  I’ve been using this product for approximately 4 weeks and I can really tell a difference in my fine lines and texture.  I have always had texture on the temples of my head and have never found anything to correct it...UNTIL THIS.  This product cured the texture on my head.  Another really nice thing about this retinol is that it didn’t dry out my skin.  A lot of retinol’s can be very drying but this one was not and it was still super effective.  It’s a little pricey but if you purchase this I know you will not be disappointed. Kieh's with another standout product!
