I purchased this product based on the raving reviews and the fact that I have always been happy with Kiehl’s products. But this just didn’t do it for me. The texture - not a fan. Even when I rubbed it good in between my hands to warm it up and make it easily spreadable…it had a tacky almost sticky feel. When I rubbed into my face it was difficult and seemed like it sat on my ultra dehydrated skin for a while before it soaked in. In the morning, I didn’t really have that baby skin feel. My skin was soft but I was not wow’d. As for fragrance, I didn’t really smell anything. Meh.
