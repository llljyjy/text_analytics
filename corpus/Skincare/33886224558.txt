I received the awaken peptide eye gel complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion. Iâ€™m so glad that I was able to try out this product because I absolutely loved how it made my under eyes feel and look. Before I had used this product, my under eyes were dry, puffy, and my skin was extremely loose almost. This product gave my eye area an immediate cooling effect from the gel which felt nice and reduced the dryness and puffiness around my eyes as the day went on. I also noticed that it also had a smoothing effect on my fine lines and made the skin around my eyes more firm. Overall, I love and definitely recommend this product to those who have similar under eye struggles. It is so worth it! Love it!!
