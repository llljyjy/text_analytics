I wasn’t expecting much out of this deluxe trial size because I have tried 3 other Algenist products and was pretty underwhelmed by them.  This, however is a delight and I will definitely be purchasing the full size.  Although it appears shimmery coming out of the bottle, it doesn’t settle on the skin that way, no detectable shimmer upon application.  It also feels somewhat oily when you first start spreading it onto your face, but it soaks in so quickly and just leaves you with a nice plump but not slick canvas for makeup.  The thing I really notice about this is that it’s doing wonders for my undereye - I have noticed lately my undereyes are prone to dryness with not enough moisture (which highlights wrinkles) and I get micro-pilae(sp?) when I use a product that is too heavy.  (and I hate using a separate eyecream lol)  So applying this over my whole face feels restorative and glowy has honestly transformed my undereyes to a hydrated youthful appearance.   For context, I am 43, with normal/combo skin and am a bit of a product junkie so when I find something transformative I’m super pumped.  This is up there with Bader for me, as far as noticeable difference on my skin.  A little goes a long way - a few drops is enough for your whole face so if the price seems a bit steep for you, don’t worry, it will last you a very long time Highly recommend for aging skin
