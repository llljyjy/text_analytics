I received this product for testing purposes. I am a moisturizer lover and I have many moisturizers on my vanity due to my dry skin. I will say that this moisturizer is my favorite because of how rich and creamy it is. I use it both morning and night as it lays very well under makeup and rich enough for night use. This product is fragranced but the smell is subtle and smells like flowers. I will definitely buy this product again when I use it up. Amazing
