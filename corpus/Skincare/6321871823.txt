I love the container for this and wish that the lip mask would come like this. I do like this product, but I would probably go for the lip mask instead of this. This has glittery look to it, and I don’t always feel like having shimmer or glitter on my lips. Nowadays I usually just add some fill into my eyebrows, have blush on, maybe some mascara and lip stain, gloss or balm on so sometimes I feel like it’s a little much. But I do like it for days I’m wanting shimmer. It does keep my lips moisturized but not as much as the mask. If you haven’t tried it before, it’s worth a shot to see if you like it. nan
