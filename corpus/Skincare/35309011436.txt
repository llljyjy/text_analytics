So I decided to try this new face moisturizer and I am completely obsessed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it but, I have really dry and flakey skin in the winter time so I figured why not try it out. I’ve only been using it for a week now and I have seen such a difference already. My face has been so soft and moisturized compared to normal. I haven’t had any flake from around my nose or anything. The cream is so light weight and soft, it has a lightsweet smell to it too. I absolutely love how soft it makes my face feel, and I thought for how dry my face is that I would have to apply it multiple times a day, but I only have to use it once a day. Definitely we’ll worth it. Absolutely impressed!
