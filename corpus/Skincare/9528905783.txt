I tried this product every morning and night for about 10 days. The amount provided in each packet was a decent amount.  I suffer from dark under eyes that look sunken in along with eye wrinkles (not bad for my age, LOL!) I would say this product is VERY moisturizing.  Unfortunately I noticed absolutlely no difference with my dark under eyes, except for maybe the area to be a bit brighter.  I took pictures before and after and saw no change.  For the price, I expected it to live up to its claims, if it had, I would definitely have purchased the full size. I have other products that are just as moisturizing for a lot less money. Just meh
