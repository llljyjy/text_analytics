I enjoyed the consistency of this eye creme and like that a little goes a long way. There’s no particular smell do deal with so once it absorbs no residual smell. So far I haven’t noticed much of a difference, but as it is with samples you’re not always going to see a huge difference. But I don’t mind it and my eyes did feel more hydrated. Nice
