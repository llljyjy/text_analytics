**received this as a free product from Influenster**I have been eyeing this product for a while and was exited that I got to finally try it.  Love that this product is certified clean by Sephora as I am slowly transitioning to cleaner products.Product glides on perfectly smooth. Hydrated my tired looking eyes - I’ve noticed that they don’t look as tired anymore, but will admit that it wasn’t an instant change as some would like to have. Love that it is compact enough and not too bulky like other eye cream jars are. No scent which is another added bonus. Will definitely be in my skincare line up moving forward! A clean product that works!
