I used the whole container and I will say that it is very hydrating! I normally use the black tea firming one but I wanted to try out more of Freshâ€™s line, so I got the youth preserve. I would say it definitely serves its stated purpose, but I would also say (for me) I like the black tea better It does what it says!
