This moisturizer is okay! I like it for day time use, but not nighttime. I wish it were a little heavier for my taste, my skin is currently very dry and my moisture barrier is damaged. This moisturizer did help my skin a little, but I’ve been using something more intense since then. I have pretty acne prone skin, and this product stung my face sometimes. I’ll drop a before/after of three days of using it. Overall, my skin is less red, but not any less dry. This might be more suitable for someone with normal skin. I have dry/combo/sensitive skin right now. The cream itself is probably 6/10 on thickness scale. Gifted by Eadem. good but not great
