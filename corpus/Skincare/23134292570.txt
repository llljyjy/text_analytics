I got this sample set to test from in exchange for my honest review.I was not the biggest fan of this serum. My exact first thought was “eww, that’s icky and greasy and everywhere“ followed by “whoa, that is heavy fragranced“ so personally I wouldn’t buy it. The delivery system is very difficult on the samples, which was awful because it was just everywhere and I’m sure the bottle is much better. The texture is like a thin, watery oil, it’s difficult to mix, it almost feels dry or gritty somehow, it was not pleasant. Left my skin with an oily residue. My face got itchy from it so I washed it off, still itchy and my skin feels tight. Smells even after you apply it. I also am not a fan of serums that aren’t stable and have to remain separate until application. Definitely would not recommend this serum. Not great
