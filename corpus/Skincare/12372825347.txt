Clarins Double Serum contains 21 plant extracts to give you smoother, firmer more youthful looking skin.  It is a great serum with benefits for all ages.The bottle has an eco-friendly design and is made with responsible materials to limit waste.  It contains double vials that dispense the serum as an oil and a gel that you mix together and apply to your face.  The textures mix well together and smooth on easily. This serum has a pleasant floral scent that isnâ€™t overpowering. I do feel a little bit of an oily residue when I first apply it, but it sinks in pretty quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not greasy.  After a few days I noticed that my skin was smoother and brighter.  After 7 days my skin felt firmer as well, especially under my chin and on my cheeks.I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review. Great for all ages.
