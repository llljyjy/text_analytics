The family loves Habit mists! This is one of my son’s favorites, my favorite is cucumber, but they are all great! We try to reapply sunscreen during the day in our family and this really helps! There is also always one by the door and one in the cars for anytime use! Great coverage, low effort…awesome SPF  :). easy peasy!
