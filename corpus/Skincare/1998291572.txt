The best mineral sunscreen I’ve used. It does leave some white cast when I first apply it, BUT it goes away or just get blended in my skin somehow. I don’t know how that works exactly, but my skin looks natural in 20-30 mins after applying. I have medium skin with a little olive tone. I saw some comments about it not working on darker skin though.Most mineral sunscreens leave white cast, so if you don’t want any of that, you might want to look at chemical sunscreens. No piling issue for me. nan
