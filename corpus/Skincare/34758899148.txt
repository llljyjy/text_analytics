Iâ€™m a big fan of serums and this one did not disappoint. It made my skin very soft and hydrated. I usually do my serums at night but I like the way my foundation looks when I use this underneath my moisturizer followed by my foundation. I definitely saw a difference as far as minimizing fine lines. I would purchase this again and would recommend it everyone #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Great product
