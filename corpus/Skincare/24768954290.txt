I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I always have a hard time finding facial makeup that doesn’t settle weird on my skin. I also have dry skin. This BB cream is amazing. It goes on light and doesn’t feel like you have anything on your face while providing decent coverage. It is also super hydrating. I used the fair shade and it does have a weird hue to it out of the bottle but it adapts and blends in perfectly with my skin. Definitely recommend this product Love this Bb cream
