I wanted to love this so badly. This is SOO oily. I’ve never used a SPF that is greasy. It just sits on the skin and doesn’t soak in. I do like that it doesn’t pill, leave a white cast or burn my eyes but I can only wear this with my hair pulled back tightly and when I know it’s not going to be windy otherwise my hair just gets stuck in it. Maybe this would be good for people with extremely dry skin but it just did not work for me. nan
