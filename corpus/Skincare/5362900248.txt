This is one of my favorite products and I really enjoyed using the wrinkle correcting serum to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles on my face. It feels sooting and calming when applied and I like how my dry skin feels after using it.I like that it has a long lasting hydrating feel to it also and would definitely buy it again.
