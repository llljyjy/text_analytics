So thick and creamy and feels like it truly locks in moisture! I live in CO where it’s extremely dry - finally feel like all of my dry patches are gone! My only complaint is this seems like it’s only going to last me two full months (using in Am and PM) - I might find something cheaper to use in the morning that has sunscreen in it instead. yes you want it!
