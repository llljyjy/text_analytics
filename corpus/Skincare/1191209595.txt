I don’t usually write reviews, but I absolutely love this product. I have very reactive, acne-prone skin and this is the ONLY moisturizer I will use. It’s super lightweight, gentle, and sinks in immediately on contact, so it feels like I’m wearing nothing at all. My skin feels smooth, hydrated, and bouncy after each use. It is also one of the few products that does not break me out no matter what, and has significantly improved my overall tone and texture. Love this product! Amazing for sensitive, acne-prone skin types!
