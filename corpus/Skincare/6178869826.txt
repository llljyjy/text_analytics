At the first time trying this cream out I was instantly hooked and impressed. I was being lazy and used hand soap to wash my face the night prior of using this for the first time. My face the next morning after using hand soap to wash it, it felt so dry and patchy. I was so mad at myself for doing that. Lol I used this to counteract that scaly skin of mine and it instantly fixed my face. I am so impressed and I am definitely adding this cream to my regular skincare routine. nan
