I can’t compare this to the original formulation but I’ve enjoyed this one so far. I like how hydrating it feels on the skin, and it absorbs pretty quickly. I use this on alternating days with a topical retinol as well and I feel like it does a good job to exfoliate. Doesn’t irritate the skin like other exfoliants. Softening and non-irritating
