I’ll admit, the first night I used A-Gloei, I overdid it. But because the product is so gentle, thisdidn’t lead to retinol burn— rather, an excessively greasy complexion for someone whose skin type is already oily. I learned my lesson, and for the following weeks, I discovered that I really only needed about five drops of oil for my entire face — one for each cheek, my forehead, nose and upper mouth area, and a final drop for my chin and neck.The first improvement I noticed in my skin upon the initial application is one I see every night immediately after applying and massaging in the oil: a plump, hydrated complexion. After five days, I began to see the long-term effects and benefits of using Drunk Elephant’s retinol. My hyperpigmentation faded, deep congestion and clogged pores dissipated, and when acne cleared up, it didn’t leave the usual dark spots behind in its wake. nan
