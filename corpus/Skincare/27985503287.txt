I love this moisturizer: it isn’t too thick and absorbs really well. You don’t feel it sitting on your skin. I feel like my skin changes and ’softens’ once I apply this. Seems really good for my dry patches and overall skin barrier. I love it for my night routine, but I’ve started testing this as my day moisturizer as well (under a light texture sunscreen) and have really been enjoying the results. I think it even improves make up application. I haven’t tested this during summer, though. I might be a little too ’rich’ for summer for me (since I have combo skin). My winter skin savior!
