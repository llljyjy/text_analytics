I’ve honestly never used this brand before, but I’m super grateful for the free trial and introduction. This has been an awesome moisturizer for my acne-prone skin since day one. I use it at night when I typically use chemical exfoliants. I was worried I would over-exfoliate my skin using this and an exfoliating toner. The salicylic acid is relatively low and the hyaluronic acid makes it moisturizing and not drying. The texture is so creamy, and silky smooth. I loved the way my skin looked in the morning. This definitely helped smooth my skin and help keep my pores clear.I didn’t know much about the benefits of Santorini Grapes, but after some research I found that it was high in fatty acids that help with the skin barrier and keeping the skin firm and smooth. It also contains an antioxidant known as Resveratrol, which can help with texture and evening skin tone.I definitely would buy the full version of this one! Great for Acne-prone Skin
