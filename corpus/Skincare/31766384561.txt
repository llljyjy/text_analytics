honestly i don’t kniw why people are saying that they don’t like the “taste” of this product cause your not supposed to eat at the first place.Second, it’s my favoris it does smell really nice,it’s smell like flower,roses it’s my favourite smell.I get it if you don’t like “strong’ smell don’t get this even if i find it really good and it does hydrate your lips. nan
