I received a sample of this product as part of an incentivized campaign in exchange for my honest review. I have oily/ combination skin with a tendency towards acne so I am always hesitant to try new moisturizers. This product felt very light weight and did not leave my skin feeling oily or weighed down. However as it was a sample size I only used the product as part of my routine for a couple of days but jt did not cause any outbreaks. nan
