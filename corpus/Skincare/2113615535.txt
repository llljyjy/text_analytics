I was so excited to try this one as Ole has some of my favorite skincare. It is light and is like gel in texture and kept my skin so glowy and hydrated throughout the day. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin or have any off-putting scent either. I always wish the packaging on this was different so I dont have to stick my fingers into it, but overall will be repurchasing and including in my staples. nan
