Wonderful spf daytime moisturizer and makeup primer! I’m 54 and use cc cream. I’ve been looking for a moisturizer with spf that wouldn’t pill under my cc cream. This is it. I couldn’t believe that an oil would work, but it does. My dry skin feels amazing, and no primer needed. Be aware that I don’t have large pores, just dry skin. I will absolutely buy again! finally found it!
