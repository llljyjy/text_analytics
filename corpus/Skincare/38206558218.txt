I had the worse patchy tan lines a week before a wedding. I applied this and two days later after two applications I looks like a normal human again. Check the photos for two days of comparison photos. Make sure you wear slippers or something because it will stain the bottom of your feet if you step on the floor, and make sure you moisturize yours hands, elbows and knees to avoid weird patches in those spots. Saved me from a wedding disaster!
