I received this product free to review from Influenster. I have also previously purchased this product. I should start by saying I have super sensitive skin.  I am in my 50’s and loved the idea of plumping up my fine lines.  I used the product for about two weeks and it worked wonderfully. My skin was glowing, I felt plumped and my fine lines looked fantastic. Unfortunately about 2 weeks in my face started to react to it and I had to stop using it. Believe it or not I would still highly recommend it to a friend. I loved the way it felt on my skin and how it made it look but I’m just too sensitive! So I would say it does make you skin look great and I felt with my dry skin it was the right amount of hydration and not too much! Great…but not for me!
