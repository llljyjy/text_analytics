I tried the Dr Zenovia Skincare Clear Complexion Acne Solutions System and couldn’t be happier. I have been using it for about a month and my skin is so clear. It had especially been effective during my hormonal acne. The scent is pleasant but it can be a little harsh. I don’t think I’d recommend for a simple pimple or sensitive skin. The moisturizer is great though. I recommend. Great product
