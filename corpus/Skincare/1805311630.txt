I was so excited to try this toner due to all the hype. I don’t believe I have sensitive skin - I’ve used products with all these ingredients before and even stronger like retinols or tret. This burns my skin if I add anything on top so I have to rewash my gave to relieve. Leaves skin feeling oily. Not a great smell. Doesn’t absorb. I tried a few more times as a last step to avoid the burning and still nothing. I’m so bummed I purchased this. Super overrated imo! I’d recommend trying Dr. Dennis Gross pads over this. They’re expensive but way more effective for me personally. nan
