So I love that this can be used on dry skin as a first cleanse, and then again on damp skin as a second cleanse! Really great for travel or if you just want one cleanser, but it doesn’t take off hardcore waterproof mascara.I’ve had the trial size for a month and a half now, and it’s still half full. A little goes a long way and it lasts for a long time. I don’t like the smell but it fades as you work it in. I do like how it didn’t break me out or irritate my skin. While this really cleanses the makeup off my face, everything but mascara, I won’t be buying the full size. It’s so foaming that it is hard to wash off, and it’s too easy to use too much. It’s also not very hydrating and my face feels a bit tight after use. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone but oily skin and only to use it once a day.I have combo skin and this is drying me out. 2.5 stars for effort
