I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I was skeptical of this product when I first got it as I didn’t think they would be very useful. I had a small pimple pop up on my forehead and put one of these on it before I went to bed. When I woke up it was still there albeit a little less angry looking. Decided to try it again for a second night and it extracted a lot of the oil/sebum out. It did take two patches to see any results and I don’t know how this would work for a larger pimple or more agressive breakout but I think I’ll keep these around for the odd blemish that pops up. It did flatten it out but I was still left with a red spot that I was able to cover with some concealer. Wish they came in various sizes within a pack. Works for Small Blemishes
