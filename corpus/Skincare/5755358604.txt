I originally wanted to go with vanilla because I wanted an everyday lip balm without adding tons of color to my lips. I ended up going into Sephora to see the shades in person and am so glad I did. I love the brown sugar! It’s so pretty and ends up being lighter once on your lips. It’s just enough color and gloss. Feels great on my lips and I’m so glad I saw this product. It will definitely be one I buy constantly. Just Love It!
