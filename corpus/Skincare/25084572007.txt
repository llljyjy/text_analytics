I had been needing a new clay mask and this one had just what I was looking for! The packaging is nice and sleek, and I think the cookies and cream look of the product is cute. The charcoal beads are pretty easy to break down and blend in as you smooth the mask on your face. There is no harsh tightening feeling as this mask dries. I like how soft and smooth my skin feels after I wash the mask off, and I always look forward to using it. nan
