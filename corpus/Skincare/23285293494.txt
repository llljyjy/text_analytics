I love everything about this product and it also smells very good! This SPF is lightweight, non-greasy and it gives you a beautiful glow.  My skin is on the dry side and it felt hydrated and protected. I did not experienced any breakout or redness.  I re-applied the product every 2-3 hours and it never felt heavy on my skin. Ps. wear this SPF after your normal skincare routine.   I would definitely recommend this product to my friends! nan
