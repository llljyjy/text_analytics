My process for trying any skincare product is to use only that product and to use it consistently for 4 weeks.  After 4 weeks with this cream I can say but I can say that my skin is certainly very well hydrated. I do not have any blemishes and I did not get any acne from this product. I like the texture of it. The packaging is sturdy and well made with a beautiful octagonal jar. I do have dry skin lately and I am in my late thirties.  Some things I would be concerned about with this product are the heavy fragrance and some of the ingredients are not for everyone.  Neither of those things bothered me in the slightest. I truly enjoyed this moisturizer and would honestly purchase it for myself. A little bit goes a long way. It performs really well under makeup and and worked well too well to generally hydrate the skin. I did not notice any reduction in fine lines or hyperpigmentation.  With a 12 month shelf life, the cream will last a long time.  I definitely will recommend this to my friends who have very dry skin and those who want something to place underneath foundation.
