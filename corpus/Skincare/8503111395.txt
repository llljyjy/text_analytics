I spent my money on this and it is terrible! I have an important day planned today but have to send my husband to go out and buy the eraser. It’s streaky and the mist sprays everywhere and all over the floor. My legs looks terrible. I’m so so upset. I really wanted to love this. It doesn’t dry down and transferred to my sheets. I felt sticky all night. Just a big bummer. If I can find a way to use it I’ll update the review. nan
