Weary after reading negative reviews regarding sensitive skin but glad I tried it. This gives a nice glowy touch when I use 4 drops with my moisturizer. I donâ€™t notice a scent. My skin is prone to blackhead and breakouts when using self tanning but products but I experienced none with this. (Unlike St Tropez face mist). There is not a ton of color but perfect for me who just wants to feel sun kissed in the winter months. nan
