Iâ€™ve been using this product for several weeks and its been doing wonders for my skin. It gives a good lather and provides a nice sensation after rinsing. I also love the smell as it smells like chocolate and vanilla. It also is a large product with alot of uses left for it so its worth the price as well. A staple for your washing routine
