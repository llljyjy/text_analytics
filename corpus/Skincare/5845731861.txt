I ordered a small sample size from Sephora, just to try it. I have oily skin and it’s difficult to find a moisturizer that doesn’t break me out, while not looking greasy on the skin. Two days after using it, my skin looked SMOOTH! No bumps , just smooth skin. My face was not oily. Sure, after a few hours, naturally your oil from your face will peak through. However, my face was matter for a longer period. Overall, this moisturizer is simple beautiful! Highly recommend it MUST HAVE!
