Lightweight and save for sensitive skin!  I wear Ilia Skin Tint in Baikal (winter) to Porto Fero (summer).  I tried Tone 2 first but it was too dark.  Tone 1 is perfect!  So glad to have a daily sunscreen that I can wear even when I donâ€™t want to look as made up.  Ilia Skin Tint and this new Triple Serum are healing my skin and taking years off! Lightweight & Natural
