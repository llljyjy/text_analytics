I have pretty moderate-to-severe redness in my cheeks due to rosacea so I am always looking for something to help color correct and soothe my skin. I was very excited to try this but unfortunately it didnâ€™t do much of anything for me. I was not expecting miracles but I have found a similar product that does so much more for my redness. This also leaves me looking like a greasy mess. I will continue to use it as basically a sunscreen under my make up but I will definitely not repurchase. nan
