This serum has been really effective for my skin! After around a week of me first using this it made my skin barrier resilient. I was able to treat acne spots without fear of irritation or dryness! I went a month off to test out CeraVe’s serum. I quickly was disappointed in switching!! As soon as the cerave ran out I immediately ordered this. My skin is finally back to resilience again. It’s light and clear on the skin but so powerful for me! It helps me battle the combo skin issues. Perfect for my Combo Skin
