Not sticky like most other glosses and has a very mild but slightly sweet marshmallow scent that I love! Definitely on the pricey side and still up in the air if I’ll repurchase because of the price but so far I am really loving it! Haven’t noticed much of a plumping effect and the hole where the gloss comes out wasn’t letting a lot out so I took a fork and opened the hole up more so it has a better flow. But otherwise it’s my go-to gloss at the moment! Pricey for a clear gloss but my new fav!
