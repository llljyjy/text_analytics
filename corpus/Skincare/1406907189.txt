I love to layer my spf and this is perfect for that! It’s lightweight and doesn’t leave behind a greasy feeling. It has a slight tint. Doesn’t leave a white cast and gives the skin a slight glow. I love that this combines both spf and retinol which are the best anti aging ingredients you could use for your skin. If you have dry skin, I suggest applying a moisturizer first. If you’re an spf or skincare lover this is a must have! Must have for any skincare lover!
