I’m happy I’ve bought this product. I was skeptical reading negative reviews, but decided to give it a chance. Very good product! My lips get flaky after using lipsticks and glosses especially at winter time. This product can heel my lips over night. It has a very pleasant light candy scent and condition the lips with a quality of a good mask. Highly recommend! Great Quality!
