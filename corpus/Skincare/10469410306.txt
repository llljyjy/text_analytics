SHISEIDO CREAM REVIEW A few weeks ago I received this Shiseido cream Essential energy“. Hidratyng day cream: hialuronic acid red con spf de 20. I think it’s creamy and it left my skin very well hydrated (I used it as a solar protector, so just a little more that would be used as a hydrating cream). I could have easily continued using it because I loved the texture and with more uses I know that my skin would have been very well hydrated while at the same time be well protected, the only problem was that the scent was too strong for me, it was like I was wearing perfume (I don’t use because I cannot tolerate strong fragrances) it lasted all day long that’s why I had to stop using it. If you are a person that is sensible to strong smells I would not recommend it for you, but if this is not an issue than i believe this product could work for you! nan
