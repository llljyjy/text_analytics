This is a good moisturizer but it didn’t blow my mind. I have normal to dry skin and this worked better for me as a day cream versus night. This is very lightweight and hydrating but I prefer something heavier at night. I think people with normal, combination or oily skin would like this moisturizer. Overall it did the trick, but it wasn’t life changing! Good Moisturizer, Not Great
