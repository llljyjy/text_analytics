After using this product I think I have found a new addition to my skin care routine. At first it did make my skin a little itchy but I do have very sensitive skin and I think it was just taking some time for my skin to adjust. I did see a huge change in the appearance of my skin in regards to my acne scars they started to go away and a lot of the dark spots on my skin were also starting to fade. This product really has made it way into my heart. When used consistently it will literally make your skin look amazing! I don’t worry about using as much makeup anymore and I’m so happy! NEW FAVE!
