It’s a nice lightweight retinal and niacinamide serum. It does leave a slight yellow tint, but that’s because the serum is yellow so I’d expect it. I use it at night and I have to remind myself that I already put it on because it’s that lightweight and natural feeling. It doesn’t make my skin feel like I put any thick serum on it. It has not irritated my skin since using it and I’ve noticed a small improvement with evening my skin tone after a couple weeks of using it. Nice lightweight serum
