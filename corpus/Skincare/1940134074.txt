This cream is very nice and moisturizing. I used it during the day and at night and it was fine for both times. It worked well under makeup and didn’t break down my foundation or make it look cakey. At night I would use a little bit more than during the day and you can kind of feel it on your skin but not in a bad way. It can be a little tacky if you touch it after using a lot. I did have two small breakouts along my jaw after starting to use this cream but they weren’t bad and could just be from switching moisturizers. I was amazing with how much it seemed to fade old acne scars on my cheeks. The scars had been there for maybe a year and were very noticeable without makeup on and this cream really faded them after the first two weeks. My only real complaint is about how it’s packaged. I’m not sure why skin creams come in jars like this. It seems so unhygienic. I have long nails so I have to use a tiny spatula from a face mask to get it out of the jar so the product doesn’t get stuck under my nails. It would be a lot better if it was sold in a bottle with a pump or maybe a tube with a pump so you can more easily get the same amount of product each time. The scent of the product is nice and not too strong but I can smell it on my face for maybe an hour after applying. The amount you get in the jar seems like it will last for several months. I would recommend this to family and friends and I would buy it again if my budget allowed for it. Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer
