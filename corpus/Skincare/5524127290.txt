wasn’t expecting much from this moisturizer, but omg it’s one of the best i’ve ever used. i suffered from horribly textured skin, and this has helped completely smooth my skin out. i cant recommend more. the hyaluronic acid does WONDERS. this moisturizer is great to apply before primer/foundation. buying a 2nd bottle soon! incredible for the price
