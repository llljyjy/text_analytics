My first impression of this eye cream was I loved the texture, it’s very different from eye creams I have used in the past. I received a sample size product to test and review. The first few times I wore this, I did notice some tingling on my skin but it went away pretty quickly. Pros - love the texture, feels nice going on, seems very hydrating. Cons - does not absorb super fast, if you wear it in the morning it will cause your eye makeup to run. Overall, I think it’s a good eye cream but not a miracle worker. I didn’t see the drastic changes it claims from week to week - see picture. Although, after the first week, I only used it at night because it was causing my eye makeup to run during the day. Just ok
