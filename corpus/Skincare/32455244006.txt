I am 44 w/dry to combination skin on my face.  I have swore by clinique and glossier creams, among others, for many many years.. My skin always felt dry regardless of how much lotion I put on until Tatcha. I have to be honest and say if you can’t buy the face wash to go with the cream you’re really missing out as I was until recently. I hope it helps just one person to not feel like their face will never feel quenched or youthful again. Phenomenal forehead relief!
