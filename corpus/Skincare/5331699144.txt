I received a full sized sample of the Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer in return for an honest review.  I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I have to say I’m not to impressed with it.  The main thing I disliked about it was it’s scent.  To me the scent is far to strong for a facial moisturizer.  It’s definitely a rose floral scent, and reminded me of an old lady.  It did leave my skin soft and supple, but I honestly didn’t notice any difference with my fine lines.  For the price, I would have expected to see a little bit more of a difference with my fine lines and the appearance of my skin.I felt the consistency was a little to thick for my liking, but a tiny bit did go a long way.My recommendation would be to save your money, and buy something you and your skin really loves. Unscented may have been better
