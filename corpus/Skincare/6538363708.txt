I received this product for free to review. I’m giving this product 4/5 stars only because it does have a slight scent which I personally don’t mind, and actually it makes the product more enjoyable to me! I know that some people are bothered by scent so 4/5 stars for that reason. Apart from that this product is great, the pump gives the perfect amount of product for one full face/neck use. I have noticed my scars are disappearing slowly but surely, and this is only after about 3 weeks so that’s great! The packaging is nice, the cream is not oily but thick enough for cold winter temps and the dry skin associated with that, and the price really doesn’t scare me away because after use 2x a day for the last 3 weeks I’ve barely made a dent so I think this product will last a long time, making the price worthwhile. I would buy this product, and I have even looked into other Tula products because this company has captured my attention, and being female owned is a very cool bonus!! beautiful product!
