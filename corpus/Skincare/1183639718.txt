I really wanted to like this cleanser since I use Dior makeup and fragrances. The smell of the face wash is similar to Miss Dior but it’s very overwhelming since it’s going all over your face. This just didn’t work for my sensitive skin as it caused a burning sensation and in turn caused my skin to dry out. Want to treat yourself to dior…I recommend diorshow mascara or miss dior! Let down
