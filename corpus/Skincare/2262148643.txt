I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for an honest review.  I’ve been using this in rotation with the waterproof version based on what my day was like over the last month. It seems effective, has a gentle fragrance, and also hasn’t caused any issues with my recently diagnosed rosacea. If it weren’t for the price, I’d purchase this regularly. Great but pricey
