First thing I’ll say is that it smells amazing! Like oranges. I like using it on my hands too because of the way it smells. (I read someone else’s review and they said they used it on their hands before bed, so I started doing it as well - loved the idea.)I have a combination normal/oily skin type and this works well during the winter months all over. But I find that it’s a little too heavy for my oily areas to use in the summer. Other than that, it sinks right in and leaves me feeling soft and hydrated. The smell does fade, so no worries about the heavy orange smell lingering for too long. I only gave it four stars because it is a vitamin C brightening moisturizer but I can’t say I have seen any brightening that I can attribute to this product alone. But I enjoy using it nevertheless. Sometimes it’s more about the sensorial experience than the end result. Lol. An Orange Smoothie for your Face and Hands
