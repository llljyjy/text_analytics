I bought mine a few months ago and I am still loving it! It is awesome to sleep on, keeps my head cool. I have long hair and I wake up and it is not frizzy in the morning. I do fall asleep with makeup on sometimes and I have not seen any transfer on my pillow. I would buy this again, itâ€™s pure luxury! nan
