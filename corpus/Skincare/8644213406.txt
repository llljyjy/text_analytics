This makeup remover left my skin feeling very clean. It did not leave any sort of a residue on my skin and took the makeup off very easily. I have sensitive skin and did not have any issues with this makeup remover. I felt like it left my skin cleaner than other makeup removers and took off the makeup very easily. I would highly recommend this product and will be buying it again. Clean and Effective
