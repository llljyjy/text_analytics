Another spectacular product from YTTP! I have missed the kale, spinach, hyaluronic acid serum that was discontinued.  The triple peptide serum is an amazing replacement.  I am in my mid 40s and have used YTTP religiously since 2019.  I look much younger than my age and love that YTTP makes clean products with trusted ingredients.  This serum makes my skin more plump and supple as well as moisturizes well for those of us suffering through winter.  This is a part of my daily routine and I just love it.  I saw results the next day. Perfect for Skin of All Ages
