I received this complimentary from Josie Maran. One of my new favorite sunscreens, one for the purse for sure! The packaging is very nice, very luxe. It’s a sturdy dark tinted glass with a very convenient pump applicator, only one to two pumps needed. It has a very light natural scent, no artificial fragrance. The formula is full of naturally derived and organic ingredients such as Josie Marans famous organic argan oil. It’s a very lightweight, milky texture that melts into the skin. It doesn’t leave a white cast or greasy feeling, it’s very comfortable. Skin looks glowy, hydrated, and bright after use, a huge plus! nan
