After using up an entire tube, I didn’t notice any change in my dark eye circles, but it is hydrating and didn’t give me any problems at least. And the metal top is nice and cooling. There is a very inconspicuous shimmer that gives an initial brightening effect, but didn’t prove to be a long term solution for me. Still, for the price, I think it’s worth a try! Not my journey
