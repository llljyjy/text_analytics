I actually really like this product- not sure why it has so many bad reviews!I layer it under, not over, the supergoop spf 40 moisturizer and use the supegoop resetting mist every two hours. It leaves a glowy finish, but not extremely so (as pictured below) and makes my dry skin feel very nourished. Will repurchase this product once I run out. really great for dry, non-acne prone skin!
