This one is a mixed bag and the results will vary depending on your skin type or your preferences or the weather. Go for it if you have normal or oily skin- should be good for any weather.if you have extremely dry skin like me, this one is only good enough for the summer or spring. Application: The product is nice, smooth and luxurious and feels cool on the skin. You will definitely enjoy it when you apply, and feel a softness. The problem is that once you have finished applying, it absorbs so fast that you do not even feel you have any product of moisturizer on your face - you have to go back and apply more and more and in the end you end up applying a lot with each application. Therefore, the tub will get over fast if you use it daily- that’s why the price is relatively low. I’d rather use the Laneige Water Bank cream even for sleeping. I bought the mini, but not repurchasing for my dry skin. Mixed feelings
