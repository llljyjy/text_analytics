Quick disclaimer. I’ve only used this one time. But I do drag. Which means I use enough makeup in one evening to last a “regular” person for a year. This stuff MELTS makeup off your face. I sprayed it, and the makeup literally just came running off my face and vem before I wiped it. I did follow up with one of the makeup wipes from this brand (which I also love! They are HUGE!) usually it takes some scrubbing to get the eyeliner and glue (yes, actual Elmer’s glue) off my face, but this spray made it so simple. You. Need. This.
