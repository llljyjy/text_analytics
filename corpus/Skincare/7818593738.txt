This product is actually good. I received this product free for review. It is on the thicker so have to use very little. I use it for a few days and it has started to do its job. Love the little compact container it is in. I say if you want to correct those wrinkles go get you some. This product helped the bags under my eyes slightly go away, and my skin was smooth. Donâ€™t use to much of it though. nan
