I’m grateful to have been sent the Caudalie Firming Cashmere Cream for free in exchange for my review. I’ve been using this in the morning before applying sunscreen. I think it has been making my skin a bit more firm looking and I really like the ingredients in this. I like the scent of it too. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox I'm a fan!
