I received this as a free gift from Sephora.  I used this with a foaming cleanser. I didn’t necessarily think that it made my face any smoother but this is a good tool to distribute the cleanser on the face evenly with a slight massage. I like how there’s 2 different materials on the brush, the silicone part does seem to help remove the makeup. The case is nice for this product as it makes it portable and great for travel or for the gym bag. Great manual cleansing brush
