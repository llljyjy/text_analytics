I received this for free fromInfluenster in exchange for my honest review I have dry sensitive skin. This spray produces a very fine light mist that you can control how much you want. Dewey refreshing and stays on. I also like to spray it on my neck and décolletage. The fragrance is light that I don’t find it overpowering or irritating. It keeps my skin dewy and glowing and I would purchase in the future when it runs out. Perfect for summer
