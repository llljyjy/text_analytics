I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to review. The sample was too small so unfortunately I cannot comment on its long term effectiveness. But the serum was very light and absorbed quickly into my skin. I liked the scent was not too overpowering. The serum itself felt very luxurious on my skin. I think it would be ideal for anyone looking for some anti - aging skincare. Luxurious serum
