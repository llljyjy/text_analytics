I’ve repurchased this several times. It’s excellent to keep the skin hydrated, especially during the winter. I use a few drops with my moisturizer when my skin feels especially dry, after the TLC serum and after my weekly DE TLC Sukari Babyfacial, and it leaves my face so soft but not oily. When my hands are very dry, I mix a few drops with my hand lotion. My husband likes to use it as beard oil, and I must say his facial hair is very soft.It’s a bit on the expensive side, but it lasts for so long! I’ve never had a bottle gone bad. nan
