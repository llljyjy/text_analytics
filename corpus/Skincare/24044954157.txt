Anything that I get from Sephora I do find is very good however this was one of those ho-hum items. Would I buy it again probably not the pump got stuck a few times, I wasnâ€™t too keen on the smell. Although I do find it is lasting a long time and I do use it every day. So maybe I am too quick to jump the gun to say I will never buy it again. Ho-hum not good but not bad
