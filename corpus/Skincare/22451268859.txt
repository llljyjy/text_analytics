I have been using vitamin c for about a year now and this is probably the best serum I have tried. It is very light and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky feeling on your face after you apply it. Also a little goes a long way when it come to this product because it applies so easily. Highly recommend! Will def be using this in my everyday routine compared to the one I had before. Non sticky application
