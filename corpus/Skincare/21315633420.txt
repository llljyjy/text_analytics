I’ve used this stuff before when I had active acne and it didn’t do much for me. So I went and did my first round of ACCUTANE now that I’m done with it I’m left with scars, dark spots and indentations I work for a plastic surgeons office as a nurse and of course was offered a free chemical peel.. but I don’t need something that harsh. After much research I decided to give this another go except this time around I don’t have any active acne just the after math of it! Looking through all the pictures of the before and after on the reviews here gives me hope that one day I too will have clear skin once again. So I started my first box yesterday my first treatment went well I love the smell and the tingling feeling affect it had on my face after that I applied some vitamin c gel cream which I heard is the best time to apply for better absorption! So naturally this morning I woke up my face feeling amazing and looking fresh and plum! Pretty excited to keep going although I do worry if I do keep up my routine as I do have to work long hours and come home tired but now I’ve made it my mission to complete the whole box and prove the surgeons wrong that I don’t need a chemical peel so wish me luck and fingers crossed better than chemical peel?
