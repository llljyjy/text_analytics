God I love this. Itâ€™s definitely oil based. I finished my bottle and then bought a cheaper one. I recently got some samples and need to buy this again. I normally use it at night and when I wake up my face is glowing. It has helped with redness as well. I love the smell too. It smells like weed and flowers. nan
