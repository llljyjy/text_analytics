I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. And wow!! I absolutely loved this lip mask. Usually, I’m a chapstick girl, not even Vaseline is moisturizing enough for me. But I was blown away but the moisturizing abilities of this lip mask! It feels soft and delicate on my lips, but coats them in a nice, shiny layer of moisture. The dispenser is a bit strange - I think I’m supposed to pick it up with my finger then put it on my lips, which works great! But you could probably just rub it directly on your lips. Also, it takes FOREVER for the first little bit to come out of the dispenser. I think I must’ve clicked it like 40 times, so just be patient. I just didn’t wanna waste any of this amazing product! I also can’t get over the smell of this product! It smells just like sugar cookies! When I put this on before bed I wake up with cushion soft, supple lips. 10/10, highly recommend! Better than any other lip mask!
