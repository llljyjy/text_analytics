I just started incorporating retinoid into my nightly routine and I’m so glad I found this from PTR. I’m starting to use it once or twice a week and so I’m glad it doesn’t burn. My skin feels more plump after use so I’ll continue to use few times a week.Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare nan
