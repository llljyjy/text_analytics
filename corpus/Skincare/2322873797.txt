I personally did not really enjoy this product. I do suffer from dry skin but when I applied this I felt like I had a layer of olive oil on my face. I felt like my pores would get clogged and suffer from a massive breakout. I have no doubt that this product works amazingly on othersâ€™ skin types but it was just not for mine! Def worth a good ole try
