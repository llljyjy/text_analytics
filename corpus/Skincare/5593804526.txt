I received this product a few weeks ago, the truth is that the result was not surprising, because almost all Estee Lauder products are match very well with my skin, I used it in a week, I applied twice a day, before using it my face was so dry because the cold weather, my skin bow feels soothed fresh and moisturized, I little jar was very small, so I’m assuming was a sample size, the normal size brings 1.7 onz, it’s not cheap, I don’t know if I will pay  almost 90 dollars for that, but the product works.
