So this product arrived about a week ago and I have been  integrating this product in my morning and evening routine and I’m so glad I did. This vitamin c serum is non irritating to my combo sensitive skin. Never did I begin to purge with acne or get those small bumps on my skin so far. A few of my acne scars have definitely began to fade! I’m so excited to see these long term effects. I’m also in love with the twist pump packaging!! Top Tier Vitamin C Serum!!!
