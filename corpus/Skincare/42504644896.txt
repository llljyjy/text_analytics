I love this mask! I always had cracked dry skin around the edges of my lips and nose but ever since I started using this after my moisturizer before sleeping, I wake up with fresh, glowy and hydrated skin. It doesnâ€™t give a lot of moisture to a point where your skin gets oily, I think it gives the perfect amount of moisture needed - for my combination-type skin at least! Love waking up with glowy and hydrated skin!
