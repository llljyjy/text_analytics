I received a sample size from Influenster, and I was super excited to try this. It is a thick, rich moisturizer but it doesn’t leave me oily. It absorbs really well and makes your skin feel supple. I noticed slight pore minimization upon application, but I haven’t used it long enough to notice long-term effects. Even if it doesn’t minimize your pores, I really enjoy this moisturizer. I see other people are using it as primers and I am going to try that because it seems like it would work well for that. A+
