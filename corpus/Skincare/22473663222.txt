I received this product from Influenster to review and provide my honest opinion. I am so glad that I did, I am a huge fan! I love the bottle it comes in, it’s so convenient to administer the perfect amount to use and feels less wasteful than your average moisturizer container. It’s extremely light cream, doesn’t leave you feeling excessively shiny or waiting for the cream to dry. It’s an excellent base for makeup and for evening skin care. I have noticed a great improvement in the dark spots around my eyes and in my skins texture. It has an extremely light citrus scent that I’m also a huge fan of. I had never before tried probiotic skin care but am so glad that I have now! Will forever be a staple in my skin care routine! Huge fan!!
