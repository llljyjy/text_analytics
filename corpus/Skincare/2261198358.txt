I have combination skin thatâ€™s dry in the morning and becomes oily as the day progresses. I find exfoliating 2 times a week helps balance my skin well. The foamless formula was gentle leaving my face clean but not as smooth as what I normally use. The scent was not pleasant. It reminded me of a cleaning agent I would use when cleaning the bathroom. It never got better even after a few uses. I still prefer my other exfoliating paste over this one. Due to the scent and less than desirable smoothness post use I would not recommend this product. Unpleasant scent
