Somehow this seems to really help my redness! I have rosacea and it is so hard to find products geared towards that. But I’ve found this spray has really helped redness for that and around any acne/irritations my skin also has. Any comments about the smell - yeah sure it does sort of smell like a pool but it quickly dissipates, especially since you have to let it dry and then you layer on top of it. It works so that’s all I care about. new holy grail!
