I love the idea of reusable cotton rounds so I picked these up during the sale. I got a round wet with remover and used the soft side of it to take off eye makeup, cotton came off of it into my eye. I donâ€™t recommend using the soft side of it near your eyes and they seem to be falling apart just after one use. disappointed and going back to disposables from walmart. great concept, poor product
