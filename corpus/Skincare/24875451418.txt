I love this cleansing balm! It has a nice light scent and you don’t need to apply much. I find it gets all of my makeup off with ease. Also, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft after. The best part, is that I can use a wash cloth to remove my makeup and not disposable wipes or cotton pads, so it’s environmentally friendly. Favourite Makeup Remover
