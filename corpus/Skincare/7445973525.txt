You might be thinking: will adding sunscreen to my morning & face every few hours really make that much of a difference? I’m here to tell you: it absolutely will. My skin is on the dry/oily side depending on the time of year- but in the winter my skin wants to match the intensity of the frigid cold snow and crumble away like that granola bar you forgot is in the bottom of your bag as a safety snack. It’s not cute friends, not cute. The unseen sunscreen revitalizes my skin & lets me have peace of mind that it’s protected from not only the blazing rays of the sun- but also adds a little extra punch of hydration so that I know that despite my genetics- there’s an improved chance of my skin looking younger for longer. I cannot recommend this product enough! I apply it after washing, toning, adding my serum, and moisturizing to really lock in the moisture. It’s comfortable under makeup & doesn’t affect the texture of my BB cream. I use Supergoop!’s mineral powder to reapply sunscreen after a few hours if I am wearing makeup- otherwise if I’m not I’ll slather this on again and hit my face with a lil setting spray to feel fancy. It’s worth the money! I’m inconsistent (despite my dedication to not look like a dried up raisin) so the full sized version will last me two months. As an added bonus: You can ALSO recycle the bottle after you’ve used all of the product so you aren’t contributing to landfills while trying to keep ya skin fresh. (I may have imagined that last part but I’m nearly 87.5% sure you can recycle the type of plastic through some method or another). 15/10- recommend You bet this product saved my skin
