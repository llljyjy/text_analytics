So very disappointed. I had a coconut lip scrub last winter that I absolutely loved. I thought it was the sephora one so for boxing day I ordered 3 of the vanilla lip scrubs thinking $5 each (reg $10).... SCORE. Well my order arrived today and I have never been more disappointed in my life, except for maybe that one time.... with that one guy..... but I digress. Anyway this has literally no scrub to it at all and because it has the texture and taste of a wax candle it won’t even work as a lip Balm. So now I’m stuck with three tubes of wax that vaguely smells like vanilla. I might use it on my ski’s this winter since that’s about all it’s good for. Disappointing to say the least.
