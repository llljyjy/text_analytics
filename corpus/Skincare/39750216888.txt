I would recommend this serum because it does what is says it will do. It reduces the fine lines on the face. I paired this #freeproduct by #topbox with clinique smart repair cream for face and for eye. My face really looked plump, more firm and very hydrated. The serum absorbed into my skin immediately and my skin didnâ€™t feel greasy. I also noted that while I was using this my face looked well rested in the morning and got a couple of compliments which made me extremely happy. Highly recommended!
