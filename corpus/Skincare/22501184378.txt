I love Shisheido skin care and this did not disappoint.  I have worn it alone on my face when I hunt and fish. Plus is that when I perspire it doesnâ€™t irritate my eyes.  Reasonably priced and very effectve..8 hrs kayaking on the river and my face was the only part not burned (I forgot to put on my ears).  I found using my normal moisturizer not necessary under makeup. Blends easily and would definitely recommend. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Would buy !
