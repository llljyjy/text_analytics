I purchased a bottle of this to add to my morning skincare routine. I have normal skin that is rarely oily and not acne prone. After about three weeks of using this I noticed my face was getting oilier and oilier by the day and i was getting small whiteheads all over it. I didnâ€™t have any other changes in my routine or in my eating habits so I decided to research the ingredient list on this product. Propylene Glycol is the second ingredient and it is straight up alcohol. The majority of this spray is water and freaking ALCOHOL!! This was making my face dry which made my skin produce extra sebum to compensate for what was lost and the whiteheads are a result of the irritating alcohol. I will never again purchase anything from this brand and will be more careful about researching ingredients before I purchase new products. Avoid at all costs!!
