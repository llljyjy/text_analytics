I really love how this lotion makes my sensitive, dry skin feel. It does an amazing job at keeping my skin hydrated too. I’ve never tried a product like this but I’m definitely adding it apart of my daily skin care routine. My pores also kind of have been looking smaller over the course of the time that I’ve been using it. nan
