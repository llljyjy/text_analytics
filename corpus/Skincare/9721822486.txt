I bought this because I wanted a good quality lip balm and I’ll likely be repurchasing it. It’s really moisturizing and actually feels like it’s being absorbed by your lips rather than just sitting on top. I took off a star because the packaging feels a little cheap but overall I recommend it Great formulation, worth the price
