This is not worth the cost. The packaging is terrible, it’s very difficult to get the product out. The cleanser is really thick formula. Doesn’t do a great job of removing makeup, I still have to double cleanse by using a oil based cleanser first. Only positive is the nice scent. not worth it- hard to get product out
