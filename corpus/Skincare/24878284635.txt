I love how supple this cream makes my skin feel. I don’t have sensitive skin so I like fragrance creams and this one has a very light scent. It’s not overpowering at all. What I can say sticks out the most is that my skin looked so refreshed after a couple of nights of use. Definitely recommend!! This is so luxe!
