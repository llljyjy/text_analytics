got a mini size of this in a Christmas holiday kit, and i’m not really that impressed? i’ve tried a ton of clay mask to help with my pores lately, and i find this one a TON of product to make it opaque, and honestly i don’t see any difference in my skin afterwards. i keep seeing reviews of people with dry sensitive skin have a huge reaction to this and i almost wonder if i got a bad batch because it does absolutely nothing for me.. it does smell really good though, but thats it. meh..
