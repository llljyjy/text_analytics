Using Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum has been a great experience for me so far. I have been using it consistently for about two weeks and have noticed a definite improvement in my skins texture, along with lightening of my age spots. It comes in two separate containers that you mix, which was new to me, but wasn’t an issue. The scent is very light amd not at all overpowering. I am happy with the results so far from just a couple of weeks use, and look forward to seeing if I have more improvement of fine lines and wrinkles as time goes on. Kiehl's Fast Release Retinol Serum
