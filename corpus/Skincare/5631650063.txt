I received this product for free in exchange for my opinion. It’s my first time using this brand and honestly I didn’t think too much of it. It’s a nice creamy and smooth consistency that I used around my eyes before bed. I only used it a few nights each week but haven’t really seen a difference yet. I have used other eye creams in the past which I liked better. First timer
