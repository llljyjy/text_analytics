I love this cream. I have rosacea and not many products help with redness when my skin is flaring. This helped over the winter. I really wish that we could get the indigo cream in Canada because I would buy it! I do not use this every night - rather whenever my skin needs some extra love. I usually do not pair with any serums or oil and just let it do itâ€™s job. I would recommend this for people with sensitive skin. It is splurge but worth it. nan
