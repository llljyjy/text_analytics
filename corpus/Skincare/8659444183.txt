I received the Clinique Wrinkle Correct Seurm sample from #topboxcircle.  This is not like the product your mom use to use back in the day.  I found it left my skin feeling soft and supple.  I personally used this product prior to bed as I already use a day time serum.  But if you are looking to start a skin routine or looking for something else I would highly recommend giving this a try nan
