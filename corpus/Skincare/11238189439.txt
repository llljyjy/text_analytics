This sunscreen has no white cast which is awesome and it’s lightweight and non-greasy. The packaging is pretty easy to use. I just use one pump. However, if you put a lot of product on your face it does feel irritating. I put three finger lengths of sunscreen once and my skin was irritated that day. I’m guessing because this is a mineral sunscreen the product doesn’t get absorbed by the skin and physically blocks. That’s why one pump of product is good. One pump of the product also covers my entire face. So just keep in mind how much to use and you will love this! nan
