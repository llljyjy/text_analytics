I thought this product is very nice, though, I feel like I would have needed a longer time to sample this product. My initial thoughts of the product was that the packaging was very nice, I love that you can get refills, which is very eco-friendly, I love that! The product applied nicely to my skin that I noticed said it took a little bit of time for it to absorb, leaving my skin, feeling a little bit oily for a few hours. My skin did feel very soft after which I loved. The only negative thing I could say is the way it made my skin feel after. I usually have very dry sensitive skin . nan
