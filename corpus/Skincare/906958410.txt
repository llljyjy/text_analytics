I got a sample of the goop and loved it so I ordered it online. When I received the container it wasnâ€™t full so I was skeptical about the product.  I am not a nitpick but when I am dropping $125, I expect to get what I paid for. I pulled out my scale and scooped out every last bit and the weight said 1.55 oz. Not happy. nan
