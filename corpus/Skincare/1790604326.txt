I was so happy to receive this eye cream from Influenster for my honest review because I am already a huge fan of Estée Lauder and the Advanced Night Repair skincare line! This gel cream has a bit of a thicker consistency, but is very soft. It is definitely gel like and blends in very nicely. I have been using this for about a month and have noticed a softer texture under my eyes. I got a little bit of sun last weekend right under my left eye, which left a slightly scaly patch that hurt, and this eye cream was soothing. I haven’t noticed much difference yet in fine lines however and it is on the pricier end. Soothing Gel Eye Cream
