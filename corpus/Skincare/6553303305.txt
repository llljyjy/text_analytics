I was pleasantly surprised by IT cosmetics Secret Sauce. I have been using gel facial moisturizers for so long I forgot how nice a cream was. It had no odor, absorbed super quickly, and kept my skin in great shape. At fist because it was so light and absorbed so fast I did not think it would hold up against the winter cold and wind, but it does! After using it for 7 days I am in love. I am so glad to have tested this and look forward to continuing to use it. Great Product!
