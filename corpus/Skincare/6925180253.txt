I was so excited to try a “cloud“ cream and opening the jar it didn’t disappoint. The texture in the jar is very cloud like and fluffy but once you apply this to the skin it’s very thick and almost sticky. After patting this into my skin, it’s super soft and hydrated. Not tacky at all. I love this cream when I do retinol treatments because it’s very soothing and nourishing. So far, I love this as a night cream and it works really well with intense exfoliation. Very rich and nourishing
