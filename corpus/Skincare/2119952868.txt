Iv’e been using this oil serum for a week now and its a nice face serum . Feel lightweight on the skin . And I like that it doesn’t  break me out . I have oily skin and this doesn’t make my skin extra oily which is nice . I like how moisturized my skin feels and it leaves you looking very glowy . Works good on oily skin
