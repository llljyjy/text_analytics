I have extremely sensitive and dry skin due to Lupus and Sjögren’s, but this didn’t bother my skin at all. It goes on well and my skin just soaks it in. It leaves my skin looking excellent and healthy, and with no fragrance! Compared to similar products, this also has a good price point. I use the Innbeauty Slushy (retinol alternative) that is also excellent. My skin is gorgeous, and my dermatologist can’t believe I’m 35 with so few wrinkles and glowing/hydrated skin. Definitely recommend! Great for Sensitive & Dry Skin
