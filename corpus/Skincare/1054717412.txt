I love the idea of a cold mask! This one, however, doesn’t offer much cold. There’s very few areas with the cooling beads + the few metal pressure point dots. Thus, it doesn’t stay cold long at all - I’m talking maybe 5 minutes. I used it 2x and returned it because it was an expensive “eh“ and bought a $10 cold pack face mask instead which stays colder longer. Like others said, the nose and mouth openings are odd sizes, too. The straps were a smart design; one goes around your head and the other under your chin to connect on the top of your head to hold the mask in place. Great idea poorly executed
