Love this cleanser!  It is super smooth and silky, and removes all of my make up without tugging or pulling.  I can also use this with my Foreo.  It doesn’t bubble up a lot, but it’s sudsy/milky enough to use with the Foreo.  It is super convenient as I can just remove all of my make up in the shower with this and I don’t even have to use cotton pads with eye make up remover first.  Yay for eco friendliness!  I have acne prone/oily skin and this cleanser didn’t break me out.  I researched the ingredients before buying and the only thing that might possibly clog pores is the Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil which has a comedogenic rating of 3, but I am thinking because it is so far down the list, it didn’t clog up my skin at all.I’m a bit more sensitive to smells than most people.  The scent is a little funky at first, a little bit like mushrooms and roses (probably due to the fungus extract and rose flower water??)  But it’s gentle enough that it doesn’t bother me too much.  Hope they don’t discontinue this! Super silky, cleans well & removes makeup
