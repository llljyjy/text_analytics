i can’t give a full review on effectiveness as i haven’t been using it long enough i can say it hasn’t had any negative effects on my skin! the reason for my review is i saw many mentions of the smell and thought i could add some helpful commentary. the smell is not pleasant the way their other products are but is not extremely offensive either. the closest comparison i can make is it smells like a lot of fake slime/gak childrens toys. the smell on the face doesn’t last very long after application but does really stick around on your hands if you don’t wash them afterwards. my thoughts on the smell
