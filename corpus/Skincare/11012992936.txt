I really liked this moisturizer for the SPF and and creamy texture. It has a really nice feel, silky and not greasy at all. I put it on after I washed my face in the morning and before I applied my makeup. It provided a good base and still allowed my makeup to go on smoothly. I wouldn’t say it is a deep moisture that it provides but a light more day time moisture which is good. It does have a very light fragrance to it that reminded me slightly of watermelon which I prefer fragrance free but it’s not a deal breaker because it’s not too strong. All in all it’s a great day time moisturizer and I would recommend it. Nice Moisturizer
