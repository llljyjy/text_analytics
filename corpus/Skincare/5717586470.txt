I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. I am beginning to get fine lines around my eyes and I was looking for something to prevent more. This made my combination skin smooth and plumper. This has softened the lines and it has evened out my skin. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue once it dries like some other products do. It also doesn’t feel heavy or thick on the skin. It has a lovely light scent that I love. This is great to add to your daily routine for a prevention of wrinkles and to softly fade them. nan
