I purchased the mini size to give it a try after hearing so many people rave about it. The first two weeks, my skin did breakout/purge (mostly white heads). As someone who doesn’t have acne prone skin, I was tempted to stop using it. However, I continued using it and OH MY GOODNESS. My skin has never looked better. In two short weeks, my breakouts have cleared up, my skin is so hydrated, and my complexion is looking so even. The smell is subtle but I really enjoy it, and it doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped. If you are like me and find that your skin needs a period of adjustment, don’t give up! It is so worth it. I will definitely purchase the full size. Healthy, Glowing Skin After 2 Weeks
