I received this smart clique repair sample set for free #freeproduct from #topboxcircle to exchange my honest opinion. The serum is blight beige colour with light texture. The scent is pleasant and does not have strong scent, easy to absorb into my skin. After applied on my clean skin, I immediately notice my skin became soft and hydrated for the whole day. The sample was small and only last 2 applications, so I canâ€™t tell the long term anti-aging effect. Might consider to purchase this serum after finishing my current one. A nice serum to add to the skin care routine
