It has a white iridescent feel to it and isn’t fragrant. It has A tad oaty smell to it but I do not mind that because I know the oats are part of the ingredients. It’s effective at getting the makeup right off, and doesn’t strip the skin. It’s more expensive than a cerave, Cetaphil or vanicream but it’s just as gentle and effective. I do feel as though I get a lot of use for my money and it’s definitely got a luxury feel to it. I’ve tried everything from Dunk Elephant to Tatcha and I prefer this far and beyond.
