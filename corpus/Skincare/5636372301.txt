I’ve been having really bad hormonal acne recently. I have to wear a mask at work and it just worsens the acne. These pictures are 4 days apart! It stopped new acne from forming and started healing old acne and scars so fast! I have been using it twice daily. Also when wearing foundation I put a few drops in to decrease irritation and prevent more breakout. I use glominerals foundation that is very good for sensitive skin but still had slight breakouts. I high recommend this oil! Can’t wait to see how my skin looks in a week! Holy grail
