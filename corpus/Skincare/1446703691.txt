I higly recommend this tooth whitening system. I could tell a difference after just one day and by the 10th day it was a very noticeable difference. It was easy to use and I liked that it was hands free so I can read or do whatever while my teeth were whitening. I also like that the packaging is made of cardboard so it is environmentally friendly. The package contains enough whitening gel for a lot of uses. nan
