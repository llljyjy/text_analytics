I was sent a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for a review of this product. I would like to start by saying I have other skin products from Estée Lauder that I really love. I did not think the sample sent was adequate enough to truly test the product, so my review may be skewed. I liked the way it made my skin feel, but I didn’t like that the scent was really strong. It didn’t irritate my skin but I also didn’t see a huge difference from using it for a few days since the sample was extremely small. nan
