I have acne prone skin and was very happy to see this product does not contain ingredients that clog the pores. I used it for a few weeks and I am happy to share I have not developed any of my usual acne (only little whiteheads once a while) but â€¦ definitely much better than before. I ended up purchasing a larger bottle the second time. I used a few sites to check for pore clogging ingredients. No pore clogging ingredients! Yayyy !
