Extremely oily and I have dry skin! I love SuperGoop’s Unseen Sunscreen so I was excited to try a new “watery” sunscreen for everyday use. I just tried it and hate it! It not only is extremely greasy, it never dries and made my skin feel dirty. It also made my sensitive skin sting a bit. I will be returning this sunblock, the price for such a horrible product is crazy! Greasy, horrible sunblock
