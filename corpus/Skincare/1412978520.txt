I’ve been needing an eye cream too so I am SO excited to try this eye cream out! This eye cream is described as a replenishing eye cream with ceramides and plant oils that delivers long-lasting moisture, visibly restores elasticity, and soothes signs of fatigue.  Definitely something I need as a new mom! I should see results with fine lines and wrinkles, dryness, and loss of firmness and elasticity! I applied this eye cream at night after washing my face and what I noticed first was the light creaminess of the eye cream. It felt very nourishing and moisturizing. Unfortunately after a few weeks of using this cream I really haven’t noticed any difference in that area, although I do use eye cream as preventive rather than correcting. I did seem to get two blemishes, one on either side of my temples after using this eye cream there. nan
