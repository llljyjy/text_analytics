This product has replaced my foundation on summer days in direct sun. With a translucent powder over top then continue your makeup routine. It sits well with concealer and is light. I didn’t think it was too dark, it muted all the red in my face brilliantly and brought out my skin tone. Thrilled with this product. My only issue is that it takes a long time to use the whole jar and eventually the oil in the product separates. It is a clear, clean oil that mixes back in with insistent stirring but takes some time depending how separated. The lid/seal doesn’t make it easy to keep the jar clean on the inside, the product is always twisting into the metal. However both of those frustrations do not overshadow the excellence of this product. You could sell it to me in a plastic bag. green gold
