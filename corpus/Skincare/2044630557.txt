I’m 40, I’ve been using a night cream on my face since I was 23. I’ve used all different types and brands of cream, also different types of Lancôme creams.   This Lancôme night cream is, by far, the best of that brand! And compared to other brands, I’d say it ranks somewhere in the top 5. The cream smells amazing without being overpowering. It is thick and creamy without being heavy.    Using this cream regularly will definitely result in a softer more supple face in the morning.   I was given this cream for free in exchange for an honest review, but I will definitely be buying some once mine runs out. Luxury in a jar
