I have used this product as directed for almost 3 months. First of all, I LOVE the fragrance. I would keep it as perfume LOL It also feels wonderful on your skin and goes a long way. However, as a person who bought it to help fade a larger sun spot on my face, I didnâ€™t find any noticeable difference. I will not repurchase for that reason. nan
