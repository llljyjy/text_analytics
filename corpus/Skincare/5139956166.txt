Dermalogica recently launched a new hydration serum, the Circular Hydration Serum, and I had a chance to test it free in exchange for my honest review. The Circular Hydration Serum has 3 goals: to immediately quench dehydrated skin, to replenish skin from within and to prevent future dehydration. The ingredients highlighted to achieve the goals are: an enhanced form of Hyaluronic Acid, an Algae-infused moisturizing matrix and Polyglutamic Acid from fermented soy. The serum can be used morning & night.The Circular Hydration Serum is very silky, and slightly viscous in texture. It’s very good, my skin feels quenched and hydrated, but the feeling doesn’t last near as long as promised. My skin is dry, during the shifting weather here in Ottawa, often dehydrated as well. My occasional sensitivity reacted at first, with a hint of irritation, then settled after further use.  It’s possible I had to get used to the oils in the serum.Overall, while effective, the Circular Hydration Serum doesn’t feel like the right hydrating serum for me. Perhaps a person with another skin type would get better results.#giftedbydermalogica Effective but not quite right for me
