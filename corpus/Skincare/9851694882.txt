This sunscreen feels SO silky when I put it on, it’s amazing! Smooth and NOT greasy at all. I have oily skin and large pores. It’s a little hard to tell from my pics but Supergoop Mattescreen is very mattifying, and it blurs my pores. The texture is incredible. I could use just this as makeup. Because it’s a small and pricey bottle, I’ve been applying my cheaper sunscreen around the edges of my face and this one in my T zone where I need it. Worth the money spent though. Best face sunscreen I’ve ever used
