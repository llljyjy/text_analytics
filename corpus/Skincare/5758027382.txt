This is a great product in that it has a mild, pleasant scent, makes a wonderful frothy foam, and I do find that it cleanses deeply without stripping my skin (my skin type is already dry). However, I use it the least often because it is so expensive, and wanted the product to last (bought it during a sale). So it’s a little hard to tell how effective it is when I’m pretty consistent with all the steps of my skincare routine, and I only use this for washing my face. I reserve it now for washing my face after sweaty workouts, and use another slightly cheaper but equally effective cleanser (Youth To The People) for my regular-wash-off-the-day/second cleanse. Long story short, if you can afford it—enjoy! But there are other great cleansers out there with better price value Great but Hard to Justify the Price
