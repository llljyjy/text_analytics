I don’t have dark circles whatsoever but I was in need of eye cream so I luckily snatched this up. I can’t say anything about it’s effectiveness on reducing dark circles since I didn’t have any to begin with but what I can say is that I had problems with my eye tissue being dehydrated and this ultimately hydrated my eyelids overall for that day. I would definitely recommend this more if the price tag wasn’t as high as it is. nan
