i don’t usually write reviews.. i’ve been using this sunscreen for almost over a year now, repurchased many times and this is the best sunscreen i’ve ever tried. doesn’t leave a white cast or piling, even when putting on layers of makeup and touching my face. feels like a moisturizer it’s so comfortable, and i hate putting on sunscreen. i don’t plan on trying new sunscreens. it does get a bit oily during the humid summer months, but nothing a little powder or oil sheets can’t take care of! nan
