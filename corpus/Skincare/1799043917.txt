I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and LOVE it! At first I was a little intimidated that the retinol comes separate and you mix it in, but that was easy. I have tried lots of retinol serums before and they usually dry out my skin. This one didn’t irritate it at all and it wasn’t as drying as other serums I’ve tried. I love the way it feels soft on my skin and not heavy. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in fine lines and wrinkles yet, but it’s only been 2 weeks. I have noticed a difference in texture. Love this serum!
