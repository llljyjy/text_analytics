I received this #freeproduct from TopBox in exchange for my honest review.I started off using this product strictly in the evenings to ease my skin into the change. My first impression was that it smelled amazing. Wasnt too strong or perfumey. After about 2 weeks I started using in the AM as well. It has worked great. It absorbs well and doesnt leave my face feeling sticky. My skin looks noticeably brighter and my skin tone more even. The only thing I did differently was the amount used. It suggested 3 pumps in the AM and 5 in the PM, which I personally found to be way too much and like it was never absorbing into my skin. For me I found 2 works the best (but again, thatâ€™s just my skin and the recommended amount could work well for other people). All in all, I really enjoy this product and will likely be purchasing a replacement when this is empty. nan
