Don’t believe the hype. I am a Tatcha addict- love their face creams and was so excited to try this. I figured with all the reviews on the faulty packaging it would have been fixed… but no. Do not buy as you will get the printed packaging on your face. The paint flakes off the package and it makes it virtually unusable. don’t believe the hype
