I received this complimentary product from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder for my honest review.Packaging 10/10!This is a thick moisturizer so a little goes a long way! This moisturizer made my skin feel soft, rejuvenated and bright!I was expecting a bit more when it comes to overall feel with the expected tightening but there was no tingling or menthol like sensations which is common.The following day after use, i noticed a luminous glow and my face felt hydrated but never oily. This moisturizer would be ideal for low humidity climates or colder temperatures. Brightening!
