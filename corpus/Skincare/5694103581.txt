I have appreciated this product in the easy-to-use sample size (as tube), and in a previous purchase of the full size. The most recent purchase has been un-usable, however, because the cream won’t come out of the pump and the lid can’t be easily removed. This product should be delivered in a tube, same as their eye cream and as in the sample version! Unusable packaging
