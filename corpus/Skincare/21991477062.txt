This cleanser is best for people with combo or oily skin. As someone with normal to dry skin, I don’t pick out foaming cleansers but of the foaming cleansers I’ve tried this one is one of the lesser drying ones. The fragrance is strong for someone like me that doesn’t usually prefer fragrance in their skincare, but I let my friend, whose go-to cleanser is from Lancôme, try the cleanser out and she didn’t find the smell strong. A little goes a long way which is nice because the bottle is pretty big so I feel like this will last me quite a while. I did take off my mascara & the rest of my makeup well but it did sting my eyes if I didn’t rinse it off right away. Overall I think it’s a good cleanser for the market It’s in but I wouldn’t repurchase it myself with the specifications I prefer. for a luxury cleanser, this one is pretty good
