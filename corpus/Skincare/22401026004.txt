**I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS. FOR ANYTHING. EVER.** I just bought this yesterday, used it last night and I’m obsessed. My poor lips have been so dry and I just bite, pick, and constantly apply chapstick and it’s just been the worst. I used this last night and HOLY COW it works wonders. ONE USE and my lips are so soft... there is nothing to pick at! Not a huge vanilla fan, but this one is really nice for this time of year. INCREDIBLE 10/10. WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE
