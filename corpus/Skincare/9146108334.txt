Everyone’s skin is different, but for my combination acne-prone skin- it’s great. I wake up feeling hydrated, glowing, and along with the rest of my routine it helps to calm any breakouts or sensitivities from the night before. I’d say to do a spot test before applying it on your face as with anything else and to make sure that this is a good fit for your skin type. I’ll be purchasing again, but due to its thickness I’ll probably switch over to a different moisturizer once summer comes around again. Works wonders for my skin
