Love this for my skin. I have normal skin with some uneven tone and texture. I have been using this for the last three weeks twice daily. For both am and pm routine, I apply it after cleansing my skin and before moisturizing. I have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and in how hydrated it is (Iâ€™m still siding my regular face cleansers and moisturizers). I like how easy it is to distribute out via the pump and it is aesthetically pleasing on my counter top too. It has a light smell and I am glad it is not a strong scent. nan
