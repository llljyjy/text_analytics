Got this after hearing the rave reviews for ages. I work at a cafe and basically have given up on wearing makeup there because it gets so hot with the ovens in the back and in general. Decided to get this thinking this would even out my skin without wearing actual makeup (I’m pale with yellow- neutral undertones, flush very easily and mild acne with lots of redness). Tried it this morning before work and here’s what happened:- applied a few dots to one cheek and began to rub in- turned from green to beige as it said it would - immediately noticed the beige was closer to orange but though just needed to really be rubbed in- after doing both cheeks and blending heavily down my neck it looked like a bad 2000’s foundation, not to mention it felt shockingly heavy on the skin and didn’t sit the nicest (it takes less effort to do foundation in comparison)TLDR:I’d say if you’re pale, or don’t like the feel of a filmy/masky product don’t get this Disappointed
