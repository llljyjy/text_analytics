Not my favorite but does the job. I have a medium complexion with combination skin and this sunscreen felt more like light foundation on my face. The tint blends well on my skin complexion and I love that it’s SPF 45. Because of the thickness and deep tint, I use this more as a “foundation“ for my face when I want to look like I have make up on without actually having it on. More like a light foundation
