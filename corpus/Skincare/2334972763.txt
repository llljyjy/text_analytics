I love this! I tried it the first time, and it did give me a bronzy skin look within a matter of a few hours. I mix it with my body moisturizer, about a pump for a drop of this Glow Drop, and apply it to one area on my body at a time. It does smell like a tanning product, but it doesnâ€™t really bother me at all. Love that I can use it on my face and body, alone or mixed in with a moisturizer. great tanning product!
