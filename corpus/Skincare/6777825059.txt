I received this from #Topboxcircle and it was a #freeproduct. I use this everyday and my skin feels very hydrated and plumped. It is definitely helping with the wrinkles but I need to use it much longer to see the magic. However, I do see my skin getting there. Itâ€™s very light and absorbs super easily. It has a very light soothing fragrance. I love the product and definitely recommend everyone out there to give it a try. I am sure you all will love it too! Great Serum!
