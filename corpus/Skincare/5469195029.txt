Iâ€™ve used this cleanser for 5 days now. I have the driest, flakiest and scaliest skin. I live in harsh Canadian winters and am a retin-a user. This is by far the most gentle and hydrating cleanser on the market. It takes off almost all makeup on the first wash, including moderate eye makeup. The affordable price, is just a nice bonus. The most hydrating and gentle cleanser!
