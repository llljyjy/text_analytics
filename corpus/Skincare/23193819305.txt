Just bought this yesterday from Sephora. Had high hopes due to the great reviews of this product and it lives up the the hype! I used the sugar scrub, rose face mask, rose toner, this serum and the deep hydration sleeping mask and Omg this morning my skin looks so glowy, hydrated and supple!!!As soon as I washed my face after using the sugar scrub and rose face mask, my skin was glowing like never before. As soon as I applied the rose toner and this oil infused serum, my face was glowing and was so supple.I definitely recommend this serum and also other best sellers from the ROSE line in this brand. This is my first time using the Fresh brand as it is quite expensive but well worth the price. Invest in this and you will never regret especially if you have dry, dehydrated skin. Prevention is better than cure. Planning to use this Day and night with vit c and retinol and my estee lauder ANR... it is natural and mild to be used with any actives. Make sure to exfoliate your skin so all the skincare can penetrate in your skin! Loved the smell, spa like feeling after using this. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! MUFOR DRY DEHYDRATED SKIN! Miracle in a bottle!
