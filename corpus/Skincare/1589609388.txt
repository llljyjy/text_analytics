I got this product complimentary from sephora. I dont think this product is worth the price. It has a nice texture, scent, packaging. I didnt notice it do anything for my pores. I prefer other pore products out there so i will not be purchasing this one in the future. I added a picture where one side of my face is product free and the other has this skin cream. Can you tell which is which? Not worth it
