I absolutely love this serum for daytime! I got it in a sample months back, and have been repurchasing and using daily since. My only issue is that I’ve noticed in the 3 times I’ve ordered this product, the bottle product is never completely filled. I understand that filling this product to the brim may result in a mess when opening, but there is definitely enough missing from the bottle that would provide up to at LEAST 3-5 days of use. (Tested with full dropper from last bottle that was running low) Would love it even more if it came full!
