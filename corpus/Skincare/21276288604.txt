I have a lot of mixed emotions about this product. First being it feels great going on the skin and I love the results. I don’t think you need 5 drops as it sits very greasy on the skin. It almost has a velvet finish but your face will feel pretty oily. I am going to keep using it to see the effects it gives me long term. But be warned if you don’t like feeling oily! nan
