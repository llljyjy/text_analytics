I have been looking for a product to manage the tiny blackheads and whiteheads on my chin and forehead for so long, and this is it! This serum is a blemish clearing powerhouse, but it does not reduce size or visibility of pores (I use a PHA serum for that instead). This serum is very thick and hydrating so I would not recommend if you have excessively oily skin. However, I have dry skin and live in a dry climate so this is absolutely perfect for me. Happy to have found a perfect product at a great price point. Cleared pesky blackheads in less than a week!!
