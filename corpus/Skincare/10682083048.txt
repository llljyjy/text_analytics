This product is lightweight and easily melts into the skin. I have light-tan skin and this does not leave a white cast. Since it is mineral sunscreen, it also doesn’t burn in my eyes when I sweat so it is ideal for running. I also have added Nars Tinted Moisturizer on top and haven’t had an issue with pilling. My face feels hydrated without feeling sticky or looking greasy. For reference, I have combo skin with a really, really oily t-zone. Finally found my perfect sunscreen
