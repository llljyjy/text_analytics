Iâ€™ve never written a sephora review before but I had to come on here to do so. I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and have to carefully watch the products I put on my face. I was a bit nervous about this but it feels so refreshing and my skin feels so so clean after each use. Will def try to get the bigger size when I run out of this one! Great even for sensitive skin!
