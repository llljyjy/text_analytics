I’m feeling conflicted about this product. I absolutely love it, but the pump broke less than 2 months in. There is still a LOT of product left but I cant get it out. I’m so disappointed, because this did wonders for my eyes - my crow’s feet were less sharp after about a week, and the skin around my eyes has never been softer. If this came in a jar I’d buy it again in a heartbeat but I can’t spend this much money on a bad package again. Other reviews suggest I’m not the only one with this problem, and honestly if I had read them first I probably wouldn’t have bought this. I’m so sad I can’t use it up. Great product, bad packaging
