I finally found a moisturizer that my skin loves. I’m combination/dry and now that I’m approaching 50 I’m paying closer attention to what my skin/body needs. A little goes a long way, yes there is a bit of smell that’s not so pleasant, but the benefits that it’s having on my skin is amazing and I simply overlook it. Try it out you won’t be disappointed. #add2cartNOW Love It
