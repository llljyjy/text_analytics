Let me say this, I had horribly irritated skin from dermaplaning my face - it was red, burnt, I even had a cut on my face.  I bought this moisturizer in a desperate attempt to restore my barrier function, and it has far exceeded my expectations.  My red, splotchy face turned even and soothed overnight. Iâ€™m not even lying. I woke up and it was like I had zero irritation, and my cut is almost healed.  This is magic in a jar - I am a FOREVER customer. It is pricy, but a little goes a long way! Holy grail, the BEST (sensitive skin APPROVED)
