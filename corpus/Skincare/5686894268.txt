Its a good moisturizer but it isnt much different from cheaper ones. I like that it is unscented and its a good consistancy but the price does not match the product. I like my vanicream one better. Also the push top stops working all the time. I am not sure why but i jave to unscrew it and try and get air bubbles out. No matter what i do the top of it has dried cream on it. I just dont think its worth it but overall good. Wont repurchase. Its fine
