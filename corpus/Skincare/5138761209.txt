I have used this cleanser for nearly two years and it is absolutely the best cleanser I have found for my skin. I have mildly oily/acne prone skin. The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture. On the rare occasion that I do try a different cleanser I find that Iâ€™m not satisfied and always come back to this one. As much as I love this product, I would NOT recommend it for someone with dry/sensitive skin. I think it is best suited for people with oily/acne prone skin types. nan
