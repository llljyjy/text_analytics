I have been using it diligently these past few weeks. It has a great light consistency, my skin eats it up. It leaves your face hydrated and plump. I love that it does not feel greasy at all. I wake up with refreshed bouncy skin. I can see my pimples healing faster, and scars getting lighter. I will definitely buy it again and use it. Love this product! Glass skin
