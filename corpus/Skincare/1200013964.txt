I was provided this product by Influenster for review.  I had never heard of cica before so I really didn’t know what to expect. I did a little research and discovered that cica has many benefits related to skincare, one of them being the ability to sooth irritated skin.  I have been using this product for 3-4 weeks now and I can honestly say that it truly has helped my extremely dry skin.  I started out using it on my face and although my face tends to be normal/oily, the Dior Cica Balm didn’t increase the oils on my face.   Then, I started using it on other parts of my body such as my feet, hands and elbows. I found that I like it for those drier parts of my body even more.  This product is very moisturizing without being greasy.  When you first put it on it feels like it’s going to be greasy, but it obsorbs into the skin and doesn’t leave your skin greasy at all.  I also like the fact that there isn’t a scent to this product so i don’t have to worry about it interfering with whatever perfume I choose to wear for the day.  This has become the moisturizer that I carry in my purse daily. I can see myself purchasing another in the future. Extremely Good Moisturizer
