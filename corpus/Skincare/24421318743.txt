Amazing product. Did my own extensive research on how to deal with red skin with skincare products without damaging and bought this product for fun without any hope for results. Now, I added it to my daily skincare routine (3-step: cleansing, toning, SPF/moisturizing) instead of SPF. It also works as foundation coverage and adds a healthy glow to the skin. The smell is incredible and it is my to-go product. I am a life-long fan!
