I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks now and I really like it. I use it morning and night and I’ve noticed my under eyes stay hydrated without feeling sticky. It does lightly brighten which makes me look well rested when not wearing makeup. Honestly I’m not surprised I would love this eye cream since I genuinely love all of Summer Friday’s products because they’re gentle, clean, and they work. nan
