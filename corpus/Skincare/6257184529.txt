I’ve received IT cosmetics bye bye makeup 3-1 makeup melting cleaning balm and have been using it for the last week or so. I really like the feel of the product on my face. It removes make up without having to scrub my face. After I wash it off my skin feels very smooth and hydrated. I’ve used numerous make up removers and most of them don’t get all of the make up off or leaves my face super greasy. I really enjoy this product and highly recommend it. I will continue using this for my make up removal process. Really works!
