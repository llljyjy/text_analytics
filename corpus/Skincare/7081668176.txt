My favorite thing about this serum is the smell — it’s very fresh and a little citrusy (but by no means overpowering if you are sensitive to that!). For me,  I think this is a serum that’s best suited for nighttime, as it feels a little sticky (with the oil) and would be good for layering/moisturizing. Love the smell
