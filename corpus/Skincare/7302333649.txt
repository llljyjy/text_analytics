I was really excited to try this as I have never heard of a “toner serum“ before. Anything that simplifies my routine will get my attention. Unfortunately, after using over half the bottle and after 2 months of continued use, I have not seen any significant difference. Its slightly hydrating but that’s it. Not a big fan of the scent. Bottle is okay. For the results and price I will not be purchasing again. Didn't see any difference
