This stuff really works! It’s pricey but worth it. It makes my skin feel smooth and doesn’t lead to break outs. I love the scent, but why are you so expensive lol. I definitely recommend it , I use it as my everyday moisturizer and at night I use perricone which is a real good brand and not as pricey but great combo for great skin results. Quite impressive!
