The bottle has been leaking since before I even used it, but it didn’t seem that bad at first and thought that even though it was faulty it should be okay standing up on the counter. WRONG. Every time I pump out any product it always spills out of the sides around the head of the pump as well. Lost a good amount of product already. Don’t bother trying to travel with it.As for the product’s efficacy, it hasn’t made me breakout but I also haven’t really seen much of a a difference in my dark spots.For the price I’d expect the packaging to function. I understand the product not working for me as it has for others as everyone is different but this was definitely a miss for Farmacy. Don't buy it unless they change the packaging
