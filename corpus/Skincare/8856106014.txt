I thought this product worked just as good, if not better, than the Good Genes Lactic Acid Treatment. It has a subtle smell that is not off putting and I noticed a difference in the way my face looked after using it for a week. I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts and this product did not make me breakout nor did it dry my face out either. Really liked!
