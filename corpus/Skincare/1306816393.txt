I received this in the Sun Safety Kit and decided to give it a whirl. After toning I mixed 6 drops with my moisturizer at bedtime. The next morning I saw a subtle difference and by the afternoon I had a golden glow. Not orange at all, it was like a real tan. No smell at all. it gradually faded away over 3 or 4 days. I have light to medium skin. Get a real glow
