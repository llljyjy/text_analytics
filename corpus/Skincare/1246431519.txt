I loved the luxuriousness of this cream. It has a great feel, goes on so easily & smoothly, and hydrates like no other. A little bit goes a long way and I love that the gorgeous gold packaging is refillable. However, I have oily skin, so after a while, the moisture just builds up on my face & it needs to be blotted. I definitely recommend for someone with less oily skin! Moisture to the max!
