Tried this because the mineral sunscreen that my dermatologist recommended caused me to break out for the first time in years, and people rave about this brand.  The sunscreen stinks like rotting fruit.  I canâ€™t even give it away.  Im surprised this product has not been discontinued.  Just more waste added to the planet we live on. nan
