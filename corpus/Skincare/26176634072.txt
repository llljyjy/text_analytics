i bought this in the very start of june and now it’s july and there is definitely a huge difference in my skin. i get really really bad hormonal acne when i get near/on my period (huge cystic pimples on my chin) which are very painful and last a few days, but the worst part is the very dark scars they leave behind. i have been struggling with this since 2020 and nothing has really helped the discoloration except for this… my cousin told me to get it while in sephora and i’m so glad i took her advice. i still have a long way to go until the spots are gone but it has really helped my confidence a lot, and when new pimples on my chin come back, they get lighter a lot quicker (they usually take around half a year to really fade away, they sort of pile on each other.) i also get acne on my cheeks when i eat bad and these have faded those acne scars as well. two things i will say that make me not give it 5 stars is that while it faded the rest of my acne fairly quickly it took a little bit for it to do anything to my chin acne but i will say they are very deep, long lasting scars so u must b patient. another thing is i realized it doesn’t rlly sink into ur skin (at least for me) but it kinda layered on. i only use this and aveno moisturizer with tea tree oil as my skin care routine, a long with a really good organic powder cleanser (art naturals brand) and maybe a face mask here and there. but if i don’t wash my face before putting on makeup, there will be significant peeling. doesn’t really bother me now that i know but before a quick errand run it’s a little bothersome. other than that this has rlly changed my skin. sorry for the long review LOL i have been struggling w my chin acne/skin in general for a while and this gave me hope!!! :) ****** skin change is also from change in diet and drinking water more frequently! first pic is from april 16th second pic july 9th. i know i look really bad in both LOL thank u whoever u r paula
