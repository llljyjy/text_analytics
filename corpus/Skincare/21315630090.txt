I received this #gotitfree from @topboxcircle for my honest review. Since this came in a small package for about 4 uses with stretching it, I can only give a review that is suited for that. I loved the fact that I could apply this serum either night or day and I love that because itâ€™s a versatile serum. It made my skin feel hydrated. There is no scent in this serum and a little goes a long way. I love putting it all down my neck too because I believe that is the most neglected area in facial treatments. It make my skin feel silky and primed my skin for a moisturizer. I noticed that it tackles my fine lines well. I am hoping that the long term use may yield more effective results. A yes product
