This salve applies like a dream. It’s the consistency of an ointment, a cross between Vaseline and Hydrocortisone Ointment.  It has a barely noticeable scent and doesn’t aggravate my somewhat sensitive skin. It definitely moisturizes, but honestly no better than lower priced and equally good Waxelene, a botanical skin salve. So I’ll use this tube but doubt that I will buy again. Dreamy Salve with Caveats
