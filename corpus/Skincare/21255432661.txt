This oil is amazing for my very dry skin! I got this as a sample and only been using it the past few days but it has made a huge improvement in my skin already. I also have acne prone skin and this has actually toned down my acne as well. It’s so lightweight too and doesn’t feel like you have oil on your face. It’s not heavy at all & i love that. I put it on at night only and the scent is very mild so it doesn’t bother me. It has more of a mild earthy scent if anything. I’m definitely going to buy the bigger bottle. Very little goes a LONG way too which is great because it’s pricey so the bottle will last me a long time. Definitely recommend for my very dry skin peeps! amazing!
