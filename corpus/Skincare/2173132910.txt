I would rate this pretty well. Only thing is I didn’t get to color match correctly as I received the product free for my honest review. I got the medium shade which may match me on my tan days of summer. But it’s extremely lightweight. Love that it has high spf in it! And it leaves your skin hydrated and flawless. I’ve mixed it with concealer to lighten the shade and love my finished look. Lightweight and flawless finish
