I have had oily skin for a while so I thought maybe this would be the product for me, but it seems like it doesnâ€™t moisturize well. I figured that this would control my oily skin and I guess it does what it said it would do, but now my skin is always dry and I have to use more product to feel moisturized. If you have really oil skin I would think this would do wonders because it has controlled my oil production very well, just a little too much. Maybe I don't have Oily Skin
