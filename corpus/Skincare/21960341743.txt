I received this product for free from Influenster and T y c ula in exchange for my honest review I have been testing this out for the last two weeks. I have oily skin and it’s working fine for me, it gives you a natural glow plus a deep hydration, also i have a sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate my skin as well. The most i like about this cream that it’s not greasy and that’s why I don’t use any cream on face and you barely can feel it on your face very light and absorbing really fast into face Good to keep for your face routine
