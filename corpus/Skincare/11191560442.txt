This gel moisturizer I was gifted by Laneige has exceeded my expectations. When I first opened it, I thought it was really smelly, but it turns out the eye cream I used that day actually was what smelled bad. This gel moisturizer has basically no smell at all and goes on like a dream. I use it on damp skin, and when my skin dries it is super soft and my dry patches immediately look better. It is very gentle. I can use other products with it without pilling, which is a must because I like to layer products. I think it is great stand-alone, especially for day use if you have more normal-oily skin, or combined with other products for deep moisturize at night. I definitely would recommend this product! Love it way more than I thought I would
