The box this comes in is such a catfish. It’s like a shiny Machamp with a ditto face. Zero shelf appeal. This is the LEAST important thing ever, but it just looks so goofy. As for the actual product and performance, it’s alright. I didn’t notice a visual reduction of my pores, but when compared to the side of my face that is bare there is a notable difference in shine. I’m still a bit glowy, but it looks like I’ve been very lightly powdered.  I’ve found that it grips cream makeup products well when used as a primer. Personally I’m not completely blown away by this and with it being nearly $30 with less than an ounce of product, I’m probably not gonna pick it up. S’alrite
