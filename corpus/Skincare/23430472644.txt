I really liked this product. It felt very smooth and went on easy. It doesn’t have a strong smell to it at all. It’s also a nice consistency that doesn’t feel harsh when applying. Personally I find it a bit drying but other than that it’s a good formulation and it’s definitely worth a try. I also received a sample size version of this for free. Nice formulation
