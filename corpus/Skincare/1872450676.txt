This lip mask saves me every single winter. I recently ran out of the product and decided to pick up the Lip Glowy Balm instead since I preferred the packaging and assumed the formula would be the same. I was dead wrong. My lips were still so chapped but I can’t blame Laneige, I think the Lip Glowy Balm isn’t meant to be as heavy duty or restorative.As soon as I repurchased this lip mask, my lips are no longer chapped and sore. I can finally wear other lip products again. The Gummy Bear scent is really good, not too similar to gummy bears but closer to an artificial grape. I have to deduct a star because they include an applicator but there isn’t a place to store it on the product. nan
