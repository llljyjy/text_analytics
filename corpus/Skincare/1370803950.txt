I absolutely am in love with this product. I have very sensitive skin that I was told to be dehydrated also. It is extremely difficult for me to find any products that my skin likes. My skin has been loving the entire biossance line. Iâ€™ve tried basically all of their products. I especially love the face wash because it cleans my face but does not feel squeaky clean or that dry tight feeling that other face washes have (this means that your skin was ripped of the natural oils and I do not think that is good). however biossance truly even helps my pimples and white heads. I do not use this as makeup remover . I do double cleanse with another washer and they both work very well together. Great For Sensitive Skin
