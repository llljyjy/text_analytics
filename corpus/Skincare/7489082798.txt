The kosas juicy vegan collagen plumping spray on serum mist is an essential in my skincare since using it for the first time! I absolutely adore the pink fun colored packaging. Probiotics help and create healthy skin. It’s a delightful scent that is fruity and light. The mister sprays out the most perfect amount of mist and it coats your skin so fast only a few spritzes are really needed. My favorite serum is now the kosas vegan collagen pray serum because it’s cruelty free and has a hands free, way much faster and cleaner access to the yummy incredible product. It is a serum so I apply before moisturizer however for that supple extra moisture it’s so soothing to spray it on after your whole skincare routine. Overall it’s a super hydrating experience all in itself. Super Juicy & Plump Skin
