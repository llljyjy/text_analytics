I love this product , it’s been about 2 weeks and I see a slight change in my acne scars (very miniminal change but they’ve slightly gone away). My biggest tip is to start off slow like every other day because a few people have said they purged when using so using every other day or every 2 days helps your skin “get used“ to a new product. ALSO WEAR SUNSCREEN !! if you don’t protect ur skin, it won’t be as beneficial. Also let the product sink into ur skin before applying your moisturizer(about 2-4 minutes is good). TOTALLY RECOMMEND START OFF SLOW !!
