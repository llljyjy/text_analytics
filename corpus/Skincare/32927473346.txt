Upon receiving this product to try I was so excited because I’ve always wanted to try Origins brand products. My first reaction was that I loved it! The herbal scent is so good. And your skin has such a luxurious tingly feeling after applying. After it absorbs into the skin and dries, it is definitely a matte finish and something I’m not used to. Currently it is February and my skin is typically very dry in Winter. This moisturizer did not keep my skin hydrated during the day. My skin started getting dry patches and peeling. I am going to try using this again in the Summer when my skin doesn’t need as much help staying moist. nan
