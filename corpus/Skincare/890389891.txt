Going over the reviews, if the roller ball doesn’t work definitely return it! I know it’s a hassle but the product is worth using. I’m on my second bottle and I love it. I have extremely dry skin everywhere because of the accutane I was on 9 years ago for acne and my skin never recovered. The oil is cool and soothing and helps with hydration. I haven’t noticed any brightening or color change under my eye, but my skin feels soft and smooth after application. Absorbs quickly. I use it under a heavier eye cream to lock in the moisture at night and during the day I use it as a wake up for the under eye. Definitely worth trying if you want straight hydration. staple in my routine
