I received this #free product for review from TopBox. I used this serum at night, after use it my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Because it is a very small sample of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum that I can only use it once, so I did not see any Wrinkle changes on my face. I will add this to my anti-aging products and see what the results in the future. Hydrating serum
