I really like this sunscreen, I used to use Purito back in 2020 before the scandal then I switched over to Supergoop Unseen (which I still adore) and I tried Supergoop Play but Play was way too greasy for me. This one still has a bit of dew to it but not nearly as bad as Play, this one just makes your skin look healthy not like a greaseball. It’s a cream that blends into the skin seamlessly and I also personally love the scent but if you are sensitive to scents definitely test before buying. If you’re looking for a new sunscreen to try out I highly recommend giving this one a chance! Worth Trying!!!
