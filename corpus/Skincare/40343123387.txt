Hi my name is Vanessa I was gifted a complementary dermalogica sample. I have dry and acne prone skin are used this dermatological face wash and it worked like a dream. The exfoliation is really good and it helps clear out some of those blackheads and whiteheads that night my face fell a little sensitive but the next day my skin felt amazing. Make sure to use a moisturizer and face serum after! This review is complimentary from Dermalogica SamplingFollow me on TikTok for more reviews @blessedvaness Perfect for acne prone skin
