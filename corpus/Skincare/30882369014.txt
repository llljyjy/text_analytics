As a mom of 3 kids I have lost many hours of sleep in the past 10 years that left me with tired eyes. I am always looking for a eye product to help, this Dior eye serum felt smooth to apply and the metal applicator was soothing. I noticed my under eye looked a bit brighter but for the price I can find another serum. I didnâ€™t love the hard plastic tube and I found out the hard way the top does NOT twist off it pulls off. I broke the whole metal tip off! Luckily I was able to reattach it. nan
