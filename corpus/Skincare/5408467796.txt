I received this product as a #freeproduct from topbox for my review.  I liked that this product was fragrance free, gentle and was very moisturizing. It was gentle and can be a nice addition to a skincare routine. I don’t know if there is any change as far as wrinkle repair in the short term.  This may be a product that needs to be used for a longer period of time to see results.  I don’t think I would be purchasing this product in the future as the results are not drastic enough for me to justify the price. Fragrance free
