I have been looking for a better quality eye cream so I was super excited to try this Kiehl’s super multi-corrective eye zone treatment! The consistency is very rich and creamy. It absorbs nicely and leaves no oily residue. I also love that it works on multiple problem areas like lifting, smoothing, puffiness, and brightening my eye area. It only takes a small pea sized amount to treat my entire eye area. I used it twice a day in the morning under my makeup then again at night after washing my face. I’m very happy with my results so far eveb though it’s still early. Amazing Eye Cream!
