This serum is a great first step in the Clinical Repair line. There’s no fragrance, it’s easy to apply on the skin, and I had no break outs! The texture is thinner than a moisturizer but enough to keep your skin hydrated. From the peptides, hyaluronic acid, to the algae extract, the ingredients are top notch – which is what I’ve come to expect from Clinique. Overall, I’d say this is a great skincare line that, with time, should improve the condition of wrinkles, fine lines, and loss of hydration. I received a sample of this moisturizer for review #freeproduct. Great serum with good ingredients!
