I’ve been using Clinique since my teenage time and now for my Wrinkles( time really flies). I got this as a sample as a #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox.

Even though it has been only few weeks, I did notice an improvement in my skin texture as it feels more smooth and also dryness is gone. This serum nicely absorbs into the skin quite well. Since, Clinique is one of my tried and tested brand, I will be buying the full size to see the maximum results. Effective Serum
