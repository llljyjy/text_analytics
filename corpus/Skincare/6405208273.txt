I have received this from Influenster and Belif in a sample size bottle. The product is lightweight and goes on smoothly. While it dries down after application, it leaves the skin moisturized but not greasy. For reference, I have dry to combination skin. It’s good to use on own or under makeup. There’s no white cast! Will definitely purchase this again after I run out of it. The full size version retails for $38, which is on the pricey side but a little goes a long way! I have been using the sample size for about 3 weeks now and there’s still plenty left! Go grab yours now!! No White Cast
