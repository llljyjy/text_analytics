This is one of the first lip balms that I’ve used that does not have the heavy taste of sunscreen in it. You just have the feeling that it is there but you can lick your lips and you’d only taste the scent of the lip balm; the scent is amazing btw.. I don’t like lemon scented or flavored anything but this smell reminds me of skittles candy. Lastly the texture is different than I expected… its kind of like a dry chap stick… it provides absolutely no shine (like most I’ve used) but it leaves your lips feeling really soft.
