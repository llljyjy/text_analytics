Unfortunately this didn’t work for me. It’s a shame because it had a lot of potential - I loved the texture and light scent. It applied really nicely. But it made me break out, so I can’t recommend it. It may work for you though! But just be cautious if you have sensitive skin. Maybe not for sensitive skin
