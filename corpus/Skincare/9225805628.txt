To start , the packaging of this product is very appealing to the eye. I use this serum as a part of my morning return. It is very moisturizing and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I’ve been using it for two weeks and my skin looks visabally healthier. My skin does not have wrinkles, however I am using this retinol as an anti aging preventive as retinol is important to use at my age ( mid twenty’s ). I also love the ingredients listed in this serum as they are all gentle and powerful at the same time ! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to introduce retinol into there routine. Hydrated & healthier skin!
