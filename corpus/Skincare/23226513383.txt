I am returning this product to Sephora.  I never complain about smells.  But this product’s smell is so bad I can’t bear to put it on my face.  It smells like hair remover I use over my top lip, or perm solution they used to use in hair salons. An onion-y sulfur. It’s not subtle - it lingers They surely could have done better on the smell Smell is Inexcusable
