I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. The Caudalie Resveratol-Lift Firming Cashmere Cream comes in a really cute pink bottle, which I loved. The cream is a thinner creamy consistency, with a light herbal scent that I don’t notice after a few minutes. This vegan collagen alternative cream was really gentle on my skin. I used this product once in the morning after applying the Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Serum, for the last few weeks, and my skin never broke out or had any adverse reactions. I liked the plumping effect and I feel that my pores appear a bit smaller from using this cream combined with the serum. This cream was really hydrating and it left my skin feeling so soft and smooth. My only complaint is that I didn’t see more noticeable results with my fine lines and wrinkles. I will continue to use this product until it runs out, so hopefully I will continue to see results. For now, I would give this product 4 stars. So hydrating!
