I received this set for free in exchange for my honest review. Overall, The set is cute but I feel like it didn’t do anything for my skin.The set came in an adorable reusable pouch that made me very excited to use the products. I will be using the pouch in my every day life.Now, the products! The Citrus Clean Balm & Makeup Melt got my concealer off my skin nicely, but it couldn’t handle my waterproof mascara. I wouldn’t recommend this makeup remover if you wear waterproof products.The Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer went on my skin well and it absorbed right in. It temporarily reduced the look of my dry skin, but it didn’t help in the long run. I also feel it wasn’t heavy enough to be considered a mask. There are better moisturizers and masks out there.The Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel is a good product to use if you want a quick exfoliation, but I wouldn’t say it did much. It made my skin smooth right after using, but I don’t feel it had any lasting affect on my skin.Overall, these products look and smell really nice, but they were underwhelming. nan
