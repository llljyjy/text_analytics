I received this product for review, and really liked it. I have dry, mature skin, and it did a great job of keeping me moisturized throughout the night. My only complaint is that it isn’t as emollient as I’d expected. I had to warm it up in my hands a bit before spreading it onto my face. Aside from that, I really love it. nan
