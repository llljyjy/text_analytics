I was sent this product #free from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest review. I definitely wasn’t anticipating how runny it was going to be, especially when the instructions say “3-5 pumps“ 1 is enough and it still takes a bit to dry! I love the way this Essence makes my skin feel - clean, fresh refreshed and bright, without making me break out! It has evened out my redness and reduced the size of my pores and my chin breakouts. It smells amazing too! I am so glad I was able to #tryitwithtopbox! A new must-have in my routine!
