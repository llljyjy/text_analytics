I did not see any improvement in my skin after using this daily for several weeks. I don’t like the inconvenience of the extra step but would happily do it if it reduced the redness in my skin or improved the appearance of my pores. I have had better results with other products, so this wasn’t a match for me. Fat water feels good but doesn't do anything
