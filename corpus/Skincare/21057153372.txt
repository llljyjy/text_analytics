Personally not worth the hype - it makes lip dryness worse! I tried this lip mask for a solid month and blamed my chapped lips on the rough New York winter weather but once I traveled somewhere warmer, same thing kept happening. As soon as I switched to regular chapstick, the difference was stark and immediate. While I know 90% of people seem to love this, it was just not great to me. Not worth the hype.
