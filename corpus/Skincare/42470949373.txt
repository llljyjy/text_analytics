I only got this product two days ago, and I’ve used it twice and I already see so much improvement! I’ve always had enlarged pores under my eyes that you could feel and see, and nothing really ever got rid of them. With using this product two times, the skin is practically baby smooth and most of the enlarged pores have disappeared - with another day’s use or so, it’ll probably improve even more. I do have really bad blackheads on my nose, which is another reason I bought it, and although I can’t tell if there’s any improvement there yet, I can definitely say the skin there is much less oily than it used to be. nan
