This cream is so lightweight and the skin just soaks it’s in. I love the smell and texture. It also makes my skin look very hydrated and refreshed the next morning. This cream has a whipped “cloud-like” texture that makes it easy and fun to apply. I am very happy with this cream and will buy more after using it up! amazing texture- lightweight hydration
