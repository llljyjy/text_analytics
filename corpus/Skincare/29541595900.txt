This is a MUST have for People with DRY Skin, for Their Winter Time Routine! Towards the End of My Evening Routine, after I have done all My Serums and Toners and Essences, I then use My Prescription Tretinoin Cream! I put My Eye Cream on, that’s when I bring this product from The Ordinary into My Routine! I use Two Dropper Fulls for My ENTIRE Face, and then another FULL Dropper full on My Neck! Then I put a thick Moisturizer over top! I then to seal EVERYTHING Completely in to place for the Night, I use CeraVe healing ointment! And I’m telling You this keeps My Skin Sooo Moisturized and Hydrated ALL Night long! It is so much less expensive, than so many other products! But it works just as well, if not BETTER than a lot of them! This is a Winter MUST have HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT, to have in Your Winter Routine! eEspecially if You use Prescription Retin-A like I do, it’s a Game Changer Seriously!!! It’s also really nice if You have Dry Hair! I would not use this product during the Day on My Hair though! Also makes VERY Dry and Chapped Lips Moisturized and Comfortable! Keep a bottle in Your Purse, and just apply a little bit to Your Lips during the Day, it helps Tremendously really does! A Winter ❄️ Skin Care Routine MUST HAVE!!!!
