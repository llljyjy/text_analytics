Writing this review after using your the whole bottle of this serum. There are a few things I loved about it:-great texture, very light and absorbs quickly-packaging prevents oxidation so it stays active longer than other vitamin c serums-no scent-egf has a promising research behind itBut there were things I really disliked also:-I wasn’t able to use it on its own as it would break me out. I had to mix it in with moisturizer so it wasn’t as potent-didn’t give me the glow unlike some other vitamin c serums-no improvement in firmness or skin toneOverall it was a nice basic serum that seems to be good formulated and easy to use. However the fact that I kept getting breakouts and having to mix it into the moisturizer was very annoying which is why I think it didn’t give me good results.I don’t think I will repurchase not bad but not good either
