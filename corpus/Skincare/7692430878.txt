Have been using this product 1x every night for just shy of two weeks, and it has helped even out my skin tone and decreased redness. Serums, or similar products that go on after moisturizer and toners, have never been a part of my skincare routine; so getting used to the consistency/thickness of this product was an adjustment for me, but one Iâ€™m glad I made! Decreases redness & evens skin tone
