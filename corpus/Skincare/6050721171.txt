I have very fair skin and so any blemish or irritation is bright red. This product is magic for fixing that. I can’t believe I don’t have to wear foundation always now! I used to have to because nothing but that would cover my blemishes alone, not even just concealer. I have been able to have a more natural everyday makeup look because if this. It also is an amazing primer if you so want that extra coverage. Cannot recommend this product more for anyone fair skinned who has redness issues! Highly recommend for fair skin
