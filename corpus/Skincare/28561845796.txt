Really bummed but for some reason this made my skin intensely dry. Even tried it on damp skin but nothing. No moisture retained. Just sat on top of skin. So my skin felt greasy but was ZERO moisturized. It felt super tight and I had rough dry patches. Skin felt better with no moisturizer than with this. Tried it for a few days because I couldnâ€™t believe such a thick moisturizer was this pointless. Nothing new/different was added to my skincare, so it was definitely this product. Super drying
