Hands down one of the best moisturizers I have used!  It absorbs into the skin quickly but it lasts all day, I have noticed a reduction in my fine line since using it! I was hesitant at first because I have dry sensitive skin and not everything works well for me but this hydrated my skin without leaving me needing to apply more and it didnâ€™t cause any breakouts! nan
