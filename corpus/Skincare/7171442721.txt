The bottle was quite vague in saying how it will help the face, aside from mentioning pores in the name, so I wish it said something on the back. But other then that I tried it out and used a pea sized amount all over my face, massaged it in until it soaked thru completely. A little went a long way, as a few hours later my skin is still soft feeling as if I just applied the cream. I got quite a bit of pores so Iâ€™m hoping this will help it out in some way. Fingers crossed it will show results more each time. nan
