I received this product for my honest review.I tried this eye cream for 2+ weeks every day and night. I didnt see a change under my eyes at all, they still look dark and tired. (I’ll keep trying it to see of maybe it just takes longer for me)I can say it does moisturize my skin very well, you don’t need a lot to go a long way (I just dab I finger for a thin layer). I don’t notice any smell either. I would not recommend to get rid of tired looking eyes, but just for moisturizing under the eyes yes. No Change
