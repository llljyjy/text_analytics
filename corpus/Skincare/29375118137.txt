I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised I was after reading the reviews here to find this product truly does show results after ONE use! Before using this serum I wouldn’t have even really considered my face to have much texture but the next morning my skin felt baby smooth and silky I seriously couldn’t believe the difference! I’ve been applying it every other night and since using this over the past month I’ve noticed a huge difference, my bare skin looks brighter and feels smoother! This has made such a difference in how my foundation applies on my skin, and I’m even able to use less. Excited to try more from Dr.Gross because this serum has definitely sold me! Believe the hype!
