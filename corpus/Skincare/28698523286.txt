A great cleanser, I struggle with oily skin and have a lot of hyperpigmentation. I’ve only been using this for a couple of weeks and it’s leaves my face feeling hydrated but not oily. I also heard it has good benefits for hyperpigmentation so hopefully in a couple of months I’ll be able to tell the difference. I bought the mini version, but I’ll definitely be going back to buy the bigger one. nan
