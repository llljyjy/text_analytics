I cannot say enough good things about this 3-in-1 cleanser! Firstly, it smells divine, like a fresh bouquet of roses. Secondly, you can use this balm with or without water, making it the ultimate travel companion! I am horrible about washing my face at night, but I can rub this on for a few minutes, then simply wipe it away. It took my waterproof mascara off with a breeze! Thirdly, it’s non-drying. After wiping off, my face feels soft and smooth. And, lastly, it can be used as a deep moisture mask! What’s not to love?!*Disclaimer* I received a free sample of this product, but opinions are my own and honest. I LOVE THIS STUFF! Heaven In A Tub!!!
