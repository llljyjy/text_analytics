I highly recommend this product! If you’re on the fence get it! I personally was worried about breaking out because I’m acne prone and have never used a cleansing balm before. But I did not get any breakouts and it leaves my skin feeling clean and glowy. A little goes a long way. So easy and gets makeup off better than makeup wipes, and more environmentally friendly since you’re not wasting all those wipes. I still double cleanse with this and a cerave cleanser. love this cleansing balm!
