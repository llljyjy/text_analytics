I received this complimentary product from Influenster for review purposes and I love Tula skin products! This mask is so easy to use and no mess! When applying to your clean face, you can either have it dry or damp skin. But I prefer dry, easier to apply. Leave for at least 10mins then rinse. After using the Tula stick mask, my face tone up more on cheek area and around the lips.  Skin softer, and more clear! Definitely recommend this product. Great size! Easy to use!
