I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox for reviewing. I am not normally one who loves face masks, but this one is really good! I have sensitive/acne prone skin, and some masks have even made my face worse but this one did not! I use it once a week and can already see a difference in the texture/appearance of my skin. Great product! Must have mask!
