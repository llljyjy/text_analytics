I love the Charlotte tilbury magic cream. It is a thick consistency and it moisturizes your skin well, afterwards it left my skin glowing. I use it under makeup and it makes my base smoother and my makeup look skin like over top. I included me wearing makeup and a picture of my applying it. Left glowing skin
