I received Clinique wrinkle eye cream from Influenster to review. I’ve used it and I could tell a little difference but not a lot. Which I’m 53 and don’t sleep a lot at night because my husband snores almost all night long. It made my skin feel soft. I’d recommend people trying it because it might work better for someone else.
