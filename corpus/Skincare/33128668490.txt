This is a high quality eye cream. Upon first use, I noticed there is no fragrance and the cream feels more like a gel. It glides on smooth and leaves the skin around the eye and brow bone soft and silky. I noticed that it works really well for getting rid of under eye circles and puffiness in the short term and makes the skin around the eyes feel firmer over time. I would definitely purchase this product in the future. Silky smooth
