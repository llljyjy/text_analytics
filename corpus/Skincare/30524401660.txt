I love Shiseido skincare. This sunscreen is the best I have ever tried. I have really dry skin and this keeps my skin hydrated all day. It has  hyaluronic acid and helps protect from harmful UV rays plus pollution. It’s a lightweight, daily moisturizing sunscreen cream that absorbs quickly. It’s good for dryness and anti-aging.
