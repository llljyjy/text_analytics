Let me start off by saying I have oily/sensitive/acne-prone skin. I’ve tried TO Niacinamide serum and the Cos de BAHA Niacinamide serum before this. Both left a tacky feel to my skin afterwards so I was looking for something that would dry down well. I’ve  heard great things about FAB’s Niacinamide serum and heard that it helped a lot with dark spots and discoloration so I went ahead and purchased it. Tried it out for a month and realized that although it dries down nicely, it broke me out and didn’t do much to lighten my dark spots. I really wanted this product to work for me mostly because I love the texture of it so much, but I would get new pimples throughout the week with this product. The dropper wasn’t an issue for me as it was for other people. I have it sitting straight in my skincare fridge and I’ve never had product spills or build up on the top of the dropper. I think my skin is just really sensitive to the citric acids in this serum. Wanted to love it, but...
