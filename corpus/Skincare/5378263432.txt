An overall non-functional and cheap product. First of all, this product pales in comparison to Vaseline when you leave it overnight and it also smells and feels a lot like Victoria’s Secrets older lip glosses that came in a tube. Secondly, the packaging of this lip balm is absolutely stupid. I hate dipping my fingers in this little jar especially when I have long nails or I am out and about or I’ve already forgotten that I’ve put on hand sanitizer or lotion. The applicator itself is ridiculous as well. It’s about 2 in long and there is nowhere to put it. I feel like both products are extremely unsanitary. Lastly, the price ridiculous. like I mentioned Vaseline does a way better job and it’s so much cheaper if you’re serious about moisturizing your lips. Not worth it. A cheap and nonfunctional product
