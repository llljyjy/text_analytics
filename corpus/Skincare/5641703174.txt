I was so excited to try this and it did not disappoint!  The jar is heavy and feels so luxurious, the product itself is creamy and reminds me a little of LM face cream. It absorbs into the skin beautifully and is absolutely the best face cream Iâ€™ve ever used. There is no heavy scent and when I use this at night, my skin is flawless in the morning! Because of the hefty price tag, I try not to use this every night, and there is no need to. After 1 use my skin looked amazing, I used this with the hyaluronic serum and it far exceeded my expectations! My skin looked glowy, smooth, and overall healthy. I highly recommend this! Exceeded my expectations!
