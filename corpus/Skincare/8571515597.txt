I have used the regular confidence in a cream a couple years ago, it was like a deluxe size. I liked it but at that time I was trying new products and something broke me out and I wasn’t sure if it was this or something else so I stopped using it. I definitely have dry skin that can get textured feeling if I don’t exfoliate like every other day. I used this product for almost 3 weeks now once if not twice a day. The ingredients are really good, I like the thick consistency. It absorbs semi quick and it doesn’t pill or make my make up pill. There’s a scent to it that tends to linger after you put it on for a little bit but it smells really nice and kind of luxurious so it doesn’t bother me at all. My only complaint is I feel like it’s not hydrating enough for my skin even when I use a hyaluronic acid serum before hand. I still feel like I need to put either another moisturizer or oil afterwards. I haven’t seen any fine line reduction or spot reduction/evening of complexion but I didn’t really expect to at only 3 weeks. But overall I like it. I like it
