This product is ok but I can’t really rave about it because the itty bitty sample wasn’t enough for more than two applications. I prefer a light scent for my facial lotions and this has none. It was light and not heavy on the skin so that’s a plus. It might be really nice but I didn’t have enough to make such a statement. Itty Bitty
