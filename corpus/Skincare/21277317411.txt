I had the pleasure of testing Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum for free as part of the Topbox Circle Product Review Program. As I am a fan of Laneige products, I was really looking forward to see what this innovative product had in store for me!  The gorgeous packaging and easy-to-read text made it simple to read and be informed about what to expect.  As the advertising boasted benefits such as skin hydration, skin firming, and improving elasticity, I was pleased to find out the claims were true. Not only did I see and feel the benefits claimed, but I also loved the fact that my skin never felt heavy while the serum was on. A little (1-3 drops) certainly went a long way! As the product is enriched with a unique formula consisting of Blue hyaluronic acid (containing clean deep sea algae) and peptides to help with the skin’s natural moisture barrier, I did see a difference in the appearance of my skin health (over a one week testing period). As an added bonus, I loved that I did not experience any ’breakouts’ throughout.This serum is a game changer! It gave me absolute certainty that when I applied it, I could trust that the ingredients would work their magic over time! I will most certainly be purchasing this again, and I have already recommended it to friends! #gotitfree #topboxcircle #trywithtopbox Moisturization Miracle!
