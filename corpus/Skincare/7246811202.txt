I’ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks now and you can see the after/before photos. I’m a big fan of the way this product has made my skin look and feel.  I can visibly see reduced lines and dark spots not only under my eyes but on other areas of my face. I will mention that it was a bit too much for my skin to jump in with a morning and night time routine. I found that out the hard way with some peeling. But I’ve gone to only night time now and that has greatly improved any issues I had. I also want to say that this product and packaging is gorgeous. I actually like reaching for this bottle every night to pump on the lid and see the 3 serums come out together so I can mix them all up and apply. Face lift in a bottle
