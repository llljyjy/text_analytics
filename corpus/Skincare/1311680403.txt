Unlike some other reviewers, I don’t think this product is that terrible. I leave it in the freezer and I put it on first thing in the morning while I’m making my first cup of coffee. it’s a really nice way to wake up my skin for the day and bring down any puffiness. With that being said, I do agree with other reviewers in that the holes for the note and mouth are WAY too small. The photo of the mask online makes the mouth hole look like it’s a decent size, however, when actually wearing the mask it’s really small and only my top lip is through the mouth hole. Nose hole is also quite small and I can feel the silicone digging in a bit while I wear it. I think with a couple of design tweaks this could be a really great product. nan
