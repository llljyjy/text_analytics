If you’re not bothered by a little stickiness and strong perfume scent for a few moments after application, this is your holy grail. It’s cleared up my random breakouts, polished off old dry skin patches, lifted and firmed my dehydrated and tired skin. Wears just fine under other skin products and makeup. No lifting or pilling up. nan
