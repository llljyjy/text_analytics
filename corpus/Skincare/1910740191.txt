A very rich cream…it feels luxurious on application and zaps dryness. I couldn’t use this as my main spf or moisturizer during the day (as “day ware”) because an SPF of only 15 doesn’t cut it when you’re pale, half Irish and have a history of skin cancer. In fact, I wish the average minimum would be 35, safety first, yada yada.It’s a pretty nice moisturizer though, didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, pleasant and light scent, the hydration could have been a bit longer lasting… nan
