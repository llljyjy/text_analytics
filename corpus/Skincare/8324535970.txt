it’s definitely pigmented and feels nice on the lips. don’t really agree with the size for the price but why i give it two stars is because its seems to dry out my lips. if i forget to wear it for one day, my lips are extremely dry and ashy. even more dry then when I started using it. it’s a no for me dries lips out
