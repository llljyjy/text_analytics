What a luxurious item. I’ve been using this retinol serum for  about two weeks every night before I go to sleep and when I wake up, the skin around my eyes are not as wrinkly, they seem tight. It has evened out the delicate areas on my face and it is really fun to mix the first time you get the product. It contains retinol powder in a separate capsule that you mix so your product is fresh as can be when you start applying. I would recommend this product, I can’t wait to see my skin after I have used up the whole tube. I sampled this as a promotion item, all opinions are my own.
