I am thankful I was chosen to review this product.  I received a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox to sample for my honest opinion.  I found that the sample was quite small, but I was able to use it for about 3 days. It was definitely assisting with the dry skin around my eyes that I get this time of year.  I felt that it absorbed well, but I can not really attest to the benefits that it can provide, as the sample was just too small for me to be able to use it consistently.  I think if I had a larger sample, I would have been able to review it better.  That being said, I would be open to purchasing it in the future.  I would recommend.  Thank you  #topboxcircle and #clinique for giving me the chance to try. nan
