I received this products as a gift, all thoughts and opinions are my own :)I’ll start out by saying I have acne prone skin, and I get super nervous when trying new products because 8/10 times I break out from them.I absolutely love the Shiseido Ultimune Power Infusing Anti-Aging Serum, I needed the smalles bit to cover my face and my skin felt SO smooth and looked great all day! I didn’t get oily or dry, and I didn’t get 1 single new pimple day of using or the day after! This time of year I get dry and flaky and I didn’t see one flake of dry skin once I applied the serum. It’s pricey but worth it! nan
