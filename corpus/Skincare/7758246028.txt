I’ve noticed since starting to use this product that there have been slight improvements to my skin, mostly in the tone overall. It’s not too tingly or strong, which is good for my skin that tends to be dry. It’s also easy to use as the pump works really well. I haven’t noticed extreme changes to my skin, but since it hasn’t irritated it I will continue to use to see if the slight changes I’m seeing continue. It also absorbs quickly so it’s easy to put moisturizer on top of it, which is suggested. Easy to use and works well
