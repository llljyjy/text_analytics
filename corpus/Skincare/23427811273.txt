Does not work. Overpriced for such a mediocre product. I did 5 applications each day for 10 days straight and there was no difference at all in the shade of my teeth. The product burned my gum lines and inner parts of my lips, even with applying the lip care. The product does not taste good at all. The product does not stay on your teeth long enough to be absorbed. One of the vials I received contained no product in it and was completely empty. Because of this, I could not use the vial and it had to be disposed of. I contacted their corporate office to inform them of the damaged product I received and they never contacted me back. I would not recommend this product at all. It does not work. Does not work
