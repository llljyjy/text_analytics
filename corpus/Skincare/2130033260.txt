Okay so I’m grateful that I got to try this on for 7 days from this #bestofbeautyvoxbox @sc @clarinsusa  just like the other serum that was part of the Beauty vox box The scent is fresh, texture is how you expect any serum….So what I did is combined this with the other serum that they had I think I didn’t combine it until day 3? But it works best together with the other serum. however I must say, the price is a tad bit steep… but I guess it’s cheaper than other alternatives , This is greaaat
