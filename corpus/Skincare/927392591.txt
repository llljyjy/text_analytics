Eh, this was just ok. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin after using it for several weeks. Also, I was not impressed with the packaging. It was difficult to open the bottle, and even more difficult to open and pour the powder in. I think Kiehl’s could do a better job of making it easier to mix. Just ok...
