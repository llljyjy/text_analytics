I have very oily acne prone skin, I use tretinoin at night so this moisturizer has been a huge help for my skin. I also apply it 15 minutes after my tretinoin every night and it has completely changed the way my skin reacts to the prescription. In the winter I use more of it but in the humid summer a little goes a long way. No oily residue, just a smooth finish and no clogging of pores or tingling. Perfect moisture for oily skin
