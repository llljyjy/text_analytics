I love this set for travel!  3 of my all time favorite products are in this - the vitamin c rose oil, the eye cream, and the resurfacing night serum.  I have these products in full sizes and will continue to buy!!  I have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin. It’s also brighter and more supple now.  The marine algae eye cream is my usual night eye cream (I use the peptide eye gel during the day).  The Omega cream has a slightly unpleasant smell so I find myself not using this as my usual night cream (I can’t really get over the scent). Love These Products!
