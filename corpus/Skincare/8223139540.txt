I’ve tried at least 40 different moisturizers and this is the only one besides Belif water bomb that actually works. I have used this product since 2017 and get compliments on how soft my face is. In the winter, I have the most dry flakey skin especially around my nose and this takes care of it! It’s very creamy and fluffy and you can still feel how good it is on your skin hours after application. Very lux and it WORKS. THE BEST FOR WINTER SKIN
