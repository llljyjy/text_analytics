I have used pretty much every form of self tanner and for this price range you think it would smell great (it does), use multiple times (no, you probably only get three to four applications PER thing. Thats almost 8$ a pop, which doesn’t sound bad, but compared to a Target brand, it IS!) and be easy to use (ABSOLUTELY NOT). Yes I get it, learning curve and all that. Girl, I have been using self tanner since I was 15. I’m 24, and let me tell you...I look a calico cat every time I use this. I tried rubbing in my lotion better, didn’t help. Tried more drops, honestly just made it worse. Tried to blend it better, and a timer set to 2 minutes didn’t help. Yes, I have a blending mit. After the 4 applications I used of this, I hate to say it...but I hate this stuff. I don’t understand if I am the stupid one when looking at all these other reviews or if everyone else is just a magician. I have been a calico cat all month
