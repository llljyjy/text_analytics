Okay I’m surprised I really like these. I’ve used acne patches before that have sucked, either didn’t stick properly, or just did nothing but tear my skin off and leave an open wound, but these ones are great. They stick well, the pimple shrinks over night, and it does not tear your skin off. It even shrunk whitehead pimples despite what some of the other reviews have said. Would definitely recommend and purchase again. I just wish for the cost there were more than just 20. So Far So Good!
