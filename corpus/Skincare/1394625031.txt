I love this cleanser and use it 2-3 times a day depending if I work out. It doesn’t strip my skin or make it feel tight. It does make it feel clean and have seen my skin clear up and even out. I no longer have combo skin and with wearing masks there are the occasional pimples that I follow up this cleaners with the cleansing acne pads and clears everything right up before it even starts. I’ve been using this for 3+ years now and love it. I also enjoy his other products and do see me choosing another cleaners unless this discontinued. nan
