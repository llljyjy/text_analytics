This serum has some powerful ingredients and since I have very sensitive skin, I can only use it about 1-2 times a week. It’s been so effective at lightening the dark spots from the hormonal acne I get that I plan to increase the times I use it. The only issue I have with this serum is the strong scent, luckily it doesn’t linger and goes away after a short while. Super effective!
