This serum is true to it’s name “MAGIC“ serum. When using it I definitely felt mike skin appeared more youthful. It gave me a beautiful glow, my lines appeared to be less visible.  The texture is nice and absorbs nicely. It worked great under my moisturizer.  It is definitely hydrating. I don’t know if I would use a moisturizer on top on a really hot and humid day. My skin looked like it was glowing from within. Feeling Magical with an INSTANT GLOW
