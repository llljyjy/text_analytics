This is my new favorite self tanning mousse! I’ve never used a clear foam before and I am in love, it also barely has a scent!! The color was great. I typically use st tropaz ultra dark foam, but wanted something not too crazy. This gave me wonderful colorful! I was skeptical as I was told I would get more of a “glow”, and I wanted more than that. Glad I gave it a shot because it gave great color. 10/10!!! MUST TRY
