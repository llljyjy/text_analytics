I do love this product although I stopped using it because it was just to difficult to get the product out of the dropper. I was on my second bottle because I did see a difference in my skin. I started back using this product and I can tell it works because my skin is brighter and smooth. It helps with hyperpigmentation. I will buy it again. They need to fill this bottle to the top ! Especially for 70 bucks! Good product but hard to use !
