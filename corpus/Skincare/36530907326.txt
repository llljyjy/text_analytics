This is the most amazing make up remover! It works like magic, literally melts off your make-up and makes your skin feel wonderful. It also smells excellent! A little bit goes a long way, you just swipe a little bit out of the tub and wipe it on your face. It has vitamin c and rosehip oil- which moisturizes and hydrates your face without making your skin sticky or greasy. Fantastic makeup remover!
