I was really excited to try The Sunscreen from NÉCESSAIRE. I’ve been using it daily since I received it and I do like it for the most part. It’s a little thicker in consistency than some other daily sunscreens I’ve used, but it doesn’t leave any white streaks after use. With that said, it does feel a little heavy so I definitely do not apply with any other products. I think the consistency probably makes more sense for the body, but it’s not bad for the face either. The ingredients are great, so I’ll continue using it. I just wouldn’t say it’s my absolute favorite. nan
