(Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project) I love this!!! I prefer to my makeup to look glowy so I had high expectations and this did not disappoint. It applied really easy, just like a normal moisturizer. It feels really hydrating and made my skin look glassy and pretty. On its own it looks beautiful but under foundation it still made my skin look dewy and lit from within. I definitely recommend this if you love the glass skin look. Glowy goodness
