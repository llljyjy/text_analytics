I started using this product to help with a skin rash I developed on my cheeks. I don’t know what the rash was, but it was some kind of dermatitis. Little surface bumps that were a little itchy and did not pop like a pimple would. Within a couple of days, the rash started to calm down a lot. Within a week, it was gone! I used this product twice a day, all over face. I also spot treated the bumps in the evening. My skin did become dry, but that helped it heal. Once the bumps were nearly gone, I started to apply this and then added a light moisturizer. I have used that combination ever since, and there is no sign of the rash. I feel like my skin looks more clear, overall. I also think it is helping to lighten the post inflammatory pigmentation very nicely. I honestly don’t think I will ever stop using this beautiful product. It’s absolutely wonderful. Cleared dermatitis in a week, improved immediately
