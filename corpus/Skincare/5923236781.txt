Didn’t work. I have pretty average dark circles (not from hyperpigmentation) and thought this might help me get away with less concealer. But nope. I’ve been using it off/on months I see no results. It also stings my skin, which is odd because my skin isn’t sensitive to acids/etc. Too bad the bottle is so big; a waste of a lot of product. Didn't work
