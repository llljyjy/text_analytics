I’m obsessed! I’ve only been using for a few weeks but I can tell a huge difference in when I use the serum vs when I don’t. I do wish the dropper was a little smaller (since you only need 3 drops) and the smell was a little more present, but those are very minimal complaints compared to how well it works. It works!
