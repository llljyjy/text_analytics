I actually really like the products but the jar of treatment, which is what I was most excited to try, came very separated and impossible to mix back together. Unfortunately Sephora won’t replace it because it’s in a set. If you’re looking to try out the products maybe look for a sample first instead of buying this. ok product, but don’t buy this bundle
