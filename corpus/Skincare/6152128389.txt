I will be the first to say that the price on these is a lot, but for what they do? They’re unbeatable. I get deep and painful nodules thanks to stress/hormones/etc, the type that left alone can be almost a month start to finish. These patches speed up the healing process SO MUCH. They make it easy to take care of those spots! They raise the nodule to the surface, drain it, and help prevent scarring. One of these followed by a more basic hydrocolloid patch cuts the healing time down to three days, it’s absolutely insane.I will say if you’re expecting these to perform like a hydrocolloid patch, there are less pricy ones on the market. I like using these in conjunction with COSRX for the best results. If you’re looking to avoid salicylic acid like me, these are a great alternative to the Peace Out ones. I think the reduced healing time, comfort of wear, and great end result make these worth the splurge to keep on hand for your really bad spots. Not your momma's acne dot!
