The Shiseido Urban Environment Oil Free Mineral Sunscreen is a lightweight sunscreen that works great as a base under makeup. I was sent this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have acne-prone skin that doesn’t react well to many sunscreens, so I was initially hesitant to try this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it doesn’t make me break out or malt my skin react in any way. I do feel like it made a good base under makeup compared to my other daily sunscreen. It’s a very watery consistency, but I actually liked that and thought it made it super easy to blend into my skin without leaving it greasy. I took away one star because I do think it leaves a slight white cast. It isn’t bad and is covered if you are wearing it under makeup, but you can just barely tell. Overall though, a good option for sun protection. Good SPF for Under Makeup
