I received retinol remix complimentary from Innbeauty. First impression, I love the product packaging & I have already been a fan of their slushy moisturizer so I knew I would love this product too. I have been using retinol since 2012 & if you are not, this is a must in your skincare routine to continue to see youthful skin. That being said my skin has built up a tolerance to use it nightly- I use it 7 nights a week. Pro tip: I dispense the product on the back of my hand so if there is any leftover I rub on the tops of my hands. I love the texture of this retinol it is a creamy gel-like consistency that goes on smooth. It absorbs into the skin almost immediately. I do wait for it to dry before I put on my moisturizer as a last step. I love the glow and the clean & clear skin that comes along with the results all while making my fine lines less visible. What makes this product different than any other retinol I have tried is that it contains hyaluronic acid, tranexamic acid, and peptides, all while soothing the skin with chamomile. I have completely switched to this retinol because it is a clean, vegan, & effective product that I absolutely recommend you try. Glowy, youthful skin ahead
