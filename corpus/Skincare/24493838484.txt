This product from Clinique goes on very smooth, and is not heavy like many creams. It was a complimentary product from Clinique and Influenster in return for my honest review. Now when first opened you’ll notice it has a scent (although fragrance free) and may be put off. Don’t worry, it’s just the ingredients. A little goes a long way, so don’t be fooled by the size. It absorbs in about 3 minutes and you can put on your makeup after if you so choose. I can’t speak to the wrinkle reduction portion yet as it’s only been a week, but I can say my skin feels nicely hydrated! I am a fan for sure and hope to see visible results soon. Goes on smooth and light
