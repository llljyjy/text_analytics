This serum applies very smoothly, and absorbed very easily. It helped even out my skin texture and covered up my dry patches for a few hours, especially during these dry Canadian winters. The scent was not over powering. I loved using this mostly at night. I have used this a couple times a week for 3 weeks and am very happy with the results so far; my skin definitely feels more softer and supple. I am grateful for this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox. Really like this serum
