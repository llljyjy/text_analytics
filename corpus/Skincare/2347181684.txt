If they ever stop making this stuff it will be the biggest heartbreak of my life. I hate wearing foundation. And sunscreen. I have lots of redness in my face, so I obviously have tried my hardest to do everything but wear heavy foundation or thick sunscreen. I’m usually a cc crème girl, but that can make my face really shiny due to my oily skin. Enter tiger grass. I have had other Dr jart tiger grass products. I have the cream everyone swears by, but it just made me really oily, so I didn’t use it. I randomly bought this recently on a whim - thinking I could try it out, since it’s a different formula, and I’m SO GLAD I DID! It’s the perfect texture fur my skin, covers the redness, and doesn’t feel like makeup or sunscreen. I will wear this everyday from now on. 10/10 would recommend holy grail product
