The cream is very light and oily. I dont feel like it does much of anything especially compared to my old eye cream (banana bright eye cream by Olehenriksen). I also feel like it leaves wrinkle marks in my make up after I put it on top. I dont think I will be purchasing this cream again, definitely not worth the money. Not my FAV!
