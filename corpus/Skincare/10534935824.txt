I received this mask complimentary from Influenster and I really enjoyed using this mask! Applying it to my face was so easy, it just glides on with a smooth creamy texture. It washes off quickly with warm water (i’ve tried masks that harden so much within 5 min it truly is hard to wash off; however this one doesn’t feel hard or stiff) it feels clean and smooth, my face seems brighter with a few uses. I enjoyed the scent its almost a mellow floral scent I’m usually sensitive to scents and this one did not bother me at all. I definitely would recommend this to anyone but especially someone like me with combination to dry skin. You seriously need it! Tula Claydate is Amazing
