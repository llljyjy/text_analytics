I’ve been using Premier Cru The Cream for a couple of weeks now and my skin feels amazing!  A little goes a long way. My skin feels soft and extremely hydrated. I’ve noticed my fine wrinkles have almost disappeared. I was hoping my dark spots would have been diminished, but sadly they are still there. Oh well. My dry skin now feels amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the scent. I prefer unscented skincare.  #freeproduct Skin feels amazing
