I was scared to use this because of the % of retinol.  But have been using it for over 3 weeks now.  I love it.  I love waking up and looking in the mirror seeing a smoother skin.  I thought this would really dry out my skin, but it hasnâ€™t done that.  I use this after my essence and afterwards I put on my KS retinol vitamin C moisturizer for nights.  In the morning i use Sobel Skin Hyaluronic Moisturizing cream.  Great product. A must have for my night time skincare routine
