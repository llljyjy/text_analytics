This is by far one of my favorite face washes I have used! A little bit truly does go a long way because it foams up so well. It definitely leaves my face feeling clean but not dry. I gave it four stars instead of five because of the fragrance. It does have a “clean“ smell which is a blend of linen and citrus to me and at first I actually liked it, but after continued use of it I wish the scent was milder or really that it was unscented. gentle and foamy!
