I absolutely love FENTY products but this was a no for me. It does not compare to the Dior lip oil, which I am obsessed with. The shine is there but itâ€™s not as hydrating and you get less product. The color appeared more clear on me rather than a sheer wash of color. If you like Dior, stick with that.. you get what you pay for! Just okay..
