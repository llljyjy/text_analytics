I’ve been using this for about a week and a half and wow! I love it! I have concerns with dry skin  and I was worried that the slight fragrance of this cream would make it worse, it didn’t...it actually helped it! My skin feels amazing and looks so much better. Plus, it actually smells good. My skin has firmer feel to it as well. I will definitely be buying this product. I’ve added a pic of myself without makeup and let me just tell you, this cream realky has made a difference. EVERYDAY USE!
