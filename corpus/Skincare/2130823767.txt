This is a watery, lightweight but moisturizing cream.  It absorbs into the skin quickly while leaving the skin feeling pumped and hydrated.  It would be a great moisturizer if you have oily skin, but might be a little too light if you have dry skin.  The bottle is a lot smaller than I thought, but would be great to throw in your bag/on the go. nan
