I love face creams and have tried lots and lots of them, and this one is definitely one of the better ones I’ve tried. It’s rich but sinks in fast, works well under makeup and even keeps my skin hydrated while using Tretinoin (with an additional face oil on top of this moisturizer). I had never heard of this brand and am very pleasantly surprised with how great it is. It does have a *very* faint fragrance but goes away almost immediately and I never really think about it. Great moisturizer
