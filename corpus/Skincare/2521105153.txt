I was looking for a matte, no white cast, easy to apply sunscreen and based on the description this product seemed like a good option. But it didnâ€™t work out for me; after an hour it melts into a film of oil on my face. It pills & balls up over my moisturizers during application. The only positive was no white cast & high SPF. nan
