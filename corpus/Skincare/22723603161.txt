I’ve been using this moisturizer for just under a week and I really like it! It’s hydrating, makes my skin glowy and smooth, and hasn’t caused any irritation for my super duper sensitive skin! It plays well with my minimal makeup routine, and I like the way it dispenses. A little bit goes a long way, Which is great considering the price! The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because of the SMELL of the product lol. I’m super sensitive to funky smells, and this smells really… musty. It’s unfortunate to have that smell right under my nose lol but it wears off after a while. Would give 5 stars, but…
