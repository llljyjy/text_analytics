I received this sample complimentary for review from Influenster. I just do love this essence, I have been using it daily since I received one month ago and I will be purchasing a replacement. I have noticed a change in the texture of my skin, I believe due to its hydrating properties as well as priming the skin for my other skincare products. This is the most important I believe,  the “priming“ of the face, it has affected the way my other skincare absorbs into my skin. I haven’t changed anything in my routine other than adding this step, and a positive difference is noted. I only gave 4 stars due to the price tag but otherwise it is a luxurious staple to have in your routine. My skin is softer and less textured. A small amount goes a long way, just tipping bottle onto fingers is the best way to use the least amount of product. I recommend! Smooth and hydrating, the perfect first step!
