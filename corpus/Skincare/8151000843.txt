I am totally blown away with Glow Recipes new Guava Vitamin C Bright Eye Gel Cream.  The texture is light like a gel, but moistures like a cream.  Nice scent, very light and not overpowering.  This stuff works!! The bags under my eyes look far lighter and smoother only after a few days of use.  It works well under makeup, but be sure to give it time to absorb into your skin before applying makeup.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again, worth it. Amazing!
