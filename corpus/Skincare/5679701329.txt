I received this toner gifted by Algenist. Today was my 10th day using this toner. After the first night, some blemishes on my chin stopped forming. Now they are faded to a tint of pink that is easily covered with my foundation. My pores also look healthier after ten days of use. They recommend using a SPF with it, which is probably why this toner works better than others Iâ€™ve tried since it probably has more serious mojo in it. I use it every morning and night, and leave it on just like a normal toner. My experience with this product has been great. better than your average toner
