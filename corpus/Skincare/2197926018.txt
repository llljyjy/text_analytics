LOVE.IT. I decided to give it a try when Sephora had this product on sale. I’ve only used (and use) their Skin Resurfacing Lactic Acid Cleanser recommended by my esthetician. In combination with this exfoliator my skin feels incredible. Smooth! I have been using the exfoliator for about a month now and my esthetician saw a positive difference in my skin: it’s much more hydrated!! Now to figure out an eye cream, haha. I’m 36 and only started getting into aging products (and just products like toners, serums etc). This is a gold mine. I use it almost daily when I don’t get lazy with my skin care routine. I don’t have sensitive skin and I didn’t get any irritation. nan
