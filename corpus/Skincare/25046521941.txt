I have a combination skin type and unfortunately this rich moisturizing cream doesn’t work well for me in my oily zone. It doesn’t cause breakouts but it makes my skin look oilier and shinier under makeup than with the very lightweight gel type moisturizers I typically use. This moisturizer does however work very well for my cheeks (normal type skin), under the eyes, and especially the neck. After three weeks of use I can see some improvements in skin firmness in those areas. Mixed results on my combination type skin
