I received this from Influenster and I was excited to try it.  Sunscreen is essential for me as part of my anti-aging skincare routine and I like it when they’re glowy.  The consistency of this is kind of chunky and weird looking when you squeeze it out, even after massaging the tube as the instructions suggest.  When applied to the face though it does smooth out and give a nice glow.  It doesn’t feel greasy or chunky on the skin, which is a win.  I’ve tried it a couple times and I wonder if it effects my foundation makeup slightly.  I felt like the finish was the slightest bit more patchy/less smooth than normal.    I think I do prefer a thinner formula personally, like the Supergoop Glowscreen, but this is not a bad alternative, especially if not wearing makeup on top. Nice, glowy sunscreen
