I have very dry sensitive skin, It is a nightmare when I look for moisturizer, I tried this ginseng renewing cream, just the cream not anything else, so maybe use the whole skin products,  the container is so small so hard to tell after a few days, because only use it for 4 days, and I think it was ok, not super moisture, I didn’t notice hydration more then normal,  I can’t tell firm overtime cause in 4 days it is too soon to tell, and very pricey. Maybe use the whole skin products for better resul
