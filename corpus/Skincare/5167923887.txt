When you put it on your finger, feels like a normal cream but when applying it to your face, it literally becomes like watery and hard to spread out across your face as opposed to other facial creams I have tried. You have to take small amounts at a time to apply evenly, otherwise if you take a large amount, itâ€™s very difficult to spread it out equally. I got this as a sample and not buying it. nan
