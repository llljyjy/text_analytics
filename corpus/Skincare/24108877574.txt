This product could not have come into my life at a better time. I struggle with creases left by makeup gathering in crows feet.  This product is light in color and in texture.  A little goes a long way.  The ingredients are perfect for skincare based makeup products.  After only 3 weeks the area where I felt insecure was able to plump again, not to mention the creases ceased. If youâ€™re new to makeup be sure to have this clean product in your aresenal.  If you are not new, add it anyway.  What is better than clean skincare used as makeup base? MUST HAVE - A+ for OLEHENRIKSON
