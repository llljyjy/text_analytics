I have been using over 2 months now & can say I enjoy this a lot. To be honest I only suffer from small lines around my eyes, not so much dark circles, and I am interested in preventative skincare. I also wear contacts, this product does not bother my eyes or migrate. The key is do not scoop the product and then apply, think of it like a balm, just lightly rub the product on your finger and tap under eyes. I never feel it is too heavy and I wear a mask for 10+ hours in a hospital setting. Something about it makes me feel more awake when I apply it before work. I only use once a day because I have sensitive skin and use dermatologist prescribed medications.  The smell is not too overwhelming for my eyes or for me personally, it does not smell like an artificial sweet berry scent, it smells more authentic, and does not fade with use. I also use the Argan  oil and this recommended I pair the two, but that is much too heavy for me. I use the Argan sticky on my face, avoiding my eye area. Lovely Product - Use Lightly!
