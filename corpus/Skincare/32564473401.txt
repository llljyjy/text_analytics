This product was pretty good. It smelled amazing and I felt like it made my skin softer. I have pretty sensitive skin and it did not seem to irritate it at all. Not sure how well it works in the long run with anti-aging, but I liked the short term effects of it. Itâ€™s pretty pricey, but a nice product. nan
