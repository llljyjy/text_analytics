This barrier booster orange vitamin C essence is said to instantly double-hydrate the skin, improve brightness and defend against polluting free radicals. It is exactly what I need.

The essence smells so good, exactly like fresh oranges! Fermented orange abstract helps nourish and refresh skin. Orange stem cells provide antioxidant protection. Vitamin C helps brighten skin.The texture is thick but easy to apply. It gets absorbed easy and quick as well. After the essence, I continue my regular routine and apply serum and moisturizer.
