At first I was super skeptical because I have super sensitive skin. I decided to start using it at night and to my surprise my skin loved it & so did I. It’s super light, doesn’t have a strong scent and it absorbs immediately. Mind you that during winter my skin is super dry, this is the perfect addition to my daily face skin care routine.  #influester Love this!
