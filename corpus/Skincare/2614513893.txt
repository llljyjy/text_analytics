At first when I started using it, I felt my face was so clean after doing my routine of removing my masks. A few weeks later, the cleanser made my face so dry that I got a patch near my cheek. I felt that it stripped my skin dry to the point I had to use another brand to balance the texture of my face again. It will definitely keep your face clean. I think it work okay if you quickly moisturize your face after rinsing the cleanser off. Started great & ended bad.
