This eye balm applied very smoothly under my eyes and felt really nice. There was an instant cooling sensation and my skin did feel more hydrated. However, I didn’t really notice an effect on fine lines. There is a subtle blue/silvery sheen to the balm which makes your eyes look brighter. Overall, it’s a nice hydrating eye balm that I’ll continue to use - but not my #1. Hydrating eye balm.
