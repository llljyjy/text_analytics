While I didn’t have any major issues with this face cream, I also didn’t find there to be anything particularly special about it (at least in the course of finishing a small jar). This moisturizer has a nice consistency somewhere between a cream and a gel that absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or looking shiny. It sits well under makeup and doesn’t cause any issues when applying makeup over it. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling as moisturized as other creams that I’ve used so I prefer to use it as a day cream. It didn’t cause any irritation to my skin or breakouts. It has a rather strong perfumey scent that isn’t unpleasant and neutralizes quickly but may be too powerful for some people. The packaging is attractive but not especially unique. I didn’t notice any major differences in the firmness or lift of my skin, but I don’t have any significant issues with that yet, and it’s hard to tell with a smaller jar to sample if these effects would have been more noticeable overtime. Overall, I found this moisturizer to be fine, but I likely wouldn’t purchase it again. Not my favorite but not bad
