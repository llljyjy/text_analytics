I really like this eye cream. It’s definitely hydrating! I have dark circles and my eyes seem easily tired because of it and this helps to give them a nice glow. A little goes a long way. Don’t put on too much because it’ll pill (reason why I took out one star)You get your money’s worth considering how little you have to use and the amount it brings. nan
