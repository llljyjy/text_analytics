I was chosen for glow recipe to try this product and give honest thoughts! Let me say i was really really impressed! I had a dry cracked patch around my nose from major weather chances and instantly after one use reduced the itchiness and pain and redness and was healed completely in under two weeks. Skin felt smoother, looked healthier, and felt more balanced. I really couldnt recommend it enough the only thing i did not like was the lather. It doesnt really lather much and has more of a lotiony feel, different from their blueberry cleaner. However i think that is more of personal preference i personally like a sudsy lather but this may not bother you. Dispite the later i think this may have to replace my cleanser soley because the benefits are amazing and outweigh any cons this has even convinced me i may need the avocado serum haha A must have for combo, dry or winter cracked skin!
