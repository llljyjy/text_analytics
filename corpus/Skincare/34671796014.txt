ive always had trouble finding a tinted spf that ACTUALLY works on my skin (my skin is very very tan).  i have oily skin and so the reviews worried me, but as soon as i purchased i knew it would be my new fav. yes, if you leave it on your skin without rubbing it in, it will leave a greasy, disgusting finish, but if you work it in properly its moisturizing, not oily, and gives you a subtle glow (not the type of glow you get when your face is covered in oil, but rather like a highlight).  i dont use any makeup product on top of this, only niaciminide and moisturizing cream underneath. it truly is magic !! best tinted spf ever for oily skin
