Finally, the perfect cleanser. I wear a pretty sturdy mineral sunscreen which is really difficult to remove. This is the first cleanser that handles it easily without having to rub at it or use micellar water which used to strip my already dry skin and end up wrecking white facecloths. My dry mature skin loves it. I am so relieved that when I put on that sunscreen I am not dreading taking it off!! I love that there is no scent and my face feels silky afterwards. I love this cleanser!
