I’ve been using this product for about a month and a half. The first couple uses, my skin got extremely dry but then it regulated and started acting as usual. This cleanser does a good job of getting rid of makeup (spf, blush, mascara, lipgloss, and highlighter is all i wear) and I usually do not need to double cleanse. At the store, though, the worker helping me out said it would get rid of the bumps/acne on my forehead but it made no difference. It’s an okay cleanser that get’s the job done. Nothing special
