I received this micro essence treatment lotion as a free sample for my honest review from Influenster. It is a thin liquid which seems not much more than water feeing but after using it morning and night for over a week it seems to have softened my forehead lines ever so slightly. I like that this does not have a strong scent. I would recommend making the bottles more spill proof (maybe the larger sizes are?) Because it is a large cost to risk losing so much if it gets accidentally knocked over. I have been applying with my hands after washing and before the rest of my beauty routine. nan
