Pros: Good consistency-not too oily..kind of like a hybrid of a serum and oil. Doesn’t clog pores or cause breakouts on my dry sensitive skin. Doesn’t really have a fragrance so more gentle than most vitamin c products which have a lot fragrances or citric oils. I like the pump and packaging—all you need is one pump. The product blends onto the skin effortlessly and doesn’t just sit on top of the skin.Cons: Price. Also…Not 100% sure how effective this is in reducing dark spots and helping with sun damage. I have a lot of sun spots and haven’t seen an improvement. Therefore, I’m not sure I’ll repurchase this because for the price point, I expected results.Maybe it just didn’t show any results on my skin but this product is definitely worth giving a try! Still waiting for results…
