I have normal to combo skin, with redness on my cheeks, and have been using this serum for years. I recently thought - what is this actually doing for me? Is it worth the price? There are XYZ serums that claim to do the same thing for half the price. So I switched to something else. I used the other product consistently for ~4 months to give it a fair chance to work and boy oh boy, did I realize how much the Advanced Génifique serum was doing for my skin! I switched back and my skin is back to being clear, redness is improved, combo skin is balanced (those dry patches under/around my mouth are gone) and my skin is SOFT. I’ll never question it’s worth again. Holy Grail in my skin care routine - I use it daily in the morning. Must Have Serum
