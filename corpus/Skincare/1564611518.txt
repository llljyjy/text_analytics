I received this Clinique serum from top box in exchange for a review. #FreeProduct.I have to say out of the three clinical repair products. This is my favorite. I really enjoyed the texture of the serum and how smooth it felt on my skin. I do wish the sample was bigger as I would like to see the longer effects, I did feel like the serum  made my skin plumper, but I would like to see what it would do to uneven skin tone and fine lines. I will definitely buy this product in the future. Must try !
