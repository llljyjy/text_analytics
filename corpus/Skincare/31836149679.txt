I started Accutane two years ago and I was on the hunt for a hydrating lip product since my lips were always dry and cracked. I bought this product and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve tried so many of the flavors: berry, grapefruit, lemon sorbet, apple lime, and mint choco. I loved all of them and they smell so nice and moisturize your lips like no other. I put this on during the day too, not only at night and it keeps my lips soft and smooth. They give a pretty shine too. Favorite lip product
