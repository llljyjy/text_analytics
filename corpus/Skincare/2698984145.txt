Just when I thought the Vinoperfect collection couldn’t get any better (seriously, the Vinoperfect serum is my go-to for getting rid of acne marks/spots) - this essence comes along and makes my serum TWICE as effective. It’s brightening, hydrating & smoothing - an actual treatment versus other essences that only serve to build hydration (which is fine but sometimes you’re trying to improve upon something and have actual skincare goals). It’s not a lie if I tell you that I have a backup ready to go so that I never run out! Great addition to your brightening routine
