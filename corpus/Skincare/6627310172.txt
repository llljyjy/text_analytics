This sunscreen is quite interesting. I’ve gotten 2 tubes of this product and the first tube felt a little gritty, and the second was buttery smooth. In terms of application it’s smooth and weightless. And though yes, it is as advertised on the name and is indeed unseen I do feel that my face feels...slightly greasy. I believe the package does say it works as a primer so perhaps that’s why it feels like the way it does. I can see the appeal, but it’s not for me. Feels...Greasy
