This is my first time trying out a sunscreen which has a scent to it and I’m loving the subtle rose, hibiscus, and jasmine hint of it!This is my current fav sunscreen as it is a multi usage cream -primer, moisturizer, and SPF in one! Great for busy moms like me! It went on smoothly and lightweight. Goes on well under my makeup and left a glowing tint without any white cast!It is lightweight and doesn’t leave any greasy feeling. Recommended! Great all in one sunscreen
