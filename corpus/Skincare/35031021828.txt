This product works great after you get past the purging (it was very mild and only lasted a couple of weeks for me) and it’s at a really good price point. I’ve changed my skin care routine a bit, but this seems to have made my skin clearer, less prone to breakouts, and perhaps shrunk the appearance of my pores. Great product, great price.
