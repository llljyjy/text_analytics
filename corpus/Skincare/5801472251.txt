I have dry skin, so was looking for a good moisturizer. Decided to give this a try. After the first use, my face was burning for the entire night. It was so bad that i had to wash it off. I wanted to give it another try the next day but still got stinging sensation as soon as I applied. Definitely going to return this. Apparently it has essential oil in it that explains the burning n stinging feeling nan
