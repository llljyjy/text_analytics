I received this for free in exchange for my honest feedback from Influenster. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about using this at first, I love it! It doesn’t break me out, doesn’t make my eyes water, and doesn’t leave my skin red and painful. It smells good too which is a bonus. After a month of using my skin is smoother and honest to God less breakout prone. Love! Worth it!
