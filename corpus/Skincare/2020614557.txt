I bought this product by accident thinking it was their Vitamin C serum, but ended up loving it and not returning! I use it nightly. I can see improvements in fine lines and overall giving my skin a plumper, smoother, brighter look. It’s at a steep price point, but nice when you want to treat yourself! I’ll likely repurchase when I run out. nan
