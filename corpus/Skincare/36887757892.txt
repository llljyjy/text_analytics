Iâ€™ve been using this Summer Fridays vanilla lip balm for about a couple of weeks now and I absolutely love it! It really hydrates my lips which is perfect for dry Vegas weather. I use it as a lip mask at night and as a subtle shine on top of my lipstick during the day. Oh, it smells so good too! Dreamy vanilla lip balm!
