I received this estee lauder advanced night repair eye gel-cream completely free, in exchange for just giving my honest opinion, to be honest I already use this gel, and I like it a lot, I have been using it for several months and I like my skin is soft, smooth and from a very nice one I learned unlike other night creams this one is not greasy, to be honest I highly recommend it to my family and friends, and when I run out of my samples Iâ€™m going to buy them Fabulous
