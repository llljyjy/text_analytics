I’ve never been a person too brand loyal for facial cleansers, I’d probably just keep buying whatever was on sale or whatever I saw in the drugstore if not for this. I got a little one as a gift three years ago and have never loved a cleanser as much since. I bought the bigger size and it lasts forever! It makes my skin feel nice and I think it does a good job of removing makeup, even though I also use a remover with it. I don’t break out as much now that I have this + my skincare routine. It feels luxurious too and you can’t top that! Like a mini spa feeling in my day. My Holy Grail
