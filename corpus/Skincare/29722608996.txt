I use the Glow Recipe Pink Juice moisturizer in the daytime. At night, i like to use a “thicker“ moisturizer, and this is the perfect one for me. The ingredients and the gel-cream feel of it, it hydrates my skin overnight and it does not clog my pores, it doesn’t give me blackheads, it doesn’t break me out, which is what every other cream moisturizer does to my oily skin. It is perfect for me, for nighttime use. Excellent Nighttime Cream for Oily Skin
