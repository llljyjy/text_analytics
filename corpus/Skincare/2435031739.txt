This product was sent to me from influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. I have used several eyecreams in the past and will discontinue use after a few wears. This is the only one that I have been consistently reaching for and I keep it in my purse for on the go. I have really been enjoying the Ole Henriksen products! I’ll dab this all over my under eye area before bed and in the morning after I wash my face. This is the ONLY eye cream I’ve used that hasn’t burned my eyes. The texture is a nice consistency, it’s not super thick and can be worn under foundation and it doesn’t pill off my face. I don’t notice a scent but I do agree that it makes my under eyes looks brighter and more alive. I have some darker circles and I find that this brings a luminosity to my dull undereyes. I haven’t used it long enough to notice long term effects on my fine lines but it helps to at least temporarily plump that skin. Great for my sensitive eyes!
