My skin is very dry and somewhat texturized. I have tried several face oils before and donâ€™t notice much results. I decided to try Ren Everbalm Barrier Face Oil and my skin looks and feels glowy, hydrated and very well nourished. I do not get any redness or residue from the oil. I really love how it feels on my skin, so far I am really happy and will continue using it. nan
