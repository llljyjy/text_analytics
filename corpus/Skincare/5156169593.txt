Love this year round even in hot, humid, coastal SC. My acne prone combination skin has never had a bad reaction to these products and I break out easily with many new products just for being new. I use mineral makeup and it looks terrific with this underneath, even seems to stay on longer. I am not as clean with my routine as I would like and use this as an evening moisturizer after my Rx retinol and love the results. really nice
