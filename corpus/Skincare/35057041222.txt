This balm does exactly what it says it will!! It’s completely unscented which is a huge plus for me. The dark color is a lot of fun and ensures you won’t miss any spots when rinsing your face. If I could suggest anything it would be to add a small spatula in order to make everything more hygienic. I would have given it five stars but it doesn’t beat the Banila cleansing balm and is more expensive - but all in all a great product that had no issues breaking down layers of SPF, foundation and eyeliner!! Delivers as promised!!
