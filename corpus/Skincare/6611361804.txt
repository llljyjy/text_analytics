Will not be buying again. IoP should retire this as since their other products are much better. The spray nozzle is defective leaking everywhere including all over your hands. The spray is also uncontrolled going everywhere creating a big mess and slippery floors. All this makes for a lot of wasted product. Even after sleeping in it for 8 hours my tan is not as dark as it should be and is patchy. Not worth the $
