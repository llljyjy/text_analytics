I received this product as a free sample. I find the initial application tugs a bit on the skin but then warms up for an easy application. Though the package says day or night I only use at night as it is too greasy for my liking to be used in the daytime. Especially if I plan on wearing makeup that day. The formula isn’t scented which is great. I do love that this product is cruelty free which is an absolute must for me as a makeup artist and consumer. Personally I didn’t notice any reduction of fine lines or puffiness. It feels nice but I wasn’t blown away. Feels nice but not mind blowing
