i have combo skin that has been drying out with the weather changing as well as some redness/texture and general dullness. because of this, i have been struggling with patchy/dry spots when i do my makeup (yuck), but this serum always makes my makeup go on so flawlessly. i use it am/pm, and i’ve noticed such a difference in my skin- it’s brighter, smoother, and overall happier. this is such a staple that i will be repurchasing. it’s not a want but a need. changed the trajectory of my life
