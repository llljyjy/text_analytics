I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I like the amount of emollients but it was just blah. Definitely not the quality that I have come to expect from Dior. The moisture didn’t last and the smell is very neutral if not sterile. I will not be purchasing as there are better options for half the price. I’ll Pass….
