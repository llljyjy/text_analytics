As I have oily skin, I was a skeptical to try this product, but it surprised me. I used the mask at night and found it very good, especially in dry winter times like now. I thought the packaging was beautiful and it even comes with a spoon for easy handling. It didnâ€™t make my skin oilier or increase my pimples and it lived up to expectations. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct nan
