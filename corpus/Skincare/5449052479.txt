Amazing! I’m upset I hadn’t found this sooner. I usually use the Belif moisturizing bomb which I ran out of. I bought this on sale and I’m in love in such a short amount of time. It left my skin so soft and moisturized. Definitely recommend. I don’t really care for the smell i wish it had a more pleasant smell, but it gets the job done. Amazing moisturizer!
