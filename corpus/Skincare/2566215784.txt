Besides the tatcha rice water cleanser I have never repurchases a cleanser more than once. Until I found this cleanser, first of all it’s HUGE. The bottle and amount of product you get is completely worth the money. The next is the texture, it’s unlike any cleanser I have used. It feels so hydrating but also feels like my skin is clean. My skin has actually improved since using this cleanser. I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser. For reference my skin type is dry and dehydrated with hormonal break outs and dark spots from post acne scars. luxurious!!!!
