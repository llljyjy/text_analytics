I recieved this serum complementary from Naturally Serious. It feels very nice on my face and keeps it hydrated and supple throughout the day. It is lightweight, non greasy and made with clean ingredients. Absorbs quickly. It does have a light scent to it, but not too over powering. Overall, I am pleased with this product. nan
