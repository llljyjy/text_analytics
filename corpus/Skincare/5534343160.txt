I received this for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I love the texture of this cream. Goes lovely on your eyes and neck. When you rub it between your fingers it feels super slick without being greasy. It took a few minutes to absorb however it is slightly tacky to the touch, which I don’t mind. I usually have dry skin and both areas felt really moisturized so this works great. It has a slight scent, the typical skincare fresh scent. Once I put it on I could no longer smell it. I had a small sample size and a little goes a long way however I only used it for two weeks so I can’t say  that I see a difference in my skin yet. Which is why I’m only giving it 4 stars. Feels Great
