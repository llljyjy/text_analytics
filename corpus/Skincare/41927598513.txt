I received a sample size of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Repair cream as a gift from topbox circle in exchange for an honest review of the product.I love the way my face feels when I apply it. It absorbs so quickly and doesn’t feel oily.. Love it!!Overall it’s a good product and I look forward to seeing what my skin looks like a month into using it! So far so good
