I was super excited for this product at first, but it pills really badly, and I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to it, so I had to return it and exchange for another mineral sunscreen. Aside from the allergic reaction, my main beef was the pilling and the price for what you actually get. It was a lot smaller than I had expected, which is a bit of a letdown considering the price.  Overall, wanted to like the product, was excited for the product, but very disappointed.  Packaging was cute though. Disappointed
