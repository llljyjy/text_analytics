It is so hard to find a face cream that suits my face in all weather. By winter, I usually need a heavier cream. until now. This goes into the skin very lightweight and absorbs almost immediately. It’s true in what it says in keeping the skin moisturized for a long time. I usually splash water on my face multiple times a day, so tend to reapply, but it does keep my skin hydrated for at least 4-6 hours at a time. No sensitivity from this really gentle formula either. I’m really pleased with this find! All weather cream
