Been using this now for a couple of weeks. It seems to be evening out my skin tone. This product make my skin feel soft and smooth. There is also a wonderful citrus smell to it. I do not find this product irritating to my face at all. I would completely recommend this product to anyone looking to try something that smells fresh and leaves your skin feeling fresh too Tula works great
