LOVE this product.  I used to use the Algenist Anti Aging Moisturizer and loved it at first but it didnt really change my skin much and is double the price of this.  When my local store ran out of that, I tried this one, and now Iâ€™ve made the switch.  It is super hydrating but doesnt leave your skin oily.  Makeup goes on very smooth and stays hydrated all day.  Very subtle pleasant scent.  A little goes a long way.  And has everything you could want: peptides, amino acids, ceramides, collagen, hyaluronic acid!  Great product, would highly recommend!
