I’m on my 3rd bottle of this and will never hesitate to rebuy. My skin always feels soft and not dry after washing my face & the best part is that it actually does remove all makeup -- even those annoying waterproof products just make sure your massaging it in. There is a slight fragrance but it isn’t over powering or strong, it smells natural. a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. Truly an amazing product. I constantly restock this product!
