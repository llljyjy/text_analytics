I love this product and I am very grateful for it! I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and dryness and I have struggled to find a thick, hydrating night moisturizer that does not cause issues for me. I started out with the mini size, loved it... purchased a full size and have been using it for about 1-2 months and was SURE to purchase a backup during the sale. This product will last a while but I did not want to run the risk of running out. Now, for claims. Hydration. YES. I use a thin layer of this overnight as a night moisturizer and wake up to hydrated but not greasy skin. I think some folks may be running into issues applying this like a MASK (big thick layer). You truly only need  a thin layer to get beautiful hydration. Plump. I never really know what this is supposed to mean and I feel it goes hand in hand with hydration. Brightening. This is always hard to evaluate however I do struggle with hyperpigmentation caused by hormonal breakouts and I find that that hyperpigmentation has been fading on a quicker timeline since I have begun using this so I will say that even though I think it is very hard to evaluate a claim like “brightens“ I do feel like those dark spots are responding well to the vitamin C in this product. Clean. Everyone’s skin is different and sensitive skin is a fickle beast. This has NOT caused issues for me with sensitivity, breakouts, allergic reactions. Sensitive skinned folks, the fact that this comes in a mini size is a beautiful thing. Love this! I've already purchased a backup.
