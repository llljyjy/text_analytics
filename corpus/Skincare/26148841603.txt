Had high hopes for this cream! Loved that it was marketed as a Vit C + Moisturizer combo and was excited to use in the morning. I have normal to dry skin, specially dry in colder months and in seasonal transitions. However, after 2 uses, I broke out in dry, itchy red rough patches all around my mouth, nose and chin. Tried using for another 4 or 5 days but the patches only got worse. Really, really disappointed. Definitely not for sensitive skin. not for sensitive skin; disappointed
