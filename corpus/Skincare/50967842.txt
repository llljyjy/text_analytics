This eye cream is not a holy grail for removing puffiness or dark circles, but it’s a really nice rich cream that moisturizes well and has zero scent. I’d recommend it just for the hydrating qualities. It’s not greasy but it does take a bit to soak in, unlike lighter creams this seem to disappear immediately. Great for use at night. Nice rich cream
