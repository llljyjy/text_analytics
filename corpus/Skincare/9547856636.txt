This is perfect for someone who wants their skin to feel fresh but likes a very light texture. It feels weightless. It’s not sticky and my sensitive skin didn’t react. I used to love Clinique’s  moisturizer but last time I bought it, it was making my skin a little itchy. This is a great alternative for me. Affordable and quality brand. I’m so glad I got this sample. It was perfect for my trip to Italy! Lightest weight super hydration
