This is truly the worst cleansing balm I’ve ever used. The second you scoop some out it crumbles up. Not the easiest to keep in your hands. Does not glide easily on the skin, you have to tug. It also doesn’t melt completely, you will always have clumps. And the worst thing about this, is that it burns my eyes sooooooo much. What is the point of a cleansing balm that I can’t use on my eyes to get my makeup off? Not to mention how overpriced this is. DO NOT BUY THIS! Worst Cleansing Balm
