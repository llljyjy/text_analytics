I received these as a gift, but I genuinely had good results. The peace out acne skin dots worked really well. I used them on two pimples on my cheek that have been stubborn and red. After using the skin dots, the pimples are significantly lighter and less red, especially in person. The dots not only helped to fade the acne but also helped to prevent the pimples from reforming. The skin dots have honestly helped me feel more confident as I was feeling stressed about the cheek acne. (Also yes they wont completely eliminate acne overnight but they will significantly reduce the appearance!) Amazing product!
