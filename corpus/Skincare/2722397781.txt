Right off the bat. Dislikes: the price, the smell but it’s tolerable and goes away quick. What I love: it’s so light, not greasy, you really don’t need much, I feel like this would last a long time, blends quick and actually works. I live in NV and it’s dry and staring to get cold and this is really keeping my skin plump and hydrated!!! Works for me!
