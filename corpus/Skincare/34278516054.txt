I absolutely love the formula and consistency of this moisturizer!! It feels cool on the skin and very hydrating. A little goes a long way, and I love how it works into the skin quickly. It also smells amazing and the scent isn’t overpowering. I also noticed a big difference in my skins appearance just after a week, It has erased a lot of the redness and fine lines. I have oily skin so I’m very picky when it comes to moisturizers but I’m happy with this one & excited to keep using this in my daily morning skincare routine Amazing moisturizer! Very soothing & hydrating
