I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest feedback.  That aside, let’s talk sunscreen.  Yes, I’m a dark-skinned African American and I will never forget the 1999 popular track “Wear Your Sunscreen“ and equally never forget the damage sun can do to skin PERIOD.  Tula’s protect + glow is the PERFECT sunscreen for my face.  It has a gel formula and doesn’t feel greasy or leave a cast on the skin, instead it looks leave you looking radiant and feeling as though you’ve done your part to hold sun damage at bay and keep your skin looking youthful.
