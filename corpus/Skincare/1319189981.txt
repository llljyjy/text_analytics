Skin type: acne prone, sensitiveI love turmeric, it has done wonders for my face scars. This product is smooth and moisturizing on the face. The sample separates the two liquids and you fold the middle and mix it together. It has a gentle rose smell to the product.My face feels very smooth after the 7 day trail but I did get some white heads on my forehead. I would love to add this serum into my daily routine to see if my face gets used to it as it does make my face feel hydrated.#gotitfree Some white heads on forehead but skin feels smooth
