I received this product as a free sample for my honest review.  I love Ilia products and I would have loved this if it wasnâ€™t for one thing.  I noticed that at the end of the day I could smell a faint rubber like smell.  I kept trying to figure out what it was so I removed products I was using when I finally realized this was the common denominator.  I was really bummed because I have dry skin and my skin liked it and I loved that it had SPF. nan
