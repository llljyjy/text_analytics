I’m taking off two stars because of the poorly designed lid/dispenser.  Two bottles I’ve purchased have had the same problem:  the lid goes off track, pops off, and leaks product.  It’s tricky to put back together.  Each time I get it working again, a squirt of serum is sacrificed.  None of the other DE products using this bottle design have this flaw, and I use the entire line.  Drunk Elephant, are you listening?  I’m a loyal customer who feels let down.  Please fix this.
