The navy is a zipper closure, not an envelope! I don’t mind the zipper but I expected an envelope so just a heads up to everyone.Otherwise nothing but praise for these pillowcases. I just bought a replacement for one I’ve had for 4 years because the seam split so they are definitely a good investment. Navy is a zipper closure!
