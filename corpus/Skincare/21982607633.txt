So I bought that $40 Hanni razor and it completely destroyed my legs. It bled soo much and my boyfriend was horrified and I had like 15 bandaids all over my legs for days. The scabs turned into dark scars because my skin is super fair and everything turns into a scar on me apparently. Iâ€™ve been using the faded cream for a 2-3 weeks and theyâ€™ve gotten so much lighter I think theyâ€™ll be hardly noticeable in another 2 weeks. I originally got a small tube in a boxycharm and forgot about it until the hanni incident. I came back for the larger tube after buying the spray, which left orange splotches all over. Anyways, this stuff works. I use it every day after I shower and I highly recommend it. Also Iâ€™m sticking with waxing these days ðŸ™‚ works fast
