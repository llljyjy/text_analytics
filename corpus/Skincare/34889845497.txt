This face cream first off, smells fricking amazing!!! But let me tell you from the start,  I received this as a complimentary gift for my honest review from #Influenster and #EsteeLauder.I live the way my face feels once cleaned and this cream is applied. It feels fresh, light weight, healthy. It definitely does help reduce my dry skin around my eyebrows and nose area. Overall, it is a great product!However, I have tried the anti-age supreme+ cream from Estes Lauder tooâ€¦ that was my favorite out of the two, as that one I could see almost instant tightening of my face and less facial lines, and less dark spots.  Normally my dark spots are much worse, and the line is more noticeable where they start. Not in the picture tho! Great everyday face cream
