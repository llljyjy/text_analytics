I received this skin cream complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and I love it. The fact that it has salicylic acid to help spots, it hydrated, smooth, balance the skin and reduce shine it is amazing. I wear this under my foundation and I was not oily for majority of the day /evening that I had it on. I also like it as an every day wear skin moisturiser. A little goes a long way. I did notice a minor tingling sensation but I know this was due to the salicylic acid which I’m fine with so if you have sensitive skin You might want to pay attention to that. Overall it’s a great product and I’ll definitely be purchasing once my sample is finish. Hydrates & shrinks pores
