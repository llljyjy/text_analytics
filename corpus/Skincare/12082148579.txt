To set the scene I have combination skin that gets oily on my T-zone, and cheeks, with my jawline, and upper lip being more dry. I am also currently on a prescription grade Tretinoin (0.05%). I first got this product as I was told would be a very basic and gentle cleanser. Upon first use I love how it was fragrance free, a gel texture, and cleansed my sling and removed my sunscreen well. However after using the product consistently morning and night for a week, along side my tretinoin it was a tad too much for me. I experienced an over drying effect all over and a breakout on my forehead. I think this is. It also burned my eyes if I got them in there. I think this would be a great product for those who have a bit more oily skin or are not on a prescription grade retinols like tretinoin. Is it a bad product?  No. Was it right for me, my skin and my routine? Also no. good basic cleanser
