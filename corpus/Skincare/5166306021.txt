I’ve been using this for about 4 days and I see a HUGE difference in my skin. This winter really took it’s toll and caused my skin to flake and have multiple dry patches. Prior to trying this, I was using a high-end moisturizer and had to apply three coats in the morning & evening for it to even slightly ease my dryness. Now, I use a small amount of this in the morning and evening and in about 4 days my skin is noticeably better. Almost all my dry patches are gone. Plus I have combo skin so this somehow soothes my dry patches without making my t-zone oily. I’m thrilled with this purchase. nan
