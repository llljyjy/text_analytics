This is an amazing product. I love the fact it has a silky feel bit a greasy one. This product is so smooth and you won’t need a lot to put on your face and neck. It is very moisturizing. Definitely can feel a difference in my skin. Doesn’t have an over powering scent. It’s very refreshing. I use this once in the morning before I start my makeup routine and once before bed. It has improved my facial skin. Love this product
