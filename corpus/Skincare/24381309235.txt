I’ve been using this face cream for a couple of weeks now, and I’m super happy with the results! It goes on smooth and the formula is really thick, which I love. My skin feels hydrated and soft, and I just love how lightweight this cream is even though it’s thick and creamy. I have dry/combination skin and this cream works wonders for keeping my face hydrated. I’ve already recommended it to multiple friends, and would definitely buy this again! Great results
