The toner is very soothing and works very well to smooth my wrinkles. I have sensitive skin, so Iâ€™m more concerned about the BHA, I only use it every the other day and make sure to put the skin cream before I got outside. So far I like it. I got this toner complimentary from Algenist to exchange my honest review. Great for smoothing the wrinkles
