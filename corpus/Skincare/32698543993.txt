I’ve been using this product for over a year. I’ve loved it for a very long time. It’s super hydrating when you first apply it but over time, it dries your lips out so bad. I’ve had super dry, flaky skin under my bottom lip. To the point where ive had to use tweezers to pick it off. I started thinking maybe it was this lip mask causing it. Not even 2 days later, my roommate, who also uses this product, starting complaining about the dry skin under her lip. So I told her I think it’s the lip mask. Ive stopped using it for 5 days and my dry skin has cleared up. So just beware that prolonged use can cause super dry skin!! Flakey skin around my lips
