Dr. Zenovia Skincare 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment has worked wonderfully at making my acne clear up a lot after using for a few weeks. I have very sensitive skin and for an acne treatment, this actually did not cause any more irritation on my skin. Itâ€™s not too oily or greasy and not a bad scent either. I have not had any more acne appear since I started using this. I am very happy! Works Very Well!
