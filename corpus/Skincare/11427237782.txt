If you’re looking for a smooth makeup application, you need this! I suffer from dry, flaky skin in the Winter months and I’m constantly on the hunt for a product that will rid my skin of dry patches quickly. After using this micro peel just once, my skin was glowing and smooth. I found that my skincare products sunk in much better and my base makeup went on sooo smooth!! I smooth on a very thin layer over my entire face, then massage for two minutes. You will see the layer of dead skin ball off to reveal fresh skin. I follow up with a hydrating serum and a moisturizer. I was previously using Rub A Dub from Saturday Skin... I found that this gave a more smooth result, quicker, although I like both. I’ll definitely keep this gem in my skincare rotation! Smooth and Glowing!
