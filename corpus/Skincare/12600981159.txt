When this product first came out I tried and and bought another after I used it all. The first one I bought went buy so fast because I didn’t realize a little goes a LONG way and ended up always using it for my whole face but I bought the second one and still loved it. I just ran out and then influentser sends me the NEW AND IMPROVED  one , EXCITED?? YES  I’ve been using the product for a week and I can tell there is a bit of a change .... it’s better. Hands down will continue to purchase this eye cream. I have sensitive skin and searched for a very long time. This is by far my top 2 faves!!! Under Eye Cream
