After using this product twice daily for the last week, I have noticed results in my skin. I have a few dark spots under my eye that have lightened up quite a bit. My face also feels more hydrated and less dull after using this serum. The serum itself is very light and absorbed into my skin fairly quickly. It is perfect for everyday use and doesn’t irritate my skin. The bottle’s design is unique and a bit confusing to get the product out. You have to hold the bottle upside down and there is a button on the bottom that has to be pushed for the product to come out. Compared to other products I have tried, this one is among my favorites and I have added it to my daily routine. I will definitely buy this product in the future and I do recommend it for those that have dark spots or need some help with glowing skin. Newly added to my routine!
