I heard a lot of great things about this product so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the package, I was hit with an extremely unpleasant smell. Despite that, I applied the product to my skin. The very next day, I woke up a huge breakout!! I donâ€™t recommend this serum for people with sensitive skin. Not for sensitive skin
