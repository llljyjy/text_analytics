I have tried the Shiseido Fresh-Moisture Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen. It has SPF 42, which is great for face and comes in a very pretty and practical packing. It has a creamy texture, right after u apply it leaves a very light glow that goes away. The skin absorbs the product after a couple minutes. It smells like sunscreen with a touch of roses. My skin felt protected and moisturized at the same time. I loved the mixture of sunscreen and skincare. I would recommend this product, although I liked a bit more the oil-free hyaluronic acid sunscreen by Shiseido. Great Sunscreen
