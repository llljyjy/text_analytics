I love farmacy products!!! I was excited to try this as I’m allergic to a lot of things but this was not worth the money. It may melt down the makeup, but it does not rinse away. My face felt like I had a thick layer of coconut oil on it. It took 3 washes with a foaming cleanser ro get the residue off. Way too much work and for the price point I might as well just use, coconut oil and then a second cleanser. I’m going to stick to the shu uemura one. Liquid, but works fast and rinses well. nan
