Not going to lie, at first I thought this product was going to be too oily for me since when I apply it at the beginning it look too heavy but then I saw it absorbing great to my skin and I was happy about it. My skin look glowy but not oily and very hydrated. This serum does the job hydrating the skin and protecting from the sun which is a double win. I cannot wait to keep using it and see my skin improvements. Great serum
