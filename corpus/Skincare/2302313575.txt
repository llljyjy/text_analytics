I received this product for free to try and absolutely loved it. I didn’t use for a lengthy time so I’m not sure of the long term results and improvement in wrinkles and fine lines but if you’re looking for a hydrating eye cream this is if. The skin around my eyes felt like silk. I will be buying this and keeping it as part of my skincare routine! Feels like silk!
