I used to love St Tropez when I used to buy it from Ulta.  This was my first one from Sephora. I spent time applying it to my whole body and I did not tan at all.  I don’t know what the problem is, maybe I was sold an old one?  I tried to return but by the time I used it Sephora said it was too late.  Which sucks cause this is expensive. Didn’t tan at all… I was still WHITE
