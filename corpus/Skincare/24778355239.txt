This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and balanced. It creates a matte finish but my skin feels almost powdery soft. It also grips makeup very good and creates a smooth finish. My only complaint is that after a few days of use I found that I needed to switch it out for a day or two for something more moisturizing. nan
