I received this complimentary product from Influenster. I have combination skin. This foamless formula feels good on my face, even on my hands to have a quick scrub.It has a mild scent that reminds me of when I’m having a professional face cleansing. I used a dime sized portion to clean my face at night to remove all rhe makeup and dirt from my day, and it feels good to have the microspheres cleaning my pores, leaving my skin smoother and refreshed, don’t scrub it too hard since it could cause breakouts.I would recommend this product, to be used only once a day. Bit harsh cleanser
