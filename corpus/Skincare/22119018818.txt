I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres  in exchange for my honest review. I have acne prone skin so Iâ€™m always a little nervous when switching up my routine. I thought the ingredients in this were great and this made my skin feel hydrated and smoother. The smell is a little odd but I appreciated it over a super obviously artificial smell. nan
