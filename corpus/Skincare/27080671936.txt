I received this product free for review. I am a light medium shade in foundation and I got mine in the shade light to medium. This shade was a bit too dark for me but I was still able to make it work. If I could pick again, I’d go a shade lighter. The problem is that it has a weird orange undertone that doesn’t go with my complexion at all. I don’t know if it’s all of them or just the shade I received. Other than that, I enjoyed it a lot. Good medium coverage with a texture that looked natural and skin like. Wore well for several hours. Did start to fade after a while so I wouldn’t call it long lasting by any means but it wore off in a very natural way so it didn’t look obvious. Nice finish and texture but weird undertone
