I have oily skin but this winter + wearing a mask indoors at work all day have really dried out my chin / jaw area. When I wear this my skin feels PLUMPED + hydrated all day!! I did notice it’s a little tacky if applied on dry skin so I’ll spray on some rose water or an essence right before this so that it doesn’t go in sticky. I follow it up with theIt vitamin C serum and it’s What has saved my skin from winter. I have noticed the pump sort of leaks, but One pump is enough. Exactly what my skin needed this winter
