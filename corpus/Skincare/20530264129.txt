Prior to being this product, I was a bit unsure about investing in this product because of the reviews. I love the Farmacy brand, however, I was just so unsure about this product. Nevertheless, I was looking for a good toner, and decided to give this one a shot during the spring sale. Surprisingly, I actually really liked this product. I have always struggled with acne prone skin, and this product is a life saver. I use it in the morning and now that it’s a part of my skin care routine, there’s no going back. I also find that compared to many other products the brand makes, the price point is fairly decent. nan
