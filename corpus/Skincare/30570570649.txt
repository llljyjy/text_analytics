The sunscreen itself is great. It never makes me break out and leaves my skin with a great completion afterwards. I actually don’t believe I’ve ever even gotten a hint of a sun burn when I’ve used this product so it’s super effective! However, the packaging makes the product not worth the price. The exterior comes off in little flakes when you touch it and those specks get all over your face. Not the worst thing in the world, but sort of impossible to get off and for a pretty pricy sunscreen, I’d say it actually 100% is a reason why not to buy it. If they fixed the packaging I would buy it regularly! For now, it’s a no. Good quality, messy packaging
