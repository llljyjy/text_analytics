used a sample packet I was given a while ago. I used the last two nights because there was enough product in the sample to last me more than 1x use. I am so pleasantly surprised by how moisturizing this is. I have been using Clinique surge moisturizer for years but I noticed it does nothing for me in the Pennsylvania winters since I moved here a few years ago. but this moisturizer is amazing, I have noticed how soft and hydrated my skin has been all day today! wearing it again tonight and buying this tomorrow from Sephora! this is great for the dry winters!
