I bought this based on the ingredient list and the reviews. I have very sensitive and dry skin. I use it as a night cleanser especially after wearing a full face all day. The granules are very gentle in my opinion. I always follow up with hyaluronic acid after. The entire brand is the only product line that clears my acne completely. Another great product from Peace Out! nan
