This stuff is amazing. I have sensitive, combo skin and I’ve been looking for something to add moisture without making me feel greasy. This oil is lightweight and soaks into your skin beautifully, and hydrates really well. To me, there isn’t really a fragrance, and it has definitely helped the appearance of my skin after about a month. The bottle sizing is a bit deceptive, but still worth it to me. I’ll definitely be repurchasing this. love this face oil
