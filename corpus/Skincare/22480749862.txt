AMAZING product. I bought the mini version bc I was traveling a lot and wanted to have something on the side. Itâ€™s bigger than your average mini sized beauty product. However, I did find the top and the opening part of the bottle redundant and a waste of plastic. Choose one, Alpha-H. Anyway, amazing product if you have dark spots, uneven texture, and fine lines. When I travel, my skin tends to get acne prone or dry or dull and this has really helped combat all of those things! nan
