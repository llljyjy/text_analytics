I received a sample size of this product from Influenster. I wanted to try this for a few weeks before I reviewed it. I canâ€™t say this did much, if anything, to improve the fine lines under my eyes and hydrate my skin. It has a gel-like consistency, which dried down fairly quick. However, I still ended up putting an additional moisturizer over this product to help with hydrating the area. Overall, it was nothing special, and I would have returned it if I purchased it. Not worth buying
