Ever have a product you never knew you needed?  This is it!  I don’t know how I lived without it.  This IT cleansing balm has a very light rose scent and a little goes a long way.  I took a pea size sample and applied it to my face.  It glide across smoothly, moisturizing my face as it was removing every bit of makeup. I did use a second half pea sized piece to remove the waterproof mascara from my lashes. I rubbed it in gently and it did not irritate my eyes.  I used a washcloth to wipe the makeup off and added a bit of water to my face with another bit of balm and lathered it in until my face was clean.  It did leave a very moisturizing feeling to me face when I wiped it down.  I applied a bit more on my face as a mask while I watched TV and prepared for bed.  I took a quick shower and my face felt so soft and moisturized.  This is definitely the product I never knew I needed and won’t be caught without!  Love it!  It’s a game changer. This is 'IT' for me!
