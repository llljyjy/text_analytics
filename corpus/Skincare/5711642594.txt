I have Normal to dry acne prone skin and I find that this moisturizer works really well. I tend to have dry patches and flaking in my skin, specially during colder months. First, I love that it sunscreen is included already and how the refills work. I have experience zero dry patches and flakinesses since I started using it. It does have a scent when you first put it on, however I do not find the scent lingers (i usually only smell it when I am applying it on) and it doesn’t seem to be a strong scent to me, but I can see if your sensitive to scents how this may not be ideal. It does make your face glow when first applied but after a few minutes this settles but I can see how it may not be ideal to have this effect if your skin is naturally really oily. Lastly, I have not seen any changes in my breakouts.  I don’t breakout more or less since I been using this moisturizer. 4 months and going strong
