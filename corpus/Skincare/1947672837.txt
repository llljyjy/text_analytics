I received this product free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I’m 28/F. I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks now, and while I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin, I do notice that for the few hours after I put this on, my under eye area is very hydrated. Honestly, while this is a nice eye cream for instant hydration, I think there are a lot of other eye creams out there that can do the same thing for a lot less money and with more beneficial ingredients. I do like that there isn’t a powerful fragrance in this, and it’s a breeze to apply. It takes a minute to soak in, like at least 20 minutes for me, so I don’t use this under makeup because I just don’t have the time to wait for it to dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs moisture, likes Estée Lauder, and doesn’t mind spending a lot of money on an eye cream with very few actives. Hydrating eye cream
