Love this product! It absorbs quickly and dries down to a natural matte finish. It’s neither too drying or too oily. It really feels like wearing nothing. It’s also compatible with all of my normal moisturizers (no pilling) which can be a problem for me sometimes. A great sunscreen for those who hate sunscreen!
