Ive wasted so much money buying crap on sephora. This is one of the few products that actually works and does what it says it will do. I have chronic dry chapped lips. Well I should say HAD. I use this every night, and I also use it sometimes during the day under lipstick or lip gloss. Even in Ohio brutal cold winters my lips are now soft. One problem checked off my list. nan
