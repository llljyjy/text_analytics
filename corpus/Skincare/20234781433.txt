I have sensitive but combination skin and I will get dark marks on my face, every now and again.  I’ve been using the dark spot serum on my face for about a month, and it’s started to fade my dark spots already. I really like how smooth and light it is and it doesn’t have a smell. It also doesn’t irritate my skin. Faded dark marks on my face, within a month
