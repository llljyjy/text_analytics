I bought this bottle because there are a lot of good reviews. I was a little afraid since every time I want to try a new skincare product, my acnes will start to come up again. But this toner serum helps my skin and makes my hyperpigmentation fade faster. I notice my pores are tightened and my skin looks brighter after a few days. Feel the differences after a few days
