Fell victim to the tiktok hype - that being said it does have wonderful coverage and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It covered the hyperpigmentation on my chin and did a good job of covering acne spots as well, just the shade range is so bad lol I’m a 01 N in the Kosas revealer concealer for reference and even the lightest shade was waaaaay too warm for me and oxidizes a bit on the peachy side ( I realize it’s a color corrector lol but I was hoping w the coverage it gives I could skip other products) but I’m sure it’ll work for me in the summer it’s alright
