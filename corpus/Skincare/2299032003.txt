I was given a sample of the Clinique wrinkle correcting serum to try in exchange for my honest review. I tried it for about 3 days, morning and evening. A little goes a long way because the serum is very smooth and lightweight so it spreads across the face easily. There is no strong scent which I really like. I am unable to comment on the long term benefits but for first impressions, I enjoyed using this serum. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Clinique Serum
