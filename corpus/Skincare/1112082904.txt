I recently received this product as a sample to try out and give my honest opinion. The product comes in very simple packaging which I liked the container automatically gives it that pure goodness look. The moisturizer has the texture of a yogurt moisturizer and the smell is pleasant. It does not leave your skin greasy and so far I am loving the way my skin looks. It may be pricey but a little bit goes a long way. My new little helper
