I loved using this mist for hydration after cleansing, but the smell everyone talks about is absolutely all-encompassing, and the weirdest part is how it varied in strength with every bottle. Sometimes it didn’t smell that bad but still noticeable, sometimes it was real bad. (Is this the plight of clean beauty???) I’ve rebought this mist like 5 times over and finally that last bottle’s mist stank so bad that I couldn’t repurchase any more. Haven’t found anything as good as this hydrating mist to replace it but I just can’t take my chances with this every time for $55! Smells as weird and bad as everyone says
