I am loving this Laneige Hydro UV Defense Sunscreen that I received complimentary from Laneige! Itâ€™s lightweight, and a daily SPF 50+ sunscreen that helps protect against UVA & UVB rays. I also love how it hydrates and soothes skin and it has an invisible finish, so no white casting at all! I also love that it is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested, I have super sensitive skin so that his a huge plus for me! Works very well!!!
