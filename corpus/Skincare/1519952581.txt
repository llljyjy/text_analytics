So I’ll start off by saying I have sensitive skin and most creams are too heavy for me, but this one soaks in wonderfully. I was loyal to another brand but after getting a sample of this, I will definitely be purchasing it and possibly venture into trying their other products. It makes my skin look plump and glowy like no other cream/moisturizer I have every used before. It doesn’t make my face greasy at all. To me it has a light, pleasant scent that is hardly noticeable. Amazing moisturizer!
