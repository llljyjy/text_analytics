This serum combines all my favorite skincare ingredients into one: hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and ferulic acid perfectly formulated to work together. I found this to be perfect to battle my skincare concerns (dehydration lines, dark/sun spots, occasional acne marks) while plumping and preserving elasticity. The texture and finish is great for my combination skin, absorbs in seconds and feels like you have nothing on, only better relieving any tightness or dryness immediately. This is recommended for use with the matching moisturizer to seal it in, but in my opinion any moisturizer you like will only enhance the effects of this serum. Canâ€™t say enough good things about it, you have to try it out for yourself! 3 powerful serums in one!
