I received this product as a gift from the brand. The packaging is nice and there is no fragrance. I have dry skin and I have used it with makeup and without makeup. With makeup on, I noticed that my skin was smoother and it acted like a primer. I also used it with no makeup on and noticed my skin had a glow and a good base but since I don’t large pores I did not notice a huge difference. I did notice it was lightly even but that’s it. Since it is a treatment, I will keep using it on my skin on those days I won’t need to have makeup on to keep track of the pores. skin is more even
