This is a wonderful product.  The 1st time you use it, it can make you skin a little red, but the 2nd time it wont, you will just have the benefit of this wonderful formula.  The smell is so amazing as well, to bad it doesnâ€™t last a little longer it so refreshing.  Been using it now for at least a few months and it is now part of my normal routine.  Just love this. Best Vitamin C Essence EVER :)
