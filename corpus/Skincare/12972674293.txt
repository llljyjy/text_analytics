I have sensitive dry skin. The first time I tried this product in the store, I was impressed with how it covered a bit of the redness on my cheeks. I bought my own and started using it more frequently, but I noticed it left a weird color cast over my skin. Also, it really emphasized the texture of my dry skin and irritated my skin further. There is fragrance in this product, so I would be wary of that. Also, a small bit does go a long way, but I noticed when I tested it on my arms, it would leave a red streak. I returned the product because I paid almost $60 for a product that worsens my skin. I do not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin. Good... at first.
