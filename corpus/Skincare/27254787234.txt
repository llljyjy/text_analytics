For someone like me with dry skin, this is a miracle cream.  It is so rich and luxe and hydrating.  It has a beautiful texture that glides across my skin and melts in like butter.  I have definitely noticed that my skin is plumper and brighter, and my fine lines have diminished quite a bit.  I also love the light sent, it elevates it and gives it a spa like quality. Highly recommend it! Dream cream!
