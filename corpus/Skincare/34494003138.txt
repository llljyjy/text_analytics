I have dark undereyes and some fine lines. What I like about thid product is the ease of application and compact. What I dont like is it doesnt get absorbed quick enough if I was to put this on and needs to also put make up on right away. This is perfect when you are just chilling in the house and you apply it so it can sit on your undereyes. I noticed that my undereyes isnt as puffy as it was, and doesnt look as tired. Overall Iâ€™d still recommend it for because it works despite the drawback of taking too long to get absorbed. Works but has a drawback
