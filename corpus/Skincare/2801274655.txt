UGH. I bought this because it had some very good reviews here but I hate it. The smell is unpleasant but much worse is that it does not soften in your hands from body heat and it does NOT emulsify well at all. Really the most useless cleansing balm ever. The price should have been a clue. Absolute garbage. nan
