This product is one of the best oil-based makeup removers that I have ever used. A little bit goes a long way and your makeup will literally slide off your face. Iâ€™ve used this oil to remove heavy makeup looks like very light makeup and it has yet to fail me. This product combined with double cleansing is to die for. A MUST HAVE!!
