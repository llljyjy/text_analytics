subtly brightens skin because of the kakudu plum, something that isn’t advertised but welcomed. a decent hyaluronic acid serum, can be sticky. best application is to apply it to a damp face, then allow a minute or 2 for the product to mesh with the water on the skin. then massage the product onto the skin until almost dry. and then spray face with a hydrator (water is fine). water another 2 minutes before massaging the product into the skin again and following with a moisturizer. i find that using an occlusive product (like a face oil) helps to reduce the stickyness. once the products have fully absorbed into the skin (which for me is about an hour) - skin looks bright and plump. it is a bit expensive for a brightening hyaluronic acid serum but it does work. it’s also safe for fungal acne prone skin! nan
