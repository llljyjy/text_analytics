i really cannot say how much i love this toner/moisturizer!!! i have very desert-y dry/sensitive skin and this product as helped me so much! i typically use this as the first step in my routine after washing my face, followed by essence, serum(s), any treatments & moisturizer. but even on itâ€™s own with just moisturizer is fine which is so shocking to me! this is one of those products that is DEFINITELY worth every single penny, i will be an avid repurchaser of this for a long thing to come! nan
