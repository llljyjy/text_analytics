I love this moisturizer! After trying and finishing my free sample last year of the previous iteration of their Water Bank Moisturizer, I wanted more, and so I purchased this. It’s just as luxurious feeling and moisturizing as the other one, and the applicator that comes with it is a nice little touch! Just make sure your rub it in well so you don’t look shiny afterward. So Moisturizing!!!
