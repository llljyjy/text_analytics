This cream comes in exquisite packaging and I really appreciate that it’s refillable to reduce packaging waste. Feels lovely on the skin. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it’s scented, and I really feel as though any facial products are best without scent. Also, while I don’t mind paying I high price for skincare products, I can’t say this product is so much better than less expensive products. nan
