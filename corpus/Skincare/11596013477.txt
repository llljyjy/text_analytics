This foaming cleanser was given to me by Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review. The Dior On/OFF cleanser did a great job of cleansing my sensitive skin. It felt nice on my face and rinsed easily. I did need to apply my moisturizer right after use. I do not prefer floral scents, but if you do, I highly recommend this product. Great cleanser
