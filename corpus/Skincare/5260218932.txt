I want to start off by saying the package is sooo luxe. Before I applied this to my skin, the cream definitely have fragrance in it. Its not too strong, but definitely not too light either. I applied it to my skin and I like the texture, but the cream is thick and the cold. My skin absorbed the cream and it hydrates my skin. I like it.  Though the package is small, you will only need a small amount to apply on your face. I Magic in the Bottle
