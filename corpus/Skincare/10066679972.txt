I can’t believe how lightweight this cream is and it’s so hydrating. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling sticky and your skin feels amazing the whole day. I have combination skin but mostly oily. I don’t really like the scent of it, it kind of smells like plato. I wouldn’t purchase it because it’s very expensive. Great but too expensive
