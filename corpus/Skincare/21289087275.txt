I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. I like the applicator as it feels cool and comfortable when applying. The serum feels nice on my skin but honestly I haven’t noticed a substantial difference in puffiness or darkness. Overall it’s a nice product but for the price I probably would not repurchase. Pretty good eye serum
