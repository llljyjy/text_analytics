I received complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project. The was delivered today and I just had to use it. I had a full face of makeup on because I attended a graduation luncheon this afternoon. Upon first impressions love the packaging and green tones of the cleanser, the texture was more gel like then oily before application. Since it states to be a 2-in-1 I was more than happy to that to the test. I applied (3) pumps and massage it in and all over my face especially on the eyes as I was wearing a waterproof eyeliner and mascara. The cleanser went to work instantly breaking down and removed my makeup so gently was a pleasantly surprised of how effective it was, leaving my skin squeaking clean without the need for a second cleanse Squeaky Clean Skin
