I received this product complimentary for my honest review. The product I received was just a sample size so I was unable to use it AM and PM over an extended amount of time. It did leave my skin moisturized feeling, however I was not a fan of the scent, it was a little strong for my liking. I donâ€™t like my skincare to be scented. nan
