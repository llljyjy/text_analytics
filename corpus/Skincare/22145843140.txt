Product feels on the thicker side and slightly oily on application. Perhaps beneficial for dryer skin types. I wonâ€™t by again as I look for lighter weight options for my combination skin.I do like that this is a clean product, and it does appear to have good quality ingredients. Thick and oily texture.
