I have combo, but lean towards oily skin. For someone who works at a restaurant this cleanser is a must have. I have tried so many cleansers from ceraV to Krave Beauty, sulwhasoo is by far my favorite! I love how clean my face feels after using it; it doesnâ€™t dry out my skin like most cleansers do and on top of it all, it smells amazing!! Absolutely LOVE it
