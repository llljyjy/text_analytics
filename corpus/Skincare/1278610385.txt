Look ... this cleanser does everything it says it will do and I’m thoroughly pleased. My face is so soft and smooth. Surprisingly, I even get less ingrown hairs under my chin. Friends have commented that my complexion is brighter. I am dark brown skinned (AA) and the my hyperpigmentation is less noticeable. I’ll also add that you don’t need a ton of product. Even when washing off makeup, just smaller than a dime does the trick. The TRUTH!
