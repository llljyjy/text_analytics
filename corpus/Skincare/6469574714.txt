I received this moisturizer from Influenster in return for an honest review. I have been using this moisturizer for two weeks and like the light texture (though it looks a bit grainy, it doesn’t feel like it) and scent. It smells citrusy, which I don’t mind. I do have a love hate relationship with the packaging. I feel sometimes if I don’t place my hand in the correct angle, the product might end up falling on the floor, though I do like that with the pump, I avoid contaminating my moisturizer. Overall, I do recommend it. It is a light moisturizer but my skin feels great after using it. Good moisturizer
