I absolutely love this spray. The bottle is so heavy and luxurious feeling. The sprayer on the bottle is awesome, it comes out in such a fine but great mist. My skin feels hydrated and looks a little glowy after I use it to. It does have a faint kinda perfume smell but itâ€™s not bad and goes away fast. I really like it. Great!
