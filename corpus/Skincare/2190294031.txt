I received this item free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review . I have been trying to incorporate retinol consistently into my skincare routine, but found that my skin always gets dry and irritated, so I stop using. I use retinol every day, and my skin has not gotten irritated or flaky. I’ve been using this in the evening during my skincare routine for a few weeks. I haven’t noticed significant improvement in fine lines yet, but feel like my skin looks brighter and I’m not needed to exfoliate as often.  So far,  I’m very pleased! Gentle and effective
