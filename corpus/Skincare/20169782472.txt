When I first got this it was part of a gift set that I got for Christmas. I wanted to buy more but when I saw the price I felt like it was too much for a lip balm… then i ran out. Once I ran out I realized it was well worth it! It has been sold out both at Sephora and through the Sol de Janeiro website. As soon as I seen this was restocked I immediately bought more. Don’t wait! Must Have!
