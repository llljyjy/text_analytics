I really enjoyed my experience with this mask especially since my have oily and acne prone skin so my pores are always constantly clogged. This mask is great for maintaining “clear pores” post extractions and is not meant to extract all impurities from your pores. Not sure I would repurchase considering the price but if you’re looking to add a mask to your routine this one is nice! nan
