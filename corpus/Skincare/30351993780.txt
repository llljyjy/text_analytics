I’m glad I got this as a sample, because I don’t think I can finish it. It smells like vomit and it leaves a waxy feeling on my combination skin. I really wanted to give this a chance, and I made it through most of the tube (the sample size was decent), but I just can’t finish it. I had to slightly hold my breath while using this because of the smell.  It also didn’t seem to do anything to benefit my skin during the time frame of trying this out. I wouldn’t purchase this. And for real, the smell is just bad. smells bad, feels weird
