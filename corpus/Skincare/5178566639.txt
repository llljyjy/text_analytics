So disappointed in this. Left me with orange stripes. I’ve been fake tanning for years with other products and have never had it turn out like this. I really was sold on how “easy and effortless” this product was and had high hopes for it. Now I have to cover up everywhere because it’s super embarrassing. orange stripes
