This gel cream feels pretty great under the eye. It absorbs really fast and does moisturize the skin. I’m not sure that it really did much else as far as dark circles are concerned. I’d only recommend the full-size if you have extremely dry skin under the eye. Otherwise, it doesn’t seem like it’s worth the money to me. nan
