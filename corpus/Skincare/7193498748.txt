What’s with all the incentivized reviews lately? It’s making Sephora’s latest releases all 5 stars for the reviews and that’s not authentic or very helpful for some of us customers who don’t have the luxury of getting products for free imo.Anyway, the scent reminds me of the Brightening C cream from Laneige, just less thick in texture. Nothing about this particularly wowed me, so I won’t be rebuying. *not incentivized*
