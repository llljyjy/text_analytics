I have been trying this Soft Cream for 10 days, and I do notice a more even complexion, and softening of fine lines now.  I’ve used it all ways both day and night: alone, after a serum, and under makeup, and find it delivers.  For me the smell is a subtle, rose smell which is not cloying at all.  I find it absorbs quickly so you can get on with your routine.  I would recommend it to those wishing for a great cream to hydrate and even out skin tone, and I’ll be looking into other Lancome Absolue products. Soft Cream for Better Skin
