I’m a combination skin type with acne and was a little skeptical of this face wash because it does have essential oils in it. I also didn’t know what frothy really meant but it’s  like how the froth on a coffee looks like, I know it sounds weird lol but the feel of the wash combined with the fragrance makes it feel like a spa experience. After a couple days I noticed it didn’t break me out, making me love this even more. A Spa Experience
