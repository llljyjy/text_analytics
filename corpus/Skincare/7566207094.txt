This is absolutely terrible. It smells overly masculine and NOTHING like it is described. It smells like a cheap knock off version of a men’s dollar store spray deodorant. Holy cow this one was the worst and most misleading fragrance I ever bought. I can’t wait to return it. I’ve never been this repulsed by a fragrance. Definitely do NOT recommend this one. Other scents to try that hit the right notes would be Apres, Ombré Leather. So disappointed. Make something that smells like an actual forest :( Cheapest most misleading fragrance I’ve bought
