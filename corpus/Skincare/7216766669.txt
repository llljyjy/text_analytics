I have used this morning and night since I received it last week and it has been really great! I can see a difference in my skin as far as texture and acne. I get acne on my cheeks and forehead and the pimples I had before using this are now gone and it helps the pimple to go away faster if I do get a new one. This is my first glow recipe purchase and Iâ€™m excited to try more from the brand! Very good!
