I’m 56, but get a lot of “No way!” Am half Asian, half Greek, always taken excellent care of my skin. My beautiful mother taught me at a young age to treat my skin well to maintain a youthful look. (Her Japanese genes didn’t hurt, either). But always looking for a new “HG” product, decided to try DE cream, but it was the reviews that swayed me to try. 6wks in & I’ve seen no results. Nada. Nothing. Nope. I even stepped it up a notch, used it morning and night after cleansing. I feel like I drank the Kool-Aid. Or rather “drunk” it. HAHATwo stars for spreadability & eco-conscious packaging. NOPE!
