I am loving the Sephora All Day Hydrator. It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling super moisturized and soft. I am also using it as a primer and it works perfectly before applying my makeup for the day. My makeup lasts much longer because of this amazing product. The price was very affordable and  quality doesnâ€™t have to be expensive! it is also vegan and clean. I highly recommend it. Perfect all day hydrator and primer in one!
