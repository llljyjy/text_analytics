Easy to apply, smells good, and nice color. Be sure to use circular motion and a mitt for better application. Gave 4 stars because it’s good not great, and mine arrived without cap; Sephora sent replacement and it didn’t have cap, either! The bottles don’t stand up; have to lay on side. Reported to Sephora, but I didn’t request replacement; I just wanted to hopefully, stop a problem! nan
