This product is does the trick on a base level. However, im so so sad about not having the original formula available anymore. I used to recommend the Water Bank Moisture Cream to everyone I could, and this is simply not the same. Not as moisturizing, not as pleasant a smell. Iâ€™ll still use it because it was not cheap and is a fine moisturizer, but the old version was truly exceptional. Miss the old formula
