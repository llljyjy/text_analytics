I’ve been using this for almost two years and it works wonders on my post-breakout hyperpigmentation. Definitely don’t expect it to work right away; it takes time. I use it after applying the Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% (in the AM), and then apply moisturizer and sunscreen on top. I have oily/combo skin. Amazing
