The moisturizer is a holy grail product for me, so I was really disappointed to find this product does not calm redness, it just covers it. Basically an over priced version of Almayâ€™s color match foundation in a glass jar. It changes to a beige color and sits on the skin like a liquid foundation. I was really excited to ditch my mineral foundation for calmer, healthier skin, but instead I was wiping off a foundation colored oily mess. Will be returning and hopefully finding another DR. JART+ product I love. Covers redness like foundation
