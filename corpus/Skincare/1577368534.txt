I really did love the way that this product felt on my skin, how easy it was to apply and how it gave just the right amount of coverage for me. I’ve been trying to focus on keeping my skin as healthy as possible and wanted to switch from a full coverage foundation to this one. I’ve developed very sensitive skin in the past couple of years and do have a tendency to react negatively to a lot of products. Although I loved this, it immediately broke me out. I even tried to switch products around to make sure it was this that was breaking me out. I wished this product worked out for me! Looked great but broke my sensitive skin out
