I actually loved using this soap. I have a hard time finding soap that doesn’t dry out my skin but this made my skin feel so soft but clean at the same time.  The smell is light enough where it’s not overbearing & it smells wonderful. Additional plus is that Is that it lathers really well so I don’t have to use a ton of product to get my cloth soapy. *this product was received as part of a free sample program* nan
