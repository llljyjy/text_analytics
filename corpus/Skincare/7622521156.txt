I’ve been using this serum for a couple days now and it’s noticeably been making my skin brighter and given it a really natural glow! I like that it’s really lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy even though there’s oil in the formula. I use it before I put on my moisturizer, and it’s been great for everyday use. They suggest 2-3 pumps but I really don’t need more than 1 (maybe 2). Great for glowy skin in the morning!
