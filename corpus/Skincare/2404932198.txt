Was extremely surprised when I received this for review. The packaging is so beautiful. The product itself also is really good. I have mature skin and usually use a heavier eye cream before i start applying my eye makeup. When I swapped it for this one i was vey happily surprised that it works beautifully without it being heavy at all abd the best thing is I really like the feel of the product i can see and feel it works great nan
