Love this SPF. The pearlescent effect is so nice and natural. Doesnâ€™t make you loose greasy at all just a light dew. I got a sample a while ago and it was that curdled texture that everyone hated. I ddnt mind it it still worked very well. The bottle I purchased texture is smooth. The herbal scent is less but still works the exact snow. Very happy with this. Blends into the skin like it was never any colour to it.  (Top swatch is the sample from a month ago Bottom is the bottle from this week) Love
