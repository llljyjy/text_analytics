Finally god my hands on this since it’s been sold out for months. The 4 stars is only because the container is so so small for the price. You really only need a tiny amount to make a difference though so I’ll see how long the container lasts. It works great - covers the redness on my nose and cheeks really well with a small fingertip amount. Will likely purchase again unless I can find a similar product for cheaper. nan
