I don’t have sensitive skin however it does get dry. The cold and wind is terrible on my skin. I thought when I applied the Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm itwould feel thick on my skin but it didn’t.  It absorbed well and lefty skin moisturized and soft, fragrance free. This is definitely my go to product from now on being that I’m in a state where it can be brutally cold for months. WHAT A SURPRISE
