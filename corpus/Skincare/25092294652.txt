I wasn’t excited for this because I thought it would be thick but it’s like a serum lotion/moisturizer and it’s heaven on your face. I honestly don’t wear sunscreen on my face normally and I really should but I have always broken out from the thickness and clogging of my pores so I just stopped wearing it. I absolutely love this formula! It makes your skin look plump and well rested even if you’re actually not. It wears amazing under powder foundation! 10/10 recommend! I received this product from @influenster #complimentary in exchange for my honest review. My new favorite sunscreen!
