I like this. I have redness and acne and I am tanned. This dims all my imperfections. It does take a few minutes for the greeness to fade but when it does it’s very calming. I don’t understand the pale people complaining… my friend used this the day I received it and she is super pale like nc20. And it left her face calmer as well - no green or yellow or anything. Highly recommend!! it’s great and I’m tan
