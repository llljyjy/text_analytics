This cleanser has transformed my skin! I use it 1x a day and alternate with cerave SA cleanser. I have combination skin and was struggling with hormonal breakouts around my chin and jawline and have had minimal breakouts since I started using this cleanser 3 months ago! I wasn’t impressed at first because the texture is different and it doesn’t lather well, but this is a permanent step in my routine now. It reminds me of the DE baby facial (similar color, texture and smell) which I also love. Highly recommend! transformed my skin!
