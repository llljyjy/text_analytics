I usually luv coola products but this one missed the mark for me. First off it smells horrible. It has a strong alcohol odor that’s so bad it smells more like acetone. Contains a chemical that burns my eyes (must keep eyes completely closed until it drys in order to avoid eyes burning). When it dries down it feels like a film of some sort is on my face for awhile. The worst part for me is that it’s nearly impossible to prevent a little of this product from getting in my hair (overspray along the hairline). This product in my hairline is a huge NO for me as it makes my hair feel so gross/dirty and I can’t stand it. Since this product contains alcohol I can maybe see it working for acne prone skin to keep oils at bay as you reapply throughout the day. Also the alcohol I can see being good for cutting down skin Bacteria that leads to acne but I can’t confirm as I don’t have acne prone skin. 100% would not recommend though as it was a huge miss for me. Maybe best for acne prone skin
