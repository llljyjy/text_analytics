To be honest, I was a little skeptical of this product at first. It appears as a solid balm, to be used dry on your face, but it melts instantly as you touch it and applies well to the face. It was able to take off a full face of makeup on its own, and left my face feeling refreshed but not sensitive. I also love how it doesnâ€™t interfere with the rest of my skincare routine and kept my skin clear. Great product!
