This is the holy grail, I’m a glass skin gal, and this solidifies the look. Makes you look dewy, and leaves your skin glowing ( not oily). I am obsessed. I usually use it after my skincare but recently tried it after makeup before using the charlotte spray, and baby everyone complimented my makeup saying it looked better than before. I’m using this till the day I die A must have in my vanity
