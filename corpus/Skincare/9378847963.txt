Out of the 4 products I tried … this is really the only one I was able to use without adverse reactions. I have sensitive combination skin type. My sensitive skin did not react badly to this moisturizer. I tend to be more oily in my T-zone & dry on my cheeks and chin area … so I found that using this on my T-zone made it more oily, but seemed to work well on my dry chin area! I don’t think I would recommend it for someone who has oily skin, but I think if you have dry skin you should try it out! I would also be weary about the odd smell it does have … it’s not a bad smell, but I would particularly call it a good smell either! Pretty Okay
