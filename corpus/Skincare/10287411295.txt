The serum is very light-weighted and hydrating. I like the mixing of the 2 sides and the texture is very good. My skin is smoother and plumper after using it for a week. I would highly recommend this product for those who are looking for anti-aging serum. The perfume scent was a bit strong but didnâ€™t cause any irritation. Plump and smoother skin
