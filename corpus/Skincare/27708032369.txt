I didn’t love this product. This is the third cleansing balm that I’ve used and about to be done with the entire thing and will not be purchasing again. I does noticeably seem to remove black/white heads once it lathers but not as well as the heimish all cleansing balm. It also leaves my face feeling slightly dry. Something that heimish does not do. I recommend heimish over this product! Not purchasing again
