By far my favourite face wash. My husband loves it too and only uses this face wash. HOWEVER, please please do something about the packaging. The hinge of the cap keeps breaking (2 bottles, 2 times in a row now). It seems like it’s ’lightly attached’ and with frequent opening/closing, the hinge breaks. Favourite face wash - but cap keeps breaking
