This might be my favorite serum. And I’m a HUGE serum girl. It reminds me of holy grail Good Genes —  but makes you less shiny so I can wear it during the day. It does everything! Brighten, plump AND I’ve noticed long term effects like lightening stubborn dark spots that have been there forever. I never want to stop using this literal gold in a bottle! Everything.
