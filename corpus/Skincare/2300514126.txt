I was having the worst hormonal break out and so when I was offered this to try I was sceptical if this would help or make things worst! My gawd this stuff is amazing! Not only did it clear up my face but also it evened my skin tone and any red pigmentation from prev acne break outs were gone!!! Smells amazing like lemon orange but light enough it doesn’t bother you and a little bit goes a long way. I did find it to be a tad bit drying which is saying something because I have oily skin but that’s why I liked it. If you already have dry skin it may not be the best for you Amazing
