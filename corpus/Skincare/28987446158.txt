I really wanted to love this, but I just don’t. I agree with many that the scent is just off - lemony but not in a fresh way. The consistency is nothing to write home about and I’m seriously concerned this moisturizer may be the culprit behind my recent acne-prone skin. I’m probably a 1/3 of the way through bottle and don’t know if I’ll ever finish it. Not wowed
