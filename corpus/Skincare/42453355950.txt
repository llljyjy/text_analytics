I have been using this product almost daily for the past week and am amazed at how tan my legs look! The lotion goes on evenly and does not streak which is a huge plus. The watermelon scent is light and not at all overwhelming. I have not noticed any difference in the firmness of my skin, but am loving the beachy sun kissed look! Holy Suntan Batman!
