I tried Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics for 14 days (day & night). My very first try I felt like the cream was kind of sticky and a little bit thick, compared to other moisturizing creams I’ve used before. After my initial application, my face became a bit warm and had that warming sensation that lasted for a few seconds. Comparing the supreme to others, I would say this cream is a little on the thicker side, it is very concentrated and smooth, but it’s very heavy. It also leaves your skin a bit oily and takes a while to dry off. This is not a moisturizing cream I would recommend to be used during the summer, as your face will become stickier with hot weather conditions. I would say it feels like your face is moisturized throughout the day. After 14 days of usage, I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin. It’s supposed to help with dark spots and find wrinkles, however I didn’t notice such changes on myself. One of my main concerns were the final wrinkles below my eyes, which after 14 days I didn’t see any difference. I was hoping my pores would look better but again, no such a difference. Perhaps this product works on other skin types, since my skin is mostly oily. I would not recommend this moisturizing cream for those with oily skin. It would probably be great for those who have dry skin since it will provide moisture, however it is very thick. I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent for my honest review. It’s Alright - On the Heavy Side
