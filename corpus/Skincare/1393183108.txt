I added this serum to my daily skin care routine and I really like it so far. It has a light scent that is not overwhelming and itâ€™s not sticky. It makes my skin feel really soft, and definitely has increased the moisture. I had dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheek area and they are completely gone. No more dry skin!
