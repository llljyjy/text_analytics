I have a sample of the Restorative Eye Cream from an offer of clean products. I chose this because I’ve been trying to find a good eye cream. I have very pronounced bags and dark circles that have gotten worse as I have gotten older. I’ve been using this cream for a few days, there is plenty in the tube to get at least a week out of it. I like that it is thick and rich. It feels good. I do think that the cream is moisturizing. My skin under my eyes does feel softer, but it does nothing for my dark circles. No brightening effect. It’s also not helping the fine lines under my eyes and at the outer corners of my eyes. So, it’s not plumping either. Everyone’s skin really is different. I’m going to continue to use the cream just in case it becomes more effective over time. It really just doesn’t seem like this is working for me, though. I don’t think I’ll be buying the full size. I’m going to have to pass.
