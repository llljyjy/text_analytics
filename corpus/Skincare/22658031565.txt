I received this razor complimentary from Hanni in exchange for my honest thoughts and review. I’ve always been one to use disposable razors with 4 or 5 blades, but Hanni’s weighted razor has changed my perception of shaving. When they say you don’t have to apply any pressure, they mean it! This is the easiest shaving tool I’ve ever used, and while there is a bit of a learning curve with the single blade, I will never go back to disposable razors.  This I excellent for anyone looking for a better shave while wanting to be more eco-friendly! Best Shave Ever!
