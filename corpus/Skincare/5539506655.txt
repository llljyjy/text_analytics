I received this product in exchange for a review.  I enjoyed the texture and lack of discernible scent.   I also appreciate the attempt at being more eco-friendly (though I do believe it is still somewhat over-packaged).   My skin felt smooth and supple once the moisturizer soaked in.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
