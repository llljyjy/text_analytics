I love it!!! :) I bought 4 LANEIGE products already and they all work so well. I struggle with acne and this product helped it so well, within a couple days of using it. I got a gift set first and I definitely recommend to start out with the small ones and see if it works for your skin. The price is definitely pricey but it’s so worth it. The product feels so nice and smooth, I hate oily and sticky products and this one is definitely not that it’s very nice!!! 110% recommend all the LANEIGE products. Also the package is amazing it’s huge and will last long. Love it!!!! :) So amazing.
