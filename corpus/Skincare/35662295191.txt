I like that this is a thicker cream with no fragrance but I’m 99.9% sure this product gave me perioral dermatitis and with more research I’ve now learned that the ingredient “phenoxyethanol” is an ingredient that has high chance of making you develop dermatitis so I will not continue to use unfortunately..
