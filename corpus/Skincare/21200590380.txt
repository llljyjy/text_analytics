I use this year-round, morning and night. It doesn’t pill under sunscreen and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized, but never greasy. It has a subtle honey scent that doesn’t linger. It’s not the most lightweight or rich of moisturizers, which is why I like it– it’s like the goldielocks “just right“ cream! Perfect as my basic daily moisturizer
