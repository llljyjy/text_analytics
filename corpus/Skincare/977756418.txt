I do enjoy using this product as a weekly hydrating overnight mask, especially when Iâ€™ve overdone it on the retinoids/acids. My skin feels hydrated, calmed and plump in the morning. But I think I love it even more for use on the body. I have been working a small amount into my hands and feet (along with anywhere else that feels extra dry) before bed and truly love the way it locks in moisture! Great for all over!
