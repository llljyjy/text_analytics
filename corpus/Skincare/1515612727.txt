Dior Cica Restore & Repair Balm Exceeded my expectations. First, I was concerned that the bomb might be highly fragranced, and to my delight, it wasn’t at all. It has a light fragrance that disappears when I apply it. I usually associate European or international skin care brands with a noticeable fragrance so I was happy that your Cica Balm had no perceivable scent.I use Dior Cica Balm when my skin feels extra dry or when it needs protection from cold and wind. I use it only on my face because I have less expensive options for my body. I think Dior Cica Balm will also be perfect to revive and nourish my skin after a day at the beach or after hiking in the sun and wind.The rich white bomb is not overly thick and not greasy at all. My skin drinks it up quickly, and it doesn’t stain my pillowcase when I use it before bed. Plus a little goes a long way, so it should last me a while. I’m glad to have this hydrating elixir in my dry skin stash. Perfect for My Dry Mature Skin
