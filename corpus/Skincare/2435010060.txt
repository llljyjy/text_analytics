Absolutely love this product! I’ve been using it now for 3 weeks and have noticed a huge improvement on my hyperpigmentation skin. My acne scars have lighten tremendously. This product is lightweight, soft and hydrating! I have extremely sensitive skin and this feels luxurious and gentle. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their skins texture and hyperpigmentation. I use it daily at night after I cleanse my face, just before my moisturizer. I’ve used many similar products, ones much more expensive and this has been the best for quick, noticeable results! If you’re thinking of purchasing, 100% do it. It’s worth it! Love!!! MUST try
