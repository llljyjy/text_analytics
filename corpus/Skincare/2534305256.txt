I was excited to see a squeezy eye serum with the silver cooling tip. Unfortunately, since the packaging is too big for the amount of product provided, it gets difficult to squeeze out to actually use the tip. I also didnâ€™t notice a difference in my under eyes and over time, I found it to irritate my eyes. Product is okay but Packaging is not good
