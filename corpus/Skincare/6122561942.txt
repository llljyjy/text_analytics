Ok, I really love this product! I’ve always been a micellar water kind of person, but this one works way better imo. Feels nice and creamy, comes off easily, doesn’t leave a weird film/residue, doesn’t break me out, doesn’t strip my skin, doesn’t burn my eyes or impair my vision. It takes off my less stubborn mascaras in one go—no raccoon eye residue. For my more stubborn ones, a second tiny amount takes it right off. Would definitely recommend and will repurchase! Works wonders
