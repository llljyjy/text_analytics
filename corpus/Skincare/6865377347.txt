I had high hopes for this but I’m not sure it’s doing much for my skin. It comes in a beautiful sleek bottle, the serum is very lightweight, it feels really nice on the skin and a little goes a long way. The product claims to make skin smoother, healthy looking, and make wrinkles less noticeable. I’ve been using for a couple weeks and haven’t noticed those changes. In fact, my skin developed dry patches and I had some tiny bumps. I’m going to give it another chance and hope to see those benefits. nan
