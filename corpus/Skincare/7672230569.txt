I was worried about that one comment saying the texture is similar to vaseline but it’s definitely not (or we don’t know the same vaseline, like thick, sticky,  greasy). It’s melting and really pleasant on the skin. Also does a great job at removing makeup. I had the Tatcha Camelia oil 2 in 1 and I really prefer the Green clean. Amazing product
