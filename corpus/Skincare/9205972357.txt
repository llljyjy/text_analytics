I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, it has made the skin dryer & darker under my eyes, and the line appear deeper. I’ve read this happens at first with retinol so I will give it another few weeks & reevaluate again. A positive is I haven’t found it irritating, which is great considering I have sensitive skin. nan
