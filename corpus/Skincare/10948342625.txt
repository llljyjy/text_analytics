I definitely subscribe to the theory that price does not determine quality of a product. Up until now pricey creams have left me disappointed while drugstore ones blew me away. This cream is the first that I felt was worth its price point. It leaves my skin moisturized, yet firm and uplifted. I don’t know how to explain it. I feel like I have been catching glimpses of my skin in the mirror and just feeling better about it. For the record I have large pores with redness and texture, some acne scarring. While this product wasn’t necessarily a miracle in a bottle (I don’t think anything truly is) It made me feel better about my skin and even has me going make up free more often. I wouldn’t advise you to go into debt over this, however if you have the money and feel like giving yourself a little something extra, do it with this product. When extra cash is on hand this will be a gift I continue to give myself. I use it in the morning and evening taking the time to endure in a little face massage each time. Something about this cream makes me feel pampered and like a little mini spa time. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Spa Day in a Jar
