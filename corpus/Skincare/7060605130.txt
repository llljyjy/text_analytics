I received a free sample of Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème from Influenster in return for my honest review.  This is one of my Al time favorites, to dare, in facial care products.  The sample I received was small but it went a long way.  I decided to use the entire jar before writing my review so I could testify to short term use results va long term and I am so glad that I did.  After 3 days use, morning and night, in addition to my daily routines, I saw results that included finer softer lines around my mouth and eye area.  My pores seemed less noticeable and my skin felt firmer. Over the next two weeks, I noticed that my age spots were getting lighter.  And by  week 5 my dark/age spots were barely noticeable at all.  I was an avid boater on the Chesapeake  growing up and I worshipped the sun and it’s burning rays.  Sunscreen was not a concern back in the day and I am paying dearly for it in my 50’s with signs of the suns damage from so many years ago.  I have tried a variety  of face care products but I never had such satisfying noticeable results so fast.  Especially from a facial cream.  My skin appears dewy by week 4 and make up goes on flawlessly over Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power .  The smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  The consistency and texture is thick but very smooth  I am glad I waited to use the entire sample because the long term use had far more results than what I noticed at 2.  I will be purchasing the full size as soon as it I back in stock and will  recommend to anyone with pure confidence. Dewy smooth skin after the fist use.
