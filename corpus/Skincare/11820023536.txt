I’ve been using this for over a month now. With and without spf. This hydrating cream has Hyaluronic acid which is a bonus for me because with out that substance idk how my skin would react. I have hyperpigmentation around my mouth area and in order to keep it in control I have to consistently keep up with my skincare routine. As well as sunscreen. My skin loved this product since the beginning of our journey. All because it’s hydrating , soothing , and most importantly provides Hyaluronic acid. It’s a bit pricey but it’s definitely worth buying. It does have a scent to it in my opinion but I don’t mind it. i recommend
