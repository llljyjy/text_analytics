I  really like the idea of refillable! It is much mor environment friendly. It is super easy to uninstall the pod. But I didn’t get an extra refill pod so I don’t know whether it will work if you already have the bottle and just buy an extra refill pod. I also concern about whether it will seal as good. But overall I like the refill idea and keep trying this style. The Eye cream itself is very soft. And it makes my skin around eyes feel comfortable and moisture. Looking forward to see the long term result. Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare for my honest review. nan
