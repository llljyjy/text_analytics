Left my face a little shiny and oily feeling. I received this as a free sample from Influenster. The moisturizing effect is fabulous. It does look a little shiny but for matter a mask and at night time I love it. I used my most drying face wash then applied this moisturizer. It did the job well. I was a fan of everything but the shiny look after. A little shiny but great
