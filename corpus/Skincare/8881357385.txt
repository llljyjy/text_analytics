yttp is one of the few brands where i can try any product and my skin will love it. this left my skin feeling so soft, it felt lightweight and had a barely noticeable scent. i got this as a free sample, but it’s def not a summer moisturizer for me. i get pretty sweaty during the summer so i stick to gel moisturizers over cream ones. i don’t think that’s a product issue so i’m not gonna knock it down a rating, bc i’ll just end up using this as a night cream and still be happy w it! soft skin
