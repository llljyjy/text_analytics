This was a good, classic moisturizer that provided a hint of color as it moisturized.  The color matching was available in multiple tints and I was able to find a natural coverage shade.  The product went on creamy and did not flake the color as the day progressed.  My skin felt moisturized for hours through the day. Good Moisturizer
