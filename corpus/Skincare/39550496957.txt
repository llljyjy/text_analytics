I really like it a lot, I recommend it, I like that it works as a corrector when it arrives, I try it in my hand first and I like that it has that touch that it doesnâ€™t bounce that you have the product applied, I really recommend it to all the people who love it makeup h we like to have our skin cared for with good products like Dr.Jart nan
