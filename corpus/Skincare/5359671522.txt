Caudalie Vinopure toner is one of my favorite skin care products and I’ve been using it for years! It does not dry you out at all. It does not leave your skin feeling sticky and wears really well under makeup! It’s helps breakouts in a very gentle way. By far, my favorite toner! Super fresh and clean toner!
