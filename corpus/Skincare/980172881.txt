It should be because Jamaicans clearly have skin secrets! I’ve been using the ROSE serums and moisturizer for years. But I would just use whatever cleanser was handy. I have been shown the error of my ways. I’ve had this cleanser for about a month. My 50+ skin feels and looks hydrated. Kind of bouncy, kind of glowy. And a little goes a loooooong way. Only for something I love would I forego makeup (and filters) for a pic! Is J-Beauty a thing?
