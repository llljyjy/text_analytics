I have very dry, dehydrated skin with some light acne scarring. I picked this up to help with the scarring, but I wasn’t prepared for how silky smooth it would make my skin. I have a very hard time maintaining moisture and this is definitely one of the better creams I’ve found for that. I haven’t used it long enough to see a difference in my scarring but I’m happy with it anyway! The scent is medium, kind of a sweet orange - personally I would prefer less scent but it is pleasant over all. The packaging feels luxurious and heavy, the pump especially. If this had less scent and were more affordable it would be 5 stars. nan
