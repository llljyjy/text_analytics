I received the serum sample which came with the eye cream and face cream in this line. I used the serum underneath the face cream to maximize the potency of the cream which actually made my skin so supple and hydrated the next morning. I like the texture of the serum which is not sticky like most other serum do. It is very comfortable to use and sinks in completely upon absorption on skin. Added bonus to complement face cream
