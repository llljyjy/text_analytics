I received this product free for my honest review. This brand of sunscreen is great! I have sensitive skin and although this is lightly fragranced, it does not irritate my skin. I choose the oil free one over this one just because I have an oily t-zone and am more prone to breakouts. It goes on very smoothly and leaves your face feeling freshly moisturized. Love it
