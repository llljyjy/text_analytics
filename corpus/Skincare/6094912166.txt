At first, when I put on the sunscreen I wasn’t sure about it since it felt pretty oily. After a long day at work, I absolutely love the sunscreen. I’m planning on buying the full size after I finish this sample size. My skin is usually really picky but my skin looks super good, not oily which sometimes sunscreen makes my skin look like. Obsessed!!
