I was pretty disappointed with this product. First of all, it has a pretty thick texture, which I didn’t mind. However, the bottle made it really hard to squeeze out, since this is hard plastic. I would have to squeeze the bottle very hard and I would always end up squeezing too much product. The bottle lasted me about 3 weeks and there was still some product inside that I never managed to get out. Overall, I didn’t see much of a difference in my skin. It’s not a terrible product, but they definitely have to update the packaging. Meh product
