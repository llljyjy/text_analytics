Wow, this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is a game changer! I’ve tried soooooo many serums, but this one tops them all! This serum does everything I need it to. It repairs, resurfaces, and replumps my skin, in one step! I love that it contains both a retinoid AND hyaluronic acid. Now I know what all the hype is about. It actually works! It’s as effective as one laser treatment and my skin looked and felt smoother after just a few uses. This serum is a powerful combination of everything my skin needs. It instantly absorbs, and works great under makeup or on its own.I’m looking forward to seeing more improvements over the next few weeks. Excellent quality, and a little goes a very long way. So happy that I got to try this new Clinique #freeproduct ! Love the instant results!
