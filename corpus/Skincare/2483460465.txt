This serum goes on nicely and is not sticky. For the price, I expected better results. The scent is pleasant (smells like oranges) but fragrance should not be part of skin care. The pump does not reach the bottom of the bottle, and therefore, a lot of product is left. I had to use a small spatula to dig out the product. Too expensive to have product left in the bottom of the bottle. This product is just OK
