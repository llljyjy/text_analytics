I purchased this after a random breakout all over my forehead (later realized it was my hair products). Even though my skin type leans more oily, I could visibly see that my pimples were smaller and less red after the first use. I’ve used it a night and during the day under spf and both situations work well. A little goes a long way. It’s been a couple weeks and my skin is clearing up with no new breakouts! forehead is clearing up!
