These are awesome. I got them in a gift set quite awhile ago and didn’t really use them.I started having a breakout on my chest from hot yoga, and I tried tea tree cream and a few other care products and nothing was helping.On a whim, I grabbed one of these pads, and within a day it started clearing up and a few days later it was completely gone.  They’ve become a part of my daily routine. Great for controlling breakouts
