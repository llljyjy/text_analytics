I was hesitant to purchase a face oil as I have combination skin. I struggle with breakouts along my jaw and t-zone but I am dry/dull in other areas. I’m a loyal Summer Fridays consumer so I decided to purchase and started mixing two drops with my face cream. Game changer. I don’t even need to wear foundation because I have such a dewy natural glow. I get compliments on my skin constantly. It’s hydrating without being greasy. I have had zero breakouts. If you wear minimal makeup and are looking for a next level dewy glow, this is it. Natural & Dewy
