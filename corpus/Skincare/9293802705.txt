This is the only sunscreen I can use around my eyes that doesn’t sting my eyeballs! Works beautifully under foundation and also performs like a primer. It is creamy and not drying at all. The formula is a little thick so to help it spread easier I usually start with a really light layer of the Dramatically Different moisturizer right out of the shower, then apply a layer of the sunscreen a few minutes later. My only wish is that it contained a higher SPF like 70, but 50 is still pretty good. I’ve used this while actually sunbathing and on vacations with a lot of outdoor walking, and I never burn. Doesn’t sting eyes!
