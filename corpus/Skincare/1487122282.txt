Thanks to Topbox Circle, I got to try a small sample of this winkle correcting eye serum for free. Please note that all of the opinions are my own and I am in no way sponsored. Unfortunately, the small sample that I received only lasted me for three days so I can’t really comment on whether I liked it or disliked it. All I can really comment is that the product didn’t cause me to break out especially because I have combination skin that is on the oilier side. #FreeProduct #TryWithTopbox Average Wrinkle Correcting Serm
