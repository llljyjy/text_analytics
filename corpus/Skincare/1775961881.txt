I’ve tried a few products from Kosas and up until recently thought they only made make up products. As an esthetician I am always open to trying new products an I was able to try the spray serum. The spray serum from Kosas has some great ingredients such as vegan collagen and hyaluronic acid. I had never thought of using a spray serum and haven’t really seen others on the market. This spray serum comes in a glass bottle with a sprayer that provides an even mist when sprayed. The mist doesn’t go on in big droplets which makes application more even and comfortable. A little goes a long way with this product. It provides this instant plumpness to my skin. I have dry skin and often apply serum but do sometimes skip it if my time is limited. This spray serum makes it easy to apply even on a tight schedule. I have been using this Kosas Spray on serum for over a month and my skin truly loves it. It provides hydration and can be used morning or night. This is NOT a setting spray so I don’t suggest using it over make up unless you need some extra hydration. It is a skincare product that makes life easier. I can’t wait to try more skincare from Kosas. So plumping
