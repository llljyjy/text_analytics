I was lucky that maybe the Gua Sha I have didnâ€™t break as most got it from the mail or from the package. Few things that it needs to be changed so as not to break easily; the package is so cheaply made. Inside to hold the Gua Sha is just moulding styrofoam no sleeve or cover to prevent breaking, 2nd how thin is the Gua Sha that while using it can break very easily for the price. I had the roller but is somewhat the same he has silk protection and moulding styrofoam but not enough for the thin facial tools to be protected in the packaged Please update them!
