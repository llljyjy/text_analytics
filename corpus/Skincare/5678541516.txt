I love this because it not only visibly reduces dark spots, but it brightens up your skin and visibly reduces post acne marks. It’s lightweight and doesn’t have an oily or greasy feeling, nor does it irritate or dry out your skin. It’s good for all skin types, even gentle enough for those with sensitive skin. It’s paraben and sulfate free. It’s very easy to use because it comes in a bottle with a dropper so you can get the amount you need. You use it in the morning and at nighttime after you wash your face and before you add your moisturizer. It can be used all over your face or just as a spot treatment. Also, it was dermatologist tested. nan
