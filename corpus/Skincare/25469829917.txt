This cream is so hydrating and feels luxurious on the skin. It also doesnâ€™t have an overwhelming smell which is a plus. It works well on top of my toner and serum and leaves my face plump and supple. I highly recommend it to someone who wants a thick and moisturizing cream which has anti-aging properties. Luxurious cream!
