I have combo skin.  I am able to try It Confidence in a Cream and after using for two weeks, this product does a wonderful job making my face feel velvety and soft.  I started using one to two times daily and presently am applying every other day.  Really high performing!  I can use this cream all year round.  Donâ€™t need much to apply and based on the jar size, will last several months.  Nicely priced.  Highly recommend! Thumb's up!
