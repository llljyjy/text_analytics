I have a love-hate relationship with face masks. My face tends to get very dry from them, so I am pretty picky. But the honey in this one kept my skin from drying out, and my face was glowing and smooth after I washed it off. Plus it smells delicious! I will definitely repurchase when I run out. beautiful mask!
