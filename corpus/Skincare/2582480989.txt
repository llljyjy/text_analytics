I received this product to try out and review. It was on the smaller side so I didn’t have enough to use for a long duration of time. From a first impression standpoint, this product was lightweight and absorbed quickly similar to the other Clinique smart repair line. There was a very light scent to this product, but it didn’t irritate my skin. I have always been a fan of Clinique products and recommend if you have sensitive skin. A good first impression!
