A friend recommended this product to me as I have quite a bit of dark spots/hyperpigmentation  on my face. I love the smell of this toner and it feels cooling/refreshing on my skin. I’ve been using this product for quite awhile now (recently purchased my third bottle) and it has been slowly lessening the dark spots on my face! It does make my skin oily though. However this doesn’t bother me too much as I use other products to help with the oilyness. nan
