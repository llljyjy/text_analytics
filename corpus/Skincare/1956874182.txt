The Hyaluronic acid serum is amazing! I bought this to test out each for less initial costs. The cream is very light weight. Doesn’t smell much at all. Very clean and simple. The enzyme cleanser is similar to the one Amore Pacific makes. Comes out a dusty powder and foams to scrub. My favorite part is the Hyaluronic serum though. I noticed an immediate lift and glow from using. I’ve tried them all (skinceuticals dr Dennis gross Peter Thomas Roth etc.) this one has zero scent no color just simple and definitely lifting and pure. Two thumbs up. Hyaluronic Serum for the Win!
