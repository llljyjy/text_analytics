I absolutely love this product, itâ€™s one of the very few I buy consistently. It starts as a solid and melts on your face and fingers, removing almost ever trace of makeup. I did find that for waterproof or layered under eye makeup, you may have to use extra balm or a cotton pad and a makeup remover. I will always recommend this product to anyone who regularly does their makeup! Best Makeup Remover Ever
