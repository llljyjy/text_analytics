I actually really love this product! I had to write a review after I read how many people wrote such bad reviews on it. It almost deterred me from buying it, but I did it anyways and I’m so glad I did. I didn’t find it to pile on my face at all. I wanted it for a quick skin care item for the summer with no makeup yet alittle glow and some overall even toned look. It does just that. I do put moisturizer on underneath and I didn’t pile at all. I use my fingers and just tap it in. I bought shade 2 even tho I am pretty light. It’s very forgiving and blends out so nice that the 2 works for light to medium skin tones for sure. I do wish the price was alittle cheaper for such little product you receive however it is skincare and more “clean” and u tend to pay for that aspect. I would still buy it again! It’s great for that everyday quick throw on and go skin I love it
