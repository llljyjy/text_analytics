Y’all this is a really great product! It works!! The picture is 4hrs after application and I was indoors the entire time! Imagine if I was outside in the sun! The formula is perfect, not greasy and my skin absorbed it well. No streaks left on my skin either! The scent is Chef’s Kiss! 50 Shades of St Tropez!
