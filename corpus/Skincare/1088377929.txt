I have an engineering background and discovered the bottle has a design flaw. The pump in the chamber is not designed to release the entire serum. About a 1/3 of the product will never be able to be used unless you disassemble the bottle. The bottom third cannot go through the pump chamber due to insufficient action from the insert sleeve. Most consumers would assume they used all the product when the pump stops bringing it up through the chamber. But it can be easily proved when the bottle is disassembled and you can clearly see a substantial amount of serum still left in the insert sleeve. It’s unable to be used the way it’s designed. This needs to be addressed by the manufacturer because consumers are not getting what they are paying for Design flaw concerning bottle defect
