This product was sent to me by Influenster free of charge in exchange for my honest review. Estee Lauder has done it again! This face cream is not only elegant but extremely moisturizing. It’s richness leaves your face so soft and feeling young and healthy. My face is oily and although this is a rich creme it does not produce that oily, sticky feeling. The scent is strong and reminds me of expensive scents. I honestly didn’t think I’d love this nor need it as much as I did. Highly recommend! Oh so soft
