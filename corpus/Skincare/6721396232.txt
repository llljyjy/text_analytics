I have been a big fan of Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester CCC + Ferulic Brightening Complex for a while now. The retail value is close to $160 but I mainly purchase it on sale at about $135. The Perricone MD works wonders and I was so happy to try this similar Lancôme formula out. It did not disappoint. The Lancôme Renergie Triple Serum is around $135 retail and $115 on sale. The ingredients are stored separately in one bottle. I love the idea but the container seems to fail to dispense all three of the ingredients properly when stored upright. To deal with the packaging issue, simply store on its side. When the proper mix of ingredients is dispensed, you get immediate plumping results. After using for three weeks, I noticed my face was softer and brighter. I loved trying this product out but I can get the Perricone MD for around the same price. If Lancôme lowered their price, though, they would rival the Perricone. I’d definitely recommend this product. Great Brightening Serum!
