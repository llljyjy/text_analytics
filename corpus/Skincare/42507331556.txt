This review is a 4 out of 5 as the sample size #freeproduct was not enough to know if there would be any tolerance issues. This serum absorbs beautifully, is light, no fragrance and my skin loved it...soft and silky to the touch. Clinique suggests using the cream, eye cream and serum together in one program.  I would suggest mixing the serum with the cream as it helps the cream absorb more quickly and it isnâ€™t sticky.  I would recommend this serum for first time users and long term users looking for a change or something new. Great absorption, soft and smooth!
