I am deciding to give this a 5 star review because this is everything I need in a moisturizer. I have extremely dry skin that’s acne prone so it’s important to find something that is moisturizing but not heavy like it’s going to clog my pores and that’s exactly what this moisturizer is. It’s perfect for a day and a night time moisturizer and it’s works well with all of my other skin care products in my regimen. If you have dry skin, you need this moisturizer, and it would work well for any other skin type as well it’s very gentle, there’s not a strong scent and it doesn’t clog your pores. Skin transforming
