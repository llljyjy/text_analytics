I really liked the packaging of this serum. It is stylish, elegant and looks great on the bathroom counter.The serum helped my combination skin a lot. After using this product for 1 month, I noticed that my skin became more hydrated and healthy, without a greasy feeling. It makes your skin glow, not shine, which is important for my skin type. I also enjoyed the lightweight texture of this product. The scent is pretty neutral too. Overall, I liked this product and would buy it again! Elegant packaging and a great product!
