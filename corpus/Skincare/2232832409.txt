Pros: easy to use product; consistency is okay, slightly runny; has beautiful sheen to the liquid. Cons: the smell is horrific and so off putting; the bottle I received appeared to have leaked and had a gross goo around the rim; I don’t think the product produces the results it claims to. I wouldn’t buy this for myself and feel disappointed. Overall, it’s just “meh“ and not worth the price. Mixed feelings
