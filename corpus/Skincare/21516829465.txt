I was nervous to try this because of the retinol- my skin takes different to different retinol products in terms of flakiness. My skin flaked LIGHTLY after the 3rd use but it improved after that and no longer was flakey- just moisturized! I apply at night after cleansing and before moisturizing. Sometimes i donâ€™t even add a moisturized and i just use this. It absorbs quickly in my skin & has a very soft fragrance. Great stuff
