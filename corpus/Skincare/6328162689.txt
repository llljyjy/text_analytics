It is very light weight and hydrating. This is my first toner and it feels like its making a huge difference in my skin care routine. I have also tried the Cream skin toner and it feels like this would go hand in hand if you like to have a morning and night toner. The fragrance is light and refreshing. Amazing Toner that shows results quickly.
