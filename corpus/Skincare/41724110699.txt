Thick and creamy with very fine particles for scrubbing. I’m not really fond of the lemony Pledge fragrance. Really seems to smooth out fine lines and shrink my pores.  I also love that it seems to polish away my dry patches.  I believe this is great for anyone to use, even those with sensitive skin.  My face has so much sun damage and I’m hoping this will help with continued use. The pictures are before and after 3 weeks of use, meaning only 6 applications.  The pictures don’t exactly show much difference but I can feel the difference. My face feels and looks better with each use!
