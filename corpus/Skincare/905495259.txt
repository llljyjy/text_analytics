As a Sephora Community Ambassador, I wanted to share my honest opinion about this product.  I think this moisturizer is great!  I don’t know why this isn’t talked about more.  This didn’t irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin and it’s got great skincare ingredients (bakuchiol, ceramides).    I find one pump does do the job, and I can apply it to my face and neck, it just isn’t as smooth as other moisturizers I have used that also have a thick texture (Belif, Sunday Riley).  It lasted about 2.5 months, which I find to be on par. The downside is the texture + pump.  Its texture is pretty thick - not as emollient as I would like.  I had A LOT of product left at the bottom, so I suggest getting a little scoop to get it out or turning it upside down once you notice it’s not dispensing as well.  This is not a dealbreaker, but troublesome, makes me wish the product came in a jar vs a pump. Great product, could use repackaging
