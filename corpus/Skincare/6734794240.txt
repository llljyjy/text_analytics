#freeproduct I received a sample from Topbox and used it morning and night.  I really liked this wrinkle correcting serum as it didn’t have a scent, the texture was really nice (silky) and it dried instantly (no waiting for it to dry).  It left my skin very smooth and I wish the sample was bigger as it’s hard to judge by such a small sample but my first impressions were great and made me want more (or to continue using it). I enjoyed using every last drop of it. This serum has amazing texture and dries instantly
