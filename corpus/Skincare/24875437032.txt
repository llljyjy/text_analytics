Worst Beauty Product I have used in years. Does not remove makeup. Does not make skin feel clean. Does literally nothing. Tap water is 100x more effective. Tossed in the trash in favor of some grocery store cleanser I had in the back ofthe cabinet, which is 1000x better than this. I have rarely been so unimpressed. Worse than grocery/pharmacy cleansers (by a lot)
