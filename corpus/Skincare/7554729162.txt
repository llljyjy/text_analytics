Feels very smooth but thick. My face is generally dry. I do feel that this helps with hydration so far. Compared to other facial lotion, I feel that I need to apply more in order to cover my entire face since this cream feels less creamy unlike others. Another thing that I like is that this cream does not have any smell to it or barely any smell. nan
