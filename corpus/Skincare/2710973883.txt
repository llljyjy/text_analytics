I don’t leave many reviews but I’ve been searching for a great sunscreen for the longest time and I’ve finally found it!. As a WOC and someone who has oily/combo skin, it’s been so hard to find a sunscreen that 1. Won’t leave a white cast and 2. Won’t leave me feeling super greasy/oily. I’ve tried the Unseen Sunscreen and the Play sunscreen from Supergoop in the past but both left me feeling so greasy. I picked this up last week while I was shopping in-store and decided to give it a try. I can confidently say that I can stop my search for a good sunscreen. I will say that when you first put it on it does leave your face feeling dewy, but NOT greasy and throughout the day it does tend to sink into the skin turning into more of a powdery/skinlike finish. I’ve only worn it while WFH so I can’t attest to how it wears while swimming or sweating. Others have also it smells weird or chemically. I’m fairly sensitive to smell/fragrance and it has a regular sunscreen smell that isn’t overwhelming. I’m only giving 4 stars because I they need a bigger bottle, I also imagine I’ll have to cut with scissors to get to the remaining product once I finish it. HOLY GRAIL!!
