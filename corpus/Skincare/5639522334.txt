I received this complimentary from influenster to give my honest review.  I love that it has zero scent and that it goes on smoothly.  I have only been using for a couple weeks so I don’t see much change other than under my eyes appear smooth and hydrated.  My downfall to this is that for some reason it will pill up when I rub my eyes.  And it comes off. So I’m not sure that I needed that extra hydration if it’s not truly soaking into my skin. nan
