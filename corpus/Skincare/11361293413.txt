The original version of this moisturizer was what hooked me and convinced me to try other skincare from IT Cosmetics. Years later, multiple products from IT are still at the top of my skincare arsenal.Confidence in a Cream was already amazing, so the fact that they “supercharged“ it is awesome. It has a beautiful, rich formulation that sinks right into skin. It feels wonderful, and not at all heavy especially for an anti aging cream. This was my go to before, and it will be for the foreseeable future. Even better than the OG?!
