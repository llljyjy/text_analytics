I loved this tinted moisturizer was very lightweight with great coverage. When I first open it it felt like a watery consistency and I didn’t think it would have a good coverage. After applying it it was a great coverage felt very light as if I didn’t have anything on. I normally struggle finding the perfect shade for my skin tone but this one matched perfectly I love it so much. I highly recommend it especially for days when you want a more “natural“ look with less steps to achieve it. I absolutely love this product!! Love this!!
