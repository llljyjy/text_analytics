Love itt ! Immediately calms down irriated skin. At night I use it before applying my serum so it keeps stinging at bay and then end with a moisturizer . In the morning I wash my face with facewash and sometimes without and end with this toner and do not use moisturizer after as it is very moisturizing so you don’t really need extra moisture. I would continue using it and update my review after a couple of months to make sure it doesn’t cause any breakouts but untill now it is just perfect ! MOISTURE in a bottle !
