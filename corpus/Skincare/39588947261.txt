I received this product and honestly,  I didn’t know what to expect. While using this product, I noticed it’s thicker consistency and sweet/fruity(?) smell. It’s pleasant and feels nice on the skin. I was honestly surprised that it didn’t leave a sticky texture on the face. The product has a hole at the top that opens when you spin it. I believe this was to make it more hygienic, but I struggle a bit to maneuver the bottle to get some out (might just be me) I was able to cut out some other products with just this one. I have semi-sensitive skin and this did not give me any reactions. But if you’re skin is super sensitive, I would check the ingredients just in case. The biggest change I noticed with this product is that it made my skin less oily and it’s only been a week. For the price and how long it lasts you, it’s not bad. Honestly, I would buy it again so I recommend it. Very Hydrating!
