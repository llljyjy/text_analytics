Love love love this sunscreen.  I do not wear foundation or make-up but know the importance of wearing sunscreen so I donâ€™t end up with a million winkles.  This sunscreen is so light and smells amazing. I usually hate the feeling of anything on my face but this product feels great.  I wore it on my face during the middle of summer in Palm Springs and was totally protected. So lightweight!
