I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. As you can see in the photo, it’s a tiny sample so I cannot give a good or bad review about this product as I didn’t get enough to test it out properly. However from the first two uses, I can tell you it’s a very hydrating gel like texture and moisturising on the skin. If you have dry skin and want something moisturising without the greasy feeling then give it a try. nan
