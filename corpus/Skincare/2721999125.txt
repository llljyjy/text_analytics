I was very skeptical buying this because of the price range. Since there’s no mini version I just have to trust it. I love this. After one week the texture on my skin decreased by … a lot lol. I don’t have acne prone skin so I’m not sure how it would affect others who do have it. But it almost has a natural blurring effect on my skin. Once I get the coloring right on my skin and combine it with this, I might not need foundation anymore. Love love it. I BELIEVE WHAT IT ADVERTISED
