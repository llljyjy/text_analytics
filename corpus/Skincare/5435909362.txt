This mask is amazing. I always notice that my skin is clearer for days after using it. I try to use one at least once a week, ideally twice. It is a little pricey but I keep buying them because they work! I use the excess product in the pouch on my shoulders, neck, and chest to make sure those areas stay clear as well and it really works like a charm on body acne too. One of my favourites!
