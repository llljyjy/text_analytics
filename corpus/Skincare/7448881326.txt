I like this product as it works for me. I use it as a foundation replacement (after using moisturizer), powder my face and I’m good to go. It definitely pulls a certain colour and will not work for everyone so I’d suggest swatching in store before buying, also may not work for dry skin as it’s a bit chalky. My pictures are with one with no makeup, and with cicapair/bronzer/mascara. Perfect -if you meet the criteria
