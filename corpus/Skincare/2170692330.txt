I was skeptical but ordered on a whim since Im breaking out and terrible about making it worse picking to get them to go away. These do a.WONDERFUL job of reducing pimple size, redness and if you have a whitehead it sucks all the ooky stuff out of your skin. I have very sensitive skin that reacts to everything and I had NO problem with these at all. I also love the nude shade for my fair skin so I dont feel too silly around the house with stickers on my face. Im sold and will be using these as a permanent treatment staple. Pro tip: cut them in half or quarters for smaller spot treatment! Skeptical but now sold on them for life
