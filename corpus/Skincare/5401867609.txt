I guess since I bought this during a sale, I can’t complain too much, but I wasn’t overly impressed with the Sephora Collection Coconut Foot Mask. Did it leave my feet nice and soft the next morning, absolutely, thus the 3 stars! Did I get any exfoliation? Not in the slightest! If you can pick one up on sale, or if you’ve got a an extra $5, give it a try and maybe you’ll have better luck than I did. Apparently many other reviewers have. Bad to pedicures at the salon for me for now. nan
