By far, a life saver for aging skin. Not once, but twice I was told by friends my skin looked flawless. I’m turning 60 and you would not know it. This is a facelift in a jar. Don’t ponder, researched anymore. This is the stuff and you only need a little to cover your face. Look younger with one jar!
