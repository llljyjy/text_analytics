I really enjoying trying the It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream moisturizer. I have a combination skin so I don’t like creams that make my face feel too oily and this doesn’t do that. A little goes a long way so you don’t need to slather too much of this on at a time and has a soft fragrance to it that isn’t too overpowering. After about a month of using it my skin feels plumper and more lively. I sometimes have issues where my skin feels too dry and starts flaking but I haven’t had that issue since starting this cream. Overall I really like it and hopefully with continuous use will see more benefits to my face. Great moisturizer for combination skin
