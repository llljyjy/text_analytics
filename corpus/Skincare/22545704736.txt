Pretty nice eye gel. I do feel like it plumped up my eye area & made wrinkles look less harsh. I got gifted a teeny jar by #Influenster so I could not tell if more goodness was to come. Once note: itâ€™s not really moisturizing, a moisturizer is definitely needed after. Overall, I did like it. Curious to see what would happen the longer I used it. Quite nice eye gel
