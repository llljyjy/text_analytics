Iâ€™ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love it! I always use it in the evenings (I have a different eye cream for morning) since it is gentle and hydrating without feeling too heavy. I used to wake up with my skin feeling tight and dry around my eyes, but that is no longer the case! I absolutely recommended! nan
