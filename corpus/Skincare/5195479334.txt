I’m always on the hunt for a good moisturizer. I have combination skin that tends to be on the oily side, I’m also allergic to silicones and fragrance. I heard of this moisturizer from a Sephora consultant and she raved about this and the ingredients but of course before shelling out the $80 I wanted to try it out so I purchased the travel size and it was great at first. My skin didn’t react to it and it was a great base for make up. So I went back and decided to purchase the full bottle and everything seemed great the container is very sanitary. But fast forward to about a month in and I found my skin becoming patchy and flakey. I realized my skin needed more moisture as now I was flakey and an oil slick in my Tzone. Super bummed it has to be this way I really had high hopes. nan
