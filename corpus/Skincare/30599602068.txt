I received this ILIAC Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen from PinchMe for my honest review. I thought that it was a nice smooth serum. It had a nice scent to it but when it came to it being tinted though, it did nothing for me in that department. I also found it to leave my skin a bit on the oily side after trying it. I think as a moisturizing sunscreen itâ€™s great but not so great as a tint. Meh...
