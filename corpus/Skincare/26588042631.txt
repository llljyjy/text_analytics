I was skeptical at first, but don’t be fooled! I was looking for a great replacement for a hydrating mask and I found it! Starting off packaging is 100/10 magnetic applicator attaches to lid?!!! Like how neat is that, and the consistency of this mask is so nice. I have very oily combo skin and I noticed a reduction of oil production over a 2 month period. Heats up and turns white. Wash off is literally so easy compared to other masks. I love this brand and will try tons of other things from them. I definitely recommend this mask to all oily and combo skin care junkies out there!! I’m Shocked
