I honestly did not want to fall in love w this product because of the price butâ€¦ truth be told, I fell in deep. This moisturizer has been such a game-changer to my skincare routine. There was a significant change with the texture of my skin and my pores shrunk with first couple uses. Plus, the packaging and the product is definitely of luxe quality. Now, I just need to wrap my head around the price tag. luxe magic in a jar~
