I was gifted the new Peace Out Instant Pore Perfector in exchange for my honest review. Wow! I really love this! I have been looking for a product to wear on days that I don’t wear makeup to help with my large pores and redness stemming from my two pregnancies. This stuff is great! After showering and applying lotion I took a small amount and concentrated on the reddest portions of my face and large pores. I tapped it on to apply. Smooth consistency and gives a matte finish. Can’t wait to keep using!! Definitely recommend! If you have large pores and redness, buy this!!!
