If you have oilky skin, this product is a big no no. It leaves my skin oily, kind of feels like you’re applying lip balm to your face. Does not feel like a cleanser. The balm is so thick that it doesn’t come out of the tube. They definitly need to rework the package. It pains me to say this because I love The Inkey List, but this product is not good at all. Not good, don't recommend
