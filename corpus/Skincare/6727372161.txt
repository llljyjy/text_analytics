I found my new favorite sunscreen. If you were looking for an spf that wears beautifully underneath makeup look no further. This SPF goes on so smooth, it does have a thicker texture but it applies so evenly and doesn’t add a white cast. My eyes don’t water either like they do with most SPF’s. Love this stuff.
