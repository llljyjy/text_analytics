Nice product but alergic to something in it. It did make my face feel really soft however, but about half an hour after use my face felt so itchy. I gave it two stars because it did do as expected, nice soft skin, but personally I didnâ€™t like it because my skin broke out and became very itchy. Nice product, however I'm alergic to it.Be careful
