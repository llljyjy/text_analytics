Starting to suffer with acne at 48 is not fun! After getting my diet, stress,  hormones  and skin care in line it was time to tackle the hyperpigmentation damage. It’s been a few weeks and along with other products I see a market difference. My goal is to be able to go back to having make up as a choice…. Hyperpigmentation Be Gone!
