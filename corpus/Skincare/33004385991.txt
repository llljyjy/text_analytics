This serum is the BEST. I was on Retin-A for 5 years and weaned myself off a few years ago. Ever since then I’ve been looking for a more potent retinol to incorporate into my routine for acne-prone skin. This serum combines two of my fav ingredients for combatting acne, and I feel like I’ve already seen a difference after a few uses.I did not experience any irritation or purging, but like I said I’ve been using some form of retinol/retinal for years now!All in all I think this will be my new retinal of choice :) LOVEEEEE for acne-prone skin!
