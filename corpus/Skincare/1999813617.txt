I used the small travel-size bottle. I saw significant changes while using this toner compared to when not using it. My skin didn’t feel or look any more or less moisturized, my pores were not smaller nor did I see any dirt on the cotton pad I used. I can honestly say it didn’t hurt or help my skin in any way. I saw no benefit
