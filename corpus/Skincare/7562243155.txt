I am already a huge fan of the brand, so I was thrilled to see this new addition and get to use it! It is lightweight, non-irritating( some vitamin C serums can be very irritating to sensitive skin) and leaves my skin feeling great! The only potential  issue I forsee with this product is the pump as I am going to want to use every last drop and a dropper is usually better for that. Other than that, a wonderful product. Great addition to the FAB lineup!
