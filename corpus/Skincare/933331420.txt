This is a great sunscreen that I use almost every day alone or under makeup. I’m glad I ignored the bad reviews. The “problem“ with the dropper is likely user error for most people. You have to take the dropper out of the bottle, squeeze the bulb, insert it into the bottle and then release the bulb. Do that and you’ll get a dropper full of sunscreen with no issues at all. Also helps to shake the bottle before you open it. Some people complained about it being too thick, but I found it to be very light and easy to apply. It also gives your skin a nice, dewy look. The protection level is also great. I have melasma and this sunscreen prevents my spots from getting darker when I’m out in the sun. I’ve tried many different facial sunscreens for my sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite. Love this mineral sunscreen!
