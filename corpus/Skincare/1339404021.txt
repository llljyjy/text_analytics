I have been using this 3-4 times a week for the past 3 weeks and I haven’t noticed much of a difference. I think it has helped with my skin seeming more moisturized but I haven’t noticed much change as far as dark spots. As with most of these types of skin products the smell is not great. I will continue to use it and see if there is more of a difference after a few months. So many people have different results from different products that it’s worth trying if you are looking for a spot/age reducer. nan
