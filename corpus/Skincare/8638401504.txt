i have struggled with bad acne for around 8 years now.. i used this product for about a year after hearing a lot of hype about it from friends.. for me, it did nothing. it felt heavy on my skin and i will not be purchasing again.. though itâ€™s cheap i suggest saving your money and putting it towards a better product! no thank you
