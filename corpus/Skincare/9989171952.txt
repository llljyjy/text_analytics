Upon first application, I was a bit taken aback, but I’ve come to really like it!This is a really lovely product to use right after you wash your face. It is very lightweight and feels just like water, but it really packs a punch! The skin-loving ingredients perfectly hydrate my face in between showering and doing my skincare routine, which has been a really great addition given how dry my skin is. Taking the time to simply dry myself off can sometimes be enough to dehydrate my skin, so this has been very helpful for me.I also love Kosas’ efforts to be eco-conscious and to be considerate of all their customer’s needs. The product is vegan and cruelty free, and the packaging is recyclable, so it automatically wins some points for that!My only negatives (which, again, actually really put me off at first):• the spray nozzle is a little too powerful. I prefer a fine mist, but this thing DUMPS. Only one or two sprays with this one or you’ll be soaked!• it has a stronger scent than I was expecting. It’s not bad, and I believe it’s not *added* (just the natural scent of the ingredients) but at first I really didn’t like it. It grew on me over time, but I find this noteworthy because I usually welcome fragrance to my skincare products, but this one was too much for me. If you’re sensitive to strong scents, this may not be the one for you.I think you’ll love this product if you want a little extra boost for your serums or if you want to add a little extra ✨ something ✨ to your routine! A nice addition to my routine!
