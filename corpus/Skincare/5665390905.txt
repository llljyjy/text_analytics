I have had amazing results with these eye masks. My picture shows how much they helped with puffy eyes just this morning. I don’t know that they help with dark circles but they definitely reduce the size of bags and puffiness for me. I especially love these at the end of a long flight. I only wish they weren’t so expensive. I have to save them for special occasions only. WANDER BEAUTY, please make an eye cream with the same benefits! I could get so much more use from that. Incredible for puffy, tired eyes.
