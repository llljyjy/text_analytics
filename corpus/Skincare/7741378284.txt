I got a deluxe sample of this and was a bit nervous to try because I have quite sensitive skin but I tried it anyway to hopefully see some results, and literally after the first use I was completely shocked at how big of a difference this product made! I have a ton of redness in my skin and a bunch of red bumpy texture on both sides of my jaw (possible rosacea) and the next morning I swear my skin was so smooth and the redness was 75% lighter than it was before and I had no irritation! Iâ€™ve never used a product with such immediate results, I used it a second time a few days later and I see the redness in my skin getting lighter and the texture on my jaw is basically completely gone. Super happy with this product and definitely buying once my sample is gone! Immediate results
