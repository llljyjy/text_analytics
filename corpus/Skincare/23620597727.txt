I really enjoyed the way confidence in a cream moisturized my skin. It was super thick and I like a lot of other moisturizers that I’ve used kept my skin from being dry all night long. It didn’t have much of a smell which I like. The only negative thing about it is the pot it was in, with nails it’s harder to get product out so I wish it was in a pump other than that I 100% recommend it Great moisturizer
