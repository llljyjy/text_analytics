I really liked this undereye gel-cream, the consistency was unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever tried for under my eyes. It has a nice blurring effect and is a great primer for under concealer which is most likely cause of the dimethicone. I did notice improved hydration and fine lines were less noticeable when it was on, but this did not help with dark circles at all. Overall, I liked it and think it would be a great addition to your skin care routine. Great for under makeup
