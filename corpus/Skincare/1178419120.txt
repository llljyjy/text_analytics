This is an excellent spot treatment. At 45 I still get breakouts and this is the only thing that calms and reduces the occasional pimple. It’s not an all over treatment - there are plenty of those on Sephora.com - but for random hormonal cysts and white heads this really helps. Yes it smells like oregano and it does tingle/“burn” while it dries but it does reduce the size and help with the redness of breakouts. And it’s a full half ounce not .2 so it lasts quite a while if used as intended. nan
