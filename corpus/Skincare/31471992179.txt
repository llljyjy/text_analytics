I really enjoyed this sunscreen. As a mother it’s a huge win not having to constantly apply sums to my child (or myself for that matter.) This sunscreen lasted around about 45 minutes or so with each application. It does come out pretty liquidy but I felt that with that instead of the water washing it away it only made it stronger and activated it even more. Also, I’d like to add that it makes an AMAZING primer for under your makeup. I love a good two for one deal. I would most definitely purchase again! 5 stars across the board!!
