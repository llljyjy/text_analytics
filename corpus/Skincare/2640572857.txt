I’ve been trying to find the right eye cream for my dark circles and didn’t see much of an improvement. I did notice that it caused my concealer to cling to patches on my inner corners but maybe I just need a better primer. I wear a pretty heavy concealer so if your wearing something light it might work for you. Not for me
