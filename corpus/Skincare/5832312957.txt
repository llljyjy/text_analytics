I really enjoyed this product! I received a sample since in an Influenster voxbox. It goes on the skin very smooth and keeps it hydrated all day. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because I broke out when I started to use it. I do have problem skin so I can’t be sure that this caused the breakout but it did happen right when I started using it. Other than that, it’s an excellent moisturizer! Influenster Review
