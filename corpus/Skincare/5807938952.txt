One of the best things about this Vit C is its texture! It’s watery, so it avoids the tacky issue I run into with Vit C’s that are serums. Appreciate that this is combined with ferulic acid. I don’t have many hyperpigmentation/discoloration spots, but I will say that this helped with overall brightness and evening-tone after two weeks. Would need to use it a longer to see if it could help lighten the stubborn sun spots I have. Good for evening skin tone
