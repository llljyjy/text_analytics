I’ve loved the Banana Bright Eye Cream since I fist tried the original formula a couple years ago. It is moisturizing without being too thick which helps it lay well under makeup which is a must for me. This new formula works just as well thankfully. I’m always worried when a brand tries to improve something that doesn’t need improvement. I like this cream and will continue to use it as my morning eye cream. nan
