*I got this as 1 of the 2 free samples from an online Sephora order.It was a tiny bit tough to spread on my face but felt nice and smooth once it was on.  It kept my oily skin matte which was nice.  My face was less oily when I woke up than with other moisturizers made for oily skin.I was excited to use this under my makeup during the day.  Unfortunately, my Nars Sheer Glow foundation COMPLETELY wiped off onto my mask with this moisturizer.  The foundation on my cheeks and chin (where my mask mostly touches) was gone.  I keep my mask on from 9am-3pm at work.  My foundation stayed on fine on my forehead.  My skin was more matte throughout the day but that may have been due to the fact that the foundation wiped off.Love this as a night cream to prevent oily skin but a definite No to use under foundation and sunscreen during the day.  Gave it 3 stars since it worked well at night. Wanted to love...
