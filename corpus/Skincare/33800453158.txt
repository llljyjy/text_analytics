This product is awesome, I was really lucky to try it #freeproduct, and gives my opinion, and here are my experiences: This Sleeping mask is light, it has a little of fragrance (this may be a small disadvantage for those who do not like the fragrance in their products) , but very very hydrating!  I’ve been using it for 2 weeks now and wooow, my skin is hydrated and luminous.  As the cream says, I use it at night and I also add an extra on the lower part of my eyes (as if it were a moisturizing patch) to give an extra to my dark circles and I cannot lie, it has helped me a lot.I have tried many sleeping masks in the past (many of those didn’t help me at all) but I really enjoy this one because I have combination skin, and in winter my skin become more dry, and this cream has helped me to keep it well and hydrated.So, If you really want to try it, go ahead!!!!#trywithtopbox My new favourite sleeping mask!
