Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is simply amazing! It smells so fresh and so clean. It is lightweight and even has that cloud-like texture (hence the name). I have been using this product on my face every single night for the past week to help with my combination type skin. I shower, cleanse my face, apply retinol, apply my Kiehl’s Cloud Cream, and then go to bed. Compared to other products, I really like that I can still incorporate the rest of my nightly routine products and get the benefit of using Kiehl’s Cloud Cream as well. In addition, this product does not leave my face greasy - I was so worried about breakouts (I have had some bad experiences in the past)! I have already started to notice a difference in my face when I wake up in the morning. My skin looks and feels softer. The texture is starting to improve. I look more awake! My skin looks healthier and radiant! I would 100 percent buy Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream from here on out and recommend it to all my family and friends. It is such a great product and I would love for them to get the same experience! Does Wonders for my Face!
