I genuinely love wearing this, it’s lightweight and color corrects redness REALLY well. However, I have sensitive skin which means for me, I notice right away when a new product makes me break out with acne spots. I have relatively “clear from active break out” skin… except for when I use this. Makes me sad!!!! Love Hate Relationship
