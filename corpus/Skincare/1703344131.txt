I love this because it’s a 2 in 1 for me. I usually use Chanel or Tom Ford luminesce over sunscreen but with this is one and done. I have dry skin and exfoliate regularly. This is perfect. It gives me a glow with spf but I don’t look like I’m going to a rave, I just look healthy. I’ve had ZERO problems with it splitting or pilling. My new favorite. Love
