Okay so I definitely have mixed feelings about this razor. I’ve used it 3 times overall and I have to say I’m not sure if it’s my absolute favorite. Out of the 3 times I’ve used it, I cut myself A LOT 2 times. The razor feels very luxurious, however, I’m not sure if it’s worth getting. I personally feel my legs so feel smoother with this razor.. I feel it gives a close shave and takes off the dead skin because my skin feels very very smooth however, if you do not use it correctly you can definitely end up with many cuts like me. I read people saying not to put too much pressure on the razor so I didn’t, but then I found it wasn’t cutting my hair all the way so I put the tiniest bit of pressure and found myself with lots of cuts at the end of my shower. It’s hard to cut the bottom of your leg, above your ankle, because the blade is so sharp. If you even glide the razor from side to side by mistake you cut yourself. The razor is definitely sharp but it’s also kinda out and visible. It’s really easy to get cut with this razor. It’s actual blades that come with the razor too.. you have to put them in yourself. The last time I kinda got the hang of it but I still ended up with cuts, just not as bad as the other 2 times. This time I went with the hair growth, then against. It was much better but nonetheless I still had cuts. I feel it takes too long to get the hang of this razor and I’m not sure if it’s my favorite. I love the way it takes off my dead skin but I don’t know if it’s worth it to be honest. This product was gifted to me by Hanni in exchange for my honest review. nan
