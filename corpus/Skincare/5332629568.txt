I buy tons of skin products and serums...but let me just say that I love this serum. So many serums on the market leave my skin way too tacky/ sticky and others are way too oily/ shiny. When using this serum, I don’t have to layer as many serums during my routine as it has so many beneficial ingredients. It makes layering serums almost a thing of the past. I am in love with the scent as well! It feels amazing on my skin and immediately helps my skin tone to appear more lively and even. Lastly, the packaging is SO elegant. It’s hard to not feel fancy when you pick it up to use it! Feels and Looks like New Skin!
