This is a great light to medium moisturizer that is a great add-on in winter. There’s a gentle fruity scent, but it’s not overpowering. I like this better for evening as the last step in my routine, as it seals in the moisture for my face without feeling greasy. I live in a dry state, so this is great for some extra moisture. nan
