I used this cream for 60 days and saw zero difference in my undereye skin. The cream feels and smells really nice, but it did nothing for my skin. I would not buy or recommend it to anyone. It is not worth the money. You are better off spending money on a cheaper, more effective eye cream from CeraVe or Cetaphil. Used for 60 days. It did nothing for my skin.
