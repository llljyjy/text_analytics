I was skeptical at first about this makeup remover that I rub on my eyelids ‘em remove makeup. I was sure it would be irritating to my eyes & cause issues. It did none of the sort though. My makeup came off easily & cleanly. My face felt refreshed & smooth! I love how easily it worked. My eyes weren’t irritated & I used this over & over. While a little on the costly side, it was awesome & I will purchase again! Gentle & Awesome!
