This product did not live up to the hype. I don’t like the shimmer or the tint it has, just seems unnecessary. Also, pilling is an issue. I feel like it highlights my fine lines and makes me look greasy. I’m so tempted to just throw it out but I don’t want to be wasteful. Definitely will not be purchasing again. nan
