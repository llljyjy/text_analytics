I really liked having this product in my house, I tested it for a month and it really meets the hydration proposal for 12 hours it doesnâ€™t leave the skin extremely oily but I would recommend it more for people with dry to normal and non-oily skin!!  as my skin is normal, I really liked the moisturizing effect that the product gave me! nan
