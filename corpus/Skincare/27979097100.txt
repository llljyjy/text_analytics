I was hoping for something lightweight and moisturizing enough as the drier seasons come around and I wasn’t disappointedI started using the Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream a few weeks ago and I’m in love with the consistency. It’s hydrating, soothing, and fast becoming holy grail status.Experience: Its texture reminds me of a slightly thicker than an emulsion so if you don’t find that moisturizing enough, you should give this a shot. It didn’t irritate my acne or trigger any new breakouts. Instead, I noticed it made my skin calmer and my complexion more even-toned.Pros:* Lightweight gel cream* Ph Balanced* Tub packaging with a spatula * Generous amount Most luxurious moisturizer
