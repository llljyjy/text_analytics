Iâ€™m a huge fan of First Aid Beauty, so was ecstatic to hear they were coming out with a sunscreen. I was sent a sample to try, and honestly was blown away by how universal the formula is. The formula of this sunscreen is not greasy at all, and melts easily into the skin. I found myself applying it all over my body, since it was one of the few sunscreens I packed on a beach vacation. My only hiccup was the first use took quite a few pumps before the sunscreen started coming out, but after that it was easy to use and quick to apply! Perfect for vacation!
