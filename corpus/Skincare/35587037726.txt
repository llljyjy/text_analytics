I used the glow recipe vitamin C treatment, but there was no change after my second bottle. So, I switched to topicals faded serum. I have seen a difference after using it for three weeks. The first time I used it, the fragrance was pungent and stinky. The smell was hard for me to bear it. Other than this product is perfect. nan
