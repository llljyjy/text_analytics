First impression on packaging simple but elegant. The texture was light but thick a little went a long way. The smell is very clean and fresh. My skin can be pretty oily sometimes so i was a little worried it would make my skin even more oily and it didnt! My skin also usually breaks out when i use new products but this didnt! My skin felt smooth and refreshed i loved it! The only downfall to this prosuct is the price having kids this is something that i wouldnt normally buy if i hadnt tried it first.  I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review so this is 100% review! Works greeeaatt!
