I’ve been using this product for about a month and I really enjoy it. I found it to be gentle and hydrating and it absorbs really well. I normally experience irritation with glycolic acid but not with this product which makes me think glycolic acid is formulated here to be more of a hydrating ingredient than a strong chemical exfoliant. It’s fragrance free which I really appreciate. Combining glycolic acid and retinol can be very irritating and we don’t need any other sensitizing ingredients such as fragrance. I recommend! I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. great product
