I love hydrating primers/setting sprays so I was excited to try this. The bottle is beautiful and I love how lightly the sprayer mists the product on your skin. It’s really unlike any other sprayer I’ve used. It has a very faint smell of rose and I only smell it right when I spray it on. I make sure to shake the bottle before using as you can see the oils settling at the top of the bottle. Using this as a primer with my regular foundation didn’t work well for me. My foundation is dewy and already has hyaluronic acid in it and this spray caused it to separate on my nose and forehead. It may work better with an oil free foundation. I did notice it worked better as a primer with powder foundation. My skin never looked dry or cakey. I enjoyed this to set my makeup with both my liquid and powder foundation and definitely prefer it as a glowy setting spray. It also feels great on bare skin for a little extra moisture and glow. Overall I liked this spray a lot and will continue to use. Great product
