I’ve had this product in my cart but never purchased it so I was sooo happy when I received it complimentary! First off the smell is AMAZING! It was just like I pictured soo fresh. Also it was the perfect amount of thickness. It wasn’t too thick where it felt caked but it also wasn’t too thin where it felt like your skin was still dry. I would definitely recommend. Finally found the perfect moisturizer!
