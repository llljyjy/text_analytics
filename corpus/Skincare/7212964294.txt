I have sleep troubles and I often have allergic reactions. This eye cream has helped with my puffiness so much. It’s undeniable. The price is amazing, and the results are there. I started off my addiction buying this at shoppers and now I’ve moved on to Sephora. I have bought countless tubes of this stuff and I’ll never stop. My routine wouldn’t feel complete without it. I don’t even mind that it doesn’t help with darkness, I’d rather my eyes be de-puffed. Thank you Inkey List! Keep taking my money! Holy Grail
