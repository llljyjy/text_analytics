Effective. Moisturizes skin with a noticeable effect. The consistency borders between a toner and a serum which was a big plus, as you can apply directly from bottle to face without wasting cotton, etc. A little too strongly scented (rose) for my taste- smell is pleasant, just not my preference. Effective!
