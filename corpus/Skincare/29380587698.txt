i have oily acne prone sensitive skin (the trifecta) and this never broke me out. I have been using it for about a year now with no issues. It can be greasy but if you rub it in well that goes away. I highly recommend this to anyone struggling to find a cheap sunscreen that doesnâ€™t break you out. best bang for ur buck or whatever
