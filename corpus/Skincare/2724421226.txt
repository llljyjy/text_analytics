I was hesitant about this product because I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin. I am super sensitive to new products but because I use the Dr. Jart sunscreen, I figured let me try this out. I have some redness & mild acne scars that are almost faded but still there. I apply my toner, sunscreen, and then this and I have the most beautiful glow & my redness is covered! This isn’t high coverage though, keep in mind it’s a light coverage. It’s just enough for a day when you don’t want to wear any makeup but don’t want to look crazy either. It says 2 drops but I feel like you need a bit more than that. I am fair skinned and it seems to blend quite nicely. I love that it has added sunscreen & did not break me out! 4 stars cause it’s pretty amazing!! Amazing for no makeup days!!!
