I love this a lot! It’s really large and it works too! I usually only use it for the night time and three times a week. When my skin is really in a bad condition it does sting little bit but it would be so smooth and soft next day. I also tried the hair hack with glycolic acid but I dont really recommend it for the regular use because the hair will get so messed up.. the result wasn’t bad though. nan
