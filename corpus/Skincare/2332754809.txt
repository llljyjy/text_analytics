I really wanted this to be my go to. First the pilling was like no other face product Iâ€™ve used. I tried using less, took that off, maybe I needed to reapply with primer? Nothing helped, it was all bad! Then the breakout, it was embarrassing!!  ALL over my face, took days to clear up. I use other Supergoop products but this NOT something I will use again or recommend to anyone. Never again
