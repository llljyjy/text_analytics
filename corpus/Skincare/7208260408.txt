I revived a trial size product so it’s almost hard to tell how well it worked. But product wise, this one was very thin. At first it was hard to get used to applying because of that, but after time I started to like it. It felt like it seeped into my pores well and has a pleasant scent. Ingredients-wise, it doesn’t seem like there is a lot of vitamin C in it. I’m pretty neutral on this product Neutral
