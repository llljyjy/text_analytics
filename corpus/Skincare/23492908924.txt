I have acne-prone skin and this product did not break me out at all! My first purchase I was a complete fan and I loved how smooth it went on to my skin and it lasted me a good while! My second purchase didn’t go as well, I felt like it was harder to apply evenly (even when I shook the tube before applying) and it also got this really weird smell that wasn’t there the first time. I also went through the tube a lot faster as getting a good amount of product was difficult. Not sure if it was the batch or there was a slight formula change. But I ended up not enjoying it enough for the price, so I am no longer purchasing. I do recommend though, good for acne-prone/sensitive skin and a great starter for those getting into sunscreen. Could be better on redness coverage but the tint is still there. nan
