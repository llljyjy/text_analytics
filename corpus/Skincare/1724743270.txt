I don’t think I’ve ever reviewed a product. (I just read a lot of them before I buy). This stuff is nuts! It’s crazy how inexpensive it is for how well it works. I hope they don’t raise the prices. I suffer from hyperpigmentation BAD. I picked a zit near my nose and eye area and boom, a mark. Like, you couldn’t even try to hide it. Every night I put a little on that spot (and others) and I’d say in 2 weeks you’d never guess I ever had a mark there. To help y’all understand…I have had marks last almost a year untreated. I say untreated because everything I tried didn’t work so I gave up. And I only got this because I was looking to minimize pores. I don’t know what magic this is…but take a chance on it! nan
