I was gifted this in exchange for my honest review. I was pleasantly surprised & SO blown away by this product. I’ve used lip oils before as well as leave on lip masks such as the Laneige Lip Sleeping mask, & I would have to say this surpasses them all. The Lip Sleeping Mask was an essential part of my nightly routine but it has been replaced by the Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil. Since first use, I have not even touched my lip glosses or any other lip product for that matter. I was even embarrassed to take a photo of it for this review because I had already used the majority of the product because I fell in love with it lol. It’s the perfect lip product. It’s moisturizing even when it’s faded & leaves my lips moisturized & soft all day long. The packaging is sleek, cute & simple. The product is cute & small & able to fit in your pocket. The doe tip applicator is probably one of the biggest I’ve ever seen but I love it so much & I’m convinced it should be on every lip product. The finish of the oil is clear & is perfect for everyday/nightly wear alone or over your favorite stain. The texture feels wonderful on the lips, not sticky whatsoever. The only thing that doesn’t thrill me is the scent, it’s reminiscent of Cherry Chapstick but if that’s your thing, by all means. It isn’t at all an overpowering smell & does fade so it doesn’t bother me much & I can overlook it. I would recommend to anyone looking for a moisturizing lip product to nourish, condition, heal & moisturize while still looking for a little extra shine  This was the first Fenty Skin product I’ve tried & I’m now curious to try the whole line. It has honestly become my favorite lip product & I will repurchase to make sure I’m always stocked! Such a Treat!
