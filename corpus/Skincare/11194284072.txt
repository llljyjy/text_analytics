This stuff is pretty great. I really liked that it wasn’t tacky feeling like alot of other serums tend to be. After using my skin looked brighter and healthier. It leaves such a nice glow without being overly oily and is very hydrating. I have combo skin and it gets really dry on my t zones and this was very moisturizing. I didn’t exactly experience plumping but the lines on my forehead did get a lot better. Healthier skin
