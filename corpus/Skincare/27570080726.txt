Do your research and ask questions before purchasing this product.  If you have the Trinity w/ELE attachment then this is completely unnecessary to purchase. If anything is smoothing the lines it’s that tiny expensive serum which beware can cause breakouts. The lip plump claim is mediocre at best & lasts less then an hour and I am being generous with that estimation. The claims this device targets the skin differently are untrue.  If the Nuface Fix, Trinity, & Mini all have 8.3Hz, how is the FIX even capable of targeting the skin differently?? Nuface refuses to answer this question. Don’t waste your money. NOT a Must Have
