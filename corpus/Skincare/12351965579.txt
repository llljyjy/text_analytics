I recieved this cleanser in my voxbox from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I will say this wasn’t something I thought I needed until I used it. I will be using this from now on. It leaves my skin so silly soft and hydrated. With other cleansers you can get that stripped feeling after cleaning your face and with this you just feel great, clean and plump. I have noticed my skin seeming to be more smooth and pores smaller. I honestly could go on forever. My only dislike is the glass bottle. I know to some it’s luxury feeling but for me having just a sink no counter space I worry it’s gonna fall and shatter. Though that dislike wouldn’t keep me from buying it may for others so I feel like I need to state that. Works amazing
