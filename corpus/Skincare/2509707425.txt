I have redness because Im using tretinoin every other day, it bothers me and sometimes it hard to cover it up because I dont really wear makeup on daily basis. It doesnt really help with my redness but it absorbs well and moisturize my skin. Despite of all great ingredients inside, this day cream doesnt have any spf in it, which is honestly pretty disappointing. Though I dont really buy the idea of “clean“ skincare but I love that the packaging are recyclable. Overall its an okay cream. Just okay
