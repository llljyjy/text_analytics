I don’t mean to be dramatic, but… after using this cream once? Maybe twice? I looked at my skin again in the mirror a week or so later and I’m shocked. Years of cystic acne scares have faded… significantly. I also have a skin picking disorder, those scars have shown significant improvement… I am so hopeful that I will be able to wear V-necks and open-back clothes again without people staring at all my scars and marks. I am not sure what else to say. This tube may be a bit pricey, but I think it will last me several months- reading the directions it says once a week to start or something. The only true con is that one of the ingredients smells funny to me- kind of like a weird popcorn smell. However, if this cream frees me from my scars I’ll smell like “weird popcorn” 24/7. Also take this with a grain of salt because after I had COVID a year ago my sniffer is janky. I hope this product works as well for you as it did for me. 💚 Stolen from God’s skincare routine?
