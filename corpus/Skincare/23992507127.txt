I have a combination of normal and dry skin, and this is one of the only moisturizers that I have found that keep my skin non-dry the whole day. It has a small bit of a funky scent, but the product is so good that it wonâ€™t matter. It also cleared up the bumps on may face. Plus it makes you look extremly glows and flawless. Good for dry skin
