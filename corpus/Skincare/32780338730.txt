I am 60 yrs old so my skin is obviously aging and becoming drier with age. I needed something like this to hydrate my skin. I absolutely love this product. It is light and not sticky. It leaves my skin looking fresh and due to moisture, helps soften my lines. If I was stranded on an island and I could only have one beauty product, this would be my choice. I especially take it with my on my vacations to help recuperate the skin I abuse in the elements. Iâ€™m old school when we use to fry our skin. This product seems to help some of the damage. Love this product. It's my absolute favorite.
