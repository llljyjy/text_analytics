I have pretty dark under eye circles. Always have. No matter how much sleep I get, no matter how much water I drink, they never go away. So the first time I used this, woke up and most DEFINITELY saw a difference. My under eye area just felt so good, hydrated AND brighter and it just felt plain good. I still had my circles but they were certainly not as dark as before. Second time, I woke up with one or two little white bumps under one of my eyes.. It ended up going away and It didn’t happen again but this still didn’t end up being anything special. Used it for quite a few weeks-to at least a month and a half. Only helped the darkness the tiniest tiniest amount. And this is kind of thick too, I got a sample size and had to warm it up with my finger before applying. No strong smell or anything. I mean it’s alright, it might work great for someone else, a sample size is worth the try but I wouldn’t buy the full size without trying a small amount first. First use: “WOW!” , All other uses: “meh..”
