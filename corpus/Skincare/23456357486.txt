Started using this nightly first trimester during pregnancy as a retinoid alternative and I feel like it’s helped achieve similar results paired with glycolic acid exfoliation some nights and keep my acne at bay. I researched other bakuchiol products but so many of them don’t say the percentage which is frustrating. This serum is simple and with the recommended strength of bakuchiol to be effective. I’ve gotten some pregnancy “glowing“ comments so I’ll keep it in my nightly routine. Ordering 2nd bottle. Great alternative during pregnancy
