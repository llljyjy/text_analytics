This serum is awesome. Comparing to other circle reducing creams I have, this serum works so well. Do not expect an overnight magic serum, be consistent and a little goes a long way. It’s thick and very moisturizing. It’s glides right on and I like to tap it on after I’ve spread the product around. I highly recommend it. It really does work. nan
