It definitely works in just one use! I did end up with the marks around my fingers but that is probably just from me not using self tanners often. It takes a long time to run in. The worst thing for me would be the smell after it dries, it’s like after you tan in a bed ans you smell burnt after. I’ll keep trying it but not sure. Not what I was expecting
