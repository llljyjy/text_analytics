This is a good self tanning product but I prefer the Isle of Paradise Self Tanning Mousse. This product is easy to apply but I have to do it in my bathtub/shower because the oil mist will get all over the ground. I also do not love the packaging because after each spray, I have to set it down on its side or put the cap back on for it to stand on its own while I’m rubbing in the oil. it’s mediocre for me
