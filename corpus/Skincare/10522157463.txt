I received this products as a complimentary for free from Influenster. I have a sensitive skin. You can see the differences after a week of using. The Niacinamide ingredient helps me to reduce my redness in my face. A little bit thick texture for me but smoothly finished. This product has a scent which I don’t mind. I will recommend this product for those who have a redness like me. I don’t mind using it over and over again. nan
