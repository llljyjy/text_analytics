The glass bottle is GORGEOUS! It helps sell it as a luxury item. The smell is not over powering, a very subtle rose scent. The product itself is lightweight and super versatile. I use it as a setting spray before and after makeup application, or as a hydrating mist. Itâ€™s formulated with Black Rose Oil which has soothing and hydrating properties. It also has hyaluronic acid which is my favorite hydrating ingredient. It worked wonderfully for keeping my foundation looking glowy all day. I loved it most as a mid day refresher for my skin though, it adds just the nicest subtle glow to my skin and makes my skin feel refreshed. I love it!
