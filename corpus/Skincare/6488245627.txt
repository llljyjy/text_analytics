**The “pool/chlorine“ scent some are concerned about is the normal smell of hypochlorous acid; it’s not a sign of an expired or turned product. Also, this doesn’t have an aggressive or defective sprayer as it’s not a spray at all, it’s supposed to be dispensed into the hands or onto a cotton square, not sprayed directly onto the face.I was hoping this would help to reduce redness or calm breakouts but, just like the SOS spray, this didn’t work for me.  I bought it thinking that an “intensive“ serum would have a higher amount of hypochlorous acid (HOCL), which is antimicrobial and can fight acne causing bacteria, but it didn’t prevent new or heal existing breakouts and it didn’t reduce redness.  I only had a few breakouts and I don’t have rosacea, just mild redness as I’m very fair and while it didn’t cause any irritation, I didn’t see results of any kind after 3 weeks of use. Didn't work for me
