I am obsessedddd with all lippy balms and products. This one is light yet so moisterizing and looks great as a gloss!! I got poppy although I do wish that I got one of the vanillas instead. The poppy smell just cant top vanilla and I dont think the color is very flattering on me. I also thing that the aplicator may be a little too big but the actual product is nice! review from a very judgey lippy gal
