This lip oil smells nice, but not too sweet. I find the product to be on par with high end makeup (such as lancome or mac). The oil goes on super smooth like a gloss, and I was happy to find the overly glossy look didn’t last more than a 1/2 hour. After that, it feels like it melts into your lips and continues to condition them for a couple of hours. So that makes this way more effective than your average lip balm to me. It also is more nourishing than a gloss. I have SUPER chapped lips all year round, and my lips have felt legitmately smoother since use. Only thing is it doesn’t seem like that much product for the price, but I don’t know how long the bottle will last me. pic 1 is of my lips no product. pic 2 is with fenty cherry treat lip oil. luxury for your lips ♥︎
