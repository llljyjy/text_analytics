This was complimentary from Laneige. I loved the old casing (glass) vs the new one (plastic) - both a soft blue in color and very modern look still. The texture easily absorbs into my skin and I use it as my overnight moisturizer as itâ€™s very gentle. I hope they work on the casing again as I did prefer the old one but product still works great. Great product - miss old packaging
