Though this was hydrating, I think it would be more effective for someone with visible lines around their mouth. It was hydrating for me, but I didn’t see any results. I prefer the Revision Skincare YouthFull overnight balm to any other lip mask/product, which visibly plumps your lips without tingling. Maybe if I have visible aging-skin issues around my mouth in the future I’d give this another try. Would work better for mature skin with fine lines
