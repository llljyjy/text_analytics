I thought this would be too heavy for my oily/combo skin, but this is a LIFESAVER! I’ve always shied away from things that look like they’d make me a grease ball, but my skin has never looked better... Ever. A thin layer of this lasts all night, it’s not sticky, leaves your skin soft and plump, and smells like honey. I don’t think i can live without it! A gamechanger for dehydrated skin!
