To all the people who have said, “If you can’t get over the smell, you don’t really care about your skin”, AMEN! I bought the full size after reading such great reviews. I have been using it in the past m a something after the recommended peel and something just after exfoliating. It goes on smooth and the glow it gives is amazing! I am starting today to add to am routine. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
