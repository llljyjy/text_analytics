I have a lot hate relationship with this. First off the white cast is evident even on me and I’m quite pale. Secondly, it’s so oily. I like how it’s hydrating and leaves me not feeling dry when I remove it but it’s kind of embarrassing to walk around wearing because of how shiny you look. I would still give it 3 stars because it doesn’t really affect my skin by causing any breakouts which is really important to me but I’m not sure if this would work for everyone. nan
