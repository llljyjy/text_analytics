I received this product as a free sample box in exchange for my honest review. I was sent the Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil in shade Warm.I love that this is an all-in-one primer, tinted moisturizer, and SPF. I love how the product is scent-free, lightweight, does not pill and looks great underneath makeup. It’s very sheer and easy to use under products. As this is a tinted moisturizer, a little goes a long way. I personally like to mix this with my everyday moisturizer so the shade blends better with my skin colour. The packaging colour is very deceiving as the colour does not match the shade you are getting. I really hope that there were more shade ranges other than the current 3 - cool, warm, and hot - as warm and hot are much darker and do not really fit everyone’s skin tone especially if they plan to use this as their all-in-one (primer, tinted moisturizer, SPF). Great SPF with Tint
