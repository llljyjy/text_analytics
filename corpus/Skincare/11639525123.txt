I know so many of the reviews are by people who got it for free and that might make you feel uncertain. DONT BE! I bought it because of an influencer (Rudi Berry) and it’s simply amazing, gentle but soooo efficient! I’ve worked my way up to using 2 days in a row with a rest day in between and I haven’t had any irritation. It looks expensive but it’s worth it. simply amazing and not that much more expensive
