I was really impressed with this for irritated skin after trying a mini and bought a full size. I’ve used it on smaller irritations and found it worked well. I got scratched in the face by a dog on Saturday (mine, I love her, but she is a young rescue, in training and a jumper terrified of nail clippers). That happened Saturday around 2PM. I have been slathering it with Indigo overnight repair multiple times daily and using Dr. Jart cica mist once the cream absorbs. And repeat. It’s 8PM on Monday. Huge difference in my face. I took a photo right after it happened and one today. So in 2 days it has gotten so much better. I was afraid it would scar but think will be okay. Incredible difference. This isn’t an every day product but it’s one you want to have on hand all the time. Can’t speak highly enough of it. Worth every penny
