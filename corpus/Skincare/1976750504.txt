I’ve been using this for the last week and so far I am pleased with it. The formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly. It’s good to use both morning and night and I’ve noticed my skin feels hydrated, which for me is key. I can’t say yet if this is going to be a holy grail but so far I am pleased with it. It is also decently priced for a 1 oz bottle of serum.  Gifted by The Outset. A good serum option
