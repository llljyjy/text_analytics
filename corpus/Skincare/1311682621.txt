I got samples of this with recent purchases and am so pleasantly surprised. I have combination/oily skin that’s been feeling dryer just on my cheeks recentlyand it showed when I used foundation. This helped a lot - it’s not greasy and doesn’t make me really oily. I only use it at night and maybe a tiny bit on dry patches during the day and I use a mattifying spf moisturizer during the day. But I feel like my search for a night moisturizer is over! a pleasant surprise!
