Horrible! Please avoid this! Wish I would have listened to the bad reviews on here but I was so desperate to get a glow before summer. Patchy, streaky, blotchy and looks like I have dirt all over my arms. Embarrassing and I have a big dinner to go to tomorrow, how am I going to get this off? Been scrubbing and it’s not budging. St Tropez should be ashamed of itself for the misleading product. The mousse applies clear and you can’t tell where you covered or not. Wish I would have tried in winter when I could still cover up with clothes to hide this hideous mess. I paid full price or this and I’d like to return it as it’s unusable, total waste of money. Worst Sephora purchase ever
