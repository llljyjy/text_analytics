I have combination skin which is oily at the T line but super dry at the rest, used this Water-Lock Moisturizer that I got as complimentary from Tata Harper for my honest review, for more than a week and I definitely love it, the cream is fast absorbed and hydrated all day, I applied in the morning before work and always use sunscreen after that, and at night before sleep. I feel my skin more refreshed and soft. Also I like the packaging. Great moisturizer
