Holy Moly, was this a surprise. I received this product as gratis as you would never catch me spending this much on a cream but once I am finished with it (although I don’t think I ever will be since a little goes a long way), I will most definitely be repurchasing. I’m not a huge fan of moisturizers with actives as I believe your last step should be a pure humectant especially since I have damaged my moisture barrier and stick to moisturizers with basic hydrating ingredients. On a whim, I used this on a little inflamed spot I had with a dark spot since the formula contained lactic acid (lactic acid is great as a spot treatment) and when I tell you the spot was completely gone the next morning. Out of curiosity, I began using it on my entire face and in a matter of a couple of days, my overall skin health drastically improved- particularly uneven skin tone and texture. When looking at the ingredients, I was pleased to know the kind of Vitamin C used is Ethyl-Ascorbic acid so I do not need to worry about having to use it up before the 3-month mark and how it was very high up in the ingredient list without many unnecessary additives. The only “critique“ which really isn’t even one is how rich the cream is. Amazing as a night cream but since vitamin C strives with SPF, when applied in the morning- make sure to use a dime size amount. A shocker.
