I was so excited to try this new sunscreen by Supergoop. I chose it specifically for exercising outside as it’s water & sweat resistant. However this sunscreen burned my eyes before even starting to sweat. And also it feels very greasy. It does leave a glow though? Although in my opinion I think it’s more glowy than I’d prefer. It also has a very heavy scent! Not a sunscreen/baby powder type smell either. But a perfume smell. And it’s been hours since I put this on and I can still smell it just as strongly. Some good things about it though are it spreads easily and no white cast. There’s better options out there. nan
