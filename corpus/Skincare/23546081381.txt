I’ve been using this serum over a period of 3-4 months mainly for my hyperpigmentation and I unfortunately haven’t seen much results. I will say it’s helped get rid of sebum build up on my nose and chin and my skin generally feels a lot smoother.  I have acne prone skin and though this product didn’t help my dark spots I plan on continuing to use it. Alright product
