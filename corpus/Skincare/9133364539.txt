Although this feels like more of a gloss than an oil, I love the fact that it slightly dries down because I feel like my lips are absorbing the key ingredients in this product. I’m a long time victim of dry lips and I absolutely love this product, I really felt as though it moisturized my lips because I wasn’t feeling the need to ever lick my lips or reapply throughout the day! The applicator is super cute and the cherry scent is also super nice! 10/10 would recommend Love it!!
