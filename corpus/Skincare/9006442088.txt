Give it a chance! A lot of people are saying it’s sticky but the key is to use small amounts, pat it on until it absorbs into the skin. This stuff cut out all the oil on my forehead and nose. And I’m serious about this stuff. I usually have such oily skin that I could smack my face into a window and my whole face of oil would be left over on the glass. When I say this works it really does! I haven’t had to wipe or blot my face for the whole day. It hydrates just enough and hasn’t caused a single break out! I’m so happy I tried this! No more oil and shine!
