I received this from influenster as a trial size. I’d say the only only thing I like about this product is the texture, it’s very smooth and goes on with very little tugging. However, that’s likely due to the petrolatum and I don’t like that ingredient, it’s always made my millia under my eyes worse. I also havent notice any of the improvement that they claim in it’s description. I do know that real results really cannot be obtained before the skin has proper turnover which takes around 90 days. It’s a good rule of thumb to use a skincare product for at least 90 days before you decide it’s worth. So unfortunately I won’t be able to continue due to the petrolatum. I wouldn’t purchase this myself because I’ve used some really nice creams that give me good ingredients, good value, and good results. Not great
