Was so excited to receive and test this out. I love everything about it! The little black balls in it break as your rubbing it in and it turns the mask from white to grey. It made my skin feel so smooth and fresh after washing it off! My skin can be sensitive to clay masks but this wasn’t harsh at all! It’s perfect even if you have sensitive skin. Love it
