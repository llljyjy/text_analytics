im quite picky about my face creams but this one checks a lot of boxes for me. It’s light weight, seems to absorb quickly to my face and doesn’t leave tacky feeling. The packaging is nice, you dont have to stick you fingers in the pot which is nice. The scent is nice I enjoy it, but some may find it too citrusy for them. nan
