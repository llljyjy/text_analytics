Love this.  You mix it up, so it’s fresh. The applicator is unique, so you get just enough product to cover your face.  It smooths in easily and is non irritating. My skin feels smoother after a month of continuous use. I use it at night before my regular moisturizer. I’m 54 years old and I like it better than any other retinol I have used in the past.  I did receive it free to try it out from BzzAgent. nan
