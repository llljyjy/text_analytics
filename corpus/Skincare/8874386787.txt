I didnt realize there is vitamin c in the product. I often breakout to products with vitamin c. I personally will continue using The Ordinary niacinamide instead of this product. It is much cheaper and doesnâ€™t cause my skin to redden. I would definitely want to use this product to lighten my dark spots. I would not recommend nor buy this product. Its good just not for me
