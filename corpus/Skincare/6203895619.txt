I have hyperpigmentation on the cheekbone area under my eye and this serum I received complimentary from Peace Out Skincare has really brightened my complexion overall making those spots appear less visible. It’s such a nice serum specially because it doesn’t itritate my skin and doesn’t sting when I apply it. As suggested I do re-apply after my moisturizer on areas of concern by tapping the product gently and letting it absorb before I apply sunscreen as my last step. I really like the overall glow it has given my skin. It looks healthy and more even. I even feel more confident to show my natural freckles because I look radiant. I think for the price it is definitely worth it. I saw mentions of its scent but to me it doesn’t smell strong at all and no fragrance either. My skin looks radiant and more even
