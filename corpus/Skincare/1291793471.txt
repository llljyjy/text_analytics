I received a sample of this and love it. I will purchase this when I finish the sample. I have sensitive skin, prone to hormonal breakouts. This feels amazing on my skin and has not caused any breakouts. I use this in the evening and love how my skin feels immediately and also in the morning. It feels hydrated and soft but not greasy. This absorbs very nicely. Incredibly night moisturizer
