I very excited to try this serum. My first impression was it has a very runny texture and the bottle needs to be shaken vigorously to thicken it up a bit. I love the idea of a serum with SPF in it for no makeup days and pool days. I found that if I tried rubbing it into my skin, it would pill up. So, I tried applying it with a beauty blender and patting it in. That seemed to work great for me. I have combination skin, mostly dry with an oily t zone. This serum gave my face a nice dewy glow without drying me out or making me look greasy. After a couple hours at the pool, it held up nicely and did it job. Nice Serum with SPF
