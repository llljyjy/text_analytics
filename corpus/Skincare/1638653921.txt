I love this cleanser. I use it with the Biossance cleansing oil to double cleanse. It is super gentle and my face doesn’t feel stripped of its oils and moisture when I use it (even if I’m lazy and don’t use the oil first). I have dry/combination skin and it is exactly what I was looking for to use in my double cleanse. Great in My Double Cleanse Routine
