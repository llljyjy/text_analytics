I finally found an affordable anti-aging serum! I just turned 30 and I was looking to add an anti aging serum into my existing skincare routine, but I wasn’t ready to commit to a pricey brand just yet. I’m so glad I found this generous size bottle for such an affordable price! The soft, milky texture sits well mixed with my everyday moisturizer. It’s light and not at all sticky. I love that it’s fragrance free and the clean, vegan formula is a great bonus! I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. nan
