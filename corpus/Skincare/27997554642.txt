Iâ€™m probably not the best person to test and review this product. I like instant results when it comes to tanning, which is why I have a sunless airbrush system in my basement ðŸ˜‚I am also super lazy when it comes to regularly applying lotion.That all being said the first use I saw hardly any color change it took a second day/layer to be noticable. I also had a patch of darker on my knee. If you used regularly you would have a good glow. Slow to Grow Glow
