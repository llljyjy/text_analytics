This lip balm smells great but is not overwhelming. It’s a herby, citrus smell that fades quickly after application. It’s very moisturizing but lightweight and not sticky. My only complaint is the cost. $10 for a tiny lip balm is ridiculous. If cost is not a concern, this stuff is for you. Amazing but overpriced
