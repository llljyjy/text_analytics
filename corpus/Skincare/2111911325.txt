I’m all about Glow Recipe products so I was super excited to see that there was going to be a sunscreen. I immediately ordered it once it became available. It has the fresh light watermelon scent that I love but unfortunately it pilled terribly on me. The only products I had used prior to the application was the Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C serum and the Glow Recipe moisturizer. I waited approximately 5 minutes between each product before applying as well and used the proper amount of each being careful not to create too much product as I know sunscreen can pill. It’s a no from me for this reason. nan
