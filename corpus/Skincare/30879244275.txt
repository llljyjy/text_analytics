my absolute holy grail moisturizer. my mom gave this to me a year ago as she was no longer using it and i decided to try it on a whim. it wasnâ€™t breaking my skin out so i just continued to use it. after running out, i tried using another moisturizer but it completely wrecked my skin. as soon as i switched back to the aqua bomb, my skin went back to its normal condition. literally cannot live without it nan
