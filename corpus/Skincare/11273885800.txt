I really like this mask. I wish it came in a scrub! But I would def recommend, it doesn’t bother me and I have sensitive skin. It goes on kind of thick at first but thins out and firms. It is orangey in color though which I wasn’t expecting. I see a noticeable difference in my skin after using a few times a week. Washes off easily. No harsh smell! really like this mask!
