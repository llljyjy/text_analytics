I received this #freeproduct from#trywithtopbox. I have never tried any  Caudalie products before.But I have heard of them. I have for the most part  a beauty regimen loyal to a few certain beauty products. I have replaced my regular eye cream for about 4 weeks now with Caudalie Eye Cream. I am replacing my previous eye cream for sure. I have always had to deal with dark circles under my eyes. After using Caudalie for just a few days I noticed how much brighter under my eyes looked. My husband even said , let me try it! Lol The cream went on smoothly and very easily absorbed into my skin. You only need a little but so what I received to try will still last me a while longer before I have to buy more. ( For my husband too ) The only thing I didn’t like at first was the way the product is designed. The product comes out on one side and you use the other side to apply. After using the product a few times I’ve now adapted to the way its designed so that’s no longer an issue. I am very happy with Caudalie Eye Cream. I will be adding this to my beauty regimen once in the morning and then again in the evening. Thank you so much Caudalie and #TopBox Circle for the opportunity to try this amazing product. Also for opening my mind to other products out there. I am very impressed with Caudalie. I will definitely being trying the other skin products they have. Thank you again! My New Eye Cream
