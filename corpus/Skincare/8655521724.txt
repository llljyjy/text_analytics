This is definitely one of the most luxurious eye creams Iâ€™ve ever used. The packaging itself is beautiful. The eye cream goes on like butter its silky not to heavy not greasy. My under eyes are dry I have dry skin in general and this is hydrating and I will say after using it for just 2 week I do feel like I notice a difference in my dark eye circles. I do love it. If you can get over the huge price tag I would definitely recommend you give it a try. Luxurious.
