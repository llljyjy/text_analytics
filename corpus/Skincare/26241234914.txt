I absolutely love this oil! It works in the hydration of the skin, calming it and whenever I need a product to heal and soften my skin I use this oil and it has never failed.Iâ€™ve used Rose Hip oil from other brands, but this is my favorite. The packaging is good, it comes in a dropper and the smell is not as strong and bad as rose hip oils usually are. Great oil - helps healing the skin.
