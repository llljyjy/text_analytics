I have purchased several bottles of this. Not life-altering but impressive for the price. I use it right after cleansing while my skin is still damp. I find that it does help with moisture retention, especially in the winter months and as a protective layer when using certain actives. I considered briefly docking a star but really my only complaint is that this doesnâ€™t come in a value size. Hope they make a bigger size of this because there are only so many uses I can find for these little travel shampoo bottles good functional affordable product
