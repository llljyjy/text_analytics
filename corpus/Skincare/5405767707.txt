Iâ€™m currently 6 months pregnant and have never experienced such dry skin in my life to the point there was big red dry irritated splotches on my cheeks. I use this wash by its self and do NOT follow up with an additional cleanser.. and in less than a week my skin is crystal clear and soft as EVER! I am so glad I picked this up! So again do not think you have to follow this cleanser with another cleanser. I love this my face always feels amazing after washing now! Must have for dry skin!!
