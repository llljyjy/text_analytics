I received this Redness Rescue Kit for free from Influenster and Dr. Jart for my honest review. And I would recommend it for those with redness issues. I believe tiger grass helps with redness, is non-irritating, and soothing for the skin. I love the Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum and Cream. They both feel nice on the skin (jelly, moisturizing dropper & thick, soothing cream). Both don’t have nearly as strong a smell as the Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Corrector. It’s a herbal, medicinal smell. Nice and subtle in the serum and cream, but too strong for me in the color corrector. I think it definitely does what it claims though! Reduces redness, soothes, moisturizes. Some people even say they use the color corrector as their light foundation. I would use it for the same thing. It’s green at first but melts down to your skin-like color when pat (PAT only, dont rub) into skin. It does neutralize redness, so it gives my medium tan skin a slightly olive tone. But I’ll take it in the winters to soothe my red skin before other makeup application! A great kit! Only con besides the smell for me, is the color corrector seemed to get a little itchy on my face. But that could be due to cold weather dryness. I may need to put a slightly more moisturizing base before/after applying these products. Highly Recommend for Redness Prone Skin!
