First off, this jar is beautiful. The packaging and the eco friendly glass container are double awesome. I received this product from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  Aside from the packaging, the consistency of the cream is thick and to me, it feels high quality. I have been using this for several days and I am so impressed with how my eyes look and feel already, I had to share.   My eyes feel brighter and more alive in a short amount of time.   I am a believer in this cream and I will be buying a refill for it when I run out. Iâ€™m Impressed Already!
