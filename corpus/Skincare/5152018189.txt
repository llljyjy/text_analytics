Not what I was expecting. Very sheer for a product with SPF. I’m not a fan of the packaging difficult to get enough product out without having to shake again. I had piling as well I thought it was just me. I read other reviews wondering if this happen to anyone else. I can’t put anything on under this product of piling will occur. I was able to put another tinted SPF on top. Which I feel is a waste. Not worth the money in my opinion. I was hoping this would replace some morning product on my face but it won’t. I won’t be repurchasing this. I do the the serum skin tint with SPF so I will just stick with that. This product isn’t for everyone not what I thought
