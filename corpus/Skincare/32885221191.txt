I usually don’t wear sunscreen on my face because it causes me to break out (yes, I know), but this was not thick like other kinds that clogged my pores. It was lightweight and blended well without leaving the “white residue.“ It has a light, not overpowering sunscreen scent and feels like a moisturizer/ serum. Works great under makeup! nan
