My skin tends to be sensitive towards retinals and other active ingredients, but it tolerates this well. My skin feels more glowy and bright in general when using this. One night I used too much of the coordinating serum and had to take a break for a few weeks to repair my skin barrier. But Iâ€™ve since used this project and my skin tolerates it really well! nan
