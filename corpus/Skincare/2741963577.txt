I feel like my skincare regime is complete ever since I started using this product. I don’t want to test anymore product swaps because this one works so well! I took a chance on it because of the price point and rave reviews on azaelic acid from skincare experts. I have combination skin with mild rosacea and my skin has never looked better. I use this in the morning after The Ordinary’s niacinamide serum and before a spf moisturizer. I do still get the occasional white head (because #life) but they disappear the next day, and more importantly I don’t have small red bumps on my face anymore. I also haven’t noticed pilling like other reviews have mentioned. 10/10 recommend!! Miracle product
