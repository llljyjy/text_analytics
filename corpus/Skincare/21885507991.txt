Like most people say, AMAZING sun screen in HORRIBLE packaging. I have very oily, acne prone skin and this doesn’t make me breakout at all and actually really really helps control my oil throughout the day I literally never get shiny anymore when I use this even having a mask on the whole time. That being said the bottle is horrendous and the product is too thick to be used with the skinny dropper and you need to suck up product multiple times just to get it out little by little. It’s not impossible it’s just silly. Still, I highly recommend it. Flawless formula, extremely flawed packaging
