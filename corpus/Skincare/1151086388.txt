I’ve been using this eye cream at night, and not using it during the day as I’m trying SO HARD to not have my mascara leave marks under my oily lids. I can’t speak to it being under makeup except for one day (it didn’t pill, but my concealer still moved into my creases). This cream is a perfectly adequate cream. It’s not too heavy, but it’s not super light. It doesn’t tug around the eyes, but glides nicely.  Bonus: doesn’t make my eyes sting like some eye creams! I feel, for the price, it’s just a tad lackluster if you’re wanting anything other than a light moisturizer. very middle of the road
