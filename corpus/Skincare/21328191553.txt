I will never buy another moisturizer. The smell -DIVINE. The texture - PERFECT. The hydration - so noticeable and long lasting. In winter I feel like I put on moisturizer and my skin is already dry and tight or even stiff an hour later. This really works. Everything Iâ€™ve tried so far from this brand has helped my skin so much and is worth the price. nan
