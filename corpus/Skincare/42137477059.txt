I love how this moisturizer actually penetrates the skin. So many moisturizers feel like they’re sitting on top of my skin and wear off over time leaving my skin feeling dry by the end of the day. The only thing I’d change is the smell. It has a natural shea butter kind of smell but I wish it had some sort of light fragrance to it. My new favorite moisturizer!
