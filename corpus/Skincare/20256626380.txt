I thought this was going to be very heavy on my skin, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t. I literally put a2 small drops on my finger and blended this in with my sponge and the coverage was amazing. I couldn’t tell it was even on. My skin was shiny and flawless. At first I thought the color would be too dark, but it blended perfectly with my skin tone. Flawless and Light
