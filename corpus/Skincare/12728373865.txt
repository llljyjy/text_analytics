I received a sample of this serum for free from Topbox to test and review. It was a small sample so I cannot speak to the long term promises that it makes in regards to wrinkle correcting. What I can say is that it is a nice serum. Little to no scent, immediate absoption into the skin and it wore lovely under all of my face products. It is a good serum and if it actually comes through with the wrinkle reduction then it will be an awesome serum. I would more than likely purchase a full size bottle just to see what the results may be like#freeproduct It was nice
