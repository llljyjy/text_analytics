My skin suffers from redness and irritation. I have never been told but I am pretty sure I may have rosacea, which sometimes causes flare ups. This product has helped my skin within the first few days of using it. I bought the trial size but will 100% be going back to get the full size. I never write reviews, but if youâ€™re suffering with redness, itchiness or irritation on your face, try this. YES
