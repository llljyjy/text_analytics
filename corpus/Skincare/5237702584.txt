This has been my go to moisturizer for over a year now, and it had been out of stock and I’d eagerly been awaiting its return so when it was back I quickly purchased more. Came in “new“ packaging. So disappointed as this is not the packaging I always LOVED and is shown on the site. Honestly, I probably won’t buy again now. The packaging was a big part of why I loved it. So sad the packaging changed!
