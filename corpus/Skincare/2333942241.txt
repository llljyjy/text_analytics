Absolutely love La Merâ€™s Eye Concentrate Cream! This cream is very lightweight, hydrating, and feels very luxurious on the skin. A little goes a long way so I do think the price is justifiable when considering the benefits. After only a week of use, my under eye is brighter and my corner fine lines are less pronounced. Highly recommend if your concerns are dark circles and fine lines! Highly recommend!
