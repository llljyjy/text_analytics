I slathered this on a few hours before bedtime last night and woke up with skin that was parched and so dry - there was no bounce, glow or healthy shine to it whatsoever. Once I cleaned and did my normal routine, my skin felt much more hydrated.If you have oily skin and want to wake up completely matte, this may be a good option Does the opposite of what itâ€™s supposed to do
