I’m surprised this sunscreen doesn’t have a higher rating.  It’s absolutely gorgeous.  I’m almost through my second bottle of it and will repurchase.  It has a sweet, fruity fragrance that isn’t over powering and doesn’t linger. My skin is somewhat balanced/somewhat combination, and it provides a beautiful glow alone or under make-up that is never greasy.  I don’t typically need an addition daytime moisturizer with it.  It’s easy to apply and melts into the skin.  The packaging is satisfying. The only downside is I wish it were spf 50.  If I’m going to be outside for a lot of the day I use a higher spf. Highly Recommend
