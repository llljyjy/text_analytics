Good, thick lip mask for winter. Definitely thicker then Cay or Lenaige. No scent/flavor to speak on unfortunately. Just has that classic lipstick-y aquaphor-y taste. Still not sure how to feel about the packaging. It looks really cute and Itâ€™s different for sure, just will take some getting use to. nan
