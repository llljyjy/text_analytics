i usually feel like face masks give me the placebo effect. but this. this works, first mask i used once and woke up bright. i was not going to get it but i’m glad i did. i heard it was great but i’m a sceptic so i feel like a lot of things just aren’t all that/worth the money. but this was amazing. i am on accutane right now and this is the only way i can wake up without my whole face being dry and peeled up from dry skin. I highly recommend if you just can’t seem to keep your skin moisturized all night. this is perfect to lock everything in and keep it moisturized. holy grail for dry skin! actually works.
