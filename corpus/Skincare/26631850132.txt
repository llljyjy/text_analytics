Let’s start with the positives first. It feels so refreshing to put this on because it really is always cold. It applies smoothly, and the stick packaging means that it’s not messy. It also feels hydrating and lightweight as well. However, overall, I didn’t see much improvement after using this product in my under eye area. The “brightening” effect comes from the tint of stick. I guess it reflects light to make your under eye appear lighter, but once you pat it out, there goes the color. The product just feels really gimmicky tbh, but the cooling effect really is nice. Kind of Gimmicky
