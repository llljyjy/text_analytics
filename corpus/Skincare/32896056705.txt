Very hydrating and most importantly did not sting of bother my sensitive eyes. You only need a very tiny amount. I’m not sure if helped reduce under eye wrinkles but it does make my face look better when I apply makeup. I honestly don’t know if any eye cream has very long results if it’s not retinol or bakuchiol based, which makes skin sensitive. So you’ll never have a perfect eye cream and that’s fine. This is definitely a better one I’ve tried. Good for sensitive eyes, moisturizing
