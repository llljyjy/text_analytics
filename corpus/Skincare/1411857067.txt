I was so excited to receive this product because I have very dark circles (genetic) and some fine lines that I recently got. I used this every night for a few weeks and I didn’t notice any difference. It’s good for moisture and if you don’t have significant under eye concerns but for someone like me it just didn’t do enough. Wanted to love it
