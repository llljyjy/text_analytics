This water Bank Blue Hyaluronic was gifted by Laneige for my honest review. I am not a fan of Laneige but quite expressed by this serum. It is quite light weight with mild and present scent. It is if gel texture and absorb fast with greasy feeling. The design of the bottle is friendly for carrying without leaking and can apply anywhere. nan
