the 1 star is for pump design.  I didn’t use it longer than 2 days.  So I cannot comment on the results.  The pump is full of air, and the product was separated so spurts of oil came out, rather than a creamy serum.  I opened the pump, and it’s that horrible format with no straw and relies on air, but has no product bag.  So you’ll end up with a bunch of product stuck at the bottom, and the opening is so small you can’t stick a spatula down there.  So because of all that I returned it.  I will say it is nice and smooth, almost like a primer, no problem with makeup.  If the pump design was better I would have kept it. 1 star for pump design
