I received this product gifted by Peace Out Skincare. my opinions are my own. First, I loved the packaging very lively and bright, gets me motivated to do my skincare! I have had stubborn acne scars that are still with me at the age of 22 since I was like 15. And I feel like I have tried everything under the sun, but these dark spots on my forehead just won’t fade completely. This is a great addition to my skincare routine especially for my hyperpigmentation, applying it was great and it smells really good. It doesn’t feel drying like other dark spot treatments. I am looking forward to seeing the results from this product! Great addition to skincare routine
