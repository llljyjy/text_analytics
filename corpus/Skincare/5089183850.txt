I received this product free to try out from influenster. The packaging is nice and I like that it has the three different serums in one you can see them each dispense. I am also a licensed esthetician and the ingredients are very good ingredients. However the niacinamide in this i felt wasnâ€™t strong enough for my skin as I did not see any benefit in that area. but i did feel a little brighter from the vitamin C in this. great product
