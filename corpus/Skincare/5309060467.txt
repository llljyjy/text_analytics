I bought the small size to try. I’ve had serious hyperpigmentation under my eyes since I was little & nothing has worked. I’ve tried gels, creams, drink tons of water and nothing. This is the only product that actually worked. My under eye doesn’t look like 2 black spots anymore. It’s more even with my natural skin tone. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did take a long time fo to see any real results but they did come. You just have to be patient. Good product just need patience.
