After using this product for a bit I love it. I love that it is cruelty-free and vegan and that it not only blocks damage from the sun but also blue light since I mostly work in front of a computer. It doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy after application and makeup goes on smooth on top of it. The reason I took away a star is because it doesn’t smell great (smells like typical sunscreen). Otherwise I love it! Love the feel!
