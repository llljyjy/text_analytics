Loved loved loved this starter kit which was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty! My favorite is the Deep Sweep Toner and I definitely feel like I’ve seen so much of a difference in my pores within just 2 weeks of using. The Green Clean makeup remover is also AMAZING - truly got all the gunk off my face super easily and without intense rubbing. The Honey Halo moisturizer is also perfect for the dry winter I’m currently experiencing right now. I wasn’t able to get the pump to work for Honeymoon Glow though as no product would come out and it also doesn’t screw open :( So bummed that I wasn’t able to try the serum. Only docking a star because of this, but the other products are definitely 5/5! nan
