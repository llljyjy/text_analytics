Got this cause I have dry lips all the time, and was trying to find a good mask. Reviews on the laneige mask were mixed, so i tried this one. However, ever since I started using it, I’ve realized it makes my lips worse. I’ve stopped using it since, but I was using it daily for a good month to give it a try. Once I realized it was making things worse, I went back to my dollar store cherry lypsyl and my lips are better off with that. Not worth it tbh cause its expensive and wrecked my lips. Not worth it
