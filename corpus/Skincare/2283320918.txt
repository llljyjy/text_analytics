This product is pretty good, 3 stars because the scent is pretty strong and I don’t exactly enjoy strongly scented face products. The consistency is very thick but a little goes a long way. It’s very moisturizing and my skin looks radiant after use. I hadn’t noted any breakouts for the use of this product but the thickness and scent could cause some for others. It absorbed very nicely into my skin. For the price I probably wouldn’t purchase this on my own though. Decent
