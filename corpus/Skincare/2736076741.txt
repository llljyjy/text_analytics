Got fromSkinFix in exchange for my review This product came just in time for the change of weather. With the colder months starting in the Northeast. My dry skin on eczema flare up at its own worst. I appreciate this set so I can try all products together. I loved the consistency of the body wash, moisturizing. And the handcream was a much-needed savior for my dry cuticles. I saturated My knees, elbows and heels with the lotion. My skin felt immediately hydrated and moist not dry and pulling and it lasted well into the next day. I enjoyed using this product a lot Excellent starter set
