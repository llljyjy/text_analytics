I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my review. I love good skincare products so this is no exception. The packaging is stunning! I love the color and the pump is clear so you can see the product. To me, it smells like orange cream. I have oily skin and I’m also acne prone. I haven’t had any extra breakouts since using this. I apply it in the evenings after I wash my face. I have noticed a slight improvement in my skins tone. This is a keeper! Smells like Heaven!
