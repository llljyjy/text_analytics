Lately Iâ€™ve been having extremely dehydrated skin and hoped that this gel would help repair my moisture barrier. Generally I have combination skin that is very acne prone. The only positive was that this did not break me out or cause milia (where plenty of other moisturizers have). That said, for my very dehydrated skin this was nowhere near moisturizing enough - after applying at night, my skin would feel extremely tight by morning. I found the moisturizing effects to be very similar to drug store moisturizer (like Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion), which was very disappointing given the high price point. This was similar to the Skinfix Restoring Gel cream (also cheaper than Murad, though not by much) - although the Skinfix was also not moisturizing enough for me, it happened to help clear my skin (probably due to the inclusion of Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, which is very calming and clarifying for my skin). Leaving 2 stars since it may be the right moisturizer for someone with more oily skin, but you can get the same (mediocre) moisturizing effects for much cheaper at the drug store, or with Korean beauty brands.
