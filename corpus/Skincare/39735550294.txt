I love this serum!  I like that itâ€™s a double and it really helps prevent my skin from gets dry.  Sometimes my skin flakes a little bit and this worked to get rid of that as well.  It goes on and absorbs nicely and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  This is a nice product from Clarins and I will definitely be buying this in the future!  I find that as I am getting older, using a good serum is a must! A must-have!
