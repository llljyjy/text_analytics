I like that this moisturizer is very lightweight! A little goes a long way with this product and I like that the packaging is reusable/refillable. The only thing I donâ€™t love about this product is the smell. In the container it smells fine, but on my skin it smells like stinky feet. Its very strange. Overall I like the idea behind this moisturizer but I wish it was a little better considering the price. Underwhelmed
