My fiancé and I were visiting New York and running around the city, staying up late, and dehydrated (not on purpose). While getting my makeup done for our engagement photos, Johnathan from Sephora Services recommended this product to help my fiancé’s puffy under-eye bags and it really worked instantly. I now use this regularly and do notice less puffiness and slightly less dark circles under my eyes. I only use it once a day. A little goes a long way and it dries pretty quickly. Not too sticky either. For less than $10, it’s a really great buy. I’m now looking into other products in this line. I’ve tried First Aid Beauty Detox Eye Roller, which didn’t seem to deliver the same results and is much runnier. Works instantly and a great buy
