Love this and would consider my favorite lip mask. I just use a little bit (it comes with the perfect little spatula) right before bedtime. It has recovered my dry, chapped winter lips in about 3 uses. Itâ€™s a little sticky, but it feels comfortable after applying and during the night. I wake up with soft and hydrated lips. Will def buy it again! No more chapped lips during winter time!
