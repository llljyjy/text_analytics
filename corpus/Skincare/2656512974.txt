I wanted to love this sunscreen, since it is oil free yet has hyaluronic acid & can be used as a makeup primer. But this product since it is a mineral sunscreen leaves a white caste. I only wear it when I am applying my make up over it. it is great and my skin feels nice and hydrated, but i just wish this was a chemical sunscreen so i wouldnt need to worry about a white caste. Great, but leaves white cast
