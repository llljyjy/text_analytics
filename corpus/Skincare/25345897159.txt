I recieved Cauldie Vinetgetic C+ instant detox mask from #trywithtopbox and #freeproduct..to try with my sensitive , oily face..I love that its vegan..no scent and only use 2 times weekly..for 5 -10 minutes..rinsing after use..this pink clay mask is relaxing and you can feel tightening as it drys !! I used it in my nightly routine..to put me in the right mood for sleep..I can say Iâ€™ve used other brands for my problems..but this stuff from Cauldie makes my skin glow..and makes me happy !! Happy glowing skin
