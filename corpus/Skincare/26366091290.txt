I was skeptical about The Ordinary at first because of how inexpensive all their products are. This is my first product from this brand and I’m thoroughly impressed how it makes my skin look. I have eczema and religiously search for products that can prevent it from affecting my face. This serum does a great job of making me feel good after cleansing. Only “negative” thing to say is that it feels sticky when absorbing into the skin and smells faintly like glue, I’m not too bothered by this. Is it a holy grail product for me? No. But it’s a good product that is affordable and definitely worth buying. Works well, Great price
