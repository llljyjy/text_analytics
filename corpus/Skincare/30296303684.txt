I’ve been using this for 2 months now and it’s great.  Yes, it burns, yes it’s sticky....it’s the only toner/exfoliated that i can say is Excellent! I worked in beauty for 10+ years and tried everything under the sun and this product works for me.  I’m 50, pale sensitive skin.  It’s helped with my hyperpigmentation like no other product.  I’m bright, smooth, not flakey.  I use this about 4x a week give or take. I started slow and used it once every 3 days at first.  I took it slow.  I use it all the way down to my décolleté.  I (try to) wait an hour and then I apply my moisturizer & Yew Tip oil on top of it.  I Use nightly, if I flake off & don’t use it for a few days I can tell, it burns (for 10-20 seconds). When I was traveling and in a higher elevation (9,000 ft vs normal 2,500 ft) & very dry it burned so I just didn’t use while traveling then.  Give it a chance to do it’s job, go slow. If if burns that bad (usually subsides after 20 seconds) water blot it of or lube up with moisturizer.  Give it a try!!!! :) great product- give it a try/chance
