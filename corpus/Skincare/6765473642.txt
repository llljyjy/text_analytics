The ShiseidoEssential Energy Hydrating Day Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 20 is a great product if you are looking to minimize your routine. I thought the cream itself felt nice going on, and it didn’t feel greasy afterwords. It’s getting four stars because it did dry out my face. It might be a better summer moisturizer for me. More moisture please
