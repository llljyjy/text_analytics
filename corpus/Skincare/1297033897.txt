Was looking for a rich night time moisturizer that was clean to replace my tatcha Dewey cream.   This cream is a nice substitute so far.  Seems to settle into my dry skin without causing milia which I am prone to and have had some products cause flares of.  No scent.  Love the magnetic scooper so u do not have to put your fingers in the jar.  Time will tell if this is a 5 star find. nice find
