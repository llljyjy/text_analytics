I have used this product for several years now. And I loved the packaging that it was in. Shown in this photo. Because it gave the right amount. I am not happy with the new packaging. Iâ€™m wondering why they changed it? With all the complaints that I am seeing . Why would they change the packaging? The product is a five. The packaging is awful.  Make up artist Not too happy. Why would they change the packaging?
