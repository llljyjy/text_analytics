I love the packaging of this serum. It feels high-end and luxurious. This is a strong scent that quickly dissipates. The serum has a smooth consistency that absorbs into the skin well. After using for a few weeks I do think it helps smooth the skin and give a slight glow. While it is a great serum, the scent and the price point are cons. There are other products that are more affordable and perform just as well without being heavily fragrances. nan
