This is just okay. I seem to break out more with this one vs the REN toner. This leaves my skin pretty dry which might be better for oily skin but I live in a desert climate so this is a bit too stripping. If you have skin on the dryer side I’d recommend the REN toner over this, plus it’s cheaper! Better toners out there
