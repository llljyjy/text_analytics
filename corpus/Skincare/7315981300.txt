I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I love it. The first time I used it, my skin felt so smooth to the touch I couldn’t believe it. It’s very moisturizing without feeling heavy or gooey and absorbs very quickly. It almost feels like a cross between the Clinique Dramatically Different (although this might be because of the colour) and Tarte Drink of H2O (my usual) moisturizers. My skin stays moisturized all day, I rarely feel the need to reapply, even in ever-changing Canadian winter weather. I quite like the pump dispenser, it makes it easy to get just the right amount, without wasting any product. A little goes a long way, so I imagine the bottle will last me a long time. The only downside is the price. I received this product for free from Influenster to review, but I don’t think I will purchase this when my bottle runs out because of the cost. nan
