The tanning mist is so light on the skin and left my skin feeling really soft! I love the color it gives me and the smell is really pleasant! My only gripe is the design of the bottle! It’s designed to be upside down, and with the rounded ‘top’, it’s meant to sit upside down- but my bottle came leaking a bit, so not having the option to leave it the other way, makes it hard to store! The clear spray does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll love this mist! It builds nicely too- so you can get as dark as you’d like without looking fake. The color is really natural and even! Color is natural and skin is so soft!
