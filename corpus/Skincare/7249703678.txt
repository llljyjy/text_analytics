The SOS Intensive Redness Relief serum 2-/ gifted by Tower 28 Beauty and has worked its way into my heart. I can say that this has become my favorite serum. I have not noticed too much of a difference in the appearance of my skin after using this product for a little over two weeks, however, I have notice a HUGE difference in the way my stressed skin feels. The most noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin is how healthy it looks. I’m confident that with continued use, my skin will look even better than ever. Overall, I’m very impressed with this product and it will stay a staple in my routine! nan
