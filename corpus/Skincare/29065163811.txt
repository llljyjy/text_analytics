i love this freaking razor so much. leaves my skin feeling smooth and no irritation! there is a bit of a learning curve if you’re not used to using facial razors like this, make sure to keep your skin moist and pull it taut so you don’t scratch yourself! only downside is that the razor refills don’t seem to be in stock very often nan
