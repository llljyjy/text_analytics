This is my favorite moisturizer but it’s a bit pricey so I opted to get the refill pod after I used my original pot. The design of the container is faulty so when I put the refill in, I ended up wasting a third of the product. I’ll just be getting the full thing from now on (even though it’s $10 more) DO NOT BUY REFILL
