BEST SUNSCREEN EVER! I prefer this one wayyyy more then Supergoops other sunscreens. This one has the highest spf count, smells the freshest, and leaves absolutely ZERO white cast, and is the cheapest out of all of their sunscreens for the face. They 2.4oz (mini) doesn’t really seem like a mini at all, I always thought it was full size because it lasts a while and I use it everyday. It has improved my skins look so much, I think it’s the vitamin e and sunflower extract that has done so well with my dry skin. It’s pretty much a moisturizer as well so you don’t really have to use a moisturizer before this. I haven’t gotten sunburnt once with having this on my face. nan
