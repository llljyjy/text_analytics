I got to try Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Facial massage Balm through PINCHme. A balm is defined as a fragrant ointment or preparation to heal or soothe the skin. Sadly I did NOT find this balm fragrant. I did not care for the scent – it seemed off somehow – neither floral nor herbal nor woodsy. I was glad it quickly dissipated. I applied this balm before bedtime which was fortunate. It left a shine and oiliness to my skin which would be hard to apply makeup over. It did not absorb quickly. I don’t think this is a product for me. However I noticed that the name of the product I tried was different from the product listed here so perhaps they are actually not identical. Also a small spatula item is shown near this product which was not included with my product – not sure if this would have made any difference in its application or effectiveness though. On the plus side, this is described as a nutrient dense balm which does help aging skin and improves fine lines & wrinkles. Sadly not for me
