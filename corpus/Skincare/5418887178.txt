I’m relatively new to anti aging regimens but as all of those funny memes say, I wore butterfly clips in the ‘00s so it’s definitely time for me. I’ve never used lactic acid but loved how gentle it felt compared to other serums. It’s smooth and rich and gave me great results, I feel brighter even in the middle of a cold winter and my skin is definitely more even. Recommend for sure Surprisingly awesome
