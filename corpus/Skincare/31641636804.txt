I received this as a sample from influenster so I didn’t get to try very much, but what I did try, I didn’t care for. I certainly wouldn’t pay the price for this. It just seemed like a normal face moisturizer. Nothing stood out to me, not the scent, no after glow, or after effects. I would not reccomend this product. Just ok
