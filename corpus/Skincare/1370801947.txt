I live in the arid, hot high desert and finding a deep moisturizing cream that doesn’t clog my pores and irritate my skin has been a life goal. I’ve been really digging the Adaptogen Deep Moisture cream from YTTP, but the opportunity to try out the Polypeptide-121 has shown me my new favorite face cream. It’s a thick cream, so at first I was a little worried how my skin would react. After application, my skin is well hydrated and glowing, but the texture is not at all evident. It blends perfectly into my skin and combined really nicely with the YTTP Adaptogen hydrating mist (I apply the mist and then rub it into my skin with the application of the cream). There’s no stickiness or residual greasiness during the day. I should also mention that a little goes a long way, so you won’t be flying through jars trying to moisturize your face on a daily basis. I LOVE this stuff and will continue to buy it until they release my next favorite item. Perfect for sensitive and dry skin!
