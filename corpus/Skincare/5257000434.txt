I was hoping I wouldn’t like it because of the price tag, but it’s the best vitamin c serum I’ve ever tried. I’ve noticed results within just a few weeks! It lightened my sun spots/freckles, cleared my skin, and just brightened and evened out my skin tone. I haven’t had a single pimple since I’ve started using this serum (I usually get mild hormonal breakouts once a month). Also, it layers really well with other products, doesn’t feel oily and doesn’t irritate my skin. I will unfortunately keep buying this lol. The best vitamin c serum!
