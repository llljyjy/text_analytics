As much as I love tatcha, and as nice as the actual sunscreen is, this is quite possibly the worst thing I’ve ever bought from Sephora. The packaging is so terrible it makes it almost impossible to actually use the product. The sunscreen explodes from the container after you open it and goes everywhere. The coating on the container flakes off and gets into the sunscreen/ all over your hands and face when you try to apply it. It’s so irritating and beyond frustrating to see this from such an impressive brand, especially for the price. I don’t need fancy packaging but it has to be functional and this quite frankly is not. Hopefully they’ll fix the packaging, but until then I have to tell people not to buy this impossible packaging
