BuzzThe delivery system for this retinol is one of the most innovative I’ve seen. The retinol is packaged separately, and you mix it into the applicator serum once you are ready to start your routine. It’s very in line with the Kieh’s chemist branding.I used this retinol for about 2 weeks nightly, and have not noticed much of a change in my skin. However, it’s fun to use and easy to control the amount you squeeze therefore I tend to use it more consistently than other serums I’ve tried. The rubberized vial also make it easy to travel with. *I found out ltr the powder hadn’t mixed, so maybe directions need to be more clear about how to be sure the powder is mixed properly Cool delivery system
