I’m a huge fan of chemical exfoliators, and I typically use a BHA, but this is a gentler option that I still enjoy! Once or twice a week I’ll apply it with a cotton pad to freshly washed skin after I’ve pat it dry. I let it sit for a couple minutes and the proceed with my nightly skincare routine! nan
