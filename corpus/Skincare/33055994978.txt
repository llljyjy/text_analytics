I bought this because everyone raves about this product. After the first use my skin felt so…strange? Almost waxy and sticky feeling. Tried using it as recommended for about a month and saw no results. If anything I think it dried my skin out and cause lots of purging. I rarely get white heads and they were consistent with this product. I have combination skin that isn’t sensitive and usually use Thayer’s witch hazel as my toner. I also have never had an issue with my SkinCeuticals retinol or salicylic acid products. not for me
