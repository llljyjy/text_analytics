I received a small sample of this from #topboxcircle. The sample size did not last long enough for me to see any of the results it claims to have. It has a very light fragrance, but it’s super mild and doesn’t last. I am fairly sensitive and it doesn’t bother me. I like the texture of the serum, very smooth. All of this line absorbs very quickly into your skin, which I love. You can apply makeup over it no problem. It did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all, so that’s a huge plus for me. Also didn’t cause any breakouts either. If it can pull through on its claims for wrinkle reduction when you’ve been using it for a few weeks, I think this would be a top seller & a great buy! It seems to be a good product from my experience with it! Nice serum
