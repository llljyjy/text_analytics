I really loved the packaging. It’s simple, clean, yet sophisticated. It’s truly a reflection of Dior’s main theme. I suffer from extremely dry hands, so Influenster is a godsend for gifting me this! It makes my hands feel nice and comfortable. It calms my redness and gets rid of the stretchy feeling in my hands. It’s also really good for calming down the redness on my face. I like the fact that it is multi use, and you can use it as a face cream, mask, hand cream, body cream, and foot cream. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has dry skin. PS: It’s unscented, so it’s good for my sensitive skin. Dior Cica Repair Multi Use Balm
