Didn’t want to love this because of the price but I’m obsessed! My HG before this was the krave matcha cleanser but I felt like it was a tiny bit stripping. My skin doesn’t feel dry at all after using this. Very light scent and gel consistency is my favorite. I don’t wear a lot of makeup but this takes off mascara and concealer easily. nan
