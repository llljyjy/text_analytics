A little goes a long way! I bought this for the first time when I was actually in LA’s K-town and have been obsessed with it since. I have combination skin where my t-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry. I just a small swipe on my cheeks and forehead and chin and can manipulate it to be all over my face and down my neck. Such a nice feeling! It doesn’t feel oily . Favorite!
