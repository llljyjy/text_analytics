I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest reviewI don’t usually wear a night cream on a regular basis so I was excited to try this and it did not disappoint. A little bit goes a long way so I feel like a regular size bottle would last six months or longer. This product was a little greasy but it didn’t leave any residue on my glasses so that was a plus. I started putting it in my skin care fridge and applying it cold felt even better, I’d highly recommend this too! A delightful surprised
