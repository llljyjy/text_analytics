I received this product as a free sample. I have been using it for the past week and I’ve noticed my skin has gotten smoother and more hydrated. The moisturizer is so light and creamy, very gel like. It soaks into my skin right away. I have also noticed I have a brighter glow to my skin. I really love this product. It does have a weird smell (I guess it’s the fermented lemons), but it does go away within seconds. Love it!
