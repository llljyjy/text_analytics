SO disappointed in this product!! It’s nice and light but I was wondering why my skin didn’t feel super hydrated. I should’ve looked at the ingredients before I purchased this because it actually has denatured alcohol in it. I just don’t understand why they would put alcohol at such a high concentration in a hydrating product!! This may give you results but the alcohol is bound to dry out your skin over time. alcohol
