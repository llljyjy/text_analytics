To start off, this isn’t my first rodeo using lactic acid. I have used The Ordinary lactic acid layered under HA on and off for the past year or so and love how soft my skin feels the next day. However that technique can be tricky if I don’t leave enough time between layers (or forget one ..or am too lazy to do the whole routine). I also find the lactic acid can be pretty intense and leaves the apples of my cheeks feeling a bit raw and flushed. I bought The Ordinary Mandelic Acid to try something slightly gentler but it broke me out. When I received Good Genes I didn’t know anything about it but… wow. Not only does it have the same clearing effects as straight LA, it leaves my skin radiant and plump. I feel that it respects my skin’s moisture barrier. I love the creamier consistency and the smell of lemon is pleasant and not overpowering. Using this regularly and alternating with retinol has cleared the breakouts left by other more expensive treatments (NIOD CAIS if you’re wondering). The 5ml sample lasted me sooo many uses, so for now I repurchased the flash fix set to get the 8ml mini and will save up to buy the full size once I’m out again because I really do think it’s worth the price.
