In my late 30’s and never had acne problems until recently. Worst breaking out around my chin ever! First product that I tried is this and I have been using it for a week and the result is awesome. Only little bit of redness and small pumps are left.  I love it!! I am so glad I came across with The Inkey List’s Niacinamode Oil Control Serum. nan
