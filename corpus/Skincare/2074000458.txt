When I bought this small 5 mL size, I didn’t realize how little products you get for $35. I’m sorry to give it 2 stars because it has a pleasant flower scent and an oil texture that will work with both dry and oily skin. The price is not worth it. I got free samples that where triple the size and even full size products as gifts with purchase in other stores. It feels like a rip off. Costs more than if it had gold and diamond dust. Seriously? Too expensive for 5 mL
