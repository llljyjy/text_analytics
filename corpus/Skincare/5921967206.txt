After trying this product I truly love this cream. It’s rich and deeply nourishing but not overwhelming. It’s an ideal option for all skin types, even if your skin is sensitive or oily. It sits wonderfully under makeup, but most of the time I just pair it with my face sunscreen. It smooths my skin enough that I don’t feel like I need a foundation over the top. Love love love
