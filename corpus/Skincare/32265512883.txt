Once again, JLO beauty has very pretty looking products but they’re not worth the hype. I didn’t think the eye cream made a lot of difference to my eye concerns ( puffiness, dark circles) .I’ve tried other eye products that work just as fine or even better for a much better price. I wouldn’t purchase it again. nan
