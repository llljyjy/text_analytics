My (very dehydrated normal/combo) skin LOVES this product!!! I was weary of it to begin with because it’s a “celebrity brand,” but Rhi’s never done me wrong. It’s not sticky, sinks into the skin pretty fast, and leaves you ✨glowing✨ like good skincare should. It’s a little thicker than most toners, but nothing too crazy Wowie zowie!
