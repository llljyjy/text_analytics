I got this in the Sephora favorites Sun safety kit this year and I actually really like it. I’ve not had great luck with other Kiehl’s products so I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I do, but it’s quite nice. It moisturizes well and it’s nice as a first SPF step. I use this as my morning moisturizer and I apply a second sunscreen over top when I go out in the afternoons. I wouldn’t rely on this as my only SPF but I do really like that it has SPF. I don’t use any silicone in my skincare because they used to break me out but this doesn’t seem to cause that issue for me. Also I love the scent but don’t necessarily want or need scented facial products. Surprisingly Good
