Since i’ve started using it my skin looks and feels more radiant, softer and brighter. It is very gently in my skin. I love the fact that I didn’t feel any tingly or burning sensation like I had with other retinol brands that I had used in the past and it did in fact reduce redness on me, also I was gladly surprise that it did not dry my skin either.  It is very easy to use, design on the bottle makes easy to dispense the right amount for you to use and do not waste anything. In love of the formula, it is very light and easy to absorb, did not notice any scent so that is a plus for me. I would definitely purchase a replacement when I run out of this and of course I would recommend it to anyone who want to try a new retinol product gently on my skin
