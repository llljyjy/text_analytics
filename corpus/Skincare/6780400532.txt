I’ve been using the Cay Skin lip balm and absolutely loved it so thought I’d give this a try. I love this even more. You get a decent size tub for the price, it’s not sticky at all, product is thick and nourishing and melts right into my lips. The smell is also a plus! I even put a little bit on my hands to keep them soft and hydrated overnight. Woke up and still had some product on my lips. This is the best lip product I have ever used. Also note, I’m not an influencer and wasn’t given a sample. Just noting that b/c I feel like almost all reviews you read aren’t real anymore. Must have lip hydrant!
