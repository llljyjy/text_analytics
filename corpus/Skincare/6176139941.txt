So far really enjoying this neck cream! I love the packaging the twist tube makes it really easy to use and no mess. It has a nice light scent that dissipated quickly after applying the cream. The texture is light and not greasy but very hydrating and moisturizing. It’s different from most neck creams that I have tried that usually have a thicker texture. I have a few faint horizontal lines across my neck so I’m excited to see the longer term results and hoping they will fade away with continued use. Great neck cream
