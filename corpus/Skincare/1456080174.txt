I’ve been using this on my eyes every nighy, sometimes twice a day, for 4 months now. I’m 36 and have some light, fine lines around my eyes but nothing crazy. I use this both undereye and on my lids/orbital area because I have hooded eyes and need some firming. I would like to think that my under eye is looking a littler tighter and brighter but honestly, I really don’t see a noticeable difference ans that may be because I don’t have significant lines to begin with. I started layering this with a tiny bit of the DE passioni retinol just under my eyes a couple nights a week to Amp up the retinol in that area so we will see. This goes on really smooth, absorbs nicely and is somewhat hydrating but I always dab a little moisturizer or eye cream over it to lock in more moisture. I think I would repurchase this but im going to give it another couple months to see if I notice any results. nan
