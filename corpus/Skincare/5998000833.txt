This eye cream is amazing. I was never one to use something specific for under eye until I started seeing slight wrinkles. I tried a few different brands but then came across this one. It’s extremely hydrating and rich. I use it during the day or at night. Leaves a glow that eventually soaks in after an hour or so. A little bit goes a LONG way. I’ve convinced my friends to get it as well. Works well under my makeup too! Game Changer
