I received this product complimentary from Goop, to try and to share my opinion. I appreciate a lightweight way to wear my sunscreen, sometimes crams give you a sense of security from thickness, but they turn out to be SPF 15. This product layers well with other SPF products, but I also love putting some extra on and using as my only sunscreen. nan
