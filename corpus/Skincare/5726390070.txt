I received this as a birthday gift and was super excited to try this product since I heard so many good things about it! Just for reference, i have combo skin but I have been more on the dry side due to the cold weather. The product itself does not have a very thick consistency so I was expecting that it will be absorbed into the skin quickly but was very disappointed that it left my skin feeling & looking greasy HOURS after application. I tried it during my morning routine before work and was hoping the greasy-ness will subside over time but noticed I was STILL as greasy at the end of my shift as I looked in the morning. For me, its best to put this on during the night as part of my nighttime routine. Overall, i have not seen a change in my skin after 1 month of use and does not make my skin feel hydrated. Would not purchase this product myself. Greasy & not very absorbent
