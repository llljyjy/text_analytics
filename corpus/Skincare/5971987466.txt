I love this stuff. It’s not often I find a product I can see myself using up completely. It helps hydrate my face as the first step in my skincare routine and i use it during the day if my skin could use a little more moisture. It smells like coconut water, so not ultra strong, but it does have a faint coconut smell. It’s by far my favorite of MB sprays. I currently have a sunburn and it helps with hydrating and cooling off my face and chest. I also like that this product was very inexpensive so how often I’m using it and repurchasing isn’t an issue. nan
