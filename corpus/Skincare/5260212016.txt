I am actually so impressed by this sunscreen. I have tried so many different sunscreens from American and Korean brands. I have medium-tan-dark skin so I am always worried about white cast. This sunscreen has 0 white cast. It leaves a beautiful glowy, dewey finish that isn’t too sticky or wet-looking. I was amazed that it had so many great skincare ingredients in the formula. Also, the texture is absolutely amazing. It doesn’t feel like a heavy, greasy, or oily sunscreen. I think this is my new go-to daily sunscreen. I like how it has more SPF than other sunscreens from clean beauty brands, but still feels nice for day-to-day rather than a heavy duty beach sunscreen. This was complimentary from Cay Skin. Love the finish and texture!
