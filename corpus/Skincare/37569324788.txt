This self tanner is AMAZING! The color works perfectly with my olive skin tone. I tan easily but don’t want to damage my skin being in the sun too much so I like to apply self tan to help with the process! This one smells SO GOOD. Most self tanners have this awful smell which makes me have to apply it at night time so I don’t have to smell it all day long.The consistency of the mousse is great and it applies easily with the St. Tropez mitt. 10/10 reccommend if you are looking to try a new self tanning product! My skin also feels super hydrated and smooth after using this mousse! HYDRATING + BRONZING! NOT ORANGE
