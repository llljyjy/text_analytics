This moisturizer comes with a pump which makes it simple and mess free when it comes to application. It did have a slight scent to it but that was not too off putting for me personally. The texture is nice, like a thicker moisturizer and I found it to be very moisturizing and not too heavy. It absorbs into the skin fairly quick as well. Overall I liked it! nan
