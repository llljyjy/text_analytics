Came to the reviews to see if anyone else complained of the odor. It really does smell expired. It’s a combination of a musty smell and a chemical smell. Enough people rave about it that I will keep using it, but the odor is not fading after several minutes and it’s…pretty awful. wow, the odor really is bad
