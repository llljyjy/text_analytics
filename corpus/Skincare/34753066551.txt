I’ve been using different brands of Vitamin C serums for a year or so now trying to find something to help with my dark circles. Kiehl’s powerful strength dark circle reducing Vitamin C eye serum seems to have done the trick! I can tell a difference in the pigment under my eyes! I would have gave this product 5 stars, but the one thing I didn’t care for was the almost greasy feeling it leaves after use. I still would recommend this product to friends and family and I’m definitely buying more and making this a part of my daily skin routine nan
