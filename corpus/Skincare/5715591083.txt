I’ve been using it day and night, and don’t notice a huge difference in my skin. I warm it in my hands for about 20 seconds and apply all over my face after applying my serum and I find that it remains quite thick and doesn’t turn very creamy as it claims to. I see how it could be soothing after using harsh peels or exfoliants. However, I believe there are more affordable options. I do like the ingredients though. It's alright
