Incredible for specific use cases but it’s definitely not for everyone. This product is a gel which pulls loose skin taut as it dries down to a film, nothing more or less. If you have moderate to large distinct skin folds the results can be dramatic, but if you don’t then this will NOT do anything for you. It’s not miracle surgery in a bottle, won’t replace your eye cream, and isn’t very comfortable to wear because of how it works. But if you want to temporarily tighten deep bags/wrinkles for a special event or photos, this is what you need. Truly amazing product if you have realistic expectations about what it can and can’t do. Advice from a Sephora employee
