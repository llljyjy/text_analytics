I received this free to try through #trywithropbox, but these opinions are my own. I wanted to love this product, because I liked other products in this line, but it wasn’t it for me. The serum is lightweight but is iridescent. It left a weird sheen on my face that I didn’t love. I find that it made my moisturizer and other products pill on top of my skin. I know it’s for night, but I didn’t like how it played with my other products. I also couldn’t wear it during the day because of the sheen, plus the bottle says it’s not supposed to be used and exposed to the sun. Might work for others, but I didn’t like how it felt on my skin. I wasn’t able to test it long enough to see if it makes a difference in wrinkles, but I have other products that work that I prefer nan
