I was super intrigued when I read the name Cleansing Serum. I thought there’s some new cutting edge technology that has popped up in the world of cleansers! Well, it’s your everyday cleanser with a good texture. I love the light gel serum-like texture that doesn’t foam like crazy and is pretty gentle on the skin. It cleans the skin properly without drying the skin too much or leaving behind that intense stretchy feeling. I obviously need to use my moisturizing skincare after washing. It doesn’t remove makeup completely but is good enough to get rid of basic everyday blush, foundation powder kind of stuff. Makes a good second cleanser or first cleanser in the morning. Does not have an overwhelming fragrance which is a plus. The sleek bottle with pump looks neat. A 150 ml bottle will last for a while but it’s a bit expensive for a cleanser. A good cleanser
