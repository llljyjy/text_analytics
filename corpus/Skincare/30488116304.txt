I love love love this product. I find it makes me much less oily than the normal Fat Water and it smells great. It’s a bit slipperier than the other Fat Water, in the sense that a lot of product can come out when you squeeze the bottle, so just be careful. Honestly, I’m so glad that I compared the two, since this one is so great. I use this at nighttime before bed
