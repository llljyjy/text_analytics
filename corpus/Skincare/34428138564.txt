I’ve been using this eye cream for about 3 weeks now, both morning and night. And even just after the first day or two I noticed an immediate change in my skin’s hydration, texture and overall appearance. I love how sudden my skin showed results which it continues to show more each and every day. I also love how a little of this product goes a long way, we’re still after using for almost a month now I still have plenty left inside my jar. I actually started using this also and other dry areas of my face because of the results I was getting from under my eye, which now the other parts I started using are showing significant improvements as well. I love the look and feel of my skin now I definitely recommend this to somebody who is looking for hydration and to change their texture and appearance of their skin. nan
