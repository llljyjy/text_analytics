Love this product so much! I have the most even complexion, smaller pores and far less congestion thanks to this serum. I use it 2 times a week after the daily peel pad from Dr. Dennis G, and follow that up with a tick moisturizer before bed (DE Wonderwild Miracle Butter.) I am dying reading the reviews saying it smells like hotdogs, to me it smells more like cloves, but I use it at night so Iâ€™m not smelling it all day. Game Changer
