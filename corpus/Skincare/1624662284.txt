I really enjoyed trying out the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream! This cream did not have any fragrance and claims to be a clean beauty item, which is important to me because I have pretty sensitive skin. I used this product every night for 10 days as part of my normal evening skincare routine and all I can say is WOW! My skin is glowing!! It was not a particularly heavy moisturizer, so it sank into my skin really nicely. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or who is looking for clean beauty products. So glowy!!
