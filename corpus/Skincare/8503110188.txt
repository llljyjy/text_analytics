I really love the smell of this soap. It’s not like other bar soaps where your skin feels like it’s paper and icky. This definitely leaves you feeling moisturized and again smells amazing. I thought my boyfriend was using my soap because I could smell it in the bathroom. I would say the paper packaging is underwhelming Love this and smells amazing
