I really like this mist. It has a nice sprayer and it doesnâ€™t leave me greasy at all despite having oily skin. The minty scent is quite strong though so I wish it was unscented. This is great for keeping in your purse or the office to reapply spf. This was gifted complimentary from Supergoop. Love it for SPF Reapplication
