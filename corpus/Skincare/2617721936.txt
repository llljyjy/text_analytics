I received this for free via Influenster in exchange for an honest review. My skin is sensitive, very dry and I have rosacea. The smell of this is so pleasant, itâ€™s a great citrus scent to wake you up in the morning. The cleanser left my skin feeling so soft and was the perfect amount of exfoliation for daily use (again I have very dry skin). The only downside to the product is that it did not fully remove makeup after a double cleanse. However, I will keep this in my rotation for morning cleanse as it really refreshes, leaves the skin feeling soft, and I did notice a glow as a result. I also tried goops exfoliating mask and I honestly think the face wash is much better! Great for exfoliating but not makeup removal
