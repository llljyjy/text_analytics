I am really enjoying this product. A very little bit covers my entire face and even down through my chin and neck and up to my earlobes. If there is any scent to it is very very very subtle. Iâ€™ve been using this for about a month so I do not have much to say in regards to what it can do for wrinkles and aging but I can say that my skin has been a lot more even and it is retaining moisture better through the cold dry winter. nan
