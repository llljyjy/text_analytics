I recently received an It brand product, Confident in a Creme, for free as part of a promotional campaign from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review of the product. Let me start my review by saying that I have tried the product for about 14 days morning and night along with my daily skincare routine. The size of the product is very good, in fact it seemed large compared to other brands. It contains 2 oz and says it is for all skin types. My skin is a combination of oily and dry. The cream is very rich in consistency and you don’t have to use much to cover the face and feel the skin hydrated. Skin does not feel sticky after application if you use a small amount. One thing that I noticed when I opened the bottle is that it has a strong fragrance. If you have a sensitivity to fragrances, this could be a problem. Although the fragrance is less empowering, once you apply it to the skin. What changes did I notice in my skin during these 14 days? First, my skin felt completely hydrated from the very first application. After about 1 week of use, my skin looked smoother and softer to the touch. A more subdued appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, especially on the forehead and around the mouth. In short, I like how smooth my skin feels and how during all these days I have seen a decrease in my fine lines and wrinkles. I am sure that with continued use I will see further improvements. I’m not a fan of the fragrance but I don’t hate it either, I think I got used to it. I recommend you give it a try if you are not that sensitive to fragrances. The results after continued use may surprise you. For a younger and smoother skin!
