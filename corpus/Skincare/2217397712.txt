Best “on a whim” purchase in awhile! This gives you such a pretty glow and makes your skin look so plump, dewy and hydrated. Wears well under makeup with no pilling. Just blurring enough that all I need with it is some concealer under my eyes and I’m good to go! I love pairing this with the IT Nude Glow Skin Tint and Nars Laguna bronzer for a super pretty sun kissed look! nan
