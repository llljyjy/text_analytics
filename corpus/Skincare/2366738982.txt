f you’re curious as to why this razor is so much better than others, it’s because of the simple fact that it’s made with quality materials. Function, quality, and aesthetic are all exceptional in comparison to other razors I’ve used. The metal is rust-resistant, and the powder coating gives it long-lasting durability. Furthermore, the finger grooves make it easy to reach far away regions, and the cap curve is designed to fit underarms comfortably. I highly suggest you use it with Shave Pillow Moisturizing Body Gel!Gifted By Hanni but would repurchase it when I’m running out of it. nan
