I use only the large bottle, given to me by my wife for PR. I’ve used everything from proactive 15 years ago to atleast 15 other products since and nothing had ever helped me achieve a fully clear face until this. I only use the large bottle, once per day in the shower and oil free lotion directly after the shower. This stuff is GOLD. I’m nearly 27 and it took this long to finally have a clear face, but thankfully it was found! For the price it’s WELL worth it! Thank you for an amazing product, and me actually writing a review is a once in a 5 year thing. So when I say this product is amazing, take me at my word. Amazing product, mid 20s male. Not just for teens.
