I have eczema on my face primarily and am acne prone as well. So I have dry skin plus problem skin. This mask is amazing! I use it once a week and my skin is instantly soothed and looks hydrated and clear. My partner even notices after I use it. I would definitely buy this again and its worth the price. nan
