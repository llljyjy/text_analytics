I received this product free from Influenster and Charlotte tilbury in exchange for my honest review. I have very sensitive/acne prone skin so I was nervous to try this. I started out using it only at night and I immediately loved it. It left my skin feeling moisturized and smooth and didnâ€™t break me out. For the past week I have been using it morning and night with no break outs and my skin is so soft and healthy feeling. Highly recommend and I will be buying this in the future. nan
