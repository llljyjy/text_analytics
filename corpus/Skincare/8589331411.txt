This is the first review I’ve ever left on ANYTHING that I’ve ever bought! But I love this mask so much, I have to hype it up so PTR keeps making it. I use a ton of different actives in my routine and have searched for years for the perfect hydrating mask that I can add to my routine anytime. THIS IS IT! A perfect, basic mask for when your skin needs a little more moisture. I had over exfoliated and my barrier was in serious need of repair and this fixed it within a matter of days. My skin is plump, hydrated, and any hyperpigmentation I have heals so much faster when I use this. It has never irritated my skin and has only helped my acne, which is rare for me to find with such a hydrating product. I use it multiple times a week and am always pleased with the subtle extra moisture and glow this gives me. Give this a chance! Use it often to see the best results! Can work in super complicated or super simple routines. Highly recommend! Perfect basic, hydrating mask for any routine
