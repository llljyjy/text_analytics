I really like this product! I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and normally try to stay away from using oils. I decided to give this a try and the results have been great. I didn’t experience any breakouts or irritation and have found it’s clearing up my skin and creating a nice glow. I recommend only using this a couple days a week to start because it can cause some dry skin, like with any retinol product. Overall, I think it’s worth a try! Great product!
