I received this item for free from Influenster for in return my honest opinion. To be totally honest I love the creaminess and light weight feel of this product. Especially, with using this product everyday the moisture it provides is amazing. I did not see many changes or results with using it compared to other products I have used daily.  I used this product for over 5 weeks and I did notice my skin was more hydrated, but I still had the dark circles and fine wrinkles.  I would not look into purchasing myself because I saw minimal changes. Hydrating but not ant-wrinkle
