I received this small sample as a free trail to review. First off it is heavily fragranced. I prefer my skincare to be fragrance free. It is supposed to be used to improve dry skin, however it is also to be used with a moisturizer. Personally I would skip this step and just use a good moisturizer. I did not see much improvement with using this product. If you are a die hard Est√©e Lauder fan then you might want to try it. Personally I will just stick with my moisturizer. Strong fragrance
