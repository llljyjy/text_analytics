I honestly felt that I had to give this moisturizer ample time to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it. Very soothing and goes on easily and my skin soaked it up that I actually had to use a little more than what the instructions said, but I have dry skin too. I started to notice a difference by the start of the second week, my face seemed much more soft than normal and my fine lines were starting to diminish. My skin absolutely loved it ðŸ¥° Pleasantly surprised!
