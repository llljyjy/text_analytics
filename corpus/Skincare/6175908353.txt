I’m actually quite surprised by how much I enjoy this moisturizer! It’s very lightweight and has a gel-like consistency. I’m someone with dry skin, and typically lightweight moisturizers just don’t do it for me. This product, however, is packing a punch! VERY moisturizing. Leaves skin feeling soft and radiant, and it’s not sticky to touch. I tried it at nighttime with no other products so I could really gauge the effect. I woke up in the morning and my skin was still soft and smooth! Very few moisturizers give me the same experience. 10/10 would definitely recommend! A Moisturizer That’s Packing a Punch
