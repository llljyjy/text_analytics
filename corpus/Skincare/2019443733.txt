I know some of the reviews I read complained about this product in regards to having trouble getting it to blend in but I have had wonderful luck with this and I love it. I use tinted mineral SPF anyway daily but I love extra targeted protection and I love the brightening affect this has. For reference I am a tan skinned black women, and I find that if I am feeling a bit dry, using hyaluronic acid and a bit of oil underneath the eyes really helps keep it from looking a bit pale. I would be really interested to see how this looks on anyone who has deeper richer skin then me in regards to white cast nan
