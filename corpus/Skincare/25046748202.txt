I received this Bye Bye Makeup 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm as a free sample. I liked that it melted in my hands and easily took off the day’s makeup. I didn’t care the effort needed to wash it off though. It was so messy and water was everywhere by the time I had massaged it onto my eyes, then added water as suggested, to then finally wipe off my makeup. It was a mess! nan
