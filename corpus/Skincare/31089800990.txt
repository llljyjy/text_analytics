I bought the sample size and liked it, but after purchasing this and using it over a couple months consistently I feel that it’s too drying for me (combination skin). It didn’t break me out and has a really nice fresh scent, but I didn’t notice any benefits to my skin. Overpriced if not part of a major sale. Spend most of your money on serums (which sink into your skin), not cleansers (which you wash off immediately)... Won’t be repurchasing. Nothing special
