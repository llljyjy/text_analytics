This products works. I have used a few gradual tanning products as well as a few from St. Tropez and I fall more in love with the brand each time I try a new product of theirs. This goes on very well and it feels almost like a lotion. It does have a scent so if your sensitive to certain perfumes this would not be for you. Overall this product works very well for me! Great product!
