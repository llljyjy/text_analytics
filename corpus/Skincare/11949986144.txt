NOT FOR PALE SKIN. Initially the colour is green, but shifts to an orange-beige upon application + rubbing in. I was very shocked to see it was drastically darker than my skin colour, and should definitely have been warned that this is not good for pale skin. I am giving 2 stars as the product smelled nice and natural, sat nicely on the skin (not too oily/greasy) and blended easily with no reaction from my sensitive skin. Unfortunate that the colour was so intense. NOT FOR PALE SKIN
