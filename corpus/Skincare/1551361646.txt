I bought this because I had originally tried the retinol 1% in squalane and was so impressed with its moisturizing. Then I read a few reviews where people really liked it on hair as well. I have super fine curly hair that gets weighed down quite easily but now I’m using this after almost every shampoo, sometimes just by itself. It does not weigh my hair down at all, softens wonderfully, and tames frizz fairly well. I have yet to use too much. I also tend to get scalp build-up really easy and this doesn’t build up. Bonus is that it also works awesome for applying other scalp serums that might be thicker and harder to apply; thins them out and makes them last longer. And yes, it’s still wonderful on the face too! nan
