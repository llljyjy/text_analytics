I was aware of the hype for this oil cleanser but it really lived up to it and I’m mad at myself for not trying it sooner. It smells amazing, has the best texture, and truly takes off ALL makeup with little effort and doesn’t strip you’re skin - after I rinsed, my skin felt moisturized and baby soft! I also love that it comes with a spatula and a tiny sample of their honey moisturizer inside the box. I have dry skin and need to use oil-based products, especially in the winter and this knocks every oil cleanser I’ve ever used out. LOVE the balm and will never go back. Slept on this for far too long
