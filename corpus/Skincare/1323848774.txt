I never write reviews, but want to make sure this doesn’t get discontinued! I use this every morning under my Josie Maran SPF moisturizer and it gives the most perfect glow. My mid-50’s skin looks young and radiant and especially good on zoom and in photos as well as in person. It’s the perfect amount of moisture and a great base before everything else. It just brightens things up and gives a natural glow without looking fake, shiny or or iridescent. I cannot recommend this product enough!! Get a magical glow!
