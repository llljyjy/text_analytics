For the past couple of weeks my face has been peeling and been dry for some reason. I was using the Biossance Gel moisturizer and my skin was feeling very dry in certain areas. I then decided to use a more hydrating moisturizer so I purchased the Biossance Omega Repair cream and it somewhat worked but not quite. I then remembered that I still had the birthday Laneige kit that I got from Sephora last year and decided to try the Water Bank moisturizer. Immediately this felt so nice on my skin. For years I’ve been searching for the right moisturizer and I have finally found the one. This feels so nourishing, hydrating and soothing on my skin. It feels amazing. I love it so much. I have combination skin but this feels perfect and it doesn’t make my face oily. I feel so dumb that I had this in my drawer all this time. I’m glad that I finally found this product, it really helped my skin feel less dry and my face stopped peeling. Great Moisturizer
