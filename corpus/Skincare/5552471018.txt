I have tried so many sunscreens. From cerave to shiseido to La Roche posay and this is my favorite sunscreen. I recently decided to only use mineral sunscreen and it’s hard to find a good one. My go to tinted mineral sunscreen is the La Roche Posay one but wanted one with no tint and this one is by far the best one I have found. The color of this sunscreen is more greyish than white and leaves a slight (barely there) white cast. The white cast actually evens out the dark spots on my skin so I don’t mind. It is very moisturizing and glowy. You get that glow recipe type glow when you apply it. It does have a slight sunscreen scent but almost undetectable. I have used this alone (with just my skin care) and over makeup and makeup applies beautifully ontop with no peeling. Recently I started using this sunscreen with the drunk elephant d bronzing drops and I love it. The texture is very light, it is not a thick sunscreen. I will be purchasing the tinted one in the summer when I am tanned. Totally recommend!! My FAV Sunscreen
