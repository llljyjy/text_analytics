The product gifted by Dermalogica Sampling worked well with my skin. I feared it would irritate my skin as most skincare products do but it did not. Instructions are easy to follow. It does not have a smell. Iâ€™ve been using it for a few days and I can already tell a difference. Perfect for my skin
