I received a sample of Caudalie Premier Cru Anti aging cream in exchange for my honest opinion. I was very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this cream as I have tried the brands other products and did not like them. This cream changed my opinion about Caudalie in the most positive way. The positive about this cream: 1. The texture is thick and luxurious feeling on the skin. It absorbs easily and feels like a premium skincare product.2. For sensitive dry skin especially mature skin types - this cream is very hydrating and moisturizing. Waking up 7 hours later, my skin looked plumped and soft.3. I felt my lines on my forehead and mouth were visibly diminished and I did not look so drained.4. It is a clean product and packaging is recyclable which is great.5. I had no reaction to the product to this product and would definitely recommend it for sensitive skim. Premier Anti-aging Cream
