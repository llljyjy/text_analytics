I love take care of myself at the comfort of my home. And if you’re like me, let me show you my new bestie!!! It’s helping me a lot to have amazing professional microdermabrasion treatments results at home! Im talking about the Personal Microderm Elite Pro!The TruTier™ technology combines variable vacuum suction and tri-speed capabilities to provide the most customizable microdermabrasion treatment on the market!I’m using it once a week, because it promises: “Weekly treatments reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, blemishes, and enlarged pores.” And even with a few uses I can notice my skin more beautiful!Let me tell you another impressive thing: “Personal Microderm removes the top layer of dead, dull skin cells. Once this barrier is removed, skin care products can penetrate 20X deeper maximizing the benefits of skin care.” Like a dream!!! Loving it!Have you ever used something by @pmdbeauty? Amazing!
