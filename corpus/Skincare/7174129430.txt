Im a big fan of Laneige products and this one did not disappoint. I have oily/combo skin and this moisturizer hasn’t caused a breakout which is nice. The texture is thick but absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin. This cream does have a slight fresh scent but is fairly light and diminishes during application. The packaging is a baby blue container, you turn the top half way and pull up to lift the top off, which is different from wanting to unscrew the top like other packagings. Using this moisturizer for weeks has hydrated my skin and less dull. It even works under makeup without separating. If you’re looking into a hydrating moisturizer that melts into your skin and works great alone or under makeup, then this is the one. Hydrating
