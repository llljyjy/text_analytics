I really love using this product! The texture is so soft and smooth, it makes my under eyes feel super hydrated! I noticed after awhile of using it my under eyes were in fact brighter. After i apply the product my skin feels so smooth and itâ€™s feels so cool under my eyes, It layers pretty well with other skincare products and it makes my under eye perfect for makeup it never comes out creased! i used this in my send to last step before my hydrating mist and i love it like that! it never burned my eyes or anything like that i really enjoy this product and i would recommend this to a lot of people! You need this!!!
