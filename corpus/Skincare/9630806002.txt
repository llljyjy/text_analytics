This stuff is amazing. I’ve struggled with rosacea and kp all my life and although this isn’t super high coverage, it evens out my skin tone beautifully, melts in and looks so glowy. Definitely not for everyone as I’m seeing people write that it sits on top of their skin and doesn’t stay on. This has not been my experience as it looks like my natural skin just more smoothed out and hydrated. I do agree that it’s hard to blend but I’ve found if I really just work it into the skin, by both rubbing and tapping in, it looks like I’m wearing nothing. nan
