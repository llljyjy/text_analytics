I had perfectly clear skin on my cheek area and wanted something moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and saw the great reviews (albeit was free products), and went ahead and splurged. Broke my clear skin into little bumps within two days. No ingredients should cause a purge (no actives) and so did not repurchase.If you have sensitive skin be wary! Wanted it to be my holy grail… Didn’t.
