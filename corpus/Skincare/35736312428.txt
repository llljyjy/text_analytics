I recieved this product for free in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. I have break out prone skin an I am 37. This cleanser made my face feel wonderful and smooth. It did not make me breakout. You canâ€™t use it around the eyes so I did need additional makeup remover in that area after using. The smell is light but fresh. I will continue this probably every other night and will be excited to see how my skin responds. But for now I feel deep cleaned but so soft and not dry. I love this product. I love it
