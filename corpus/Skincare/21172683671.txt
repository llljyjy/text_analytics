Get it now! This is the best lip balm I’ve ever used. For the longest I thought nothing could beat my Carmex and I’ve tried them all; both high end and low end. This not only moisturizes the lips, it literally melts the chaps and cracks away. It also smoothes any weird lip lines/wrinkles, it lasts on the lips, and smells great. It looks like lip gloss on but feels like lip balm. New holy grail. Buy it now
