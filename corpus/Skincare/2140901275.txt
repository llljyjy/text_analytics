When I want a lip oil, I truly want that thin non sticky consistency. I do like this lip oil, it has a nice cherry candy scent that isn’t too strong. This is for people who want a thicker lip oil/gloss. Slightly sticky but not bad. My hair did stick to my lips with it though. I’m still on the hunt for my go to lip oil. I might have to return this for the price since it’s not a love for me. not my favorite but not bad
