I was super excited to get this because I’ve been really wanting a tinted moisturizer type of product since I don’t wear makeup most days. I received the shade tan and it has a white cast once you apply and blend it into the skin. I’m assuming that’s from the spf in it? I had to put on some pressed foundation powder to mask the grey/white look it gave to my skin. So I can’t wear this alone. I did end up buying the darkest shade and that was way too dark. I’d rather use my spf that doesn’t give me a white cast and mix that with a foundation. I didn’t take off a bunch of stars simply because the formula is great and does look very skin like. It allows your skin to breathe while providing the sun protection. It evens out your skin tone Great but not for me
