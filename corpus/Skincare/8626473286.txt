I had the opportunity to try this product for free. This was a good product for a beginner. However it isn’t my first choice for someone with more experience with retinoids. It also isn’t the best for oily/ combination skin types. It is a light weight oil but it feels a bit greasy and doesn’t absorb in the skin completely like some of the competitors. This was great as my sealant of my skincare at night right before a think moisturizer. I did find my skin was a bit plumper in the morning afterwards. Good for beginners
