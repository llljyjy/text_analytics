I’m pretty impressed with the amount of moisture this product has given my skin! During these cold, dry winter months this is exactly what my skin needed. The product is a thick consistency that is very hydrating. It smells nice too! I can’t say I noticed a huge difference in  my pores, but overall I am satisfied. Super moisturizing!
