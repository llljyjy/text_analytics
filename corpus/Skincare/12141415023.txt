I’ve had problems with other make-up removers since my mascara is hard to take off. It was so tiring to scrub my eyes of with micellar water so I looked for a melting butter. I had read some reviews on this product that claimed it broke them out and to not buy... I risked it and I fell in love with this product! I don’t have extremely problematic skin but it is pretty sensitive and this product is just so soothing and soft, it really worked well for me! It isn’t super oily just very creamy and doesn’t smell like anything to me! I’ve been using it for like half a year and I still have so much left! I take it on trip and everything and is just perfect for me.I would highly recommend :))) Really liked it!
