I am obsessed with this product. A little goes along way. I have normal skin that can get dry if I slack on my skincare routine. This product is unscented so it does have a mildweird smell to it but it doesnâ€™t bother me in theleast and disappears nearly immediately. It hassaved my skin during summer in AZ and I knowafter applying my skin will be back tomoisturized and plumped immediately or thenext morning when applying at night. Highlyrecommend. In Love
