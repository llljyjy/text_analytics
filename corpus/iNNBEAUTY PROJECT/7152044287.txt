I absolutely love this moisturizer,  it’s so silky and hydrating. Has vitamin c and squalene which brightens and plumps my skin. The formula is very light too but once you apply it feels like a silk over your skin. I personally don’t like thick moisturizers and gel too. This formula is in between. Definitely going to repurchase it. And most importantly it’s fragrance free. Love this product
