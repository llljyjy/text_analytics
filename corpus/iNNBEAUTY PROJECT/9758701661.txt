I make a lot of mixtures (of SPF, foundation, moisturizers) for my complexion to save time and get custom finishes (sheered out foundation, more radiance, etc) and this a useful thing to have in my arsenal b/c it combines radiance with great hydrating / skin benefiting ingredients. I have had lots of trial sizes of other glowy primers / lotions (the Glam Glow, an Armani one etc) but never really found a spot for them in my routine b/c I didn’t want to add a whole step and didn’t feel like they were doing enough work on their own (like if they’re radiant but not hydrating enough to be my only moisturizer I can’t be bothered.) When my skin clears up a bit I think I’ll love wearing just this and SPF as my base. The vanilla scent gives me a little pause - I don’t mind scented lip stuff but something just feels gross to me about putting something vanilla scented all over my face. I have unknown fragrance allergies and it’s really hard for me to figure out whether something fragranced is or is not bothering my skin (I switch up my routine a lot and use a lot of actives) so I would much prefer to just avoid fragrance in skincare / complexion makeup all together and not have to wonder. I have used this a few times though with no obvious deal breaking irritation issues. Lovely product, wish it were fragrance free
