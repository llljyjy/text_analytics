I love this product! It is gentle and cooling on the skin. It applies very smoothly and absorbs quickly. I noticed a visible reduction in redness after the first use. I love how hydrating and nourishing it feels on the skin. Nothing but good things to say. Also, it does have a slightly herbaceous/grassy? smell to it but it is VERY subtle and fades quickly. I will continue to purchase for sure. nan
