I was gifted by INNBEAUTY Project to try out and have never had a retinol work this quickly and effectively! Normally with retinol my skin feels very dry and gets very irritated, this still worked great to get my skin to peel and remove acne scars, but it didnâ€™t leave any itching or burning. Also, can we talk about how cute this packaging is?? Not like other retinol
