This is a great starter skincare kit at a valuable price. Iâ€™ve been using it with me on the go, the size makes it perfect for travel. My skin is on the sensitive side and these products were gentle, it left my skin feeling more hydrated and soft. The packaging is also super cute. Thinking of gifting a couple to friends for the holidays! Hydrated skin
