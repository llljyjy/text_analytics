I love this moisturizer. I love that itâ€™s vegan, as someone who follows a plant based lifestyle I look for vegan beauty products as well! And this one is super hydrating! I have very dry skin because I live in an extremely cold climate and this moisturizer absorbs so well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and radiant! Definitely recommend! Vegan! And hydrating!
