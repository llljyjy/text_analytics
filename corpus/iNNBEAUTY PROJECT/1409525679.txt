This serum is pale green, has a watery jelly consistency, and smells like Green juice. It’s not especially moisturizing, which is fine, but I’ve seen zero positive change to my skin. I feel like my skin looks more dull and tired, possibly because of the s I stopped using in favor of trying this. I have been trying to finish it off for weeks. Bummed to see zero effect. Meh, no effect whatsoever
