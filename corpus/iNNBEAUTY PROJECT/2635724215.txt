This lip oil is my absolute favorite of any I have tried. Ever. It smells delicious like a caramel apple sucker if you have ever had one before. My forever cracked and dry lips are sooooooo soft since I started using this. Since I purchased it awhile ago I visited their site and purchased other flavors since only two are available at Sephora. I have candy cane, the mystery scent and berry jam. Berry jam has the most color followed by candy apple. Candy cane is clear with pretty red glitter and mystery scent changes its pink tone based on your pH. They are ALL amazing and really make your lips feel hydrated and smooth. The gloss effect is gorgeous as well. I have gotten almost all of my friends hooked and I donâ€™t think any of us will stop using these oils. You can tell from the photo how well loved my candy apple one is :) Addicted!
