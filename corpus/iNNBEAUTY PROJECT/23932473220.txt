I have been using iNNBEAUTY PROJECT Retinol Remix every night to aid in lessening the appearance of fine lines. I love that this is a clean, vegan formula that is healthy to apply to my face. The texture is a bit velvety, but lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly. There has been no irritation fortunately, and my skin looks overall clearer after use. I have skin on the drier side, so I appreciate the Centella and Hyaluronic acid to offset any retinol drying effect. Even though it typically takes awhile to see significant effects from retinol, this product is assisting my skin with appearing brighter. It contains tranexamic acid to assist with fading dark spots as well. Would recommend. nan
