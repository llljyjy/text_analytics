Love it. Truly. I’ve used every single moisturizer from this brand and this is tied in first place with Slushy. This product has not caused any adverse effects in my skin, no acne or sensitivity. It’s moisturizing without being heavy. The consistency isn’t a super thick cream, honestly it feels more like a gel cream hybrid which normally I hate because I have a tendency to hate gel moisturizers. But the consistency of this really is so light and so refreshing and yet still so effectively hydrating. And I have very dehydrated and dry skin. There is no overpowering sent to worry about either, which for me is a great plus. And I love that I can layer it with the slushy serum moisturizer if I really just want that tiny boost. I started using this moisturizer about 2 months ago day and night, and honestly my skin just looks and feels amazing. I use it in conjunction with glow recipes pore refining toner and their hyaluronic acid serum. All of these products seem to work well with each other oh, and I never have any pilling. I definitely recommend this. Absolutely love
