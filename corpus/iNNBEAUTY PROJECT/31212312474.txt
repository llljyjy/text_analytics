Overall, it surprised me. Due to my oily skin, most moisturizers I use tend to pill or just don’t help me at all. Because this is more of a serum, it sinks really well into my skin and leaves it feeling very soft. I use this in combination with retinol and vitamin C, and it has worked wonders for my skin in terms of softness. I am giving it 4 stars since it’s nothing game changing but for the price, it does its job really well and I am very satisfied. surprisingly good
