Wow, this serum is incredible! It is super easy to apply and doesn’t have an overpowering odor. I really love that it’s vegan and cruelty-free. I’m in my mid-20s and slowly trying out retinol to prevent fine lines and dark spots. I recommend only using it once a week if you’re new to retinol since it is a very strong reactive. You can work your way to 2 or 3 times a week once your skin gets used to it. And always wear your sunscreen the day after you use it! Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project In love!!!
