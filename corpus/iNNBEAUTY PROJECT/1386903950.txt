This is a great cleanser- it takes off and melts makeup right off and I like that it is clean. It does however sting eyes- so be careful to avoid the eye area. I would have loved if it was a little gentler on the eyes. Its a really nice liquid-y oil-y cleanser that melts makeup right off. I didnâ€™t feel like I needed more than one pump and I liked the neutral scent it has. Great cleanser
