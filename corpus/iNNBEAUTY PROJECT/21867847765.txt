I was so excited to try this when I read about the ingredients. I always find my skin needs a balance because often times a cleanser leaves me feeling dry and tight, but not this cleanser. I feel hydrated and soft to the touch. It helps remove my makeup effortlessly and hasnâ€™t at all irritated my skin. I really like it because a little goes a long way and it has such a thick lather. I enjoy this cleanser a lot. Remove makeup & dirt effortlessly
