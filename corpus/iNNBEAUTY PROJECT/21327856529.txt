This moisturizer has a nice lightweight creamy gel like texture. A dime size works well easily absorbing into my skin adding hydration, plumpness, bounce, and radiance. I like that this is a multitasking cream! My face feels replenished and looks much healthier. The texture of my skin is definitely feeling and looking smoother too. I highly recommend trying this day and night moisturizer. Great multitasking cream!
