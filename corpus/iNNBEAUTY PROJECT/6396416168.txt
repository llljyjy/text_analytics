I genuinely love this product and highly recommend it to anyone. I have normal to dry skin and it does not cling to dry patches on my skin like it does to some reviewers here. It definitely feels luxurious and gives you that radiant, not so shiny look - you can wear it on its own and can be worn as a makeup primer. It smells like baked goods to me when applied but you don’t smell it throughout the day which is a MAJOR PLUS for me. For foundation(s), I either wear the Fenty Soft Matte or the Too Faced Born This Way foundation - and it stayed on the whole day for me. For tinted moisturizers, I wear the Fenty eaze drop & PUR 4-in-1 tinted moisturizer and have also held up the whole day for me. The only downside is that for some reason when I use a Vitamin C serum IT PILLS. I’ve tried it without the Vitamin C serum and it worked fine - maybe it doesn’t mesh well with Vitamin C or the serums I have?? (I use the Naturium Vitamin C Complex Serum & Volition Beauty Strawberry-C Brightening Serum for reference). And I find that it is easier to apply right after your moisturizer. Overall, this product is wonderful! Paid my own money for this product. Honest review!
