Gifted by brand I am using Retinol Remix at Night time  and has seen some changes on my dark spots and hyperpigmentation. Yes its improved my uneven textured skin too. Plus point It doesn’t irritate and doesn’t dry out my skin as some retinol dry out skin so badly. It also Helps to soothe my skin. I like its an vegan product. nan
