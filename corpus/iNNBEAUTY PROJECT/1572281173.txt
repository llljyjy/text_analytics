I was gifted the retinol by Innbeauty Project to try and share my honest opinion. My skin is very sensitive to retinol so I am very varefulnwiyhnwhat I try. This appealed to me because it was vegan and only has 1% retinol. I can say that it absorbs well, has a very smooth and soft texture and leave my skin glowing. I tried it rge recommended every other day but tgst was still too much for me. I spread out mu usage and I’m much happier. While I didn’t have a terrible breakout like I’ve suffered in the past with other products, with limited use I’m still hopeful for positive results over time Beginner friend
