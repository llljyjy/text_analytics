Ooooh, this beauty just landed on my doorstep today and I was anxious to break into it right away. The texture, it’s that perfect texture between lightweight and thick. It’s just right. It sinks into my skin beautifully and leaves me with a healthy glow. My skin felt soft, bouncy and hydrated, ready to take on the day! I had no issues with pilling or interfering with any of my other products. I’m a big believer in using peptides and am so happy to see them on this formula. This is sure to be a top favorite of mine. And major kudos for the packaging! Sustainability! Recycle, recycle, recycle! Already a hit! Possibly my new favorite?
