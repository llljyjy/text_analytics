Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project in exchange for review. I am a regular retinol user, so I was excited for this new blend. After using this for two weeks, I haven’t noticed any improvement in my skin. In fact, I have noticed more breakouts. Nothing significant, but I hardly ever breakout. I don’t think it’s fair to say it’s the products fault because I know skincare can take a month or so to take effect, but based on this initial use I don’t think I’d recommend it. nan
