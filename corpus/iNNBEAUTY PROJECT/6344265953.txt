I like this product, does it’s job! I’ve noticed less redness and my pimples do seem to decrease in size overnight after putting it on. Super easy to put on by the way! But it is a bit difficult to remove without washing your face. Product is decent in my opinion and will recommend for the occasional breakout! nan
