I really have been loving this cleanser. I love a gel cleanser but find they don’t remove makeup so usually use an oil cleanser first as a makeup remover and then a gel. This one works as both. It lathers on the face without water and breaks down my makeup and then foams up once water is added. My dry skin doesn’t feel stripped from it either. Removes makeup
