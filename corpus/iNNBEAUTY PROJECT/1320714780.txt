I have rosacea and dry skin but it also breaks out. I also struggle with needing some anti-aging help. I was skeptical but this cream is amazing! I use it in combination with my Paulaâ€™s choice oil boost and I wake up with dewy beautiful skin. It does not aggravate my rosacea at all. Super happy to finally find something my skin can tolerate. I would just rather it in a pump versus jar for sanitary reasons. super moisturizing!
