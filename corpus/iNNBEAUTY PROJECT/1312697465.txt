At 40, I don’t often have severely blemished skin. But after trying out a new foundation, I received horrible cystic acne on my cheek. After a month, they hadn’t gotten worse but they hadn’t gotten better. I went to Sephora and walked out with this product. As soon as I got home I washed my face and immediately put it on, removing it the next morning. I have never seen a spot treatment product work so fast! These huge, deep, cystic pimples had dramatically reduced. I am now five days in, and you can barely see them. I will never be without this product for those rare  monthly pop-ups. immediate results!
