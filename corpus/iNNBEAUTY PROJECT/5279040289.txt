This brand has received a lot of great reviews so I thought I’d start with this serum/moisturizer. I use a vitamin c serum before moisturizer so this product is a 2-in-1 for me. However, it is so light that it doesn’t leave skin feeling moisturized so I definitely need to also follow up with a moisturizer, especially in the winter. Otherwise it is okay. not enough moisture
