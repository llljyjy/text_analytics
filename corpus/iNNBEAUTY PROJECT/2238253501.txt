After applying all the products from the Healthy Skin Edit, my skin looked refreshed and felt supple. The cleanser (Keep It Clean) applies smoothly, but you need a significant amount of water to really activate the product. The cleanser has a barely there smell and leaves my skin feeling prepped and cleansed for the following steps. The serum (Green Machine) has a thin jelly feel, not sticky,  and left skin feeling plumped. The serum moisturizer (Slushy) at first was watery, so shake it up a bit. This product shocked me in the sense that it is a multi-purpose product with phenomenal ingredients. At first I thought Slushy was an extra step, but this is the product that gave my skin a dewy look. The moisturizer (10 + 10 More-sturizer) left my skin feeling protected and soft. This is a great value for the price and my skin looked more hydrated after using it. I would recommend and I will continue using these products! Loving this kit! Great gift option too.
