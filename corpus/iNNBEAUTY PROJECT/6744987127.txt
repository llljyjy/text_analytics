A great option for moisturizer! I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this one is a solid option! Gives your skin a plump, hydrated look with just one or two uses. I’ve seen a difference in my skin with that! I have more oily skin and it’s not too greasy, but soaks into the skin nicely! Highly recommend. Solid Moisturizer!
