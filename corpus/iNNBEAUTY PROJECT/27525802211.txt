I can’t tolerate the smell of this! It’s a really overpowering scent. It smells like herbs and I can’t keep this on my face for a long time. It wasn’t a pleasant experience using this product for me, just because of the scent alone. I did not really notice a difference after I wiped this product off my skin. Terrible herbal scent
