I was very excited to try the gifted by Innbeauty Project Retinol Remix 1% Vegan Retinol Treatment with Peptide & Tranexamic Acid and was not disappointed. I love that this formula first off is 1% vegan retinol so it is strong and it’ll help with fine lines, wrinkles, dullness, uneven texture, loss of firmness, and dark spots too so a vast variety of skin issues. You’ll start to see results fast because of it being strong and I’m very happy with the results and fading in dark spots on my skin and feeling smoother as well. I feel this retinol is gentle, I did not experience any irritation or anything of the sort using it daily. It has a very lightweight texture as well that easily absorbs into your skin. I also love that this is a clean product so I feel good about using it too and the packaging is super cute as a side note. Strong and effective
