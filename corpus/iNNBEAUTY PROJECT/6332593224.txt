This cleanser is super hydrating. The first time I used it I used 2 pumps which was way too much yet it didnâ€™t leave my skin dry or leave any weird texture behind. The times after that I used one pump which is sufficient enough because it foams really well. It left my skin feeling clean and visibly brighter which I loved. Definitely one of the better cleansers on the market! nan
