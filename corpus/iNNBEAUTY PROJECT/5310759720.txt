This is a nice light serum that hydrates. If you have really dry skin like me you might want to opt for something a little bit heavier that will soak into your skin and keep it hydrated for the entire day. Pairing with a thicker moisturizer is nice for bed, but it still feels like it doesn’t trap as much moisture as I’d like. Nice but probably wouldn’t buy again. nan
