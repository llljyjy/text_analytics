I have very fair, sensitive combo skin that is prone to redness. Initially I liked this and used up about half the bottle, but I noticed I started getting really red and breaking out on my cheeks around week 3 or 4. The fragrance is extremely strong (and my skin usually hates fragrance) so I’m assuming that’s the issue. Sad because I really like so many of the ingredients in this, but it needs to be reformulated. Why add fragrance? Not for sensitive skin
