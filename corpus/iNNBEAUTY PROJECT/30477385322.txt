This is a pretty good cleanser, but I don’t know if there’s anything all that special about it, in my opinion. I’ve used it for both regular cleansing and makeup removal- the method for makeup removal does actually need a bit of water, otherwise it’s way too dry to actually do anything, but the regular cleansing method works great and gets very sudsy! It did a decent job of removing makeup, but like I said, it does require a few splashes of water while massaging. I have dry skin and still got that “tight” feeling after using this cleanser, so I’ll probably stick to cream cleansers, but this is a good backup for makeup removal. Skin still felt tight and dry
