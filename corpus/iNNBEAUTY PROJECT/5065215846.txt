To start, the packaging is so cute which you always have to stop and appreciate. Secondly, it is actually a great moisturizer. It is light but goes on nourishing, making your skin feel extra hydrated. I go back and forth between a heavier moisturizer and a lighter one and this may have taken place of my lighter one for the upcoming months. Definitely worth a try. Light + Bouncy
