Honestly, I love this brand, but this product is not my favorite. After wearing the moisturizer for about an hour, it started to get cakey then rub + peel off. It might be good to sleep in, but definitely do not wear it under your makeup unless you want a chunky makeup look :/ However, I do like that the product is fragrance free. Okay fragrance free moisturizer alternative
