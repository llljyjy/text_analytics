This kit by Healthy Skin Edit has everything you need for a healthy complexion! The products are great for travel too. I have combo skin so this kit works great for my skin. I love the clean hydrating gel cleanser. It leaves my skin so soft. I follow that with the vitamin c serum which leaves my skin looking glowey. The slushy serum adds that extra glow to my skin as well. If you have combo or dry skin you are going to love this kit. The 10+10 Daily Moisturizer leaves your skin very soft. A little of the moisturizer goes a long way. Great for travel!
