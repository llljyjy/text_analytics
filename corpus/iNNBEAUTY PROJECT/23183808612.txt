Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project. Iâ€™m usually a double cleanse type of gal,  but this has proved me wrong so far! It did a great job of removing makeup although my eyeliner and mascara took a little bit longer to remove. However this did a great job otherwise and left my face feeling refreshed afterwards. nan
