INNBEAUTY Project gifted me their Retinol Remix.. It’s lightweight, the texture is kinda creamy and runny.. It’s easy to spread and blend smoothly.. This product is very hydrating and my dry and sensitive skin loving it.. It doesn’t sting, it doesn’t burn and it doesn’t makes me feel uncomfortable.. Im using it every other night on the first week and every night the next week I don’t get any irritation at all.. I’m noticing my pimple marks starting to fade.. Im waking up every morning with glowing and hydrated skin.. I really think that I look younger and feel younger.. My skin feels softer, smoother and plumper.. My favorite retinol so far.. My new favorite!
