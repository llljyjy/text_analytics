This is the BEST lip oil/gloss I have ever used. I have a huge collection of glosses and always find myself coming back to this one. It is not sticky and stays on for so long. It makes my lips look so plump, healthy, and shiny. When it’s gone my lips are actually softer. The color is perfect and I think would look good on every skin tone. It’s your lips but better and beats any high end lip oil I’ve bought. I wear it all year round but wearing it in the summer when I am more tan, I get so many compliments. PERFECT
