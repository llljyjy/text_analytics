i used this retinol for a week straight, and i experienced no irritation whatsoever. i am an experienced user with retinol so that’s probably why i didn’t experience any irritation or purging. i noticed my breakouts were clearing up quicker than usual. overall, i enjoyed the product!  (gifted by INNBEAUTY project) super gentle for sensitive skin
