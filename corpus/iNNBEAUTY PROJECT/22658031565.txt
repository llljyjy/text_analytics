I absolutely love everything about this product, from the fragrance and the packaging to how deeply hydrating this is, particularly on dry winter skin. My profession requires me to wash my hands very frequently, and as a result, my hands sometimes become dry. With this, I can keep my skin plump, hydrated, and firm without having to worry about the drying effects of alcohol and soaps on my hands. Great For Hands Too!
