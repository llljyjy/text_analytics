This is the best vegan retinol I have found that actually does what it says.It goes on your face perfect leaving the skin feeling very light not greasy. A pea size amount goes along way. It covers my face and neck. If you cant afford to go to a dermatologist and get a higher percent of retinol then just start using this 1% retinol and see what it does for you. Highly recommended.
