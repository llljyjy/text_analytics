Iâ€™m loving this moisturizer! As always INNBEAUTY has the cutest packaging. The smell of this moisturizer is very light, not much at all which is great. My skin feels so soft and smooth after applying this and not at all sticky, which is sometimes an issue for me. I have combo skin and would recommend this! Lovely!
