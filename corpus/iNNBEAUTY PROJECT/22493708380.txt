This product was gifted by Inn Beauty Project in exchange for my honest review. I really like this cleanser! I personally wouldnâ€™t use it to remove my makeup as I prefer to go in with a cleansing balm to do that, but this is a great second step for me with a really enjoyable consistency. It does have a bit of a scent to just be aware of that if you are sensitive. Great second cleanse
