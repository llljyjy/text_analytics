This product didn’t really improve my skin, but it also didn’t make it worse. I have very oily and sensitive skin. I used this product after toner, but before moisturizer. It didn’t have a scent to it and applied smoothly (I do like the squeeze applicator). After applying, it felt sticky on my face. It never made my skin look super clear, but I do think it helped add an extra boost of hydration. I won’t be repurchasing, mostly because of the price and the fact that it didn’t improve my skin over time. nan
