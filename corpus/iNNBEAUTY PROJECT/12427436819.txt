This serum gifted me by innbeauty in exchange of my honest review. I used this serum for about 15 days and I saw huge different in my skin dark spots that remained after acnes. It smoothed my fine lines and changed overall my skin texture. I found this serum very good one specially with the price it has I can compare it with luxury and high price products in the market. I would definitely buy this once I runout of this bottle. I feel more moisturizer and brighter skins I do recommend Good and affordable serum
