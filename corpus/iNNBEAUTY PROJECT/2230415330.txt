Since I started using this face glaze, Iâ€™ve been getting so many compliments on my skin and people asking for my skincare regimen! It gives off a beautiful natural glow as the product has a soft shimmer in it and applies so smoothly. I compared the texture after applying to half my face and can say that it truly feels more moisturized and bouncy that the other half! It makes your complexion look so radiant that I normally wear it instead of foundation and it feels way better on my skin. If you wear foundation regularly, you also also wear it as a primer to give your foundation and extra oomph! Perfect for a soft radiant glow!
