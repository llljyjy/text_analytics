I have dry, extremely sensitive skin and have tried La Mer (horrible smell and horrible ingredients), Augustinus Bader (amazing and use at night still), Drunk Elephant, Sunday Riley, Tatcha, Caudelie (literally most brands at Sephora) and NONE compare to the affordability and results of this one. Itâ€™s sinks in for me but keeps my skin glowing and plump all day. Miracle worker. I like to use this line for the day and love the slushy and green machine and retinol remix as well. No breakouts at all since switching to this. Used to have chin pimples all the time but fragrance free is key to getting rid of them for me. Also got rid of dry patches and texture. Always going to repurchase! One of the Best moisturizers on the market!
