The only other iNNBEAUTY PROJECT product I have used is the dual-phase face mist, and I absolutely loved that product. That’s why I picked up this moisturizer. However, my biggest problem is that it only lasted me one month without being a phenomenal moisturizer. I have very normal skin, and I enjoying using a moisturizer at night that will make my skin appear more glowy, but this was very dull. I would say it’s a very average moisturizer, and for the price I would pick something else that had more product. I’m not even sure if I would recommend this as a day cream because it would make more sense to pick a moisturizing sunscreen. As for the amount, I’m not sure if the tube I had was underfilled, but I used the same amount, about the size of a quarter, approximately 3-4 times a week and it was empty in 30 days. nan
