I was gifted by INNBEAUTY Project their Face Glaze Skin Barrier & Glow Moisturizer and it has quickly become one of my favorite beauty products! It is truly so diverse and can be used so many ways! I love using it as a primer so an extra glowy finish, mixed in with foundation to create a beautiful skin tint, and as a subtle highlighter over makeup for a very natural glow! This face glaze is very moisturizing and doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin either! Highly recommend! Very diverse!
