The product itself is amazing and does wonders for my sensitive dry skin. Consistency is perfect! Not too light, not too heavy. Skin feels hydrated and moisturized since I started using it! Love the ingredients list! The product does brighten my skin in a noticeable way.  The redness of my tone has decreased and cleared up a lot of my blemishes.  I would recommend this product. Love this moisturizer
