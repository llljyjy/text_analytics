Iâ€™ve tried a variety of different moisturizers and this one is one of the best. Super thick and moisturizing but also has some great ingredients for your skin. It reminds me a lot of the Skinfix peptide moisturizer but is much more affordable. This has become a staple in my skincare routine. *gifted by InnBeauty* New fav moisturizer
