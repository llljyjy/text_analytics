I really enjoy this cleanser! It’s very delicate but it does a great job at removing any traces of makeup I have left. My skin feels very soft and clean after I use it, it doesn’t make my skin dry, which is a huge plus. The fragrance is very subtle, kind of refreshing. One or two pumps is enough for the whole face, so it’s going to last me a while. nan
