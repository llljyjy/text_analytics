I love this moisturizer! I just wish it came in a larger container because I feel it runs out quicker than other moisturizers. It sinks in quickly and leaves skin feeling plump, smooth, and firm. No greasiness. It makes my skin feel similar to Drunk Elephant Protini with a much better price point. nan
