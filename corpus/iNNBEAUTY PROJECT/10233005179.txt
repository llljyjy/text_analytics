I am obsessed with this face glaze complimentary from InnBeauty! My skin looks naturally dewy and gives the perfect glow. Normally my skin can look kinda dull and drained but it looks refreshed and I’m literally glowing after using the face glaze! It’s lightweight and feels just like a moisturizer.  My skin feels so soft and hydrated and it’s super easy to apply. It goes on smoothly making it impossible to miss a spot! I’d definitely recommend. I added a before and after where you can see the difference it makes! nan
