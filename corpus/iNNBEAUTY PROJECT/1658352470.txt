I have combination skin with the area around my lips super dry and my t zone being oily. I get blemishes usually on my cheeks that turn into lasting hyperpigmentation. I decided to add this serum to see if extra hydration would improve my skin. Since using this product, the texture of my skin has noticeably changed. Itâ€™s plump, moisturized, and smooth. My hyperpigmentation has absolutely reduced, as has my occurrences of blemishes. When I do get a blemish, it heals much quicker. This is the only thing I have changed in my routine. I add this serum after my face wash and before my lotion. (I use first aid beauty face wash & the it cosmetics face lotion)I love this stuff!! life changing!!
