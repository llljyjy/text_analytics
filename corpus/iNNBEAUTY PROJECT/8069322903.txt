This is the first product I’ve try from this brand, it’s gifted by innbeauty and I really like it, I have dry skin so everything dewy and glow I love, I like this particular product because it’s glow but not greasy, and I feel like it really smooth out my skin, has a slightly fresh smell ,I see myself using it more for primer and mixing it with my more matte foundation ✨ really like the glow ✨
