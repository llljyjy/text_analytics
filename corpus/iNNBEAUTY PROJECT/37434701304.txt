Normally I’m not picky with cleansers but I’m actually really enjoying this! I love that the fragrance is minimal and my skin doesn’t feel dry or stripped after use. But I do feel like it cleans effectively. The only thing it doesn’t remove on its own is my waterproof mascara but I always have to double cleanse to remove it so it wasn’t an expectation. Definitely a new fav cleanser! A wonderful new cleanser
