I always have to double or triple cleanse to get off a full face of makeup - usually a balm first and then a foaming cleanser after - but this product takes everything off in ONE pass. When I swipe with toner on a cotton pad after there are no remnants of makeup on that pad which is just insane! Is this made with MAGIC?!
