The INNBEAUTY Project gifted me their Retinol Remix. It is 1% retinol and it is awesome that it is vegan. Iâ€™ve tried various retinol products with various results. I like that this one says even for practiced users to take a day off to help avoid irritation. I like this remix with the added peptides, hyaluronic acid, and other ingredients to form one great anti-aging product. I have been using this in my nightly routine. It applies well and I have started to see some improvements in my fine lines and skin overall. great overall anti-aging product
