I was literally in the store looking for a few items and this gentleman helped me look for an alternative because they don’t sell what I was looking for in store. He recommended this item which I’ve never heard of but it works fabulous. The idea kind of came from toothpaste. This item is so clean and owned by women. Which I love. And the item works so well and for the price, it’s so affordable. I use it every night and it tingles and kills away all my acne and makes my skin beautiful. I wish I had a before picture but here is an after picture. Look at how clear my skin is Can’t beat the price.
