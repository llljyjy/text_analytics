It really does help break up the makeup and completely washed away my eyeliner, unlike some other cleansers that leaves some residue. It does however leave the dry areas of my cheek a little dry, but nothing like a little moisturizer can’t fix. The rest of my face didn’t feel or look dry since I have combination skin. I like the amount you get, the pump dispenser and the gel texture. Great face wash. nan
