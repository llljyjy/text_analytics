i bought this with my own money at my local sephora during the spring sale. i genuinely love this product. i have used to for one night, and it was recommended by a sales associate there. i hadâ€¦ low expectations. i thought this was gonna be an AWFUL product after reading the reviews but i had 500 points and it was the cheapest one i found.the ingredients are great. i personally apply this over my yttp mandelic acid and i woke up with my blemishes faded. like they were honestly gone!! i love this product and how fast it acted. also applied it over dark spots and they also faded.well done innbeauty! surprised
