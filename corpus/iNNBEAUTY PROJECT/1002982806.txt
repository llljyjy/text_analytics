This was gifted by INNBEAUTY project.  I tried this product out slowly 3 days/week, I liked it, it did not dry out my skin, it actually helped with the water retention and hydration in my skin. I added a ceramide cream on top and it was great! I am going to start upping the dose so I can lighten my hyperpigmentation. I am still getting use to the only a pea size amount which in this product is 1 pump! Great product
