Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project. This serum has a very interesting texture, it’s not runny at all. It’s more of a jelly consistency and had a green color to it. I apply four drops onto my face and massage it in. It sinks into my skin nicely and layers well with my other skin care products. My skin looks hydrated and soothed after using it. nan
