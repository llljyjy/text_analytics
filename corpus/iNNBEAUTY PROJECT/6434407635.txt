I am always interested in trying new products and this one did not disappoint. The consistency oof this oil jelly serum is so nice and light, it is perfect for then summer. I have combination skin and I found it helped so much with hydration and brightening. I love the price point too -- so nice getting a quality product for under $35. I have very sensitive skin and I really liked how gentle yet effective this product is. This was gifted by INNBEAUTY Project love the green machine!
