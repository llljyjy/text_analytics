This is the most luxurious moisturizer Iâ€™ve ever tried! It is so silky and thick but yet it still feels very lightweight on my skin, absorbs quickly and is so hydrating. It is not greasy or sticky and really melts right into my skin. The ingredients in this are really impressive - between the vitamin c & peptides I feel like this compares to some of the top moisturizers on the market but like for literally half of the price. Would def recommend!! So luxe
