I bought this on a whim because it’s a little cheaper than my usual moisturizer (skin fix) and I have to say, I’m more than impressed and surprised by this product. My skin is SO soft from it, doesn’t look oily (which skin fix makes me looks like) and it doesn’t pill when I put my sunscreen on after. I like the innisfree one and I’ve had troubles with it before but both products together are flawless. Also love that it has vitamin c in it already. I’m cautious of using it when I use actives and haven’t tried it with my acids but it’s a small price to pay. Overall I highly recommend this product! give her a try
