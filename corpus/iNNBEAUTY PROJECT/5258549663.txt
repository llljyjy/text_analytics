*Complimentary from INNBEAUTY* I was always scared to try retinol because I have super sensitive skin. I started off using it about twice week, and after a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin texture and dark spots on my face! The texture was so silk and soft and easily melted into my skin. Iâ€™m so excited to continue using this! nan
