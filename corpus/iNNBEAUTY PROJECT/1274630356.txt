I’ve been enjoying this cleanser. It has a gel texture and creates a rich lather, but feels gentle on the skin. And it easily removes all my face makeup. Left behind a little eye makeup-didn’t sting my eyes though. After rinsing, my skin looks clean, smooth, and bright. And doesn’t feel dry or tight. nan
