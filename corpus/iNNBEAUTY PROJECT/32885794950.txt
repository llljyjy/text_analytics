I just wanna say I feel like a princess when I use this moisturizer, because of how amazing it leaves my skin feeling. The winter & weather where I live is so dry & has my skin struggling but this has been such a lifesaver. I already feel like it’s even made my hyperpigmentation way better, my skin feels smoother, more lifted and firm which I love coz who wants wrinkles, lol. I use it on a daily basis and sometimes as a base for my makeup too because it’s just that good and keeps my makeup in place. I can’t say enough good things about it! It’s a must have! There’s no way you won’t love it!
