InnBeauty is one of my discoveries for 2022 and I love all of their products . This eye cream is no exception. I love the airless pump bottle. The cream itself is tinted though it doesn’t really give any pigment to the skin. Once blended, it gives glow to the skin, and while it doesn’t seem like much, I can see a huge difference in my Hyundai look when I apply this cream to one eye and not the other. The texture is lightweight, but it has substance and works well for me even in cold weather. I think this eye cream would be amazing all year round. nan
