I was gifted InnBeautys new Keep it Clean cleanser.  And it’s just that a clean powerful cleanser.  I typically don’t like gel cleanser because I feel they don’t lather or wash well, this is not the case with Keep it Clean. One pump gives a nice lather that removes stubborn makeup easily and effortlessly.  There is no scent and it washes off easily.  I do feel it leaves my face a little dry after washing but that’s what face lotion is for. Clean cleanser for everyday wash
