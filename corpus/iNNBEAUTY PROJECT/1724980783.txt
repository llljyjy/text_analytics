Innbeauty Project gifted me this moisturizer and I’m so in love!! While I’ve heard of the brand, it’s my first time trying them, and I was not disappointed.   First off, the packaging is so adorable and fun.  Secondly, I was very pleased with the application-- it applied smoothly and easily and instantly gave my skin a nice little glow!  On top of that, I also felt refreshed and hydrated after application.  It looks great by itself or as a primer if you want that subtle, natural glow under your makeup!  Definitely something I’ll be adding into my Summer skincare routine, highly recommend it! So in love!
