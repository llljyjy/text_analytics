I am someone who, as soon as it gets cold and dry out in the winter, needs to completely overhaul their routine to something excessively moisturizing and hydrating, otherwise my skin will get tight, ashy, and flaky. Therefore I tend to gravitate more towards thicker, humectant creams that preserve my moisture barrier throughout the day. InnBeauty’s 10+10 More-sturizer is a perfect selection for the winter months for me. It feels amazing—my face soaks it up, lol. It’s not greasy, though, and you can layer it with other products under and over and not have any product pilling. Plus it’s unscented! It’s a little pricey for the size in my opinion but you get great value and a little goes a long way with this one. Perfect for the winter months
