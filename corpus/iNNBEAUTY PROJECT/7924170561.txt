I have very dry skin and wear makeup regularly, although this cleanser did not take off my mascara it successfully took off my base makeup (for waterproof makeup and mascaras i’d still use a cleansing balm). I’m used to cleansers leaving my skin feeling stripped and dry and this cleanser didn’t do that at all. I would really recommend this product especially to my dry skin girlies or girlies that wear makeup and would like to not double cleanse everyday! great for dry skin and makeup girlies
