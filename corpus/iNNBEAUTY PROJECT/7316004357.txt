Complimentary from Innbeauty Project. I love the 90’s vibe I’m getting with the look of the packaging and bottle. The texture feels like a creamy and thin facial serum. It’s a lightweight formula that absorbs into the skin quickly. I love that the formula is clean and vegan. It applys nicely without any sticky residue or flakiness. I tend to have sensitive skin, and this felt really soothing. I love using this in my nighttime skincare routine three times a week so far. My skin feels so nourished and healthy after using it. Overall, I would recommend this for retinol beginners & those with sensitive skin because this has calming ingredients. So soothing and makes my skin feel more plump.
