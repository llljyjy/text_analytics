I got to try the Retinol Remix complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project and I’m loving it! As far as a retinol goes, it’s really gentle, while still being effective and prioritizing great ingredients. This is very different from other retinol formulations I’ve tried in the past - and I particularly love the other ingredients that are included in this formula. It has a really nice almond scent that doesn’t linger and it is thin and easy to spread around. This sinks into the skin really well! I not new to retinols, so use this 3-4x/week and so far I love it! I Will update my review in a few weeks to go over the improvements I’ve noticed. Amazing gentle formula
