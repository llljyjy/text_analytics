I really love the way this product absorbs into your skin without leaving a greasy residue, especially with my oily skin.  I am also acne prone so I was happy this didn’t break me out although it does contain oil.  However, doesn’t last that long (1 bottle lasted me about 1 month using it once a day), and I didn’t see a noticeable improvement in my skim. nan
