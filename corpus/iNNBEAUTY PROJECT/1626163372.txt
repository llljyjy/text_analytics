This is my first experience with INNBEAUTY and I liked this lotion! It doesn’t feel heavy, but it is moisturizing. I used it only at night, so I’m unsure if it would do well under makeup. I did, however, wake up with a moisturized face which is great! The winters are harsh in the Midwest and I could see myself using this again! My skin appears stronger, which is great because I am on the tail end of Accutane. Any moisturizer that could help my skin now is good in my book! nan
