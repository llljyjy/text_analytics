I received this complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project for my honest review. A great daily moisturizer for parched skin! This is a buttery formula that sinks into the skin and leaves you with a plump and dewy look. It’s very rich so I would suggest for normal to dry skin types or for those like myself with oilier skin that needs something more occlusive in this dry air. It’s a nice formula but only a seasonal product for me. Great For Dry Skin!
