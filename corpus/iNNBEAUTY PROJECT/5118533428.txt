I saw someone rave about this on Tiktok and since the Dior oil is out of stock I decided to buy it. Ive never tried the Dior oil but this does everything I wanted the Dior to do for half the price! The color is so pretty and it’s nice and shiny. Perfect for no makeup days. I don’t think the smell is overpowering at all, and I’m sensitive to fragrance. It’s a little sticky so more of a gloss but I don’t like how oils feel anyway. The packaging is fun too. nan
