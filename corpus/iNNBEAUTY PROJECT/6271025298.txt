also youre paying 34$ for a moisturizer, moisturizers have one job and thats to stop/slow doen TEWL, the main ingredients are water, glycerin (humectants) and occlusives (shea butter and silicones). you can find that anywhere and like another reviewer stated the shea butter is high up on the list which could be problematic if youre prone to acne. I also feel its shady the brand hypes up the inclusion of ceramides but they only have  one in this formula when theres a specific ratio of ceramides needed in skincare for them to even work, i believe the only product that has the correct ratio is the moisturizer from a brand called skinceuticals. i will say it does feel light and smooth (siliones) and it dries down to a satin finish and then later on my face gets dewy but it really isnt worth $34 doesnt have correct ration of ceramides
