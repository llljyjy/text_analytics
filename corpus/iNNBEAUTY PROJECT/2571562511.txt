This was gifted to me by innbeauty  project to try all opinions are my own! If you are not using a retinol product in your skin care routine you are at 100% missing out! I have fairly sensitive skin at times and I had no issue integrating listen to my routine! I always have some sort of product with retinol in my routine because the improvements it has made are insane! This one particular absorbs into the skin nicely, didn’t irritate my skin at all and absolutely instantly makes my skin look brighter! I’ve noticed over time that my skin tone really evens out when I have retinol in my routine. Definitely would recommend Retinol is a must have
