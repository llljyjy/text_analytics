I have combination skin, so I love using gel cleansers. This one is absolutely fantastic. I can use it like a regular cleanser in the AM, and I can use it on dry skin to take off my makeup in the PM. My skin always feels hydrated and clean when I use it, and I haven’t been breaking out! This is my new favorite gel cleanser, it works so much better than any of the others I’ve tried. INNBEAUTY Project gifted me this cleanser, all opinions are my own. Great for combination skin
