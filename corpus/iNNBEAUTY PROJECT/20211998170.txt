This is the one product I have ever found that I will rave about. I have combo/oily skin and struggle with acne, scarring, oiliness and texture. After two weeks of use this has my skin feeling flawless, plump and hydrated. I feel confident to leave the house without makeup and feel like I am glowing. I am not sure why this is so good, the ingredient list did not wow me but the product is UNBEATABLE. The most notable unique quality is the texture. The oil and waterbased phases are a great combo. I am often dehydrated but heavy creams make me greasy. This is the perfect solution!In my routine I use this after Dr. Brandtâ€™s Pore Cleanser, then this serum, then the Honey Halo Farmacy moisturizer. I hope this gives you as much confidence as it gives me! Miracle product
