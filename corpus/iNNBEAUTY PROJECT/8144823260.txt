Finding a good moisturizer especially now in the winter months to keep my dryness under control is sometimes a struggle. So I’ve been trying 10 + 10 moisturizer for several days now. The difference that I can tell is that my skin felt  hydrated & glowy. I didn’t consider it to be a thick cream & a little bit goes a long way.  Being a clean product is a plus. I would definitely switch my current moisturizer for this one. My skin is silky smooth
