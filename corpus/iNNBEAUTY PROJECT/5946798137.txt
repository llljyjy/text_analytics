I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and overall I really like it. I can definitely see improvement in my skin, even in such a short time. I’m taking off one star because I have had issues with it pilling. I think I’ve figured out that it happens when I use too much (a tiny bit goes a long way!) or when my skin isn’t thoroughly cleansed. Overall the pros outweigh the cons, but I hope they’ll tweak the formula in the future to address this issue. Less is more!
