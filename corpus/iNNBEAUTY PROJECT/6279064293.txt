Complimentary from INNBEAUTY  Project. First let’s start off with how much I love the super cute packaging ! The pink and baby blue go well together and are definitely appealing. I love how the product information is displayed on the bottle, it is definitely user friendly and very easy to follow. There is essentially no scent to the retinol and it’s formula easily absorbs into skin. I’m new to retinol and didn’t notice any irritation. I used only a pea sized amount on my forehead, cheeks, and chin. I am only using twice a week so that I can get used to such a potent ingredient. This product is both vegan and cruelty free which I absolutely love. I love that this product contains both centella asiatica and German chamomile. Both of these ingredients help soothe and calm redness.  I can’t wait to see what this product will do for me in the next 4-6 weeks ! Love the formula and packaging
