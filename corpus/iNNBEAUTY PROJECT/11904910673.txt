Gifted by INNBEAUTY project. I’ve been really liking this new retinol remix! It’s gentle enough on my skin where I can use it twice a week without irritation. (I would say I’m about intermediate level in tolerance.) Honestly pleasantly surprised by how effective it was— skin always felt smoother in the morning. Haven’t seen significant results yet for more stubborn hyperpigmentation, but it does subtly even out my skin tone overall. Fair pricing for a retinoid. Gentle & Effective
