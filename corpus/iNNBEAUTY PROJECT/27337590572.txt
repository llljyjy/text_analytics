This lip oil is SO GOOD and so slept on!! Before I bought this, I was really apprehensive about the red tint of the oil, but now it’s my favorite shade of lip gloss ever! It smells amazing, leaves a hydrating, sheer red tint on your lips that lasts ages even under a mask. It never gets outside of your lip lines and fills in any natural creases of the lips, making them look so juicy and plump. I’ve never finished a lip gloss so quickly! I hope sephora will carry the rest of the shades of this soon!! I’d love to try more shades! BEST. LIP OIL. EVER.
