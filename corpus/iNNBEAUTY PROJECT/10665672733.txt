I’ve been suffering with hormonal acne for the pass year and have some dark marks from my scars. This has really help fade them away. It has helped my skin look brighter and luminous. I have used a couple different retinol but so far this one is the most light weight in my opinion. It absorbs into the skin with out leaving it sticky like other retinols. I use at night time, the next morning my skin looks so much smoother and I can visually see how it helps my fade my scars. Love the fact that they’re clean vegan and effective. Definitely recommend. Complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project. Non sticky absorbs well into the skin
