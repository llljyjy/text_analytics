I was so pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer! The texture is incredibly smooth, creating a hydrated natural glow. It helped make my skin look radiant when used alone bur also gave makeup application an extra boost of luminosity without being too shiny. With combination skin, i worried this would make me too glowy but it has the perfect balance. *gifted by INNBEAUTY Project in exchange for my honest review* Glow On Baby
