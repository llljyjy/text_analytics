Obsessed with lip oil! It’s a translucent icy soft pink color on the lips, so pretty! When you hear oil you think thin but this has a little body to it. Not as thick or sticky like a gloss but definitely not thin and watery like an oil. Personally I prefer a thicker lip oil so it doesn’t run all over my face and this is the perfect consistency! It feels cushiony on the lips, stays on for hours and leaves my lips so moisturized! The only thing I could do without is the scent. It’s a little too sweet for me but it disappears quickly so still definitely a winner! OBSESSED
