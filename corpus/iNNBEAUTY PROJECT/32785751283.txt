This product went on incredibly smooth and was very easy to work into my skin! U could feel an immediate pluming sensation once completely worked into the skin. I absolutely felt hydrated but the product never dried down so it also had a slight oily effect to my skin witch was okay because I have dry skin. Makeup was able to sit on top of the product with no issue and my skin still had a gorgeous glow to it. The overall glow it gave my skin was gorgeous and I actually just wore as is with a little mascara and I felt great all day! Gifted to me by INNBEAUTY PEOJECT Very lovely
