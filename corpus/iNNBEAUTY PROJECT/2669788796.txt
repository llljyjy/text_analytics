I have been wanting to try the Dior lip oil but not for the price and impulse added this to my cart during the sale. It’s.. ok? I’m not sure what I was expecting. It doesn’t add much color to my lips but provides shine. Thicker than the Merit lip oil but not sticky like a gloss (doesn’t leave much residue on my mask). The applicator is nice and it is moderately hydrating but I’m not a fan of the sweet smell. It reminds me of jolly ranchers. Personally, I would prefer minimally or unscented. It’s ok - not a fan of scent
