This is my new favorite sunscreen to use everyday. It makes my face so glowy after applying, and wears so nicely under my makeup and throughout the day. By glowy, I mean dewy and shiny, so if that isn’t your thing then this is not the lotion for you. My skin is normal to dry and it feels so nice with this sunscreen, I love touching my face at the end of the night, it’s so soft.Complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project. LOVE IT
