I was gifted this for free in Exchange for an honest review. First off I love the colors of this packaging it makes it so much more fun and adds a fun element to skin care which can sometimes become a little bit to scientific. What I love the most about this product is that it offers more than one benefit to it I also love that it makes it easy because it can be used in the morning or at night sometimes I get a little bit overwhelmed with all of the different products that I can use and when is the best time to use them. nan
