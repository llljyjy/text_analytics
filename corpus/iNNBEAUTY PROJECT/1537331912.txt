I love this stuff. Smells great and not too strong plus it really has controlled my acne. Since I’ve been using it my facialist has even seen a difference in my skin. I feel like it immediately soaks into my skin so it doesn’t make me feel greasy and compliments my moisturizer (I can get vey oily in my T zone so something that soaks in is important). I’ve purchased this 3 times and will continue to do so! The -2 stars is for the packaging.. I feel like there’s a ton of product that’s hard to get at the bottom and some build up around the opening after a while. Kind of a waste. I also wish the packaging was environmentally friendly and recyclable great product. not so great packaging
