Impressed so far. I bought this on a whim with low expectations - there’s no note of the percentage of vitamin C, and honestly I’m very skeptical of the whole ‘superfood’ and ‘stem cell’ thing. But to my surprise, my skin looks and feels great. I didn’t even realize it was congested until this cleared it up! It’s good for day or night use, gentle, calming, and really has a noticeable effect. I didn’t love the other two products from them that I picked up, but might try to green machine mask next. nan
