This was gifted by INNBeauty in exchange for my honest review! I was so excited to receive this product in the mail,  not only was the packaging a 10/10 I’m really enjoying the product! I love testing out new retinol, especially ones that are said to be gentle on sensitive skin. I haven’t been using this for long, but so far I’m really enjoying it! amazing ingredient deck!
