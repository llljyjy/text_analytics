I normally don’t leave reviews, but this went viral so I feel like other shoppers may want to know details before they buy. I’ve tried tons of lip oils over the years and and this one isn’t special, the reason I give it 1 star is because it’s very sticky and it has the exact same taste/smell as cherry cough syrup and I can’t stand that, and I usually enjoy regular cherry flavored/scented products, but this one is completely cough syrup scented. It also doesn’t provide enough tint to be worth it when I get a honey lip oil that hydrates my lips better and is way less sticky. Even after you wipe this off your lips are still a bit sticky, and like I said, I’ve had others for an even lower cost that made my lips feel great. If you like that kind of cherry scent and are okay with a product being a bit sticky it may be for you. Over hyped in comparison to any regular lip oil
