I have used this product about 5 times.  My skin is normal to dry.  I am fair with freckles and sensitive skin.  The mask is not irritating as long as you don’t keep it in too long.  About 7 minutes was good for my skin. At 10 minutes my skin turned a bit red but resolved within an hour or so.   After using it my skin felt soft and a bit brighter.  I dont think I will purchase again because it is expensive.  If I see significant results after finishing the product I will update the review. Skin feels soft and bright…but not mind blowing :)
