This cleanser is truly incredible! I love the fact that this cleanser may be used several different ways. I enjoy double cleansing with this product. I like to apply this to dry skin and then rinse with water. Then I apply the gel to damp skin for the second cleanse. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and super soft. I am amazed how well this cleanser takes off all of my makeup, including mascara.  This cleanser is not heavy and feels very lightweight on the skin. The cleanser has little to no scent. Also the pump makes for easy application. I would recommend this cleanser to all! Squeaky Clean & Soft
