I love the idea of a hydrating cleanser I can use when my face isn’t breaking out since the cleansers I use during that time of the month tend to be more harsh and drying. This hydrating gel cleanser felt really silky while scrubbing on. I appreciated that although the product isn’t scented it didn’t have any heavy chemical like scents that some unscented products have, it smelled pretty neutral. After cleaning my face felt soft but not greasy(I have combo skin). Would dey recommend to anyone looking for a hydrating cleanser. I received this product complimentary from InnBeauty in exchange for my honest review. Hydrating without making greasy
