I like this color and formula a lot! It’s really hydrating. I feel like I have to apply a lot to get that super glossy look I like tho! For $15 it’s worth it, but I wouldn’t pay more for it. It doesn’t look super glossy as soon as it is applied to the lips, but give it 5 min y’all to heat up, then it pops off! pretty good
