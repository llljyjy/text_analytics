This more-sturizer exceeded my expectations. It really does as promised. My skin felt plump, smooth, supple, and it had more bounce. This is packed with great ingredients such as 10% peptide complex, 10% Vitamin C complex, and ceramides. No fragrance detected and the texture feels like a hybrid between a gel and cream, very lightweight. I love reaching for this during the summer. Reach for this every time in the summer
