Now that am in my 30s,  I was looking forward to start using retinol and including it in my skincare. I found that several retinol I’ve used irritated really bad my skin. I’ve been using this one for a week now and so far so good! I’m happy to give it a try. “Complementary from INNBEAUTY Project” “gifted by INNBEAUTY Project” A really good Retinol!
