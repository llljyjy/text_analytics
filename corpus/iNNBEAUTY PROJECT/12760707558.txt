This is one of the only moisturizers that doesnâ€™t cause my face to over-produce oil. I have oily/combo skin, and this moisturizer has worked wonders on my skin, and kept moisture even in the winter. However, this is not enough moisture for anyone with dry-leaning skin. Great for oily/acne prone skin!!!!
