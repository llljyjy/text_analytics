I’m a huge fan of this brand and have been waiting for them to release a gel cleanser for so long! I love their foam cleanser but I personally love to switch between an exfoliating cleanser and a hydrating cleanser depending on how my skin is feeling. I find this works best for my combination skin which can go from super dry to oily. This cleanser is everything I had hoped for. It lathers well but isn’t extremely foamy. It works beautifully to cleanse everything away and leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. It prevents that stretched, dry feeling that I sometimes get after washing my face. I highly recommend this cleanser! The perfect cleanser for combination skin!
