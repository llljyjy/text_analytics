I was gifted this product from INNBEAUTY Project. Although I was gifted the product, I have already decided that I will repurchase it when i eventually run out of it. After using this product my skin feels nourished and looks more plump. I am super glad that this product does not have a strong fragrance because my skin tends to have adverse reactions to fragrance. A little goes a long way with this product and the texture is super silky and creamy without feeling heavy on the skin. All in all, this is a product that I would recommend. nan
