This obviously works great for some people, but it didn’t work for me: I love the idea and had no problems with the dispenser, but the powder just sat on top of my makeup. I wouldn’t say it was cakey, exactly, but visible. I’ve worked hard, with different moisturizers and primers, to keep my foundation at a natural-looking matte finish, and this looked powdery and unnatural up close (it looked okay from maybe four feet away, which is why I gave it two stars). Supergoop clearly needs to keep working on their resetting/reapplication SPF products. The resetting spray works better for me than the powder (at least half the time, it works perfectly; the rest of the time, it has an equivalent problem, causing my makeup to shift a little and settle weirdly into my pores), but neither is what I want it to be.
