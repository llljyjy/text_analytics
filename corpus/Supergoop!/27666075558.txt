Having a toddler means you gotta be outside almost everyday. I always try to use some sort of face cream when outside especially in the winter and summer. I have never tried the supergoop products before but let me tell you that I’m very impressed with this spf face lotion . I love how it blends into my skin and how natural my face after it. It doesn’t make my face look white like some other lotions I’ve used in the past. I also like that this product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. Living in one of the coldest state in USA my face gets super dry in the winter and this lotion is helping my face feel hydrated. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great face lotion spf. Gifted by Soopergoop Amazing Face Lotion SPF
