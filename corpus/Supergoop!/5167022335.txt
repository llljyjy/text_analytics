This used to be my favorite sunscreen because it would leave my skin so radiant and glowy. If you have fair skin and no issues with chemical sunscreen, I still highly recommend it. Unfortunately I’ve developed an allergy to chemical sunscreen filters, and wearing this causes severe eye irritation. It’s such a lovely sunscreens though! Radiant finish for fair skin
