This is the product that was missing in my skincare staples. I love how practical it is, perfect as the last step before heading out while wearing a face full of makeup. Best of all is that you can carry it with you to reapply throughout the day. The smell isnâ€™t overwhelming and you get used to it. Application is easy and mess-free. This was gifted by Supergoop!
