never knew something could be so tiny and expensive, but then again, im 4’10“ and spend $100 on groceries every week so I guess it’s possible. what I love most about this sunscreen tho is it doesnt feel heavy or sticky or shiny and there’s no white cast. it functions like a makeup primer which is probably what encourages me to use it. but it maybe will last you like 5 applications, which is kind of crazy for a $20 product great for a 3 day max trip
