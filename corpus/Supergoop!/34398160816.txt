Although I do prefer the regular glow screen more, this one is still nice. I am very fair skinned and tried the lighter shade afraid it would be too much tint for me but it wasn’t. At first the tint was very pink, but it dissipated quickly and just blended right in to my skin leaving little to no color. Was very light weight and I couldn’t feel it on my skin. I was expecting more glow but this kinda absorbed in. Nice under makeup. Light
