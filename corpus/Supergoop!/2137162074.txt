I’ve used this product on and off for a few years. I love the way it feels and a little bit goes a long way. It makes your skin feel like velvet and you only need about a half dime-sized amount for your whole face. I’ve never burned while wearing this out in the sun. If you use too much and apply it too generously, it can clog pores. I love the formula because it isn’t too drying or sticky. nan
