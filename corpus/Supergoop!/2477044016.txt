I am obsessed with this product! I LOVE that not only is it a natural bioretinol serum, but it also contains SPF 40! As someone with freckly, light skin, SPF is a must, and can be hard to find in a product that also benefits the skin! I’ve been using it a couple weeks and have noticed an improvement in the texture and quality of my skin, and a decrease in fine lines.  Even with the SPF in it, my skin doesn’t get oily looking throughout the day like other SPF products often do.  Definitely recommend! The best thing for my aging skin
