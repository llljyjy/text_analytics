As long as this product is made, I will continue to use it! Of every sunscreen I have ever used, this is the all time greatest. It goes on so velvety smooth and makes my skin feel like silk. There is no color or cast to it whatsoever, making it a great face sunscreen for myself and my biracial daughter.  It is pricey, so I have tried a few “dupes” but nothing is quite as perfect as this. I do keep the others and apply them to my body instead! Love this product and entire company so much! the sunscreen that makes you want to use sunscreen
