I ordered the mini version of this in hopes of finding a sunscreen that doesn’t irritate my eyes and because of the strong UV protection it claims to offer. I’ve used it for a few days so far and overall it’s been okay.On the plus side, eye irritation has been very minimal. I’ll feel a little bit of a sting occasionally if it manages to get in my eye, but it’s nowhere near as bad as the Aveeno SPF 50 sunscreen I was using previously. The product is also easy to apply as it has a relatively thin consistency, and I find the scent to be pleasant and subtle.My main issue with it, though, is that it leaves my skin very tacky and shiny all day. This causes my hat and mask to feel like they’re glued to my head, which isn’t particularly enjoyable.Overall, it’s certainly not a bad sunscreen but I don’t think I’ll be purchasing it again.
