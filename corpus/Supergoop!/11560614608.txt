Gifted by Supergoop! This is interesting! If nothing else, Supergoop is the most interesting western SPF brand. I… am on the fence with this product. I can’t use enough of this product to provide ample sun protection, but it also doesn’t work well with other sunscreens. I have really enjoyed this as a body SPF as it provides a nice glow + I can layer a bit more comfortably than on the face. nan
