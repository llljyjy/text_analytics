Not worth the price tag for a few reasons. The consistency is very loose and watery, the amount I. The bottle is not valuable for $46 and finally, the packaging as a whole is just bad marketing. Thereâ€™s so many better ways of packaging this produce, just do it like they package the tinted moisturizer! nan
