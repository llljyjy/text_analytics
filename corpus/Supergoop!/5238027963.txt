This sunscreen was easy to apply and it did sink into the skin right away. You will have to use a very hydrating moisturizer as it did feel a bit dry minutes after application. I would definitely enjoy this in summer time when my skin is more normal. The plastic bottle was extremely light , I would expect something more sophisticated for the price tag. Bioretinol is not the same as retinol there for no concern there with day use. Nice sunscreen for normal to oily skin.
