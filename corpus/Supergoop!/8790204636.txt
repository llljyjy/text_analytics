I love this SPF setting spray! It smells great, like a fresh minty scent. It also goes on easily and doesn’t mess up my makeup or anything I’ve applied beforehand. It dries extremely fast once on your skin, within a few seconds! The one thing I don’t love is the actual spraying part. It does come out like a stream instead of more a mist? But, it’s not enough to make me not use it. I still love the product and it’s going with me to the beach in a few days! This was gifted by Supergoop. Great SPF setting spray, ok packaging
