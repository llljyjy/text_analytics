I got it as complimentary from Supergoop! for the review purpose. I was skeptical at the concept of sunscreen “oil“ at the beginning. It turns out pretty great. It is moisture but not  oily. But I applied a smaller amount compared to usual sunscreen to avoid getting too oily so I am not sure how the “sunscreen“ part works.  It is suitable when I need to run some errands, leaving home for just a bit. I haven’t used it with makeup though. no sure how it works with foundation. nan
