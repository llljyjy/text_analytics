At first opening it was a learning curve but the packaging is pretty cool. Very small in size and that makes it great to carry around. It has a alcoholy smell initially going on but it blended into my skin very nicely. It also gave me a very nice glow. Definitely worth the coins. Also, this was gifted by Supergoop. nan
