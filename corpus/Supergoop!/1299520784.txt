I’m a super loyal fan of the original Glow Screen,  and was excited to try this as a more tinted option. It still packs the usual, gorgeous glow screen sheen, but the color is much deeper than I expected. I have light skin and felt it was too dark without my self tanner. I’ll still reach for it whenever I have my self tan on, but will probably stick with the OG shade for everyday. Bronze shade is pretty dark
