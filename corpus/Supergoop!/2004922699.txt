I had a crazy reaction to this. Wore it one day, with nothing else different in my routine. And was absolutely red (not sunburnt) and irritated after an hour in the sun. I’ve tried their glow screen and daily dose, and had the same reaction. I thought it was chemical sunscreens I was reacting to, but I just switched to Shiseido sunscreen, and it works beautifully. Definitely something with the Supergoop formula that doesn’t agree with me. But some people love it, so proceed with caution. It’s a no for me dawg
