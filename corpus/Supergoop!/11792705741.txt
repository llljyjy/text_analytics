I tried this and the resetting spray and found this was very easy to apply during the day and over makeup. However I am not entirely sure how much product you would need to use to actually get the SPF 35. For this reason I plan to still use this but as a «refresh» throughout the day, rather than as my main form of daily spf. Pros if this product as compared to other «brush on» spfs: this one has much better packaging. Clear on/off for powder disbursement and there is an interior «tube» that protects the brush bristles from being fanâtes when taking the outer tube (lid) on and off. As compared with the spray, his was easier to apply. I think I need to try the full-size spray before making a definitive rec btwn the two, as the spray nozzle on the travel size I got was faulty. (I think the package was a dud as opposed to the product not being good!) easy to apply, tough to gauge coverage
