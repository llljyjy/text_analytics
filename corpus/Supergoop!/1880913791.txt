I love Supergoop! Sunscreen! But this is a fail. The texture is like goopy snot, so it is pilled right out of the bottle. Trying it out I have chunks of pilled sunscreen around my eyes.. I tried some on the back of my hand and it took a lot of rubbing in to get it smooth. That isn’t gonna work around your eyes. I can’t imagine trying to wear this under makeup / concealer. I even tried shaking the bottle. What a mess. It is immediately being returned. Did I get a bad batch? … cause this is bad. Nope nope nope nope nope
