Spf is one of the most important, if not the most important step in my morning skincare routine. I tend to use an acid or retinal at night so I’m always going threw spf quickly. I’ve never tried another sunscreen with this one’s consistency! And I love it! The “watery” moniker is no joke, and it makes application so easy as it feels like it melts into my skin as I apply it!Gifted by Supergoop! Love
