I wanted to like this because I wanted to combine spf with a setting spray. one less product right? first, the spray is not even. Everyone has experienced a misting spray bottle that becomes a squirtgun to the face... this kinda behaved that way straight out of the box. This is obviously an issue with packaging. Additionally it is VERY oily. I don’t even want to spray it on my face when i have clothes on cuz it will leave oil marks/spots on your clothing. And be careful, cuz after i used this the first time, i almost slipped on my bathroom floor. Any spray that gets on the floor is like coating your floor in oil. I will not be buying again. I DO recommend the standard sephora setting spray. I guess I’ll have to find an additional SPF spray to use ontop of THAT. Sadly disappointed
