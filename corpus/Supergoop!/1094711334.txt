I used to work in skincare development and we always absconded with these plastic 2-in-1 dispenser bottle brushes because they never work properly - 10 years on and nothing has changed. I could not get sufficient product to dispense into the brush; no matter how much I shook or tapped the container, all I would get is a thin streak that would blow off before I could even get it to my face. At one point I emptied as much powder from the bottle brush as I could into the cap of another jar and applied THAT powder (similar to how you apply Laura Mercier translucent powder), and this was about 4 hours after I had already applied sunscreen lotion and makeup, but the powder is so awfully chalky, even on my fair skin it separated after about 20 minutes in the sun and did nothing to prevent sunburn on my nose where I had applied it liberally. Trash product, will return. Trash
