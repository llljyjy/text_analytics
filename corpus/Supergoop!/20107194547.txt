Supergoop gifted me their Setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40, and I can officially now say I have a product that not only sets my face for makeup.. but more importantly than that protects my skin from harmful UV ray damage. The mist itself is so light and refreshing.. and it truly doesn’t feel as though you’re even wearing sunscreen.. this product is so versatile, I love it. I also adore how healthy and glowy it leaves the skin, along with the feeling of my skin being hydrated and radiant. Hands down absolutely recommend. A Setting Spray That Protects..
