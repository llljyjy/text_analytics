My skin type is very dry, but with the current winter season, it is downright parched. A sunscreen in oil form is such a unique concept and a dream for dry skin. I apply about 5 drops on top of my moisturizer and this oil layers so nicely. This provides sun protection, while locking in moisture, and adding a healthy dewy glow. As a bonus, this makes for a beautiful hydrating base for makeup. LOVE this!Gifted by Supergoop, but opinions are my own. A sunscreen oil? Genius!!
