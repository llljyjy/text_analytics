I wanted to love this sunscreen so bad, but when I tried it out twice now I just couldnâ€™t get over the finished look. It seemed to accentuate every pore or line on my face, the pearlescent quality was a bit too much for an everyday look and really made every line and pore look so bad. made my pores and lines stand out
