I was kindly gifted by SuperGoop! to try this and it does not disappoint! I love adding skincare loving ingredients into practical products like spf. This is a chemical filter oil sunscreen with ceramides. My skin absolutely loves this. It has a nice dry oil texture leaving skin plump and glowing. I love applying this right after my main Sunscreen and then following with my foundation base. I’ve had so many complimentson my skin! It looks and feels wonderful and love that I’m getting sun protection! Home run! Amazing spf oil!!!
