I’ve been hearing so many ppl talk about how great this sunscreen is and I finally had a chance to try it! Let me tell you I’m obsessed!! It’s so lightweight and feels amazing of my face! I love that it’s tinted so I can use it on non makeup days and it just evens out my skin and gives me a healthy glow along with 40spf coverage!! So good as a primer under makeup too!! Can’t get over how amazing it feels on my skin, not sticky at all and no weird smells! LOVEEE
