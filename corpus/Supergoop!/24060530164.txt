I really enjoyed this mini, was great to carry in a bag for reapplying and a good way to test this formula. The superscreen from supergoop is my go to face sunscreen. Since this cheaper and offered in more sizes, I wanted to try this for face and body. I wore it a few times on my face and didn’t love it for that: it’s heavier/greasier than the face-specific supergoop offerings, and made my (dry) skin feel congested after wearing it twice. It also has a cooling sensation from the eucalyptus. But while it may lack the cosmetic elegance of their other spfs, this is still a great offering. As a body spf, this feels moisturizing, rubs in quickly, and offers solid protection. Since it’s offered through FSA/HSA, we’ve already repurchased a larger size. nan
