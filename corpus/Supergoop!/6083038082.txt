This sunscreen has been a fav of mine for years now. It is a perfect sunscreen for effortless summer glow. I have a dry sensitive skin, but this chemical sunscreen never give any kind of irritation or redness. It also did not leave a white cast on my medium skin. I really love the glow it gives and still protects my skin from UV damage. Will be forever repurchase! The Perfect SPF for Glowy Skin
