I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t caused any breakouts! I like to use this on days where my skin needs some extra hydration or when I want a glowing make look. You should try it if you dry skin or living in a drier environment. I wouldn’t recommend buying this if your skin is on the oiler side or if you are living in humid areas. Don't mind it
