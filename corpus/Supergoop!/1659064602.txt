LOVE that this is a mineral powder sunscreen that’s easy to use on the go and portable. However, the bristles are rough, the product doesn’t dispense evenly, if at all, and looks and feels a bit heavy on the skin. Convenient for SPF reapp, but not the easiest or most comfortable to use. Room for improvement
