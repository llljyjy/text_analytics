I received this complimentary from Supergoop! and I am in love with this (re)finishing mist for a few reasons - but a main one is being able to easily reapply sunscreen with my makeup still on. I have combo skin and it doesn’t dry me out or make my skin oily.When using - CLOSE YOUR EYES. It will sting.The scent reminds me of hairspray - it’s a very strong smell, but it does go away within a minute or two. I was actually really surprised at how much it reminded me of Aquanet. The mist itself is super fine and I primarily use powder makeup products, so this gives a nice finish and sets it all without issue. I’ll definitely be buying more. Perfect for my Combo Skin
