went to buy sunscreen for my oily skin and the beauty advisor suggested this. I used it twice and returned it. it’s sooo heavy!! I looked greasy and none of my makeup would stay in place, even after allowing it to “dry“ for a good 10 minutes. I’ve tried other supergoop products and as far as I can tell they are 100 percent not made for my skin type. nan
