The perfect lightweight SPF!!  I have sensitive acne prone skin so I’m very careful with spfs.  I’ve been using the Every single face spf for the last couple weeks now and I’m obsessed! It doesn’t break me out, it doesn’t feel heavy, doesn’t leave a white cast, sweat resistant, it literally covers all my needs!! Gifted by Supergoop. My perfect lightweight SPF!
