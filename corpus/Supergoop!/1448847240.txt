I am a golden goddess thanks to Glowscreen. It’s a little too “glowy“ to use on my entire face, but I love using a dab on my cheeks, forehead and nose. I hate using regular sunscreen on my face, but this one works for me - gets absorbed quickly, no icky smell, just the right amount of tint for my pale face. Works well for me
