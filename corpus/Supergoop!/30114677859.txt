It’s my first time trying a sunscreen that’s also a face oil and I can say I am a fan.  My skin felt moisturized and it was very lightweight on my skin. My skin was glowing afterwards and even better it’s protected from those harmful sunrays. It’s a win win. It’s very useful right now with this dry winter weather I have by me.  Gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my hi eat review. Great oil
