My savior in hot and humid Houston weather. We often cycle, and I always feel that I need to re-apply sunscreen but really don’t want to touch my face with dirty hands, and this spray is just perfect for situations like this. Furthermore, when I want to re-apply sunscreen without damage my makeup look. I really don’t understand why I never used it before and really happy of receiving it complimentary from Supergoop. It’s definitely now my to-go product. nan
