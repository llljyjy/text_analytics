I saw this on social media and really wanted to love this glow screen, however, for the price point would not recommend. It does give a glow but I was hoping the tint would be thicker like a make up primer. For the price point, you can find similar products that are sunscreen, glow and primer. Average glow - not sure its worth the price point
