I love supergoop sunscreens so I was estatic to get my hands on this sunscreen oil. The packaging is super cute and the oil is amazing! It glides on smoothly on my skin and it is not super oily so it does not leave an oily residue. Also, it works well with makeup. Sometimes, I like adding a few drops to my moisturizer if I am using a thicker cream. Gifted by Supergoop! nan
