I use this everyday & I’m only done with about half of the bottle. I use the 2 finger method (apply 2 fingers length to face) to apply & this has lasted a very long time! Gives great coverage, doesn’t sting the eyes, & leaves a nice glowy finish. Even on breakouts, it looks nice & doesn’t feel heavy. great everyday SPF!
