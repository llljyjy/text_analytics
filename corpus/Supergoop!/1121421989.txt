Oh hello inner glow! I LOVE this product! When I apply it, it goes on smoothly, feeling refreshing and oh so moisturizing. The best benefit for me is the healthy looking “I’m glowing from within” vibe it gives off. I’ve found I need no additional foundation unless I’m doing a more formal look, and even then I definitely need less foundation than I did before I used this product! It lasts a long time each time I apply and makes me feel fantastic about protecting my skin from all the damage that the sun can cause, like wrinkles, dryness, freckles, uneven skin tone, dark patches, and overall aging. I’ll add a pic for proof and tell you that I’m 43 years young, wishing to look 29. Ha! Anyway, I love this so much I bought the big size for my regular make-up, the smaller size for my travel make-up, and the trial size that came for free with purchase lives happily in my wristlet wallet. I am literally never without some glow!    Once you’ve tried it, you know you can’t live without the glow wherever you go! IYKYG (If You Know, You Glow)
