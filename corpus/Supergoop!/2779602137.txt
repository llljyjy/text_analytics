For context, I really enjoy the matte and the glowscreen from Supergoop, for different times of the year. My skin is oily-combo, so it benefits from the matte in summer and a glow in fall/winter. Hearing that this new Daily Dose contained retinol, (Bakuchiol to be exact), I was super excited. I didn’t care much for the applicator, which is a dropper that doesn’t grab too much product- I think a pump would have worked better here. The sunscreen comes out a with a tint, and blends nicely without white cast. There’s no off-putting scent like most sunscreens. Unfortunately, this was a miss for me. I think those with drier skin types will love it, because for me, it was very greasy. I personally did not love the shine it left on my skin; but it does blend out nicely and feels soft on the skin Lightweight but kind of greasy
