I love to use this sunscreen during the summer. It has a skin-like finish and is never shiny. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin and it doesn’t interfere with the way my makeup looks. I also wear it during winter sometimes, butI have dry skin so I like to opt for something with a little more moisture during that time. I highly recommend! Does What It Says
