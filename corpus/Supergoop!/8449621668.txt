I think this is the easiest way to reapply your SPF, especially when you donâ€™t have the chance to wash your hands to reapply your regular SPF.The only thing that I need to warn you is to be careful to apply it near to your eyes, otherwise, it could sting a bit.This SPF was gifted by supergoop. nan
