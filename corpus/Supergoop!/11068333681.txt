When I first saw this product, I thought it was a sunscreen, but it’s actually a plant-based retinol alternative treatment that also has spf protection to prevent sun damage. I think of this product like a serum that you use at the end of your routine, right before using your primary sunscreen. I used a little more than the recommended amount, but it didn’t leave a cast on me. It’s lightweight and has bakuchiol which has multiple well-aging benefits. I wouldn’t use this treatment alone because you’d have to use a lot of it for adequate coverage, but it’s good way to provide extra protection. Fans of Supergoop will definitely enjoy adding this to their routine. Extra protection
