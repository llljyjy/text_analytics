If you want a product that you I’ll reapply sunscreen over makeup, this is NOT it. It will take your makeup right off & move it around & get the stick all gross. Just don’t bother trying it lol. Now I just use it to reapply on days I’m only wearing sunscreen, which it works well for. I really love it for reapplying on my neck/chest though because it gives a gorgeous glow to that area, and I find it a little too dewy for my taste on the face (and I have dry skin). great for no makeup days
