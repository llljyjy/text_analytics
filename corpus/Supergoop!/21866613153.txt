As someone who is stuck at home most of the time, I think this product is perfect for days where you have to leave! This suncreen that was gifted by Supergoop, goes on super smooth, leaves no white cast so you can put it on whenever, and helps protect your skin from UV rays! If you have oily skin, you might notice that the shine it leaves behind is not the best! It is made with clean ingredients and is cruelty free! I am excited to keep using the product because you always need a good sunscreen in your pocket! Sunscreen is a must have!
