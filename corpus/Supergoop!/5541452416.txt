Love this! The mist is very fine and feels hydrating. The mint in this will sting you if you have any open wounds or active acne so beware. Also I read other reviews that said it was thick and oily, but you have to SHAKE IT WELL!!! Like really really well. I shake it for a good 30 seconds before applying. love it
