I have never like a sunscreen as much as I love this product! As a person with deep dark complexion, it is SO DIFFICULT to find a product that leaves a white cast after applying the necessary amount (two-fingers worth) and reapplying throughout the day. My skin literally glows after using this and I’m enthusiastic about reapplying throughout the day because I know that it will disappear right into my skin and not leave me looking gray.I gave it only four stars instead of five because it does sting badly when it gets into your eyes. I’ve been avoiding my eye area recently which I wish I didn’t have to because that area deserves sun protection as well. Overall, great product and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND. CURRENT FAVORITE SUNSCREEN
