Not good under makeup, or for oily acne prone skin. I have very sensitive skin and it never broke me out but It made me super oily. My foundation would slip and slide and my skin looked terrible. The sunscreen would never sink into my skin and it definitely does not feel like itâ€™s lightweight. Avoid if you have oily skin!
