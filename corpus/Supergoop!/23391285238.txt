I will likely never buy another type of face sunscreen again. I’ve been using this product for two years now and am so happy with it. Some don’t like it, but I absolutely love the texture of the product and it is pretty fast absorbing. The smell isn’t noticeable to me and it has not made my acne-prone skin react in the time I’ve used it. Can’t recommend it more. My go-to for my sensitive skin
