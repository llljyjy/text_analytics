I love this product! I have many Supergoop prods and this is definitely a new favorite! I’m a content creator and love having a product that helps me have beautiful skin during daytime (no flash photography) photoshoots. It’s similar to Fenty Beauty’s Diamond Bomb powder in the sense that it have very fine glitter in it, but unlike diamond bomb it’s both moisturizing and has SPF. The formula is super comfortable although I recommend only applying it to skin that’s exposed rather than wearing underneath clothes. The price is quite high so I’ll definitely be using the play sunscreen + this where I want a bit of extra shine. Shimmery Perfection - coming to Greece with me
