I wanted to love this so bad! Supergoop is one of my favorite and most trusted brands. Worked great for the first few days. Perfect amount of moisture for winter but my face started breaking out in rash/ bumps after about 4-5 days and now I have the worst texture all over my face! Sadly I will have to return. It was love at first site thenâ€¦.
