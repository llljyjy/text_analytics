“Glow” isn’t the appropriate description. It’s a tinted, silvery metallic and reminiscent of the Max Strobe Cream. When you’re done spreading this on the face, your fingers will be silver and shiny. This would have been great in the 2015/2016 makeup era because we loooved that highlighted look under our foundation. I’m sure it would look great under a fully done face, but not for what I wanted. I thought “glow” meant dewy because a lot of YouTubers have mentioned it’s great for those with dry skin… no no no. This is not buildable. I would pass and not repurchase more recommend this.I purchased this in the $25 best sellers kit with the Unseen Sunscreen and Play sunscreen. (Both of which I love and have repurchased) it’s a no for me
