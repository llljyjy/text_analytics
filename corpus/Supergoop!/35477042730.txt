A great FACE spf!!! I do not think I would use this on anywhere but my face, but granted that is what this product is made for!! I use it over any very light makeup that I put on, and it doesn’t interfere with that! With the spring weather, I am not outside as much as I would be in the summer, but this is great right now for day to day activities, unsure about summer sports though! It also smells good, and doesn’t break my face out, which is important to me! This product was gifted by Supergoop to me, but I have purchased it myself too! One other thing, with the price of this product, it is on the higher end, but this brand has a variety of different kinds of sunscreens, for various purposes! Not many sunscreen brands have such a great variety. a great SPF option!
