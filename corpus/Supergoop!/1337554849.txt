Superfood daily dose boost spf - This is such a great idea from Supergoop. To have a product that is both a spf and serum. I’m always in a rush in the morning and like that I can cut out a step with this product. I also have a tendency to skip spf during cloudy days but now I don’t miss a day with this product. I like that the product didn’t leave my hands and face greasy and surprisingly wasn’t oily on my face. But I’m not the biggest fan of the smell. This was gifted by Supergoop. nan
