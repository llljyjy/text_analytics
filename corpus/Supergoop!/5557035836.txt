I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. I like that it protects against blue light as well (or at least it should).It’s got a greasy-ish texture but I have normal-dry skin so even though there was a bit getting used to it, I didn’t mind too much. There’s no whitecast, it is “unseen”. However, after about an hour or so, it starts to peel off and I have to keep taking these small strands/balls of product off my face. I don’t wear makeup so I’m not sure how well it does with it, but if it peels without makeup, I feel like it would be worse with makeup. I will use the rest of it, but I won’t be buying another Meh, it peels
