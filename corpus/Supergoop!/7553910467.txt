Very convenient for reapplying in the beach!! Trust me you don’t want to touch your face when you’re in the beach with sand and other germs on your hands. I have dry/normal skin so this worked well, but I wouldn’t recommend for those with oily skin. Another thing--this is a DRY OIL and OIL in any format doesn’t work well with makeup. If you use it over makeup, make sure you bring a powder to “set“ everything again. Fantastic for beach
