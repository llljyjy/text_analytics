I received it complimentary from Supergoop. I love supergoop for their spf and this one is amazing for my dry skin and to layer up on sun protection. I use this as the last step of my skincare after my spf sinks in I add few drops of this spf on the skin for maximum protection. It does not leave the skin oily or greasy. I really like it. Great to layer sun protection.
