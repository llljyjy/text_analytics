This is an amazing sunscreen especially for touch ups during the day. However it gets everywhere. It doesn’t absorb very quickly and leaves me feeling pretty oily. I also just can’t get it off my hands? The regular sunscreen is easier to take off the hands than the spray, but you’re not even applying the spray with your hands. works great but gets on everything
