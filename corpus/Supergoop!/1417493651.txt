I really like this Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 in Sunrise. I love that it is SPF 40 and lightweight at the same time. I love that it contains hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. This shade looks great on my skin. I love that it gives my skin a luminous glow! Sunscreen with benefits
