Great SPF on my skin.  I honestly love the glow with the spf on it! It feels amazing on the skin and it doesn’t look too white when you put it on. The coverage is perfect and you can reapply without pulling over and over it.  This probably my new favorite sunscreen. I just don’t like how tiny the packaging. Overall love it and I will definitely recommend this to other people. Yay
