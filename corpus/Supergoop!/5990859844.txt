really interesting product! i wasn’t sure how to layer this into my routine at first but it’s a great way to get your spf on in a moisturizing way. it’s a really slippery oil that layers nicely on top of your moisturizer and before sunscreen! i let it sit and absorb for a bit before doing my next step. overall a really great way to keep moisture in, especially in the colder months sunscreen in an oil?!
