Okay this is the best sunscreen ive ever used. It’s crazy how beautiful it makes your skin look. I brought this to Mexico after getting it in a Sephora Hello Favorites bag and didn’t know what I was getting myself into. This under light makeup is gorgeous. You don’t even need foundation on top of this you’ll be glowing and radiant. I know it’s supposed to be sunscreen but I’d use this as a primer anyday. If you’re oily, this may be too much for you. But as a combo girl myself, I loved this. Whoever buys this, get ready to GLOW. It’s beautiful. YUP SUPERGOOP DID THAT
