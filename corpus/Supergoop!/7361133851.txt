Ok, so I understand all the criticism but hear me out! I use it a certain way and it’s been working wonders for my skin. I’ll put the whole dollop on my hand and blend it like crazy (yes, this is a bit wasteful), then I delicately place this on my eyes and nose - basically center of my face outwards. It not only blends well but it brightens/conceals any dark spots and evens things out giving me this luminous glow. Better than any tint SPF I have used! 40spf, mineral, and EWG-safe. For naysayers, I think blending it very well in the hand and then applying will help with the crepey skin effect. It was a no until it wasn't!
