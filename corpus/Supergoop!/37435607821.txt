It can feel a little greasy when you first put on but dries down to a natural glow in 10 minutes. Wouldn’t recommend for oily skin but is great for combo or dry skinned people. Smidges makeup a bit if you reapply on top but not too bad. I don’t love the way the stick is shaped cuz it makes it hard to reach certain areas of the face like nose and under eyes. nan
