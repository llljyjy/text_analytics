I chose this because I was looking for an eye cream with SPF.  Unfortunately this isn’t the right product. The formulation is WAY too thick to rub into the under-eye area completely and ends up pilling.  It doesn’t so much “brighten“ as leaves a white cast.  I won’t be buying this again. Better on Paper than Eyes
