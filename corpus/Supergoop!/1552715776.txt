I have been using this a couple weeks and love it! It feels and smells very close to lotion. You can hardly tell there is sunscreen in it. I use it on face and body. It makes my face shiny but fine once I put makeup or powder over. My face is very sensitive (most sunscreens burn) and this has worked very well for me. love! feels like lotion
