I absolutely love a good glow, this stuff is like the Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter of spf. I am pretty fair, in my early 30s even though this app says otherwise. I do think it’s a little dark for my skin so I have to look in the mirror to blend it, but not a big deal for me! I can still wear it without makeup. I’ve read reviews that say this can even work on deeper skin which is great! no white cast, it’s more of a bronze glow coming out of the tube. I use a good amount for my face daily and this tube lasted me a little over 6 months which is pretty standard for me (and good because it expires). I used to love the Volition luminous spf, but it seems they changed it and have made it even less spf based off the reviews, i’ve also tried the paulas choice glowy spf in the coral tube and it had a bit of a gray cast, also not as much spf as supergoop! I just bought another tube because I cannot be without spf. I absolutely recommend if you like looking super glowy! I use hourglass ambient powders and put highlight basically all over my face, so I don’t feel a tin man vibe like others mention, but I could see someone possibly feeling like that if they’re used to a more matte look. this stuff is beautiful and makes me want to apply my daily spf! flawless filter of SPF
