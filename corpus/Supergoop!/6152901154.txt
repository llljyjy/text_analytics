I absolutely love this! I bought it because I saw Katie Jane Hughes wear it as, essentially, a tinted moisturizer and I’m hooked! I suffer from acne and hyperpigmentation and on the days when I don’t want to wear makeup, I use this and spot conceal with a matte concealer and feel super confident and my skin looks great! Because it’s a glowy sunscreen I do have to blot throughout the day, so if you have oily skin and don’t like that, beware, but it’s not something that puts me off using this product. Beautiful natural finish and high SPF!
