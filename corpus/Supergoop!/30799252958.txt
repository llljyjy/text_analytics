I really like this sunscreen! It’s super convenient and easy to apply due to its stick form. The only thing is that it’s a little greasy. As someone with very dry skin I don’t mind and it does absorb in a couple minutes so it leaves more of a glow which I like for my dull skin. I’ll probably buy again but I wish there was more product for the price and less oiliness. Overall pretty nice
