This was sent to me by the brand with my opinions are my own! I absolutely loved the unseen sunscreen from super goop and was so excited to try this one out! I love that it offers a little bit of coverage while still protecting my skin. Itâ€™s easy to throw on on no make up days, looks amazing on my skin and wears nicely. Definitely would recommend! Love this!
