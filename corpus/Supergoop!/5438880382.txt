For reference I have combo skin and have liked many of supergoop products in the past. I take about 5 drops and gently pat it into the skin. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin super soft. There’s def a bit of a glow but it doesn’t look oily. It hasn’t caused any bad reactions and I will continue to incorporate this into my skin routine. I was gifted this product complimentary from supergoop nan
