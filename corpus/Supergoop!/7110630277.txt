I followed the instructions and shook the bottle very well. Sprayed a couple times and it went everywhere. Strong smell and even after waiting the 3 seconds that it says in the instructions, it burned my eyes. Itâ€™s so oily and it left spots on my shirt so that I had to change, as well as all over my bathroom counter. All throughout the day, I kept feeling my face and it never dried down. I was an oily mess. Returning this asap. Beware!! Very Oily
