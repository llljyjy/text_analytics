I wanted to love it because I thought it would be perfect as a makeup primer. Not the case at all. It pilled over top of my skincare products and it was way too shiny to use on its own. The next time I used it, I just used my moisturizer and it didn’t pill, but it looked awful under the kosas foundation. The unseen was a much better fit for me! Didn’t work for me
