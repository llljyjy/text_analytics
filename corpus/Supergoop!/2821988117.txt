This is a light and easy sunscreen that is perfect for the pool day with no makeup, but you don’t want a white cast. It would be a bit too oily to put makeup over top but as it is tinted, there is no white cast. Don’t expect a full/ medium or even light coverage with this though. If you have the money, it’s a nice product, but not necessary. nan
