This product was was gifted by Supergoop! For reviewing purposes. I’ve been looking forward to trying the daily dose hydra ceramide boost from super goop! It’s an spf 40 and I find it so interesting that it’s an oil! My skin is dry so I love using oils this was right up my alley! This product has no scent and is really light weight for an oil! I love the cute packaging on this product! It has a nice dropper top. I love how this product feels on My skin! No white caste
