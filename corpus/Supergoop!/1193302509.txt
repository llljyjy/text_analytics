Has a watery lotion texture. Feels really light and hydrating when applied. Absorbs quickly and completely. Leaves a soft, smooth finish- no chalkiness or greasiness. No white cast on my fair skin. Does smell like “sunscreen” but I lowkey like that. The packaging is cute and easy to bring along with you. I’ll happily use this up, but there’s just other SPF I like better especially for my dry skin I like something with an added benefit of being nourishing. Lightweight and hydrating!
