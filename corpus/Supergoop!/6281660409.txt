I was excited to try this product after all the rave reviews I see about it on social media! I do really enjoy this product but it took me a few tries to figure out how to work it into my routine correctly. This sunscreen deposits more color (not coverage) than I expected so definitely make sure you order the correct shade or you have a nice tan going so it matches your skin tone. I found that it works best after my serums but under my moisturizer. It is super light weight, adds a nice glow, and it doesnâ€™t have that sunscreen type smell. Overall I would recommend! nan
