gifted by Supergoop! I have combination skin so I only use oils in winter as otherwise they feel too heavy. This one is nice oil that is hydrating but is not too greasy or heavy, perfect for winter. I like that it has SPF but since I don’t like using too much oil, I think of it as an added layer, and still wear sunscreens on top. Glad to report that it doesn’t pill with the 2 sunscreens SPFs I tried to pair it with. nan
