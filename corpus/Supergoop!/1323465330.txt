I love this eye cream. A little goes a long way. I don’t experience the pilling others have mentioned unless I use too much. I don’t apply the same way I do other eye creams where I want to lather it. I just tap a couple drops below and above eye to prevent sun damage. Beats any other eye cream spf option I have tried. love
