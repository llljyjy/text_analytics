Best sunscreen ever!!!!! This is my go-to for everyday sunscreen. Even my husband uses it. It’s tinted and leaves the skin looking so natural and it’s non-greasy No one can yell you have sunscreen. Make sure you use a light moisturizer before using this sunscreen; makes it even better and it won’t smudge. This us my holy grail!! I hope they never stop making it. BEST SUNSCREEN EVER!
