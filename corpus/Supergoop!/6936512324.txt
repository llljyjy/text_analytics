I bought this to have a sunscreen touch-up option that i can easily carry around in my purse and apply without getting greasy hands. This powder option fit the bill. The packaging is compact and the product applies easily. It is translucent and doesn’t cover up whatever makeup i already have on. I like that I can click the container open and closed so product doesn’t leak into the lid when not in use. i don’t like that you have to sort f mush the bristles together to get them back in the lid so as not to crush them (which is why I removed a star). nan
