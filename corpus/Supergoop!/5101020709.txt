Supergoop did it yet again! This is such a nice lightweight/non-greasy lotion and it literally disappears into your skin. NO white cast and I absolutely love that it’s spf 50! It’s perfect for year round use because it’s not too heavy, but still hydrating. My skin is sensitive and looks great using it! This was complimentary from Supergoop but this is my honest opinion! Lightweight and no white cast
