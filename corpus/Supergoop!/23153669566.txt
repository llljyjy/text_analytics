I have tried a few spf’s and so far I’m liking this one. It is not to heavy and thick but offers plenty of protection. It does have a nice glow/shimmer to it. I don’t think I would use it as a highlighter like it mentions but it does give off a glowing from within look when applied to the skin. Overall a nice product and would recommend it. Also love that it is vegan. A Good SPF
