This stuff is terrible.  I will probably use it on my arms and for the beach but, will never buy again.  It’s way too greasy and the “glow“ is not a glow.  It just sits on your skin.  None of supergoops products are that great.  This is too hard to work with for on the face.  Hard pass! Greasy and sits on skin.
