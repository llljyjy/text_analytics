*gifted by Supergoop! I never tried Supergoop products before and I’m wondering why!!! This sunscreen didn’t even feel like sunscreen to me.. it’s so lightweight, non-greasy and didn’t leave any white cast on my tanned complexion! Its a WIN y’all! It also has a refreshing, cooling sensation when you apply it and I really liked that! I’m def trying out more Supergoop products:) A must buy sunscreen!!
