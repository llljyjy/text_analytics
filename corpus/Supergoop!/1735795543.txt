The perfect way to reapply your SPF! I always have a hard time with reapplying my SPF and this is the perfect way. I used it on a full makeup day and it gave the skin a nice glow. I would say just be careful around the eyes because it can burn a bit but as long as your careful it is fine. Love this product! perfect way to reapply your SPF!
