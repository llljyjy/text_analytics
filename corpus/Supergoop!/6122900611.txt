I am truly OBSESSED with this sunscreen. I use Supergoop in my everyday routine already, but with the glow + tinted version, it has completely changed my makeup routine. I live in a hotter climate and the “no makeup, makeup” look is preferred. If layered with makeup, it definitely gives you a glow from within. Perfect summer staple
