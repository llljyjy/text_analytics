This is my go-to for radiant glowing skin. I donâ€™t wear foundation, so this is perfect over my moisturizer to brighten my skin and give me a nice glow. It blends easy over other products and works well for darker skin tones, although I would not recommend using more than a dime size amount. For darker skin tones,  since you need more than a dime size amount for adequate sun protection, I would recommend using a moisturizer with spf (e.g., fenty beauty hydra vizor) first and then putting this on top. Perfect, radiant glow!
