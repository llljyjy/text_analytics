I originally bought the super goop tinted mousse sunscreen and haven’t been able to find that so I figured I would try this and I like this one better! It’s definitely more moisturizing which is great for my dry skin. It absorbs after a few minutes so if you put it on at first and it feels greasy, that will go away. My daughter can’t stand sunscreen but has been stealing this from me! She says it’s great as a base for makeup. I wish I would have gone a shade darker but I usually just put on a darker bronzer or darker foundation on my contour areas. There is no smell. Great coverage: I definitely will be rebuying got you some!
