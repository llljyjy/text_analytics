I have been very pleasantly surprised by this sunscreen. I have never been great at wearing SPF other than what’s already included in my foundation and I wear such a thin layer, that I know it’s not enough protection. I just don’t like the feeling of multiple layers of cream under my makeup. This stuff solves that issue. It protects my skin, gives me a healthy glow, and gives me plenty of moisture. On my “good skin days” where I don’t need extra coverage, I’m able to skip foundation all together! Perfect!
