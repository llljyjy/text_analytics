honestly i’ve never found a sunscreen that goes well under makeup. i have very dry skin and every sunscreen i’ve tried have made my makeup super oily or even dryer! this sunscreen not only works well under makeup but makes my makeup look even better! it’s smoothness makes it work almost like a primer and it helps blur my pores i honestly love it love love love
