As a sunscreen, this works. As a serum, it works. That’s the only reason that this is getting two, rather than one, star. I really wanted to like this product -- the serum/sunscreen combo is one I’m usually a fan of. However, this stuff smells...yeasty. It smells like an english muffin that’s been toasted and sprayed in banana boat. I get that it’s fragrance free and that’s great, but the scent that is present is offensive enough that it’s turning off a lot of people who would otherwise be open to using it. It’s also NOT for oily skin types. It’s very wet and it takes forever to dry, and it’s also very thin and liquidy so it can run everywhere. If you have dry/normal skin, don’t mind strong and maybe unpleasant smells, and are looking for an effective sunscreen and serum, then this could be for you. But it isn’t for me. Might work for some but not for me
