This product left my face feeling oily and greasy. I have dry skin so I didn’t think I’d have this problem, but it feels like I haven’t washed my face at all today. It’s so heavy and it does not dry down. I’m very disappointed. I’m going to stick to Korean sunscreen, as it seems western sunscreen is still as subpar as it’s always been. So greasy! Terrible product
