Iâ€™m really loving this sunscreen! At first, I was a little nervous to use it since I tend to steer clear of anything with shimmer, but the Supergoop! Glowscreen Sunscreen actually gave me a gorgeous glow. It did feel a little sticky at first but it dried down fairly quickly. Will be trying it under makeup next! nan
