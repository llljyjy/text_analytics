If you have medium/tan-dark skin tones, this willnot work. I have a medium light tan complexion and gave me such a bad white cast. It has a lightweight consistency but once you blend it in, it feels really thick on the skin. on top of that it pills horribly and smells like fritos/dog paws. so sad it didnâ€™t work out for me. so bad
