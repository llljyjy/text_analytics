This sunscreen is pretty incredible. It’s extremely lightweight and watery (per the name) - especially to be SPF 50. I’ve never seen anything quite like it. It leaves no white cast. It does, however, seem to take about 20 minutes to fully absorb for me, so I wait at least that long to apply my makeup. I do live in a very humid climate, so that could certainly be a contributor. I don’t have sensitive skin, and it doesn’t burn my eyes, but it does have a little bit of a chemical smell, so I can certainly see how it would cause eye burning for some people. Very lightweight. May become my new holy grail.
