It didn’t play well with many of my foundations. The color was also way too dark for me, I’m about NC15-20. The lightest shade looked straight orange on my cool, olive skintone. If you are tannner than NC20, or are warm toned, this may work for you, but my pale cool friends will look like an oompa loompa. Not for pale cool toned people.
