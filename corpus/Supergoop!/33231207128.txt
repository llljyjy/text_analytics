I’m always looking for ways to incorporate SPF into steps I’m already doing in my routine. I feel like I am less likely to forget to put my sunscreen on I’d it’s part of my skincare or makeup routine. I am in love with Supergoop Glowscreen in Sunrise! This SPF + primer leaves the perfect amount of shimmer on my skin. I wear it alone or under my makeup. My makeup looks better and lasts longer when I use it. It’s perfect for summer and looks amazing over my self-tanner. I would purchase this product again and again. Perfect for summer!
