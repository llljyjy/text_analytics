I have combo skin and I was super excited when this oil came out. Supergood makes amazing spf products. The oil I want to say is on the medium side for consistency. It’s not light, you can definitely feel it on the skin but if you’re dry to combo this works amazing for dry spots. It has a light cooking oil scent but didn’t bother me or cause any breakouts on my skin. I’ve used this under makeup as well and does not pill nor disrupt my makeup. Just gives an extra glow to your skin with added protection. nan
