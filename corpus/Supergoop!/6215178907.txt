Supergoop is my go-to sunscreen since the last couple of years and I was so excited to try their new formula. The mineral sunscreen is a first that I have liked, and hasnâ€™t broken me out. It works so well under makeup, it has a slight tint to it. As someone with combination skin, you might need to powder your t-zone just like with any glowy sunscreen. Another winner!
