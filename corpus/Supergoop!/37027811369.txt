I’m so shocked this product exists!! I was looking for something similar and I came across this at Sephora and I’m so glad I did. I’m 24 and it’s really important to me to protect my skin but I do wear make up so reapplying sunscreen in the middle of the day is not really an option. It doesn’t feel like normal sunscreen, it goes on similar to a make up setter. 10 out of 10This product was gifted by supergoop but my option remains the same nan
