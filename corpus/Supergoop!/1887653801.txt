I’ll preface this by saying that I didn’t know, until today, that this comes in another slightly darker shade, golden hour. I purchased this mini because I wanted to try glow screen, but I didn’t see it in anything but champagne in the store. Unfortunately, my skin is medium to tan. This champagne shade washes me out. I like the texture and the glow is nice. I’ll continue to use it, but only under my foundation so I can add color back to my face. I was hoping to use this alone since I don’t want to wear foundation everyday. Despite the shade, I’m still on the fence if it’s worth the price. And why wouldn’t the mini or value size be sold in the shade Golden Hour??? nan
