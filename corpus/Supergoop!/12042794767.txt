It’s a clear sunscreen that feels a bit like Vaseline and primer, specifically like a Elf primer I used to use. I have dry skin around my checks and chin so I wasn’t too worried about the consistency of this product. That being said because it feel a bit like Vaseline, I wasn’t sure if I would like this because it does feel a bit too oily for me. However, I waited a few minutes & as it dried, it no longer felt Vaseline/primer like. My face felt quite smooth and I forgot I had sunscreen on lol. Overall, I would say it is a good sunscreen. nan
