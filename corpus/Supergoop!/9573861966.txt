I was really wanting to like this product but I’m not super impressed. The directions say to apply every 2 hours but that’s just unrealistic if you wear make up. Second, it made my skin a tad red and irritated but nothing too crazy or bad. The scent is ok, it’s a mild nutty scent kind of like almonds. I wouldn’t buy again but maybe this is the right product for someone else. I was gifted by supergoop! For my honest feedback. Not my favorite
