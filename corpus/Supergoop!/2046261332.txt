I was gifted by Supergoop! complimentary exchange for a honest review. I received this yesterday and immediately opened it up to try because I love sunscreen. I wear sunscreen every single day, even when I’m home. I have dry skin but not sensitive, so I can use both physical and chemical sunscreen. This one is chemical sunscreen, so if your skin doesn’t react well to chemical- stay away. This goes on super smoothly just water (just like the name suggests). It absorbs quickly, makeup goes on nicely on top, no white cast. Highly recommend this! Best chemical sunscreen ☀️
