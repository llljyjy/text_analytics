Let’s start with, I’m a fan of Supergoop so when I saw this new product I was super happy to give it a try. I normally use their Glow Screen SPF 40 but since I’m in my late 30’s and this product target fine lines I feel like it best for me. It seems like it’s tinted but when you apply it looks clear. Does not makes my skin oily, I do like to apply another moisturizer under because this alone my skin does not feel as much moisturized - like the SPF mentioned above.  It does melts into the skin as does not have a strong fragrance. SPF + targets fine line  - good purchase
