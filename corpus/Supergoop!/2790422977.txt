Unseen Sunscreen has an interesting gel consistency that immediately absorbs into the skin. It really in unseen, although I could feel it drying my skin out. The scent is mildly unpleasant. It feels more like a primer that goes over moisturizer. At this price point, there are much better options. I would recommend either EltaMD or Thank You Farmer. nan
