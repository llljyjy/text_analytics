First - I bought this in February and it expired in October of the same year which is incredibly frustrating - there’s no way I would have used all of the product before it expired. I Wanted to love this but didn’t at all. It takes a few minutes to rub in / settle on your skin, but it still looks incredibly fake and thick. Also transfers extremely easily if you touch / something touches your face.  Ended up buying the OG Glow Screen and using it instead. Not worth the purchase
