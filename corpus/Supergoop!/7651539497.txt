This product was gifted to me by Supergoop! and I honestly think it works pretty well. It does have a strong sunscreen scent and the sprayer isn’t the most gentle, however it left my skin feeling like normal. It didn’t feel like I used anything on my face, was not sticky in any way and the scent went away almost instantly. I can definitely see myself using this product all summer long! Perfect for Summer!
