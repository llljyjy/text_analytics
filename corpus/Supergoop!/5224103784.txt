I recommend buying the smaller version and when you finish that size buy the larger size to refill it. The 1oz version has a WAY BETTER nozzle that sprays more consistently and works with the way they advise you to spray your face in a circular motion. The 3.4oz is a great value but the 1oz packaging works better ESPECIALLY if you plan to use this over makeup and worry about it ruining it. Personally I like this sunscreen and on a hot day the scent is refreshing and cooling and I don’t even like rosemary. I’m on Tretinoin and it doesn’t sting my skin or leave it irritated. And it doesn’t leave you looking ghostly or casket ready!Lastly, this doesn’t sting my eyes but it does taste weird. So hold your breath and tuck your lips in when applying like they state on the packaging! Worth a Try!
