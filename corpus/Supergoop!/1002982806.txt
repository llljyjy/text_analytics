I enjoy this product, I have been using it all week. It is a chemical sunscreen so when it gets in my eyes it’s a bit irritating. I have a medium skin tone and to me this is perfect especially right now in the summer time, it gives such a nice glow and is really easy to apply, it doesn’t transfer on my phone or clothes! I haven’t tried the regular glow screen so I can’t say which one I like better but this is nice! This is a great everyday spf! Works very well under makeup no pilling at all. I had to tone down my hydrating products in the beginning because I was greasy glowy looking, now I just add vit c, light moisturizer and this! Love this!
