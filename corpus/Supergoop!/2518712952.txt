I love that has SPF 50 for that maximum protection. I need all I can get now that I am almost 50 myself. It has a very watery texture so it’s lightweight and absorbs very quickly. I did not any white cast after application. If you don’t like the scent of sunscreen then you won’t like this one. I don’t mind it at all in fact I rather enjoy it. The packaging is also so adorable! This was gifted by Supergoop but love is my own. Good option
