I was super excited to try this because I heard great reviews but this might literally be the worst product in existence. It made me look so oily and emphasized every pore and wrinkle. I also have sensitive skin and it broke me out so bad. Please save your money and skin barrier and buy a Korean sunscreen instead. donâ€™t buy!!!
