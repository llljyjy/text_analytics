Humans arenâ€™t the only ones that like the smell of this spf! I sprayed this on myself outside and a bee immediately began swarming me and landed on the nozzle. Never buying this again. The product is also expensive for how much spf you get. Between myself and my husband, we almost completely used up a brand new can after a half day at the beach. Will Attract Bees
