This is one of my all time favorite sunscreens. It is so nice under makeup as a primer or on its own during the day. It’s great for sensitive skin too and has the slightest tint which makes it perfecting on days where I don’t need a ton of coverage. Note that it is slightly pearlized so just keep that in mind, it won’t be matte (duh, it is called GLOW screen). Highly recommend!! 10/10. Amazing sunscreen
