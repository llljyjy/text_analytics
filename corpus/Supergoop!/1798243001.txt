The bottle is adorable! I love the shape and the baby blue dropper applicator which makes it easy to dispense the liquid. The oil is packed with hydrating ingredients and keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long. It can be used as a replacement for your regular moisturizer or on top of your moisturizer if your skin needs extra hydration. The oil is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t leave behind any unwanted greasy residue on the skin. I love the added SPF! I know I can’t be the only one who sometimes forgets to apply sunscreen especially during the colder months. The oil assures that my skin still gets the (sun) protection it needs.
