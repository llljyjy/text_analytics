woc here, i tried the original version of this but it was too pearlescent, this one is perfect and blends right into my nc45 skintone without an ounce of ashiness. its a beautiful lightweight gel liquidy lotion type spf, it hasnt irritated my skin either. HOWEVER, i wouldnt rely on this as my sole spf. its just too luminous to apply the large amount of spf you need to cover full UVB/UVA so i use this now as a makeup step vs spf/skincare OR on TOP of a heavy duty spf because the tint in this is helpful (google iron oxides). also would love to see this sold in a mini size so people of all skintones can have the smaller/less expensive option to choose from. almost perfect
