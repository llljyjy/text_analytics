I was gifted by Supergoop and so far, I love this product! It came in handy today while I had on a full face of makeup, but forgot to apply sunscreen before hand. It smells great and my skin definitely felt protected. I think the only drawback is I was a bit shiny, but that can probably be prevented with some blotting! nan
