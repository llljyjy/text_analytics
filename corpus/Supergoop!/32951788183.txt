Complimentary from Supergoop!Compared to other facial oils I’ve used, this one feels more lightweight. It doesn’t have a fragrance to it, but it does have that “oil smell” to it. Upon immediate application, this has a glowy finish. However, after a minute or two, it dries down to a satin finish. I used two-three drops for day time use, but to be completely honest, my skin was not any more moisturized than usual. I have dry combination skin, but I still spotted the usual flakiness despite using this oil. In addition, the additional SPF is supposed to be a selling point, but I find it really pointless because I’d have to use a lot of this to get sufficient SPF coverage, but given that it’s a facial oil, I can’t use too much of it. This means I’d have to pair it with my usual sunscreen, so using the facial oil for the SPF is kinda redundant at that point. Overall, wasn’t super impressed with this. nan
