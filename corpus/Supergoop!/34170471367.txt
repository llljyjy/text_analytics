No white cast on my brown skin! I have used this a few times and have had no inflammation or irritation like I get with some sunscreen. It is suggested to layer this with something else that has spf, so I use a facial moisturizer with spf in it. This leaves my skin so soft and not oily. I do recommend. No white cast!
