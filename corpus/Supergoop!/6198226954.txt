I like the texture, tint, and feel of this, but it started pilling making my cheeks look really dry - I don’t wear foundation or any makeup over my sunscreen so I’m not sure what would have caused it. It’s a shame because I liked everything else about it. Perhaps it was my vitamin C serum under it, but I had let it dry very several minutes before applying the sunscreen. Does mattify, but also pilled
