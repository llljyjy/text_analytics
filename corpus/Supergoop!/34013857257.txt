I have tried many different sunscreen SPF products for my face of combo oily and dry skin. This is by far one of my favorite products to date. Most products leave white streaks that don’t feel or look pleasant. However, this product absorbs into my skin so well without any noticeable white streaks. I have a medium skin tone and this leaves me with a light Dewey look and feel. I apply Moroccan oil to my cleansed face for hydration then layer this over and it’s worked wonders on my face. 10/10 would recommend. Great product!
