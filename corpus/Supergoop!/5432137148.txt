This is not a bad sunblock at all but it is overpriced for something SO similar to their “Body“ PLAY EVERYDAY LOTION which they SPECIFICALLY advertise as usable on the face. Similarities: -VERY similar texture. Maybe a little more watery, a little less tacky -Identical appearance on skin. This isn’t a matte invisible lotion, it will leave your face with that telltale sunblock shine/“glow“ that some people like. I put this Face lotion on one-half and their EVERYDAY PLAY on the other half, wore it throughout the day, indistinguishable. Same “glow“ that by the end was a little oily because of my combination skin-Same smell / minimal and inoffensive Differences-Like I said, maybe a LITTLE runnier and a LITTLE less tacky -More face friendly ingredients about pollution and blue-light blocking -Packaging, I guess It’s not in itself a bad sunblock, far from it, and I won’t be returning my purchase. Once I finish it though, I’m going to have a hard time justifying paying twice the cost for what feels and looks and protects exactly like their other sunblock lotion. If I was going to pay THAT much, I feel like I should just get their UNSEEN SUNCREEN which applies so silky and looks so demi-matte. Hard for me to repurchase, hard for me to recommend when there’s better bang for the buck within the same brand. Overpriced version of their PLAY EVERYDAY LOTION
