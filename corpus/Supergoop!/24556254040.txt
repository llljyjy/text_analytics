I love it! It sprays on really nice, doesn’t feel sticky or tacky in anyway! It does smell like sunscreen, but only for like the first couple sentences & then it’s nice. I didn’t personally use it as a “setting spray” technically. I didn’t really have any makeup on other than mascara, but I just used it for some SPF & I really like it. I would recommend it to others!
