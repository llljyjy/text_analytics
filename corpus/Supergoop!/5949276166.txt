I like the glow that comes with this but I wish the tint came in different colors because I felt it made my medium deep skin look a light lighter than it usulaly is. I’m not sure if I’m a huge fan of it on its own, but I like it under makeup so that the look goes from sweaty/greesy to glow. Wearing makeup also covered the “lighter skin“ experience I mentioned earlier. nan
