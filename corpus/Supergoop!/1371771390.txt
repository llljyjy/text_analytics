This sounds like a great idea.  The handle has clear instructions for open and close to get powder out.  Only, the powder doesn’t cone out.  I shook and shook it.  So, can’t use it on the go which is why I bought it.  I can open up powder container and put it in tray but I can’t use brush.  The center powder dispenser (that doesn’t work) is the same length as bristles, so it scratches my face when I use the brush.  Such a poorly designed item. Doesn’t work. Powder doesn’t come out of brush.
