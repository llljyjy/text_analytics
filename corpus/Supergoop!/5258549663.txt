Supergoop products are a hit and miss for me mainly bc of the texture and how my dry skin feels with it. I was really surprised how much I liked this one! It’s “serum“ like texture helped it seep easily into my skin! its slightly tinted but doesn’t leave a true color or white cast. Huge plus for a sunscreen. And a daytime retinol? So cool! nan
