smells pleasant and blends into the skin quickly. i used a relatively small amount one day and makeup went on well, had no reaction. on the second day i squeezed it out on three fingers and it felt like way too much. i ended up breaking out slightly. just a heads up! otherwise it’s a good creamy alt to my paula’s choice. nan
