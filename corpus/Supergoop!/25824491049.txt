I was really upset that this did not work out for me since I saw everyone on TikTok urging others to buy it. I tried putting on a different moisturizer, different primer, no primer, and no moisturizer under this product to see if any of these were the problem, and it still did not work. It looked great in pictures/videos and from a distance in my mirror, but in real life it was patchy and pilling off of my skin. It just would not absorb in certain spots no matter how hard I tried and would always pill as soon as I touched my face. It definitely looks great at first but starts wearing down immediately after application. overhyped
