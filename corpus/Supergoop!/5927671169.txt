I love that this product combines the SPF benefits of a sunscreen with the hydrating benefits of a facial oil.  Even though I still layer on an additional sunscreen for added SPF, it makes me feel better knowing this oil is doing more for my skin than typical facial oils.  Sunscreen usually feels heavy and greasy on my face and occasionally leaves a whitecast, but this innovative oil format is lightweight and clear so it doesn’t leave behind a residue and is not sticky.  Unlike the traditional unpleasant sunscreen scent, this oil has a subtle, nutty aroma.  After moisturizer, I apply three drops of this oil to my face and neck and it gives my skin a beautiful glow.  I don’t have to wait very long before it fully absorbs, and I have not experienced any pilling despite mixing sunscreen types and applying makeup on top. I can re-apply this after a few hours on no makeup days without my face feeling greasy, but when wearing makeup, I’d suggest re-applying using Supergoop’s resetting mineral powder sunscreen to ensure makeup doesn’t break apart.  This was sent to me complimentary from Supergoop. Hydration and SPF in one? Sign me up!
