I heard that this product was great to wear under makeup. Although I haven’t tried doing that yet, it probably is because it is extremely mattifying. Unfortunately, this is also what I don’t like about it. My skin feels uncomfortably dry after I put it on. It has a very weird texture, and after wearing it for a week straight I was quite disenchanted. On the plus side, like all Supergoop products, it is cruelty-free and reef-safe. I absolutely adore this brand and use a LOT of its products, but I won’t buy this one again. Not right for my skin
