I received this complimentary from Supergoop for my honest review.  This is a great hydrating, non-greasy sunscreen. I do think watery lotion is an accurate description of the formula. It doesn’t pill and can be layered well. It does smell a little like alcohol when you first put it on but then it fades to a light sunscreen smell. It leaves your skin a little dewy but it doesn’t feel too heavy. I like this the most of all supergoop sunscreens. Good Daily Lightweight Sunscreen
