This was gifted by Supergoop! Much excitement for using goop sunscreen!! It is incredibly light and has no residue left behind! What more could you ask for. Has a very subtle scent but nothing too overpowering and there has been no reaction either. I love that it doesn’t ruin my day makeup and it is also waterproof! It’s also a cute bottle that I can carry in my bag, but one thing I don’t like is that it’s little quantity that I would probably run out of in just a month because of daily usage. Love how handy it is! And no residue!
