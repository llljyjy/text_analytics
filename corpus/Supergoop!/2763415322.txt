I did not get this as a gift from Supergoop lol, but I did purchase it a couple of days ago.  I agree with what everyone says about the application - it glides right on, sinks in well, super lightweight.  It does have a strong smell, unlike some of their other sunscreens, but it doesn’t bother me personally.  If you’re super sensitive to sunscreen smell then it might.  However, I don’t like the super reflective glow that it gives me. I know that super dewey look tends to be “in” right now, but I prefer something a little more subtle.  If I’m putting makeup over it I think it’s fine, but if that’s all I’m wearing, my skin looks a little too reflective for my liking.  I’ll still use up the bottle, but tbd if I decide to repurchase.  Just depends on how well I’m able to combat the shininess. nan
