I love every single SuperGoop product I’ve tried and I always prefer muti-purpose products so I’m glad this works as a primer and as my sunscreen! The golden hour is a bit too dark for me, so I use it under or mix it with foundations that are a bit too light for me to balance out the brightness.  It absorbed easily and it’s hydrating, giving me a radiant glow. nan
