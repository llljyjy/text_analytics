This booster is suitable for my combination skin.  This product is well distributed over the skin and is absorbed within 2 minutes.  At first I feel a little oily texture, but after a few minutes it goes away and I don’t feel any discomfort.  I really like that this booster contains SPF, I put it on my face once and don’t worry when I go out in the sun.  I also sometimes put on make-up and I am absolutely satisfied with the way my face looks.  The facial skin is moisturized, smooth and silky. Perfect booster
