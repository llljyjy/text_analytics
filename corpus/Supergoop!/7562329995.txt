Supergoop is hands-down the best sunscreen on the market!! I absolutely love the Glow Screen for that ‘no-makeup’ makeup look, giving you a bit of color and a gorgeous glowy sheen. I find that my makeup sits well on top of this sunscreen, and even without a full face, this product is perfect with a touch of cream blush and concealer for a natural finish. I also have the Unseen Sunscreen, and I find that I reach for this one more instead! Definitely recommend this for anyone looking to try a new sunscreen, it is worth every penny! Best Sunscreen Ever!
