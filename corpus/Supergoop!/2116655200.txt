I received this product complimentary from Supergoop!, all opinions are my own. I have used this a few times and I love the convenience of it- it makes reapplying SPF super easy. I find the mist to be super fine which makes it easy to apply evenly all over. The first time I used it, I made the mistake of not tucking my lips in, and it stung a bit. Additionally, I personally do not like the rosemary & mint scent, but it doesn’t linger long so it doesn’t bother me. great SPF for on the go
