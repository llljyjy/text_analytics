I really like this sunscreen! It feels light weight and doesn’t feel greasy. It doesn’t leave a white cast and has a nice citrus scent, which I also like. I can’t really stand the scent of most sunscreen products. My only complains are that it does tend to break me out a little, and burns my eyes when it starts to sweat off. No white cast!
