As someone who deals with vitiligo, SPF is very important to me. I want to be sure I have it on every time I go outside, rain or shine. And this Supergoop Glowscreen has become a staple in my beauty routine. I love how the tint gives my skin the perfect natural, bronzy glow, and protects me from those harsh UV rays. I am so excited to keep using this over the summer, and have been telling all of my friends. YOU NEED THIS! Not A Want, A NEED!
