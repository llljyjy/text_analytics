I’m so excited that I finally got to try the (re)setting refreshing mist with SPF 40 by super goop! I love the concept of being able to set my make up, refresh it, and get some sun protection at the same time. A couple of things to note:- it has a scent, which I like a lot. Keep that in mind if you are someone who is sensitive to scents. -Reading product reviews, I made a note to close my eyes when using the spray to not experience any stinging. -I’m pretty satisfied with the spray, but if the mist far is slightly finer I suppose it would be better- but that’s just my personal preference. Gifted by supergoop, I hope you found my review helpful :) nan
