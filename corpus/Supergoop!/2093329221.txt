I was first drawn to the product because I love the idea of a daytime retinol. This serum makes my skin feel so smooth after just one week of using it and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I love the ingredients in it and have loved everything by this brand. I’ve found that my fine lines have minimized and my skin just looks so much healthier while using it! This is amazing!
