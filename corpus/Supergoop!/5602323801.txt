Been using this for over a year, and wanted to drop in and sing its praises. This stuff is AWESOME. I actually use it instead of foundation on days when I don’t want heavy foundation (especially under a mask) but still want SPF and some glow. Don’t expect this to cover/conceal zits, etc. on the skin, but it will even out the skin tone a bit and provides a pretty glowiness. In short, it makes me look alive! Kudos to Supergoop for always coming out with creative SPF products. This is a good one! Been using for a year - I recommend!
