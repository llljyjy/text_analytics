I love a travel spf that doesnâ€™t disturb my makeup! I carry in my purse for the backs of my hands too! This one feels good, sprays easily and no mess. It has a nice Minty feel. It does make up tubing mascara smear on my upper lid. Brow bone area/crease area. So I have to be sure to keep my eyes closed until dry. Gifted by Supergoop Easy spf touch up
