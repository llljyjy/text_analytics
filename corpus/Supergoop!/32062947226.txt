It’s a summer essential! Run don’t walk to Sephora and pick yourself the watery lotion SPF. This is such a cool formula. it is super watery/ liquid-y, it has zero sticky feeling and it blends right in. This is for sure going to be my fav SPF for summer. The packaging is also perfect to carry around. Gifted by Supergoop. Get your hands on this!
