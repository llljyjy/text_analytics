This was gifted by Supergoop! This sunscreen is great! It smells like your typical sunscreen, however, it’s extremely light weight and dries down clear. It does not leave a white cast or any residue. It feels a little oily for a couple minutes while it dries down, but once it absorbs it’s almost undetectable. Amazing sunscreen!
