I love this stuff! It doesn’t feel oily or heavy on my skin and it doesn’t transfer. I like how it layers well with other products, even makeup. So far it gives me good protection from the sun even without reapplying. Only giving it four stars because the yellow cap is about the same size as the package. I think I should’ve gotten a little more product for the price. I was not expecting it to be this small. nan
