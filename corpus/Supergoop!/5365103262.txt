I’ve definitely had a different experience with this product than some of those negative reviews. The formula is definitely thick but I find it covers, blends, and brightens nicely. I normally only use this when I know I’m going to be out in the sun for the day. It’s so gentle and never stings plus I find that the thick creamy texture keeps this from running or getting greasy as you sweat or swim. nan
