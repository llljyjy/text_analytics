I am a lover of SPF and of Supergoop, but dang… do not put this anywhere near your eyes. I was in agony. I don’t want to waste it so I am using it on my neck and chest, because never will I ever put this on my face again. My eyes were swollen and red and burning the entire day until I washed it all off of my face. Burned the Baloney out of my eyes
