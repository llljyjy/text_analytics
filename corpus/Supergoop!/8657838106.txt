I was using uv clear for a while, however it really hurt to pay that much for sunscreen that you’re supposed to use every day and use liberally. I get a little over 3X more product with Supergoop, and it’s still cheaper. I was on the hunt from something that wouldn’t break the bank, and, at the same time, had an elegant feel/look to it. I finally found it. Relative to what all is out there, this is much more affordable, without compromising on the quality of the product. It definitely makes you glowy, maybe even a slightly greasy, but I prefer this to a matte finish. I also live in a very hot and humid climate, we all look a little dewy anyways. I like the way it looks and feels and how it looks under makeup. Hasn’t burned my eyes. Will be buying again. Elegant bang your buck
