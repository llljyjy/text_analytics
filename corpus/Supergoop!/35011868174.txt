Supergroup! has done it again with this SPF and I’m a fan. I tried this product last week and I was not disappointed. The texture is light-weight and it melts into skin like a dream with no tackiness or residue. It didn’t leave a white cast and the watery texture wasn’t greasy or sticky. I love the packaging and can definitely throw this product in my purse for quick touch ups throughout the day. If you’re on the hunt for a new SPF for the spring/summer, then look no further. Supergoop! is it. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop! Supergoop! Has Done It Again
