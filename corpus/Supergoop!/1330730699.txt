This stuff is not heavy- if you’ve ever used benefit porefessional this is exactly that. It’s mousse like and light. The tint doesn’t leave a tint- it blends in totally clear on me. Was so sick of heavy sunscreens feeling like tooth paste on my skin. This is one of the most comfortable ones I’ve ever used. a primer feeling spf!
