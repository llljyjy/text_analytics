I was gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my honest opinion. Supergoop has really done it again. This setting mist is a total game changer and a must have for the summer. It help set my makeup without leaving any shine or grease. I do have dry skin and it is a mattifying mist but, It’s great for all skin types. The mist itself was very refreshing, so I was able to take it with me on the go to help re-set my face when I can feel my makeup break up. I love that it has SPF 40 as well to help protect my skin from the summer heat, and it doesn’t leave annoying whitecast! Your Summer Bestie!
