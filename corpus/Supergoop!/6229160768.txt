This was gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my honest opinion. This sunscreen is a lightweight oil with beneficial active ingredients that lock in moisture and target dryness. Great for anyone with dry flaking skin like me (thanks Retin-A!). I used three drops as suggested which didn’t make my skin too oily. Afterwards I layered on another brand’s moisturizer. No weird pilling or anything strange which a pleasant surprise. It also felt good knowing I was getting adequate sun protection and giving my skin a healthy dose of beneficial ingredients. I enjoyed this product and will continue to use this since SPF protection and dryness management is important for me. nan
