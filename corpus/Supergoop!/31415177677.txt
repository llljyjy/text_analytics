The price is painful for me but it’s stupidly good. The only sunscreen I’ve ever used that doesn’t feel like I poured melted butter on my face. Will I buy it again? Probably. Will I hate the price every time? Definitely. It actually is unseen! I can’t feel or see anything on my face. Makeup and other products go well over it but let it dry for a few minutes for best results if you’re layering products. actually really good
