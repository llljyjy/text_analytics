I’d read the reviews complaining that this pills but I thought I’d risk it because nothing like sunscreen during those bright, sunny summer days, right? I regret that. It really does pill the minute you use anything other than very very gentle tapping motions or even lightly tug at the under eye area. It has a weird dry down, too, kind of patchy and powdery. Does not at all feel hydrating or moisturizing or nourishing. I can’t even imagine trying to go over this with makeup. I guess the slight pigment means that you can get away with only this if you’re feeling a natural kind of day, but I’d dread using concealer over this product. The consistency is super thick though and it does that thing where it dries in a gloopy, thick ball and jams up the nozzle where the product comes out of. I don’t think I’ll purchase this again. Pills, dies down unpleasantly, too thick
