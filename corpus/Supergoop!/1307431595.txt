This isnâ€™t a terrible product; I only wish for this to have transparent packaging so I can see how much I have left and the price point is not attractive to me. I have combo skin and at first, this sunscreen made me really oily. I use this in replacement as my moisturizer and after a while my skin became adjusted and it gives me a nice dewy finish. It has a lot of ceramides which is great to restore/repair natural skin barrier. I would repurchase if they made the adjustments in packaging and $. the first & last time I will purchase
