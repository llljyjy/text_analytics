Perfect for outdoor activities. If you love running outside and hate your face melting in the heat this is perfect. I have a grease ball face and when I work out I need something that won’t just melt off me while I’m sweating outside. This is a perfect sunscreen. It stays matte and when I reapply it doesn’t feel too caked on. It works well on my friends skin who’s a man (sweats way more than me by the way). I love that it’s mineral, it doesn’t burn to put it all over your face if you have sensitive skin. The only issue I have is that if im not using it for sweat inducing activities it makes my skin feel a bit dry. But more like theirs a nice smooth powdery veil kind of dry. I guess that is the point though for it to be mattifying. As a primer type situation I love it my eyeliner doesn’t imprint itself to my brow bone. Perfect. Light, Airy, Invisible, sweat proof
