Okay this product is amazing. I got the deeper shade and I thought it was going to be too dark, but it turned out to be perfect. The color is basically a tint and looks so good. I wasn’t sure if the glow was going to be too much, but it’s perfect and natural. I have oily skin so I will have to see if it gets too oily in the sun. This sunscreen is amazing…
