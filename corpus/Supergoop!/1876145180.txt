I love Supergoop as a brand. From the packaging to their unique colors and brand vibe. I purchased this item directly through their website, as you can almost always get it at a discounted price buying direct from them. I was excited when it came in the mail and used it, sprayed all over my face. It felt nice on my face, not too oily and it was easy to build. My main issue with this product is that it stung my eyes so badly. And not for a short period of time. I sprayed this when I was out and about, three hours later when I got home my eyes were still stinging as if I had just sprayed it. Long lasting! But in this case itâ€™s unfortunate. I reached out to them and they refunded my order. AMAZING customer service, this product just did not work for me. Stung eyes, but good customer service
