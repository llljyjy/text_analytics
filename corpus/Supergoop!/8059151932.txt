1. I am NC35, and this does not leave a white cast2. have oily skin, and this does not make you greasy3. this is the only mineral sunscreen, that does not have a tint, still does not make you white.4. I reasearched a lot before buying this, and what you will notice is, all other mineral high end sunscreens are in the range of 28-50 bucks, but only offer you 30-50(1.7 oz/ 50 mL) ml of product. This however, is a bit expensive, at least for me, but you get twice the quantity 3.4 oz/ 100 mL for a good price. Brown/Oily skin approved
