This has definitely grown on me. On the days I spend more time outside and still want some coverage, I like to wear this over another sunscreen layer to minimize the risk of taking away protection. I trust Supergoop products and love how they post their SPF efficacy reports for full disclosure. Also, so many other mineral-based tinted sunscreen products have red undertones or that sickly zinc-based bluish purple cast, so I was very pleased to see options for golden undertones that actually work for my skin. For reference, I wear 346W and my other shade matches are MAC NC42, NARS Syracuse, Fenty 310, and Estee Lauder Double Wear 4N2. Texture-wise, it’s a thicker, almost mousse-like consistency that’s similar to the PUR Bare It All foundation, if you’ve ever used that, so I find this applies best with fingers or a brush. I get medium buildable coverage with a natural matte finish, which I prefer. I only wish this was also water/sweat-resistant, but otherwise, this personally ticks every box for me. All in all, very pleasantly surprised by this product. Pleasantly surprised
