Was so excited for this based on Taylor Wynn’s recommendation. Unfortunately disappointing in a few ways: first of all, it is way too glowy to wear alone. It’s probably a good glowy primer under a matte foundation, but for a no makeup day it made me feel like the tin man. More importantly, after a few uses the screw top base separated from the rest of the packaging, so when I squeeze the tube product oozes out and gets everywhere (there are photos from other reviewers who had the same experience). I never burned wearing it so it at least functions as a sunscreen. Terrible packaging, too much glow
