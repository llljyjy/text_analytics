I use SPF daily whether I am inside or outside. The packaging is perfect for throwing in your bag to travel so you donâ€™t forget to reapply! I have combination skin and I do not need to use moisturizer. It applies and absorbs seamlessly into my skin. It feels really hydrating on my skin and did not make my skin feel or look greasy. I usually wear this alone for a bone makeup glow, yet when I have worn makeup over this and it does not pill. This SPF shields from UV rays AND blue light! I am a teacher so I have been on the computer everyday. I am enthusiastic to continue using this in my skincare regimen. I genuinely recommend this if you are looking for a sheer, smooth finish while preventing signs of aging. Gorgeous Luminous No Makeup Sunscreen
