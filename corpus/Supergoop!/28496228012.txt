I love this product alone. The color is really nice, it has a really light scent to it, and it makes my skin look alive. Only downside is you have to be careful what you layer on top. Depending on the product it might cause pilling:/ personally my Kosas concealer and saie highlight do not agree with it. Beautiful alone, but pulling can occur
