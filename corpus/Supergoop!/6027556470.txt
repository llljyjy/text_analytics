This was gifted to me by Supergoop! This is the first sunscreen oil I’ve ever used and I was pleasantly surprised. It’s not greasy, it’s a light layer that sinks into the skin leaving it looking dewy. I didn’t love how my makeup looked on top of it but I only tried to to test it out because normally I wouldn’t wear an oil like this under makeup. I think this product is better used when you’re not wearing makeup. I have dry skin so I really love locking in all of the moisture I can with an oil and this one is great. Every time I’ve used this I have noticed my skin feels plumper and looks more soft and supple than it had before. The packaging is easy to use and the lid closes tightly and doesn’t leak (which is so important with an oil and travel!) I think overall this product is so innovative I would continue to repurchase.
