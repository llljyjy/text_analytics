I was really looking forward to this product-A one stop shop multitasker product. Great coverage and feels like makeup when you apply the correct amount for sunscreen. But it oxidizes and definitely not worth the price. Luckily I found it for half the price at TJ Maxx and not expired. Best to put your money towards their Unseen Sunscreen I do pay full price for that quality. Agree-skip it!
