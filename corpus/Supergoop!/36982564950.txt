I do not love this sunscreen. The unseen part about it is perfect (which is why I give this product 2 stars) but the texture is a no from me. It feels very weird putting it on to the skin but it leaves my skin so greasy for at least an hour. The product itself is greasy, and it shows on the skin. Wouldnâ€™t recommend it. Greasy...
