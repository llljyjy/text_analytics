I have mixed feelings about this Supergoop daily dose hydra-ceramide boost + spf. It’s super oily and doesn’t really ever absorb into the skin. I have dry skin so I usually don’t mind this in a product but this was so oily! I only use a few drops and my face looks so greasy. I don’t think this product would work for someone with oily skin. Because I’m only using a small amount, I’m not sure how much it actually protects against the sun. It does seem to moisturize my skin well though. I do like this product when I’m wearing makeup. It gives a nice dewy look. Overall, it’s okay but I don’t think it’s worth the price. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop! Not worth the price
