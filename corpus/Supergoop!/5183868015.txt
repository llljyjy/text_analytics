Ticks all the boxes for me! Doesnâ€™t break me out (even with a slight coconut scent and silicone-y feeling), easy to blend in, works for all skin tones, and wears well over my skincare and under makeup. I wore this on vacation in San Francisco this summer and my makeup looked flawless after 10 hours of windy cruises and sweaty sightseeing.  Had to knock a star off for the price, wish it was at least bigger. nan
