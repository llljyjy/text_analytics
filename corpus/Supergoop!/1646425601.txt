I have been a fan of Supergoop for awhile, and I was really excited to try this new version of the glow screen. At first, it was a little darker than I anticipated, but it blended out nicely and the color kind of settled in over time. My skin tone is fair-light, so I couldn’t wear this in the winter. However, it’s a great shade match for me when I’m self tanned. It has a beautiful glow, and looks nice on its own or under makeup. Another great product from Supergoop! Supergoop
