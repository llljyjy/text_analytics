I received the Supergoop Daily Dose Hydra-Ceramide Boost + SPF complimentary from Supergoop. The oil has SPF 40 which is unique in oil-based skincare. The oil has no synthetic fragrance. I smelled no scent at all. The product is also vegan and reef safe. I use this oil mixed with my facial creams and makes it easier for the cream to hold in my moisture and bring back oil into my skin after it has been washed. The oil is lightweight and not heavy on my skin. I can also use this without the cream too but I like it even more with the cream since it helps retain moisture and revive my dry skin especially since accidentally over-exfoliate, I had no breakouts on my skin even when I have acne-prone skin. I would suggest using this 30 minutes before going outside so the oil can absorb more into the skin. Soft and Moisturized Skin
