I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. I like that this sunscreen is in a mister bottle. It makes it easy to re-apply the sunscreen on top of my makeup throughout the day. The natural scent of rosemary is pleasant. The two issues I have is that, I always seem to get it in my eyes, and this mist does make my skin shiny (like oily). nan
