Holy grail!!! I hate wearing sunscreen on my face. It’s thick, greasy, leaves a white cast and clogs my pores. This is the complete opposite. It’s clear, goes on like a gel primer, absorbs immediately and doesn’t clog my pores. I didn’t want to love this so much because it’s kind of pricey, but it’s worth the money hands down. It also goes on flawlessly under makeup. Will recommend to everyone (especially those who hate wearing sunscreen like I do). I now look forward to putting on sunscreen in the morning. nan
