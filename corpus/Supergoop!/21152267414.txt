I was very excited to try the glow screen from Supergoop just due to the sheer amount of good reviews from social media. It did not disappoint in the slightest. An amazing base for light makeup that makes your face glow from within. Even alone, this product was great. I however wouldnâ€™t recommend for oily consumers as it may be too glowy. Overall, great experience and absolutely lived up to the reviews! Lived up to the rave!
