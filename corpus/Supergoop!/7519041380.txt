I’ve been looking for a face sunscreen that doesn’t bother me with being super heavy and sticky and I finally found one! I was sent this product in exchange for my review and I am so glad. Last summer I tried a friend of mines super goop sunscreen stick, and although I liked that better, i’m really happy to see how much I love the brand. I am so happy to see that they aren’t only cruelty free but reef safe as well. The tint wasn’t super notice for me so I don’t see why anyone would have problems with it.  I can’t wait to use this all summer! nan
