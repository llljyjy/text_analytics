Sunscreen is okay, I like the concept of a primer/SPF but it does feel like a layer on top of my face and I can’t imagine the tint is universal for everyone since it doesn’t blend in all the way? The packaging is what really gets me - the orifice is super small and there are a ton of air bubbles in the formula so the product spits out a lot, I have to hold it away from me. I’m also near the the end of the tube and need to crumple it to get product out, but there’s kind of a significant amount leftover that it’s been like this for 2+ weeks now. Honestly, the entire experience was annoying enough that I won’t buy it again. Just ok, packaging sucks
