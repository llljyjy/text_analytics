I was shocked at how lovely this was on my skin after trying a couple others (tried the IT cosmetics one and it was basically like theatre makeup... just awful & I couldn’t wait to wash it off). This goes on thick in terms of knowing you’re getting the SPF coverage, but blends well and the whiteness goes away after a minute. It looks radiant & glowy and has great coverage without being heavy or pancakey. I thought the color would be too light until it settled. If I add a little quick contour with some bronzer (i’d recommend since the coverage is medium+), it looks like my normal light liquid makeup face. It’s really beautiful on the skin and doesn’t feel uncomfortable (I don’t like the feeling of Ilia spf serum for instance, it feels heavy and icky). So this is my fave by FAR and I hope they DO NOT CHANGE IT! FYI I’m 45, very pale & have some hyperpigmentation marks from months/years past of acne (late in life). Pic is of a quick application today with only blush and a tiny bit of bronzer added. My Fave - GORGEOUS glowy finish & medium+ coverage
