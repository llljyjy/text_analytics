Product is a bit messy to dispense/apply but works pretty well. I don’t think this is the most powerful sun protection in supergoop’s line since I’ve gotten a mild burn while wearing vs other products, but I’m not religious about reapplying every couple hours. I have more tanned skin, so I appreciate the non chalky look and the more hydrating ingredients. Product is scented but it doesn’t bother me. nan
