Supergoop is such an amazing brand, and I am a huge fan of their SPF and refreshing spray. I use it as a base before and after my makeup, and it literally lasts all day. I have trouble reapplying SPF constantly, but this bottle fits in my bag and itâ€™s so easy to just spray in my face to refresh my makeup and reapply sunscreen. The smell is subtle but I like it. It dries down beautifully and leaves my makeup looking fresh! I was gifted by supergoop! Refreshes my makeup & so easy to reapply sunscreen
