the definition of a sunscreen without a white cast. i took one star off tho because of the price; it’s far too expensive! but it’s super lightweight and applies easily. doesn’t irritate my sensitive, acne-prone, combo-dry skin. very interesting gel-like (almost silicone-y?) texture. honestly love it! nan
