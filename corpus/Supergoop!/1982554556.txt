As much as I LOVE this product, I can’t get over the money I’ve lost because every. single. time. the pump malfunctions. Because I loved the formulation so much, for years I’ve repurchased hoping that supergoop would fix this issue, especially since it seems to be fairly common, but I’ve been disappointed each time. Another sunscreen brand finally came out with a similar product and that pump has been working like a dream. Love it, but have to leave it
