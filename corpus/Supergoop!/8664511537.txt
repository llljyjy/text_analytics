I purchased a bottle for a four day trip to the Caribbean during October. I ended up sharing it with my two friends because they loved the scent so much and the bottle lasted right up till the end of our trip. No white cast, reef safe, lovely light scent, gentle on body/face, and super easy to use. During our trip I acquired a cut on my leg from snorkeling, the spray was super gentle when I used it on that skin area. It does leave a bit of a shine on the skin, my friends and I didnâ€™t care for it since it was so hot and humid our bodies were constantly sweaty. Amazing product! No lobster colored skin here! A must have for my skin
