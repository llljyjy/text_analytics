This was gifted by Supergoop! This is perfect for reapplying sunscreen when you are out and about. I love having this in my purse because I can easily reapply sunscreen midday over my makeup. As a bonus, it refreshes my makeup! I’d say if you’re concern is being to lo shiny, don’t be, because it doesn’t make my combo skin any oilier. This will be in full rotation and ohh summer coming up! perfect for spf reapplication!
