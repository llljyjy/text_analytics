I wanted to love this but it broke me out immediately after using the first time. I havenâ€™t had this issue with their Unseen Sunscreen. I also have a med-tan skin color and found it too light & metallic looking. It would be nice to have deeper color options for those this does work for. Unfortunate breakout
