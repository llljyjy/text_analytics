This is pretty nice! I’m no sunscreen expert; shamefully, I’m just now getting into the habit of wearing it regularly at 24. Historically, I’ve hated the feeling and smell of sunscreen on my face, and this one isn’t as bad as some others I’ve tried. It’s very glowy! Like almost metallic glowy if you’re using the proper amount. For that reason, I like it under makeup but I don’t know if I’d wear it on its own. It doesn’t pill or bunch up under my foundations, and it doesn’t have an unbearable smell throughout the day. It sinks in pretty well, although it’s by no means undetectable, especially in heat and humidity. It does have a nice tint that evens out the skin tone, so if you don’t mind how glowy it is on its own, I think it’s a good substitute for a base product. Can’t complain!
