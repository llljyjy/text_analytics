When i received the product i was excited because i love to have a glow to my face ‘hence’ glow screen. Packaging simple and small enough to put in my purse. Doesn’t have the typical sunscreen smell it’s very faint! But babyyyyy when i applied the glow screen and it set all the way in! IT WAS THE GLOW FOR ME! Meanwhile still protecting my skin from the Sun rays. And it also is very lightweight! I LOVE IT! ABSOLUTELY LOVE
