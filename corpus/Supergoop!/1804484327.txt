Love this sunscreen.  This replaces my foundation on casual days.  It is very matte, great coverage, works almost like a primer as well.  I wear sunscreen year-round, and with moisturizer, primer, sunscreen, foundation, etc. it is a lot of layers.  With this, it cuts it way back, and seems to do the trick.I had avoided this brand, as I assumed it was connected with Gwynyth Paltrow, but itâ€™s not. Combo Sunscreen/Foundation/Primer
