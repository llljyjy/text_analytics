Iâ€™ve been using the Supergoop! Glow Sunscreen SPF 40 for the past couple of days and love it! The texture is like a really light moisturizer and dries down semi-matte, which I prefer because a lot of sunscreens can often be too dewy/greasy. It has a light cream tone which blends out really nicely on my South Asian brown skin and best of all, does NOT sting the eyes!! nan
