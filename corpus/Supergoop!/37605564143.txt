I have been wanting to try the Supergoop! Glow Screen for so long and it was worth the wait! It feels super lightweight on my face which I love for all day wear. It gives enough of a glow to wear alone, or to build on top of with makeup. It doesnâ€™t have the thick consistency or strong smell of a usual sunscreen, which makes it that much better! This will absolutely become my every day wear, with or without makeup. A must have!!
