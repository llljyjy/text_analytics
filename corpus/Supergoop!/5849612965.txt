Do not try and unscrew the powder portion for if you do even the slightest, it will get all messy and the powder will slowly start to spill out. During the time I did use it, yes I felt a powder on my face but was unsure about the sunscreen. The powder didn’t do its job for I found myself resetting it a lot. Overall, if you like a sunscreen powder, then this is for you. I just recommend to not wear a lot of makeup if you choose to use it. OK powder if you’re wearing makeup
