Is it just me or is this brand overrated? I used supergoop when it first came out and I started getting a horrible rash on my forehead. It turned out it was Supergoop. Fast forward a few years and I thought I’d give this a try. It made my skin break out by the end of the day and my skin never breaks out so i returned it and it just felt so heavy on my face. I’ll stick with Ilia tinted spf 40. Really wanted to love this as I’ve seen so much hype around it but nope. Not for me. pour clogging and made my skin break out
