I’ve been on the hunt for a great SPF for quite some time. Many that I’ve tried leave a greasy feeling on my face, feel thick, or leave a white cast on my skin. I did like the Supergoop invisible sunscreen but it feels like silicone on my skin. I haven’t been too impressed with their other ones. Once I tried this SPF oil I am hooked. This is the best sunscreen that I’ve ever tried. It’s a lightly moisturizing, it sinks into my skin so quickly and leaves no white cast! This sunscreen is my favorite! Love it
