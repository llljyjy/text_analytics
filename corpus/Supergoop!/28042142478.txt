I really like this product. It honestly gives you this glow, while protecting your face from the sun. I have normal skin. I use this after my toner and moisturizer..but before my foundation. I don’t have to use a primer. It give you a healthy glow. On no makeup days..I put this on..some mascara, lip gloss and I am good to go! It you have oily skin, this probably won’t work for you. I am 39 yrs old, and it works great for me! Glow for aging skin
