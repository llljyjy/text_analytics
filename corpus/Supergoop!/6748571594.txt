Pros: - leaves a beautiful, radiant finish underneath makeup Cons:- I could not get this sunscreen to stop pilling! I tried different moisturizers, no moisturizer, rubbing it in right away, letting it sit - nothing worked! It would end up streaky and then when I tried to rub it in to even it out, it would pill!- on bare skin, I looked like I had rubbed highlighter all over my face, not like I had a “glow from within“ look. Pilled like crazy, and I looked like a disco ball
