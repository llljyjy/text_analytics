I purchased this in hopes of switching over from the super goop play sunscreen because that one was making my makeup separate. After one use of this product, my skin has broken out. I have sensitive dry skin and this product is the worst. It smells horrible and leaves a horrible white cast (Iâ€™m fair toned). I thought the comments saying the white cast is bad were being dramatic, but I was wrong. Please save your money and try another sunscreen 4 new breakouts 2 days later!
