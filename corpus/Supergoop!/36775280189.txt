Feels like you’re wearing nothing at all! Not greasy or oily. I have very sensitive skin and this does not affect it in a negative way. The only caveat is that it does sting my eyes (even though I didn’t put it near them at all). But I also have very sensitive eyes. Works well as a primer too. Love!
