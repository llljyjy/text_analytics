I’m a big fan of the texture and compatibility underneath a full face of makeup, but on no makeup days, this gives me less of a glow and more of a full on shine. I’ve started pressing transparent powder on top of it so I look less greasy. But I do like the fact that it evens out my skin tone and blends well with foundation and concealer. Will make you very shiny
