I bought the value size since its FSA/HSA eligible. It leaves no white cast and doesn’t sting my eyes. The smelly has a very slight sunscreen scent, but mainly smells like citrus. It makes my skin look very oily, but I don’t mind if I’m staying at home. If I do go out for errands, I’ll just put on some setting powder and it’s fine. I wouldn’t wear this under a full face of makeup. It made my foundation (rare beauty) look so dry and patchy - which is something I’ve never had an issue with. nan
