This is 100% my new favorite sunscreen! I was gifted by Supergoop but I would say this regardless! First off, it doesn’t have that overpowering chemical sunscreen smell. It smells slightly of florals and a little citrus. I love how nicely it absorbs into my skin without leaving that greasy feeling that other sunscreens leave behind. I even applied makeup over it and it went on like a dream. I also really love that it’s sweat and water resistant for those hot summer days! Living in Florida, a good daily SPF is so important and this one is a hit! I just wish it came in a bigger size. New favorite SPF!
