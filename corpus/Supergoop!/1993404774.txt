Sunscreen is a must for me. I love invisible ones but for the summer, I am excited to have this one from Supergoop to add a hint of color and shimmer. Glides on without feeling heavy. When I wear this with makeup, gives my makeup a hint of glowing within and when I donâ€™t wear makeup, this gives me a boost of color with shimmer. Sunscreen for the summer!
