This is BY FAR the WORST setting spray I’ve ever used. It made my face extremely oily and I don’t normally have oily skin. My makeup ran within 3 hours of applying the spray. When I say “my makeup ran”, I mean, I LOOKED LIKE A STRAIGHT UP RACCOON!!!! Don’t buy this product. Total waste of money! I’m going back to my old faithful Urban Decay. THIS SPRAY IS AWFUL!!!!
