I really like this product, but my only issue is it leaves a slight bit of an ashy look on my skin. But overall this product is great! The Matte finish definitely helps control the oil on my face. I would definitely use this as a primer before applying my makeup. I plan on using the Unseen version which I was told wonâ€™t give me the ashy look on first application. I would highly recommend this product. Love this product
