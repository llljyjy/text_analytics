This is the second supergoop sunscreen that I’ve tried and been disappointed with. This sunscreen does not play well with other products. If you try to layer this over anything it will pill all over your face. I love how it looks when I wear it alone but that’s not realistic. There are so many other sunscreens that don’t have this problem, it’s just not worth it. PILLS, no further explanation needed
