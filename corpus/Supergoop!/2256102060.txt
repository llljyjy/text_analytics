I am ultimately surprised. Frankly, I bought the smallest size figuring I wouldn’t like it too much, but wanted to see what it was about since I love Supergoop and have been using Supergoop play for years. I love it! I was worried about looking too oily and sweaty, but it truly looks like a natural glow. Dewy. Def not drying which is my main concern. I’d rather look oily than cracking at the seams… ya know? I would say in comparison to the Play sunscreen it is a bit thicker and have to work it in more. So far I am surprised and will most likely be buying a bigger size. nan
