I love wearing this under my makeup. I like light coverage looks, so the glow from this sunscreen peeks through my makeup and gives me a “from within” glow. There isn’t any large chunks of glitter that makes it too flashy to wear. Overall, I love this sunscreen, but it *might* be a little too much if it’s the only “makeup” product I’m wearing. nan
