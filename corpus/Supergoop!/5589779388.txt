Really wanted to love this. I DO think it’s a great, incredibly smooth sunscreen with a bit of tint. But under makeup? Just don’t. This was literally the only thing I did differently in my normal makeup routine, and it made my completely separate and cake in my T-zone. Would probably be fine for someone that doesn’t become oily with makeup on throughout the day. Normally I use Lancôme foundation, Dermablend translucent setting powder and Mac Prep + Fix spray and I get a bit shiny lateen on but it stays smooth looking. I’ll still probably keep this just for the sunscreen, but I’m sad I won’t be able to use this as a primer as it claims it is. ironically, not for oily skin
