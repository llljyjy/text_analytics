This has quickly become a new favorite! I’ve never tried anything like this and love the idea of a sunscreen oil. I appreciate a multipurpose product combining skincare and spf! Even though I’m oily, my skin is more dry and dehydrated this time of year so this gives me that extra hydration I need. So far it hasn’t clogged my pores or broken me out either. I also love the fact that it doesn’t feel like I’m wearing sunscreen, it doesn’t leave behind a weird film or heaviness like a lot of face sunscreens do. Different than any sunscreen I’ve ever tried!
