I’m a big fan of Play, and it’s our sunscreen for the whole family. I just recently tried Unscreen and really liked it. BUT I like this new face sunscreen, too! A review said it was basically Play. It’s not; it has a completely different texture and feel. I’d say this new face sunscreen feels like it’s between Unscreen and Play. I like using a separate moisturizer and used it under EVERY SINGLE FACE yesterday on a walk when it was 80% humidity out. It was great! I didn’t feel oily at all. It’s watery and has a light sunscreen feel at that beginning, but once it settles, it dries nicely without the typical sunscreen tackiness. Very Nice!
