This was a solid purchase! I initially intended to try the mini, as I have sensitive and super fair skin that ONLY burns, and the price point seemed a little hefty for an almond oil based product. I was willing to throw down the cash because we are moving from New England to Texas this month and I have been testing any and all sunscreens to find “the one,” as we are approaching 100 degree plus summer weather there. For reference, I wear sunscreen everyday, SPF 50 on the face, and 30 on my body most of the year, upping it to 50 in the summer months. I like this for a lot of reasons: There really isn’t a fragrance to this product, it applies easily, although, I find myself using kind of a lot. I could (read: definitely do) just have dry skin that sucks it up. Others may have better luck using less depending on their skin type and condition. The product doesn’t leave me feeling greasy at all. I work in a hospital and wear surgical scrubs which are laughably thin little napkin outfits, and show ANY greasy product you have on through them. I’m happy to report, I don’t look like I’m hiding pizza in my pants!As for efficacy, I have taken the top off my jeep and exposed my upper body to the sun without any signs pf burning! You would think all sunscreens are effective. You would think wrong. This one passes the test. I keep the bottle right side up on my counter, so I can’t attest to leaking, but I will definitely be repurchasing this product again and again. a win for sensitive pale people!
