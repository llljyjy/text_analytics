I liked it more than I thought I would based off the reviews. The market is still so small for this type of product but I am determined to reapply my SPF as the sun only is getting more intense this summer so I picked it up. The scent is a bit shocking in its intensity and isn’t really necessary in my opinion, but the sunscreen works well as a refreshing spray. It’s not the finest most in the world but frankly I didn’t expect it to be. I want to be able to throw this in my purse and roam about town, and give myself a quick touch up on the sunscreen and refresh my skin. I think this accomplishes that. I will say I would not rely on this as a way to extend your makeup- for me, it made my skin extra dewy and my makeup never seemed to dry back down. I definitely would transfer. For an oily girl like myself that’s a new feeling since I rely on powder so much… I might this on the go with a powder puff afterward and see if it affects the over-dewiness. That being said it did not make my makeup melt or come off, and it actually did refresh it nicely. No white spots like others have complained. It’s nice and undetectable! it works as a refreshing SPF spray.
