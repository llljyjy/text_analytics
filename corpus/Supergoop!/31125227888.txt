(Product gifted by Supergoop!) I’m not normally one to leave a bad review, but I really didn’t like this product. I’m so sad about it because the idea of a setting spray/sunscreen all in one is GENIUS! I just don’t feel that it was well executed. :( After putting all of my makeup on, I sprayed this on my face as the final step and it like totally ruined my makeup! It made my face SO greasy and my makeup like melted off of my face. I looked awful throughout the day because of it. Won’t be using this product again! nan
