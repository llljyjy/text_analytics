This stuff is really interesting! I like that it’s a primer and can also be used as a highlighter. The texture is really nice and melts right into my skin, doesn’t feel oily or sticky at all. One issue I can see is that it might be too dark for those who are really pale. The shade was a tad dark on me and I’m on the paler side, so probably won’t be used as a highlighter. However, when I rubbed it in it was fine! Glowy!!
