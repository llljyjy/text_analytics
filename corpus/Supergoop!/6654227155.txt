i tried a sample of this product. It is light, hydrating, and not greasy feeling on the skin. Because it is tinted, I think it would work best for someone with a medium, warm skin tone. It does not work on fair skin tones. The finish is unnaturally metallic- I would not use the word “dewy“ to describe this at all. I am used to some irritation from chemical filters, but i needed to wash this sunscreen off within half an hour. I would not be able to leave the house wearing this product. not for fair skin, metallic finish
