It doesn’t leave a white cast!! This is the first mineral sunscreen that I’ve tried that I actually like. It doesn’t leave a white cast because it has a slight tint to it. It blends easily into my skin and wears nicely under makeup. I also really appreciate how it has bioretinol in it in order to target signs of aging. nan
