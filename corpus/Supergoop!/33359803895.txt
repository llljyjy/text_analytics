I really like this product for no makeup days, I haven’t used it with makeup yet but so far so good, I thought it wouldn’t work for me since i’m so pale but it blended out with a sheer bronzed glow, the only issue I had was pilling by my neck but it wasn’t anything crazy. This is basically a skincare version of the Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter! I definitely recommend if you have dry skin :) Good Sunscreen
