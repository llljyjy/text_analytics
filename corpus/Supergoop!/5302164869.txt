I was gifted by Supergoop their Daily Dose Sunscreen Oil and I love it! I have dry, sensitive and Ezcema prone skin so I don’t change my spf skincare often but I think this might be my new everyday spf! I love that it is an oil, it absorbs really well into my dry skin! Definitely have to let it dry for a few minutes before applying makeup. I have found that it doesn’t pair well with certain matte foundations, I would only wear this with a tinted moisturizer and a satin or dewy foundation, definitely not powder! Gives skin a beautiful glowy finish and it is very hydrating! Great for dry, Ezcema-prone skin!
