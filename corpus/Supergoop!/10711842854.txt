I’ve always loved Supergoop’s sunscreen so I was definitely excited to try this out. I really like how it’s not white. It has a little bit of a tint to it, that helps with not having a white cast. It’s hydrating but not overly so. It sinks in quickly and looks great under makeup. Without makeup it just gives your skin a gorgeous glowy fresh faced look. Absolutely love!! Favorite sunscreen!
