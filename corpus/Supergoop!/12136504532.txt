Great sunscreen, remains on the skin after going into the ocean. Prevent sun damage very well. Hardly feels like sunscreen. Provides minimal coverage. No white cast at all. I use it under Ilia Shelia foundation for extra sun protection & more coverage. Doesnâ€™t clog pores, minimal/no scent and washes off easily. Worth the buy soft light finish
