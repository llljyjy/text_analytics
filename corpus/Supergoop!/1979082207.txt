Ceramides are my jam! And I’m trying to be more into using sunscreen. I really love this super hydrating oil gifted to me by Super Goop! It sits nicely on my skin giving it a boost of health and protection all day long. It’s definitely not something you can re apply so it really works as a nice base. It’s not sticky and it’s great for dry skin especially in the winter! Only down side is that the bottle did not seem very full. Hydrating protection!
