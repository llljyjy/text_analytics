As a glowy base it’s fine. As a sunscreen it awful. I know it says to reapply every 40 minutes - which is insanely impractical for a sunscreen. If you’re using it for actual sunscreen purposes, as one does with SUNSCREEN, reapply EVERY 35 minutes. This melts off. Don’t trust it as a sunscreen. Think of it as a glowy base and wear another sunscreen because this one is simply not it Not it.
