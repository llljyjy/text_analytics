First, let me say that I love Supergoop’s products. I received this complimentary from Supergoop! and while I’ve used setting spray in the past, when I saw this one was an SPF, I was super thrilled to try it. I did my makeup and then spritzed my face a few times and let it set and once it dried, it felt SO light! It kept my makeup on all day and protected my face from sun exposure. I will note, it’s a larger container so it’s hard to take on the go to re-apply after 2 hours so I’ll definitely be purchasing the travel size for that. Super lightweight!
