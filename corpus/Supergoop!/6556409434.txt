At first I was mad they got rid of the original formula just like everyone else but give this a try! I actually love it just as much as the original now that I tried it! I think it’s super natural and pretty, it does not separate or settle into fine lines. I even use it under my eyes like a concealer and it does not crease! I’ve worn it in the ocean and pool and it stays on and doesn’t budge, still looks amazing!I LOVE that it is 100% mineral sunscreen. I have super sensitive rosacea skin and this has never broken me out or irritated my skin! Please don’t ever discontinue this I don’t know what I would do if it was discontinued because literally nothing works for my skin! I use this as a foundation, it’s buildable and you can get it to a solid medium coverage. Or you can use less and use it as more of a tinted moisturizer. DON’T EVER DISCONTINUE
