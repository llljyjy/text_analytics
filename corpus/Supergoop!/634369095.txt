This glowscreen is my new favorite product.  I have light screen and have had issues with getting too much sun in the past so I am extra careful with always using spf now. I find that some sunscreens give my skin a white cast so I love that this doesn’t. Instead it gives my face a healthy glow! It doesn’t make my face oily.  I appreciate the spf of 40. It is ideal for using under my face makeup and works well on its own too. The tube easily fits in my handbag for on the go use.  I appreciate the high quality ingredients.  I also always love this brand’s fun and cheerful packaging. nan
