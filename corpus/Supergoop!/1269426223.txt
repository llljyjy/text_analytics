Way too oily for my skin.  I love the regular sunscreen and bough the stick as a way to re-apply protection on the go. Well it was definitely too oily for my taste-the oily mess just stayed on top of my skin- not a good feeling at all! Specially in 90 degree weather I can feel my pores clogging. nan
