I have normal/dry skin and this makes my skin look dewy and sun kissed! It gives my skin a natural tan look without looking fake. I have sensitive skin and so far Iâ€™ve had no reactions. I added concealer, cream bronzer and blush and setting powder. It held up in the humid heat! Even after hours my skin still looked dewy! No dry patches at all. Going to be wearing this a lot this summer! Still dewy even after hours of use!
