I got this product complimentary from Supergoop!It’s a good concept but I wish the mist was a little more fine. It doesn’t feel like it’s applying evenly and I ended up getting a few droplets on my face which was annoying when the whole point was to reset my makeup. That being said, I would probably purchase this if it came in a travel size as it would be handy to have in my purse. nan
