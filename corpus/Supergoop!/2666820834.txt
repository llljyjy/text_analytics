I LOVE all Supergoop sunscreens! My go-to is usually the unseen sunscreen for my face, but this is great in place of moisturizer if I donâ€™t have time to layer on several products. I really like the thinner consistency, and it does not feel heavy or greasy at all! This was gifted by Supergoop, but I would have bought it on my own anyway. :) nan
