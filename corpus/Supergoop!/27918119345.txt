This powder sets your makeup, fixes any unwanted shine, and adds sun protection to your makeup routine! I absolutely love it, especially as someone whose face is almost always shiny. It helps so much with that and I love not having to worry about putting lots of sunscreen on my face with this and the spf in my foundation already on there. This is definitely worth a try! I have the medium shade. There is also a light and dark shade as well as a translucent powder option. The powder comes through the brush, so it’s very convenient and is great for traveling. The only thing that is a bit annoying is you have to remember to open and close it, but it’s just a tiny extra step you have to take. I love this product! Love it!
