I was gifted by a super goop the every single face watery lotion sunscreen and Absolutely LOVE the finish of it! It’s not sticky whatsoever and doesn’t leave you feeling gross like your typical sunscreen. It has a lotion consistency and is super buttery. I highly recommend for the summer! No stickiness at all! Love this sunscreen.
