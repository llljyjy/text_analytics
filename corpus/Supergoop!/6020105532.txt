I am very pleased with the Daily Dose Hydra-Ceramide Boost Oil! I use it in the morning.  I apply about 3 drops and gently pat into my skin as my moisturizer. My skin feels soft, hydrated and supple. And although it’s a face oil, it doesn’t make my skin oily. I love the SPF protection. Plus it’s great that it’s a clean product. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. Great face oil
