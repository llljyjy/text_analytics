Love this Spf! The consistency is on the watery side but not too watery. It’s very light weight. It has very slight sunscreen smell. It does not leave the skin with a white cast instead it leaves it nice and glowy! The packaging is nice and slim so it’s perfect to throw in your bag and apply throughout the day.  Gifted by Supergoop. Lightweight!
