I wanted to like this sunscreen because I heard so much about it and I love to get the natural dewy glow. However, this one is just not for me. I put in on after my moisturizer and I usually don’t wear makeup on top of that. After a couple of hours, I felt like my face looked so oily and greasy. :(When I was putting in on, I waited to let it absorb and pat it on, but I feel like I started to get a little bit of piling. I feel like under foundation it does give an ok glow, but without makeup it’s too much for my skin. I have dry cheeks and oily T-zone, but I feel like this still make me look so greasy all over my face.I am going to try the summer friday sunscreen drops, hopefully that will work better for me. Not for me, maybe for you
