Love it! I am a SPF junkie. I make sure to apply my SPF every morning no matter what. It seem’s like most of the tinted SPF face products that I have tried here recently are matte of make my face look dry. I needed a hydrating SPF for my face. This does not lie when it says it’s hydrating. It goes on so smoothly and just adds a silky finish to my face. It looks hydrated but not oily. I like it! Highly recommended! Love it!
