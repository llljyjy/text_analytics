I love the Supergoop brand and products that I’ve tried from them in the past, I was super excited for the whole concept of this being a setting spray and sunscreen in one! I hate having to apply cream sunscreen and that nasty sticky feeling. The mister on this is super fine and nice, the minty smell initially hits you but I feel like it fades over time. The only thing I don’t completely like is how my skin feels after applying. It kind of has this dry texture to it and I like my sunscreens to be more hydrating personally! All in all though it’s such a cool idea for a product and also love how they are clean brand and reef friendly! (gifted by Supergoop!) Such a cool concept!
