i really wanted to hate this product, because it’s $40 for the full size and if it’s not great you can chalk it up to hype. unfortunately, i adore it. the product makes you look glowy without being overly moisturizing and greasy. i have combination-oily skin and haven’t had an oil-slick like issues and my makeup stays put on top of it. wish i hated it
