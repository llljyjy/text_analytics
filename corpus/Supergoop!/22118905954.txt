I was excited to get this in the mail, it’s great for setting makeup, I learned that powders aren’t as good as protecting your face from the sun as regular liquid or stick spf, I don’t usually wear makeup and it makes my face look not as smooth, I’m sure it would be great on top of makeup, it reduces shine. And would be better than nothing for reapplying over makeup. The applicator is okay. Okay, but not the best thing ever.
