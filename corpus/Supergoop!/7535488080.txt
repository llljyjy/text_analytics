I love Supergoop products, they are all amazing. Glow screen has a great silky smooth texture, it absorbs very well. Finally sunscreen without the  smell, I can wear it all day, unbothered. Skin looks amazing and glowy. For me personally Golden Hour it is tiny bit dark as Iâ€™m very pale but it contours face nicely when used with concealer on top of it. I would get Sunrise next time.
