I love Supergoop sunscreen products because they have multiple benefits plus SPF! This oil was really interesting especially for the winter months. I use a few drops after my moisturizer and work it into my skin. Then I finish with my normal sunscreen. Iâ€™m pretty wary of mixing oils with spf because oils can leave patches in your spf application.  I think this is a nice product but it is not necessary. (gifted by Supergoop) nan
