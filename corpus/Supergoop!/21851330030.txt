I was so excited to use this sunscreen. This is my all time favorite brand and I looove their SPF products. This sunscreen did not leave a white caste, was easily blendable, and did not leave my skin looking or feeling oily. I touched up every 3 hours and did not sunburn at all (spent the day at an amusement park with water rides). Another thing I valued about this sunscreen was a clear expiration date- most produce have an X amount of months attached to it after you open them but this sunscreen was transparent on when it will expire. Love it!
