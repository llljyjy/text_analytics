This face mist is a total game changer.  The sense is super light and refreshing so perfect for spring and summer. The bottle is sleek and easy for traveling or to throw in your bag so you can refresh your make up and skin throughout the whole day. SPF is so super important that it’s often forgotten about so this is an easy way to have it on hand all of the time. The mist is super fine so it won’t disrupt your make up which is a huge plus. I highly recommend this and what a cute gift idea with this be in a basket for a graduate or a bride or Mother’s Day. this product was gifted by supergoop Love the light scent
