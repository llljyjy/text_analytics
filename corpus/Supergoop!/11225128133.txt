I was gifted this product and I would definitely recommend it! The golden hour finish really gives your makeup look a natural bronze glow to it. I apply this underneath my foundation and the shimmer really does shine through. Compared to other sunscreens, this one blends well and is easily buildable! It doesnâ€™t make your skin feel greasy or oily, but a nice highlight and it protects your skin so what more could you ask for!? Buildable and Blends Well!
