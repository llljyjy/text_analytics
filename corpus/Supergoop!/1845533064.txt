I’ve always loved anything by Supergoop and was super excited to try this new Daily Dose Bioretinol + Mineral SPF 40! This one is a nice texture and is lightweight too. It’s perfect to use for everyday and I really enjoy the dropper with this spf too. The only downfall for this is the weird scent it has. I’m not a fan and it is slightly off-putting. It does dissipate after it sinks into the skin. Hoping they change the formula to have no scent or a typical sunscreen scent. nan
