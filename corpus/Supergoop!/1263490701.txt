I love this sunscreen/primer. It reminds me of Chanel Les Beiges Eau de Tint in color and light texture, but it’s better because it protects my skin from UVA/UVB and blue light. I often wear it under Ilia Skin Tint or by itself. It gives me a beautiful golden glow that isn’t too orange or brown for my pale ginger skin. It evens out my skin tone without covering my freckles. It’s not greasy and is moisturizing. Try the mini size and see if you like it. I just bought a value size because I love it so much that I’ve gone through my other containers. nan
