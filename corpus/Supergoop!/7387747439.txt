I have used the famous Supergoop tinted sunscreen for the past year which I absolutely love… so I was nervous to try this product as I didn’t know if it would live up to the tinted sunscreen which I love… but it absolutely did. Supergoop does it again. This product is perfect for everyday use, it doesn’t break my skin out, and doesn’t feel heavy or oily on my skin. Perfect for everyday use
