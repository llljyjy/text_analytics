This has a runny texture as expected with its label as a watery lotion. It applies very easily and feels somewhat greasy, which I think people mistake as a glow. In addition, this doesn’t have your typical sunscreen fragrance but rather a strong alcohol scent that burns the nose. It lingers for about 10-20 mins and fades. It is bearable to wear in its first layer, but reapplying later in the day gets difficult because of the grease factor. I think this may be suitable for dry skin, but this also contains alcohol as a top ingredient. There’s no white cast & doesn’t pill so I’ll give it points for that. I’d rate this 3.5 stars. *This was gifted by SuperGoop Greasy + Smells of Alcohol
