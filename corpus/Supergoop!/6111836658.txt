I was gifted by Supergoop. This is the sunscreen I’ve been waiting for! I experience way too much pilling with the Unseen Sunscreen and the Glow Screen is too dewy for me. I love the watery texture of this sunscreen - I haven’t seen another sunscreens with this texture that matches in SPF. The texture makes it really easy to reapply throughout the day without feeling like you’re putting too much on your face. Best texture from Supergoop so far
