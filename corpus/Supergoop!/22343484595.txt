It was amazing at first, I loved the glow and was so excited!However it started pilling and would separate on my face after using it for a couple of days. I thought it was my moisturizer at first but I tried using it multiple times with different moisturizers (I usually use the Laneige moisturizer) and unfortunately it didn’t work out. It’s a shame because I really wanted to love it. Maybe I had a bad batch or something. nan
