I received this product complimentary from Supergoop in exchange for my honest review. I’m not sure I understand why you would want an oil as your sunscreen (wouldn’t that make you feel MORE greasy?) However, the scent is not unpleasant and rather subtle. It also helped add hydration to my dry hands. nan
