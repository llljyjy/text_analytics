I’ll have to agree with everyone on the poor sprayer. It definitely spits and applies uneven. I ended up pouring the formula into a continuous sprayer I got on Amazon and now I have no issues. It smells and feels a little minty which is refreshing for sure. And as others have pointed out-it is a little “oily” which is nice for a subtle dewy glow but if you’re not into that I wouldn’t recommend this for ya. I like it overall-I like the added SPF even though I do apply SPF before makeup it’s nice to know I’m able to reapply with this spray. nan
