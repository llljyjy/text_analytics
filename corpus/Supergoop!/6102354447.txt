Love this product! Wasn’t sure about it at first because the texture threw me off. Feels very much like a primer. But I wear this and some setting powder and I’ve gotten multiple compliments on how clear my skin looks. I’m acne prone but this product is really light weight so I feel like I can wear it all day, everyday without clogging my pores. nan
