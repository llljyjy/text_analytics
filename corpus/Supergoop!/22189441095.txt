Gifted by supergoop , and it’s amazing! I’ve enjoyed all of the Supergoop products I’ve tried so far, but my skin seems to appreciate this one even more! I like to put this oil between my serums and moisturizer in my morning routine. It doesn’t have a scent and absorbs rapidly, making layering a breeze. Although I am sure I will continue to use sunscreen in my routine, I appreciate that it offers SPF benefits. Love this serum
