This oil is so good, it’s very lightweight, good protection, but the smell is awful. That’s the only downside, but it’s excellent under foundation. I use it as sunscreen/primer. I have extremely dry skin and it works so well. I would even wear it in no makeup days because it absorbs quite well into my skin. Even though I have severely dry skin, most oils leave behind that oil slick look, even under matte foundations. This is expensive, but worth it, especially if you are dry. Excellent sunscreen/makeup primer
