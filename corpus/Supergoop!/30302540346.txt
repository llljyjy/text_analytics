only got it because i needed a hands-free way of reapplying spf and i have dry skin so i don’t mind a little dewy-ness. it sprays very uneven and the smell is super strong. i like minty scents but the initial spray is more strong in the scent than in the actual product being put on your face, but the scent does settle down after a minute. also, maybe just a personal thing, i find the balls in the bottle that are meant to help with mixing the product to be excessively loud and maybe they take away from the amount of product in the bottle (idk). i have very sensitive eyes but they weren’t too irritated by the product, just keep your eyes closed for a bit so nothing gets in them. overall, the product is fine despite what i’ve mentioned but i’m sure there are better ones for a similar price. nan
