Love this! Glowly on its own and looks great under makeup. It DOES cling to dry patches in a kind of weird and obvious way, so I only use this in the summer (and use the unseen sunscreen version of this in the winter). However, on hydrated skin, it has the most beautiful glow and sheen (not glittery). No problem layering cream or powder makeup on top, and a tube of this lasts a full 3 months of summer for me. Summer dream!
