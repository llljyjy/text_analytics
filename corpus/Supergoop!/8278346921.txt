I’ve tried the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen before but I was so excited to try this Glow sunscreen! It’s insane the glow you get and you are also protected from the sun as well!! My skin looked like a had put a liquid highlighter (but not overly blinding) . I  also love the texture, it just feels light weight which is perfect for summer, you don’t want anything heavy. I wear this by itself and just some concealer and it’s my go to but if I feel like putting on more makeup in the day I can also apply this on top as a highlighter! It’s a win win for me! I love the dewy look! Dewy and protected!
