The first time i used this was probably 6 months ago, and i broke out in little bumps the next day, however i did use it in combination with a couple other new products so i couldn’t be sure what did it.. i decided to take a chance and try it again the last couple of days and it’s been working amazing for me! no breakout so far. It also is the perfect glowy base for under my foundation, which helps my foundation look even more dewy. I like it!
