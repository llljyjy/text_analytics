Gifted by Supergoop. I really like the new nozzle of the new supergoop resetting mist. The new mist sprays out so finely. With the old nozzle the spray was very intense and would often get clogged. I love that Supergoop took the time to resolve this issue. As for the formula, I can’t recommend this enough. I’ve been using this as a way to reapply sunscreen for years now. This mist allows you to reapply your spf protection without disturbing your makeup. It’s also great to use while on the go if you don’t or cannot spend the time to reapply with a conventional sunscreen lotion. Great for reapplying
