Those 4 + marks after the SPF rating means  it delivers the highest quality and best sun protection  available., I don’t burn! I don’t turn red! I don’t freckle! My arms and hands don’t fry as I’m driving. Fair skinned people need and deserve this kind of protection- so buy it! Medium and dark skinned people ALSO need and deserve this kind of sun protection-Y’all need to buy it. People with sun spots or Melasma- you need and deserve this too. Don’t sit there reading this review- buy it! nan
