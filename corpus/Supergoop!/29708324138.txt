I love that this is really unseen! It is also one of the few sunscreens that hasn’t broke me out as my skin can be quite sensitive. It’s a bit pricey which is why I took off one star but I would definitely repurchase as this sunscreen lives up to its name and exceeded my expectations. My skin loves this!
