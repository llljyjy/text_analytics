This wasn’t for me though it feels nice. You’re supposed to put it on before any other products and let it fully absorb for 15 minutes. That wasn’t great plus I was just SHINY. Also doesn’t really go well on top of make up so hard for reapplication. I think this would be great for people with more melanin in their skin who don’t want a cast (or people not wearing makeup) but for me their other products are much better. not for me (and I’m an spf junkie)
