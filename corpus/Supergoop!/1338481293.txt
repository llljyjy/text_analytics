I love spray on sunscreens - for me, it’s the best way to apply sunscreen because I always forget before I apply I apply my makeup. Also, cream/gel sunscreens always seem to interfere more with makeup application. I also don’t want to deal with sunscreens that have a white cast, which is more common with spread on sunscreens. This is just perfect. It’s high SPF and completely clear - there is absolutely no white cast even on my darker skin. I usually powder after foundation and then use a setting spray, I just replace my setting spray with this. The mist is fine and very refreshing (if you like that satisfying feeling of a face mist). It does leave a slightly dewy finish but it is not greasy and doesn’t melt my makeup. I have dry skin so I appreciate a little glow. I love supergoop products and this is no exception, a very good release for this summer season. Gifted by supergoop. Perfect for my darker, dry skin!
