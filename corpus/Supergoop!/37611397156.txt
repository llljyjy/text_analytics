I received this product as a gift from Supergoop! and I loved it. The product left my skin glowy and a bit bronze when I used it as a sunscreen. I also used it as a makeup primer and it made me almost feel like I accomplished the glass skin/clean makeup with minimal effort. I also liked that it’s didn’t leave my skin with a white cast. I do wish there was another shade deeper I would definitely buy
