This is a tinted mineral sunscreen that has a lightweight texture and because it’s tinted it doesn’t have a white cast. I love the added skincare benefits to it, just not sure how much value it has in sunscreens. Plus, I wouldn’t use it as my only sunscreen, but rather as an added layer on top of my sunscreen. nan
