this is literally my new favorite sun screen!!  it gives a nice subtle glow to my skin and i love how it has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid to act as skincare ingredients.  it doesn’t pill with any of the makeup products that i use which is something i really look for in a sunscreen.  i honestly don’t have anything negative to say about this product, im glad they added a new shade! love love love
