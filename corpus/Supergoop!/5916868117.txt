Received this product complimentary from Supergoop and im so happy I did. I’ve been searching for such a product to reapply sunscreen on days where I have makeup on. It’s perfect to take with me and it definitely is refreshing. It has your typical sunscreen scent but not so much. The lovely part is the other scents that are quite relaxing. I tried this with a skin tint, and it held great! Even applied it before makeup application. Just what I needed!
