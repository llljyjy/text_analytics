I have a love/hate relationship with this sunscreen. It goes on smooth, doesn’t leave a white film on my skin and overall kept me matte the whole day. However it did make my skin feel greasy, but I never appeared oily. I definitely will continue to use this sunscreen, it’s the best one I’ve been able to find so far for my oily skin. Worth a Try!
