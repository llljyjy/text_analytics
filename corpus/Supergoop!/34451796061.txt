I decided to purchase this despite the many poor reviews and ended up disappointed that they are accurate. I use chemical spf but if I sweat or cry or even get watery eyes from allergies my eyes burn really badly. I have been using a mineral spf but it dried my eyes out so I though a mineral spf for eyes would be a great buy. This is super thick and I really have to tug at my eyes to spread it quick enough before it dries down. It never really dries down it just stays really thick like if you put honey on your eyes. I have very dry skin so this should have been nourishing. On oily skin this would be even worse. It accentuates any wrinkles or milia. I’m in my 20s so I imagine this would be a real bummer for anyone with more defined wrinkles. Reapplication is impossible because it pills on itself. I ended up returning after giving it a good shot because I can’t justify $40 for .5oz of really bad spf when I can get 5x the amount of a good quality mineral spf for the same price. I’d skip this one it’s a flop. nan
