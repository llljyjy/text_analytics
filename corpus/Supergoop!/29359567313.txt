I read/ heard all the hype on this sunscreen, and I unfortunately it did not work for me. It glides on super easy and is convenient. But it made me face so oily and never blended in my skin literally felt like I had baby oil on my face. For reference I have combination skin but near mostly dry. Hopefully this helps someone :)) Very Oily (Beware)
