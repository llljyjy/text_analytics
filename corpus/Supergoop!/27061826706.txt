I really really wanted to love this but it just was not it. It pilled horribly. I tried it several times to see if it was me. I really wish this worked. It did give a glow but not something Iâ€™d wear on its own. It would have been better as a primer. You are better off skipping this sunscreen and going for the Supergoop play sunscreen instead!! Not a favorite! Supergoop Play is much better
