I wanted very much to love this product. I have very dry skin and I wanted to consolidate my SPF with intense moisture for ease. And this does technically do that, but I find the smell so off putting, even after application. It smells weirdly earthy to me - like rubbing natural clay or straight up mud all over my face. But worse, because I generally like the wet earth sort of smell. Supergoop! is definitely one of my favorite brands for SPF, but this ainâ€™t it for me. nan
