My mother used to slather whatever drugstore sunscreen on my face when I was a kid and I hated how heavy and oily it was, so I used to not wear sunscreen day to day.  This completely changed my mind about sunscreen.  It’s so lightweight and has virtually no scent.  Now, I can protect my skin without feeling like I’m about to spend the day at the pool!
