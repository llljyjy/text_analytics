Clean ingredients and fun way to try out the zinc based sunscreens from SG.I love them, zinc has a healing and calming aspect and the textures are all great.No reaction on my sensitive, hormonal, combo skin.No white cast. No perfume, and totally ok smell.I will say that Matte Screen is full of silicone. So I won’t try that one. A much cheaper way to try that way then buying the mini sizes individually.The PLAY is waterproof/sweat proof so a good sport day option that also wears nicely for daily usage if needed.My favorite is….the mineral sheer screen for it’s lightness and invisible application.I do not wear make up and cannot comment on this:/Hope this helps:) Great way to explore SG mineral sunscreen
