I love the refillable aspect of this product ($20 so a better deal than their normal/non-drugstore sunscreens).I use their unseen sunscreen in the AM and use this to touchup throughout the day. Works well for my oily skin to reset and powder middle of the day. Sometimes if I know I’ll be spending all day I’ll use this in the AM to set my sunscreen and double up the protection. That being said I do find the application to be a bit wishy/washy as it does come out in a puff like a cloud so applying it deliberately can be a bit of a guessing game hence the 4 stars. Final verdict: For a powder sunscreen this is one of the more affordable ones and I appreciate the refillable component which cuts down on landfill clutter. Until I find a better one with comparable value of price I will stick to using this one. Solid but dispensing can be a problem
