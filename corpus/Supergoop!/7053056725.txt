I love supergoopâ€™s sunscreens and this one was no exception! The glow screen applies so smoothly and gives your skin the most beautiful and natural glow. I already had the original shade, and this new one (golden hour) is darker and was perfect for my tanner skin tone in the summer. It can also be used almost like a contouring shade. Love this! Perfect for summer
