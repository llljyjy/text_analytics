Coming from someone prone to breakouts who is known to break out in hives if exposed to the sun without some form of protection, this sunscreen is wonderful and does its job. The formula is so creamy and easy to put on, I have combination skin and you canâ€™t even tell I have any on. I can tell a huge difference in my acne scars and the only thing I have been doing different is using this product. If you relate to my at all and are looking for a nice sunscreen I hope you try this! nan
