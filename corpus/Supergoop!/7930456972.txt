I was so excited to try this because I love unseen sunscreen SO much. Such a let down. The cream has a tacky texture, not at all like unseen sunscreen, would not evenly blend, and did not set well on my skin. It looked very dull and pilled. It was not a hard decision to return this. Would not recommend at all. Skip. Horrible & Strange Formula
