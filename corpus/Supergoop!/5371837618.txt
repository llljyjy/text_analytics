Obsessed it’s this sunscreen! I’m a huge SPF junkie, and the Glowscreen just made it in my top 3 Faves. It’s lightweight while still giving good coverage—most of my other face sunscreens are only 30spf. It doesn’t make my screen greasy,  or have a super intense smell. It gives my face a nice sheen for the days I want to go foundation free. Big fan of this product! New fave sunscreen!
