Since spf is the most important part of a skincare routine, I am constantly looking for a good sunscreen with good ingredients and that doesn’t leave a white cast. This one checks out both the boxes for me. It is so easy to apply being the consistency is so watery, melts into the skin effortlessly and doesn’t leave a white cast for me. I am so pleasantly surprised by this product and how cute is the packaging though. Definitely will be re purchasing. Gifted by Supergoop. A winner
