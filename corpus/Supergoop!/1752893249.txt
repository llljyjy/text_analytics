Love the consistency on my oily skin, especially in the summer heat. However, I had to stop using it because I noticed I would get a breakout the very next day after using. Once I stopped using it, the breakouts stopped. Now I have to keep searching for a sunscreen that doesn’t leave me feeling me oily but also doesn’t leave a white cast on my dark skin. break outs
