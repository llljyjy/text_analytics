I bought the miniature size and loved it. Once I purchased the larger size I realized I started breaking out on my forehead with little red bumps after every use (everday) even if I washed it off. I went without it for a week and it started clearing up, but once I used it again it all came back. I don’t recommend if you have acne prone skin. If you don’t have acne prone skin it’s amazing I love glow iness it gives my skin and never pills, just wish it didn’t make me break out:( Great for non acne prone skin
