Sunscreen is an absolute necessary part of my skin care routine that I use every single day and a lot of times it is difficult to find a sunscreen that melts in to your skin without leaving a residue or white cast, The sunscreen has been so perfect for me for my daily use as well as for reapplying throughout the day! nan
