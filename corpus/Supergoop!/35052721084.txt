Sugergoop! gifted me this sunscreen oil and I LOVE it! I use this on top of my regular moisturizer to help with my dry skin. This oil absorbs quick which is amazing because I hate oily greasy skin. I try my best to apply sunscreen but honestly forget half the time so I love that this incorporates SPF into it. nan
