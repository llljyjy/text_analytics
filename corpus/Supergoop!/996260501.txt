This two in one product is a game changer! Not only does it help set & refresh my makeup, but Iâ€™m thrilled it provides SPF protection too. Most of us only put SPF on before makeup, but we need to reapply throughout the day for continued coverage, the (Re) Setting Refreshing Mist makes it so easy to stay protected. I love the ultrafine mist as well, it smells divine and leaves a soft matte finish. Gifted by Supergoop! SPF made easy!
