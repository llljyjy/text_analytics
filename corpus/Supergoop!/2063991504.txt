I love this product, cannot live without it. I have not have any of the problems mentioned in the reviews. It hydrates without making my eyes greasy, it does not bother my sensitive eyes, and it doesnâ€™t leave any white cast. I really just dislike the price, however it lasts awhile, since a little goes a long way. nan
