I purchased Supergoop!’s Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 recently. I live in South Florida and sunscreen is a must. I wanted to give this product a try, so I purchased it. This is a sunscreen that offers hydration and invisible broad-spectrum UV protection. This product works for people with Normal and Dry skin. My skin is normal but can be sensitive as well. Unfortunately, this product was not for me. It made me break out and it caused irritation. The formulation was oil and unfortunately this caused a problem for my skin. It was too oily. This product is cruelty-free and gluten-free. I wanted it to work because it is perfect for travel, it’s a mess free, sun stick that glides effortlessly. This product is ultra-hydrating. It can be used as a glowy highlighter that can be used on the face, chest, and shoulders. It goes on completely clear but unfortunately it does leave an oily residue. This product is a Clean at Sephora Product. This product unfortunately was not for me. Supergoop! Glow Stick SPF 50 Sunscreen
