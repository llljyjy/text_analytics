Gifted by Supergoop!I love this Supergoop! Daily dose product. I love that’s it’s a sunscreen oil. It leaves absolutely no white residue or film on my face which surprises me considering it has SPF 40.I have very dry skin so it being a oil is perfect for me. It’s just slightly moisturizing and hydrating for me.It’s light, I get no greasy or oily feel, it maybe different for someone with other skin types but for me it’s perfect. I can actually wear moisturizer with it.Overall I am very happy and I love the container and dropper dispenser. no white cast or residue
