I love this setting spray! It was gifted to me, however I quickly inserted it into my everyday make up routine! Also it having an spf 40 is amazing because a lot of primers with spf make my make up greasy so I love that I can get all of my spf from this spray alone! I also like how long my make up lasts when I use this product I have oily skin and it works so well for me, definitely recommend it!! Definitely a must have!!
