Iâ€™m always a fan of Supergoop and love their Unseen Sunscreen formula. Their Glowscreen in Golden Hour seemed so intriguing, with the same scent less formula with a bronze hue. This will definitely be best for my body during the summer as it is much darker than I was anticipating to be used on the face.  On my arm this leaves a dewy, glowing finish! nan
