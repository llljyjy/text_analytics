Its actually not bad. I like it, it gives a nice matte finish, as well as spf coverage. Only complaints is the terrible application process and the container. Its not that easy to get the product out onto the bristles and on your face. Sometimes Iâ€™m not even sure if its working. And other times i just see dust in the air. But once on your face, it just blends in without altering the color of your makeup. Takes down the shine if that is what youre looking for. Its also really easy to carry around for reapplication out and about. Ive suffed it inside cute 3D purses and its been ok. Its a good product that needs more improved packaging (but at the same time the concept OF the packaging is perfect). Hope that makes sense and helps! Good product, so so packaging
