We needed this long ago but I am glad that súper goop has finally released it. It’s a very nice sunscreen. I like the formula because it is easy to blend and the nice glow it leaves. It is perfect for medium and dark skin tones. I have light skin but I will wear it when I am tanned. The undertone is warm so it’s perfect for summer. I also find it less greasy than the original light version. I really recommend it. It’s great!
