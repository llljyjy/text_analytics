For being a mineral sunscreen, this is the best I have used! It still has that mineral feel of being a bit heavy and slight white cast look on my skin, but itâ€™s still the thinnest and most easily spreadable mineral sunscreen I have found so far. If you have to have a mineral sunscreen, this is a great one to have. I still prefer chemical sunscreens to this one, but while I have to wear mineral sunscreen for the time being I will continue to use this one. With this mineral sunscreen it feels a bit more drying on my dry skin so now I use moisturizer under my sunscreen as opposed to chemical sunscreens I have used that moisturize adequately on their own.
