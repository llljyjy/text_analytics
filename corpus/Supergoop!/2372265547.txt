I’ve been a big fan of Supergoop products and was so excited to see this new one come out - the concept is genius! I am always wanting to refresh and add SPF to my face throughout the day, but that’s impossible when you’re wearing any kind of face makeup since it would just ball up and look terrible if you applied a sunscreen lotion on top. This spray is a perfect solution! It feels lightweight and you can either rub it in a little, or just apply a very thin layer and not have to. It didn’t feel sticky on eyelids either which I was nervous about. Love that it’s a higher SPF too. It felt good on my skin and didn’t bother me or feel like heavy sunscreen whatsoever. The scent is truly a minty herbal smell, which was refreshing at first but was a bit overbearing for the first 10 minutes it was on since it’s right on your face (I’m a little sensitive to strong smells), but thankfully it faded after that. I would recommend this! It did make the upper chest area of the shirt I was wearing a bit stiff/sticky feeling and I had to wash it, so just something to keep in mind - maybe have an older tshirt on when applying this.This product was gifted complimentary from Supergoop! in exchange for my honest review. nan
