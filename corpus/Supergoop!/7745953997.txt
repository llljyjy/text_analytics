I have been reading amazing things about this sunscreen but I was not expecting too much because I donâ€™t tend to like chemical sunscreens but this one is amazing!PROS:- Great texture: although it has a strong silicone texture, it spreads easily and absorbs quickly, even applying quite a lot.- It leaves the skin feeling silky soft.- It leaves a soft matte finish immediately(not greasy at all). - It works amazing under my makeup. This is what I like the most about this sunscreen, that my foundation always looks amazing over it. It seems to work as a primer because it even minimizes the look of my pores.- It is a non scented formula.- Clean at SephoraCONS:- It is a chemical sunscreen: this is just because of preference, that I prefer physical sunscreens, because this is an amazing product. - It is a little pricey, but the quality makes it worth it!
