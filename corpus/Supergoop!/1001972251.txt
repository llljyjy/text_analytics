I like that this sunscreen is reef and ocean safe. But, I found that when applied it was really wet and sticky and took a little more time to absorb into my skin. After it was absorbed I feel it did it’s job well and I didn’t get a red in the face as I normally do. It has a bit a sparkle which made me feel like I didn’t need to put on any make-up.
