A sunscreen that doubles as a facial oil is almost unheard of, so I was very interested to see how well this product worked for my dehydrated skin. It contains ingredients like ceramides and hyaluronic acid which I love.  I apply 4 drops during the day as the last step of my skincare routine, which is enough to cover my face and neck. It feels lightweight when applied and leaves a glowy finish once absorbed. This is a great sunscreen oil that is packed with hydration. I didn’t feel like it was necessary to apply a moisturizer beforehand, so I skipped that step. It really locks in moisture for hours even if you don’t reapply every 2 hours like I do (I work indoors so I almost never see the sun except early in the morning, hence why I only apply it once a day). I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. Great for dehydrated skin
