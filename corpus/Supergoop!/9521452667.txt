The product itself is amazing, super absorbent and no white cast. However, the packaging for the large bottle is really bad and in order to seal it for travel I wasted a lot of this sunscreen, which isnt cheap. If you plan to bring the large bottle on vacation, I recommend only doing so if you have minimal travel/stops involved. Otherwise, much of the product will be wasted just trying to close it poor packaging (18oz)
