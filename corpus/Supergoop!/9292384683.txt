Supergoop! sent me this product as a gift. My skin normally reacts poorly to sunscreens because it becomes greasy quickly, but this product did not. My skin felt normal and revitalized after a few hours of using it. The scent is not as overpowering as some others. The only drawback is that the spray is quite forceful, therefore I recommend spraying it from afar. Aside than that, I was quite happy with the product. nan
