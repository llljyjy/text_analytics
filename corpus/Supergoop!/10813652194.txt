Gifted by Supergoop! I have been testing out various sunscreen in preparation for the summer and this is a great option! It has 50 spf, is oil free and doesnâ€™t cause my sensitive skin to break out. There is a bit of a residual shine lift behind but that can be reduced with some setting powder and spray. nan
