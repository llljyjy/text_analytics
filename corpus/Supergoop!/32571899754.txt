I really like the texture of this sunscreen. It’s like a lightweight cream and it’s not greasy or super shiny. It definitely has a slight white cast, but it’s not that bad and it dissipates as you wear it. It’s also a really nice base under makeup. I appreciate that it’s fragrance free as I have sensitive, acne prone skin. Worth a try
