This is the ultimate busy lifestyle product - so easy to toss in your bag and spray whenever you need it without any fuss! I love the way the spray works and the smell is great too. It doesn’t sting my eyes like most spray sunscreens. I will say it leaves your face looking very dewy that it borders on greasy and it never really sets so it just kind of looks like that until you remove it. But I think it’ll be great for summertime! Complimentary from Supergoop! Convenient!
