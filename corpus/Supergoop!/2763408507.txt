I love this product. I have very oily skin so being able to powder over make-up with smearing and without extra shine is fantastic. If you arenâ€™t oily, this might be too drying or matte for you. My only negative comment is the packaging which could be way more functional. Also hard to squish the brush back into the cap. great for oily skin but packaging needs help
