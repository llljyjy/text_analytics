I actually picked this up by accident thinking it was the regular Unseen Sunscreen (which is also great!), but I really like the nice glowy finish. Iâ€™m basically a vampire and this stuff makes me look less like a corpse when I go outside (and protects my extremely fair skin). I Look Alive for Once!
