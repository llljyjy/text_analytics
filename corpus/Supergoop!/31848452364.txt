This sunscreen oil is just perfect for the dry skin! It’s nourishing and moisturizing, and  I prefer to use it instead of my usual moisturizer, but the biggest perk is that it has spf 40 in it. So I literally kill two birds with one stone!The formula is lightweight, it absorbs super fast and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy. And it works perfectly with my primers and foundations. Highly recommend checking it out! I received this product complimentary from Supergoop nan
