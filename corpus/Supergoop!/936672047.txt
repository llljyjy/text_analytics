I was hesitant to buy a full-size because there were so many reviews that said it was glittery or orange. I ended up buying a trial set of three mini Supergoops. I am very fair with a cool undertone and this looks beautiful on me! I mix it with CG Smoothers BB cream in light for a perfect “glass“ skin look. It doesn’t oxidize throughout the day and the fragrance is unnoticeable. Perfect!
