I received this complimentary from Supergoop! Definitely feels like you’re spraying your face with sunscreen and I’m not sure how much the spray would prevent sun damage since it’s so light and not a thick reapplication of cream. This would be good for throughout an average day but probably not for a day in direct sunlight, you would need more sunscreen for that. The product smells pretty good! It is nice and convenient to just spray on more throughout your day and over your makeup without having to rub in the product. nan
