I received this complimentary from Supergoop but this is my honest opinion.I love face oils and I was so excited to try this one with SPF 40 in itThe squalane, ceramides and hyaluronic acid make my skin feel and look hydrated and plump.Even though it’s an oil, it absorbs completely in a couple of minutes and doesn’t look greasy at all. I have been loving this for the winter months since my skin is extremely dry and this helps hydrate it and also protect against the harmful effects of the sun. Thanks to the ceramides in it, I feel the nourishing effect immediately and lasts throughout the whole day, helping with dry spots as well.The only thing that I do not love about this product is the dropper, but since it’s an oil and most oils come in a pump it doesn’t bother me. I just have to be careful when pulling the dropper in and out to not waste product.This has already become a part of my morning skincare routine. Great for dry skin
