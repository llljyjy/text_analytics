This is perfect for winter.  I need some extra hydration and love the SPF.  The scent is delicious as well.  You do need to be mindful that this is an added SPF and will not replace sunscreen. If combining be mindful of mixing types of sunscreen so you do not get pilling.  It is an extra layer.  I place it as the last step after moisturizer. It is great for me since I am mainly inside away from windows and the oil helps keep me hydrated.  I am giving 4 stars only because it is not a stand alone sunscreen. Gifted by Supergoop. Smells Great
