So I really love this formula as a primer/sunscreen duo. It’s super siliconey in texture so if that’s not your thing you won’t like it. But it blurs pores, grips makeup, and protects your skin all in one. Highly recommend for summer events. Only reason I docked a star is because it did break me out a little bit, but I’m just sensitive to chemical sunscreen. Great Summer Primer
