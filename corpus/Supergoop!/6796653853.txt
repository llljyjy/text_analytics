Giving it two stars because it feels heavy on my face and suffocating to my skin. I put it on and as others have said it doesn’t soak in. It doesn’t feel like other primers that I have used with SPF. I can still feel it on my face. I got it because my skin is dry/oily. My T zone gets oily while my cheeks and neck get very dry. I tried Elta 46 for face but it dried out my cheeks and neck and I had very visible dry patches. I read it was because of the zinc oxide. So now I’m back to square one trying to find a face sunscreen that works well under makeup and works well with my combo skin and doesn’t feel like I have a face mask on. I’ve tried Cerave AM and my makeup just slid right off. not for me
