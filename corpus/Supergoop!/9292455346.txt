I love Supergoopâ€™s mattescreen, glowscreen, and unseen sunscreen so much so I thought this would be another winner. Do not be fooled -- IT IS HORRIBLE. It pills so much - with or without makeup. I had to go wash my face in the office bathroom it was pilling so badly. The whitecast is not bad on my skintone - light/medium with golden undertones but the pilling it unbearable. Wish I could return this for a different Supergood product. Terrible pilling - not as good as other Supergood
