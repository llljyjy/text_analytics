This product caught my attention simply because there are not many products like this! A strictly hydrating face oil with SPF? Sign me up. The Vitamin A version of this did not interest me because of conflicting actives. Needless to say I was very excited when this was announced. I am happy to say that I am very impressed with this oil. It is of thin to medium consistency, more on the medium side. It is light enough that I donâ€™t feel clogged. Smell is fine to me, pretty much not noticeable. No breakouts so far on my oily skin. If the SPF coverage is truly as promised I think they have a hit product on their hands. Another hit from Supergoop!
