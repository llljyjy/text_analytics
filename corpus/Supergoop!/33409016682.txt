This product was gifted by Supergoop. The packaging is great and Itâ€™s  light, watery consistency allows it to be quickly absorbed.This sun essence is sure to be a summertime favorite.Feels like you are putting on a essence/emulsion and keeps my skin feeling hydrated and protected without any white cast at all. I really enjoyed the texture of this product. I have normal/ combination skin. nan
