I have a hard time with sunscreen. When I put a lot of sunscreen brands on my face, I instantly feel like my skin is not breathing and is starting to feel like I am sweating under the sunscreen. This however does not give me that feeling. It feels just like a primer or a moisturizer. Very happy and will be repurchasing when I finish mine. Wow! 10/10
