If you like silicone primers and stuff you may like this! I personally can’t get over the texture. It’s very silicone like and slippery and greasy. It feels like it’s clogging my pores. Did not do well on my oily skin, It also doesn’t sink in or anything, so it feels heavy. To me at least. I think it’s a to each their own type of product. For me, the Innisfree one worked way better. In every situation. And that one is only $15. Definitely give it a try if it’s been on your mind, but for me it was pretty lackluster. Meh..
