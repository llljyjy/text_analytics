I wanted to love this, as I have other Supergoop products in the past (like their UnSeen version), however this one missed the mark for me. I was hoping this sunscreen would leave my skin with a realistic glow, however I find that it looks more like a sheer liquid highlighter put all over your face/neck when applied generously (using the recommend amount of sunscreen) vs. looking like you have a ‘healthy glow’. This one also pilled/did not mix well with my skincare products, and the shade Golden Hour was  a bit too pigmented + shimmery for my dry/fair-skinned face. I could see this looking better on a more tanned complexion and/or on those who are seeking an all-over highlight look. Looks More Like An All-Over Shimmery Bronzer
