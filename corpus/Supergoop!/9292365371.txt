Literally obsessed. For the longest time I hadn’t been wearing SPF on my face (I know!) but every time I tried a sunscreen it became so oily and was such an unpleasant experience. My sister recommended this to me, raving about how matte it is and how it can be used as a sort of BB  cream even, since it’s slightly tinted and doesn’t leave a white cast, and simply blurs the skin. She was so right, it does all of those things. Pricey but I can’t imagine using any other product now, it’s so soft and smooth. Does at times pill a bit when first putting it on but just pat it out a bit and it’s fine, still very much worth it.Oh and it definitely protects against the sun!! I wore to the beach several days, other areas of my body got burned or tanned but my face was untouched (whereas usually it would also have become red!) Protects well, stays matte, blurs skin - love!
