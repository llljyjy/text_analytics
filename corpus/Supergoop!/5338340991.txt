At 34 yrs old, I recently became obsessed with using sunscreen and also have started worrying about fine lines so when the opportunity to try this came up, I immediately took the chance! I’ve tried a handful of SPF brands and NOTHING has compared to Supergoop so I knew this would be good. The SPF is tinted which threw me off at first but when you apply it, the product melts into your skin without any white cast. This gave me such plump, healthy, glowy skin and no irritation whatsoever. I’m so excited to start regularly incorporating this into my sunscreen routine to see more long-term results. Another hit from Supergoop!
