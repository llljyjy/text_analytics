If you do not have sensitive skin this sunscreen is great, very light/moisturizing and leaves a glowy finish on the skin. HOWEVER the eucalyptus essential oil in the formula gave me huge painful breakout all over my skin. This was the only new product I introduced at the time and my skin improved once I stopped using it. sensitive skin BEWARE
