The only two things I love about this sunscreen is that is a sunscreen and that gives you a beautiful glow with broad spectrum protection. To me. The other two hugeee downsides are: Not waterproof! Meaning that if you sweat caused by weather, loses efficacy AND if some falls into your eyes youâ€™ll end up crying because it burns somewhat. NOT for everyday use
