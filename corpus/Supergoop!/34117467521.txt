I was gifted by Supergoop ! I have been wanting to use this sunscreen for weeks now and I have to say the wait has been worth it. I can definitely say that this is a Black girl friendly sunscreen, I have a darker complexion. It smells amazing, it does not leave a weird white cast over my skin, and it does not leave me feeling greasy or tight. It soaks into the skin so well. I also tried it as a primer step in my makeup and wow! my foundation loves it! I have already gotten my sister hooked on it! Black girl friendly (Dark complexion), I love it!!
