Got this as a sample from a skincare set and was super excited to use. It feels more like a primer, and it immediately absorbed into my skin, but it left it feeling dry- almost mattifying. I got two huge pimples that same night after applying. It was so drying! I recommend the Elta MD skincare sunscreen instead MADE ME BREAKOUT
