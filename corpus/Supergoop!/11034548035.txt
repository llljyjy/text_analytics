I honestly hated this sunscreen, I had to return it. I heard/read soooo many good reviews on this and it was definitely not what I was expecting. It feels heavy and sticky once applied and leaves your skin looking oily. I wouldn’t care all that much if it was just leaving my skin looking oily, but it physically felt like it was clogging my pores. No amount of rubbing it in helped. I had to re-wash my face to get the feeling off. I also tried it for a full day just to see how it would wear, and I swear it feels worse in the sun! It was like I was wearing a heavy face mask all day. Maybe that’s what helps protect your skin, but it was not something I was used to and probably won’t ever adjust to. Yikes!
