i feel the only reason this sells is the tiny eye spf market that currently exists. For me, this went right into the trash. This will sink in and give you lines were you don’t have any. For me, I have no lines at all around my eyes, this stuff is so chalkly and gross, no matter what you apply under or over it becomes a horrible appearing streaky lined mess. Don’t purchase. I  gave it so many chances, missing my reutrn window. But, tbh, I was glad to throw it out, it had been wasting so much of my time in the AM, when I would end up putting it on, only to have to take it off. Most over rated product.
