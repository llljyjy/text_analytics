I absolutely love super poop and all of their products, but this was not my favorite unfortunately. The spray gets into your hair and makes it have a gross stiff texture. The spray also broke down my make up and made me look a lot oilier than I wouldâ€™ve wanted. I tend to wear a full coverage foundation, or concealer and other products. This left me feeling oily after application. This is probably great for people who use very minimal make up but this for me added way too much shine and texture. This was gifted by supergoop! nan
