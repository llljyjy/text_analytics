Here are the facts:Packaging? Horrible. The pump gets stuck and its hard to get the product out, I have bought it 2 or 3 times but it happens every time.Formula... people are right, it does not absorb quickly and it makes you glowy af. This can and will make your make up look oily if you put it on top. HOWEVER... I love it anyway. I use this every morning and night if I can, and it makes my skin look smooth, glowy, evens out my skin tone, it is also one of the FEW SPFs that donâ€™t break me out. I follow up with concealer and a mattifying pressed powder when I need to and it gives me a perfect natural finish.I will buy this again, but beware of the cons! Horrible packaging- but will repurchase
