I’ve worked so hard to have clear skin for the past 2 years, and I take my spf game very seriously. I bought this thinking it would be my new go to when on the run or flying. I reapplied as the instructions said, making sure to blot before applying so that my pores wouldn’t get clogged. The way the product is distributed could be better but it’s a good product for when you’re on the run. But unfortunately, this product made my skin break out like I have never before. Okay Product,don't recommended for oily/combo skin
