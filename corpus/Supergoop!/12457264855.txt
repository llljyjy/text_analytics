This gave my super dry skin a nice glow and unlike most products that give a dewy look, it actually dried down nicely and quickly. The look is somewhere between a normal sunscreen and a tinted moisturizer - definitely good for those no makeup look days when you want something a little extra.  It works fine on my light skin, but if you have anything lighter (fair, very fair) I would definitely try out in store or as a sample first. Great glow for dry skin
