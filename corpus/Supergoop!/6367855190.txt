My favorite to wear every day. I HATE the feeling of being able to feel my sunscreen. This feels like a silicone primer that dries down smooth and basically undetectable. No white cast or heavy feeling. My go-to sunscreen because I know it will work in all situations whether I go bare faced or add makeup. I donâ€™t think it has added skincare benefits like other coming on the market; however, I will continue to keep repurchasing. As a normal skin person with tendencies to get oily in the T zone, this is better for me than Glow as Glow makes me feel like a disco ball when alone. Best All Around Suncreen
