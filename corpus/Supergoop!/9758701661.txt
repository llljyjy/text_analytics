I’m deep in the throes of a Retin A purge and my face is incredibly sensitized, peeling, the whole deal. I live in fear of that sunscreen sting on my vulnerable skin and had to seek out all new products. This is a joy to use, no irritation, totally clear out of the bottle and so never even a temporary white cast, and it soaks in pretty quickly so I’m not waiting for it to set down or forcing it to do so. Woo hoo! Great for retinol sensitized skin
