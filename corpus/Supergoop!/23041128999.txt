I tried it in store. No white cast, awesome! Smelled very heavily of sunscreen. I used to use a Japanese sunscreen but it’s hard to find. So, I tried this. Most american sunscreens aren’t high enough SPF but this one has 50. Well, it pilled all over my face. Which lessens the efficacy of the SPF. And if that wasn’t enough, it burned my eyes so they’ve been stinging all day. It is extremely fragranced. It leaves a nice glow but this is the worst sunscreen I have ever used and will be returning and buying one from a different brand. Burning, pilling, glowing
