I am absolutely in love with my Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 in the shade ‘Sunrise! It’s the most perfect tinted sunscreen. It gives you a beautiful glow but doesn’t leave you looking greasy. It is smooth, breathable, and gives you a barely there coverage. I like to use it on its own for a beautiful sun kissed no-makeup glow, or as a primer under my foundation for the most natural looking makeup. It sits beautifully underneath my foundation and gives me the best glow from within look. Not to mention it’s a clean beauty product and doesn’t break my eczema-prone skin out! Cannot recommend enough and will repurchase again and again! HOLY GRAIL!
