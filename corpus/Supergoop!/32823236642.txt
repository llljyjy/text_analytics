Kindly gifted by Supergoop. I’ve been searching for a sunscreen with good SPF protection and am glad to have found this one. It’s such a lightweight product when applied. I absolutely love the soft texture, invisibility, and even the smell. So I’m excited to have had the opportunity try this out in my routine ahead of the warmer months! nan
