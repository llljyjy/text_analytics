This sunscreen is a game changer! I love the fact that it contains Bioretinol that is super gentle and does not cause my skin the be irritated. Immediately upon application my skin appears hydrated and has a healthy looking glow. I love the light tint that this product contains. It takes away redness and makes the skin look soft even without any foundation. When I wear makeup this product does not cause my makeup to settle nor does it compromise the wearability. I also love that this sunscreen has a daily dropper which makes for easy application. Also the SPF 40 is wonderful for everyday.  I have a new favorite! Perfect Daily Sunscreen
