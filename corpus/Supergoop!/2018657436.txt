We’ve found the product we all need especially for those makeup wearers! The fact that this setting spray has spf automatically gets a 5 in my eyes and it’s easy to use especially over makeup since you need to reapply every so often! I am 30 years old and have a little bit of combo skin and when I use this to set my makeup I notice it definitely gives a Matte finish which I love! Very refreshing nan
