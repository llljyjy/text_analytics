I really wanted to love this sunscreen. I really did. But every time I attempt to apply this product, it starts to pill up. I barely rub it into my skin and it is rolling up and sticking to my hands. I have tried to use this sunscreen both with and without products underneath, nothing changes. I think it is a formula issue. I would recommend the Unseen Sunscreen or the SheerScreen over this one. Not worth the money
