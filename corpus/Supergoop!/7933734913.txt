I love it! I went into sephora looking for something anti-aging and the employee recommended this! I was super skeptical when I got home and read the reviews but I’ve been using it for 2 weeks and I love it! Yes it’s a bit “greasy” but if you let it sit on the skin and then go back with moisturizer it works! I don’t apply makeup until a good 15-20 mins after my skin prep. I love it :-) nan
