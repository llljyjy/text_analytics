I had to repurchase this after I ordered it from ulta and it somehow became unscrewed in my beach bad and spilled everywhere...but this stuff is amazing!! No strong smells or greasy feeling. It just absorbs and makes your skin so soft. Easy to apply and excellent coverage. I was out in the sun all day and did not burn. Just make sure u blend it in well after spraying because it sprays on in spots if that makes sense! love
