i really wanted to like this because it made my skin look beautiful. this gave me a horrible, bumpy, dry rash. i don’t even have particularly sensitive skin… i tend to use zinc oxide based sunscreens, but i can use the la roche posay chemical sunscreens just fine. apart from the rash it also pilled up when i tried to layer a moisturizer under it. overall not impressed for the price point. gave my (not sensitive) skin a rash!!
