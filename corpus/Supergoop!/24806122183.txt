Iâ€™ve been using Supergoop sunscreens for over a year and was excited to try the New Daily Dose Bioretinol + Mineral SPF Sunscreen. I noticed my skin feeling plump and healthy within 2 weeks, I also noticed some reduction of fine lines. its lightweight and is easily absorbed. It has a slight beige tint, which is great for days when im not wearing make up and works so well on days I wear make up - no cast. I would highly recommend adding this to your beauty routine. New Supergoop must have!
