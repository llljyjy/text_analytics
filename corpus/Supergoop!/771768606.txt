While I think this product is a good idea, I don’t think it was executed well. Once it’s on your face, it looks nice and has nice coverage, but the issue I have with it is the application. When applying it on your face, the powder gets EVERYWHERE. It makes a big cloud of powder around you making it difficult to apply quickly and discreetly. It also has a sunscreen scent (yes I know it has sunscreen in it, but I don’t feel like their face primer/ sunscreen has a strong scent like this.) It is nice that it has the brush included, but I think I would like it better if the brush and powder were separate so that I could control the amount of powder that comes out. Great on, but not great application
