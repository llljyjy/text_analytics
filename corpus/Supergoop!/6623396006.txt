This product was gifted to me by Supergoop but the review is my own. I love Supergoop as a sunscreen brand. Their Play sunscreen is my holy grail but I always wanted to find a way to reapply sunscreen during the day. Other similar products tend to sting and burn my sensitive skin but my reaction to this was the complete opposite. I find that it’s an easy reapplication method that doesn’t budge my makeup. It made me a little bit more glowy but I’d rather that than the burning of other sunscreen sprays. You can tone down the shine. I’ll purchase backups during the next sale. nan
