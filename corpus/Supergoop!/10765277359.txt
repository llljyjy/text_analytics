Personally, I wasn’t a fan. It does what it says and functions properly, but I found it to be way too shiny on the skin. I know that’s the point of it, but it made me look like I dipped my face in a pot of oil. I think if you are using it as a primer under makeup it will be fine. I don’t wear foundation or base makeup except for under eye concealer, so this product wasn’t for me. I ended up returning it because I didn’t think I would be able to use it ever. Not a Fan
