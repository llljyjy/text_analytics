This is the perfect on the go SPF mist for my fellow make up wearers or just skin care lovers. I find that I can re apply more easily on top of make up without worrying about moving my foundation around. It does get everywhere and it feels sticky on your clothes. However, I feel that in the summer time I wouldn’t mind because it will fall in other parts of my body. The skin looks super glowy and but doesn’t feels heavy but if you are oily skin, I would stay away. I also suggest to close your eyes very tight, otherwise it can cause irritation.  “Gifted by Supergoop” Perfect for dry skin
