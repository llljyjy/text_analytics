I love this product! I mean my routine makes my skin a little oily afterwards and this helps to balance that out. I know some people may see a white caste, but I don’t and I rub it out pretty gently until I feel comfortable with how it’s spread out throughout my face. Also, a little goes a long way, just remember to reapply. I’m on my second bottle and I still have a little left in my first one, so you get your moneys worth. Love it!
