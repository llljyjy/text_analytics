In two years of using this it has never messed with my skin — doesn’t break me out, doesn’t sting my eyes. Works perfectly under makeup and doesn’t have the oily finish that a lot of sunscreens do. If I had one wish it would be for supergoop to change the packaging because it gets v hard to get product out when you’re down to your last 20% (supergoop please hear my prayers why is the bottom of the tube a 90 degree angle) nan
