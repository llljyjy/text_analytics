I was a bit iffy at first on whether or not it’d be too shimmery or peel but it’s not! My new favorite and go-to tinted sunscreen from now on. Supergoop! Golden Hour is definitely the product to go to when you’re in seek for a glowy and bronzed natural look. It’s also super lightweight and doesn’t feel greasy at all! So in love with it!! Love!
