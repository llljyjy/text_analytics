I really love the dewy glow this product gives my skin! In addition to being a sunscreen, it makes a perfect luminous makeup primer. I like wearing this under my makeup, but I don’t usually use it to reapply since that can get me too glowy! Also // it’s worth noting that this is a chemical sunscreen. So if you’re sensitive to chemical sunscreen filters, keep that in mind! Dewy Goodness!
