Once I got over the Crisco like feeling of this oil, which takes a while to sink in... I think it’s an amazing product. I laid out on the beach all day tanning. Didn’t get burned at all, only tanned. Supergroup is the only brand of sunscreen I’ve used where I don’t get burned at all. I start believing I don’t burn in the sun from consistent use, but then I try something else and get horribly burned. Works really well
