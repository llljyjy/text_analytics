I won’t wear makeup when I work from home, but I also want to look decent for video calls. This is a really nice sunscreen / half makeup / half skincare. I was skeptical when I first put it on because it washed me out and didn’t seem to apply evenly, but it looks great when I brush it out a bit with my foundation brush and use blush to warm it up. It stays well, looks natural, and feels light enough to work from home in. Also love that is has SPF. Great for Working from Home
