Supergroup! has done it again with this SPF. I started using this product last week and I was not disappointed. The texture is light-weight and it absorbs and melts into skin like a dream. It didn’t leave a white cast and the watery texture wasn’t greasy or sticky. I love the packaging and can definitely throw this product in my purse for quick touch ups throughout the day. If you’re on the hunt for a new SPF for the spring/summer, then look no further. Supergoop! is it. My New SPF Bestie
