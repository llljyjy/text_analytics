This protects the skin barrier and itâ€™s highly moisturizing and restorative oil helps soothe and soften my skin while locking in long-lasting hydration,  leaving my skin with an all day healthy glow.  I apply this in the a.m. as my last step in my skincare routine. It can be layered on top of the Superscreen and before Unseen Sunscreen. Love this moisturizing oil!
