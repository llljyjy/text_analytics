I am so disappointed. I had huge expectations for this sunscreen, it seemed innovating and moisturizing. The amount  You usually have to put to guarantee that your sunscreen will effectively protect you is a quarter size, so to start with that was hard ti gauge, second it just sat on my face not absorbed it at all, it transferred to anything that my skin touched even after several hours after i put it on, and I mean 5-6 hours, i could tell by the smell. My skin is combination with big dry patches and I this thing did not absorb on either dry or oily sides of my skin.I do not know for whom this will work, It did not for me. I am stuck with a full bottle. does not absorb, huge dissapointment
