I’m consistently underwhelmed by supergoop products. They feel literally goopy, very greasy and heavy. This spray is oily. It doesn’t disperse evenly when sprayed so the coverage isn’t even. By the end of the day my face felt granular from the powders clumping together. Great potential and idea, but overall awful texture. nan
