Trying to get in the habit of wearing sunscreen Every. Single. Day. so I’ve been testing all the new SPF launches and being a huge fan of Supergoop knew that I needed to try out their Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50 ASAP! The packaging is fun and the product is packed with skin-friendly ingredients that go way beyond just sun protection. It has a creamy consistency that absorbs beautifully leaving the skin hydrated and radiant. Very comfortable to wear, not greasy or heavy at all, and doesn’t irritate my eyes! Undetectable under makeup and does not pill. There is a light “sunscreen” scent to it that’s very subtle and dissipates quickly. Already have a backup ready for upcoming travel! Complimentary from Supergoop. Super-GOOD!
