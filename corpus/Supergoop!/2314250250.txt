This product is horrible. Do not believe those reviews that say “incentivized“, they are lying! I can’t believe this product has 4 stars. It’s extremely oily, i sprayed it and obviously pushed my hair back and yet, the tiny drops i got on my hair made my hair so oily that i had to wear a hat i had in my car.My face was legit dripping oil, the spray is too thick (not a mist) so you get drops that when touched feel like pure oil sitting on your face. Take make it worse, the bottle was dripping into my purse and made a big mess. DO NOT GET THIS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
