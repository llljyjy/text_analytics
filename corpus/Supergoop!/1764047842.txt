Received this item gifted by Supergoop. I was really excited to try because this sounded perfect for reapplying sunscreen over makeup. However, it looks very greasy over makeup and gritty in the hair and clothes that is falls on (since the mist is very harsh). Love it on its own when out swimming at the pool and I’m not worried about getting it in my hair or clothes. Gives off a really nice glow. Gives off a really nice glow…
