This product was gifted to me by Supergoop. I love a lotion that has SPF! It didn’t leave a white cat on my skin which was great and I loved how it left my skin feeling refreshed and glowy. However, it does smell like sunscreen which wasn’t a problem for me but I know others may not be too excited about the smell. nan
