I wanted to love this so badly after reading about the ingredients but other than irritating my eyes, this sunscreen is patchy, won’t blend, pilled, oily, and broke me out. It’s a shame, the concept sounds like it could have been a great product if it was better executed, but the fact that this pilled means that it won’t offer much sun protection which would defeats the purpose of this product. Will be throwing this out. one of the worst sunscreen I’ve ever use
