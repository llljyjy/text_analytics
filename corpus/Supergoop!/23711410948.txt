This is my absolute favorite sunscreen - it adds glow and a bit of coverage + SPF. It is easy to layer and reapply without pilling. It also goes beautifully underneath makeup and creates a nicely prepped base. I love that it’s a clean chemical sunscreen so no white cast but also no harmful chemicals that damage my skin longterm. My favorite and I’ll definitely be repurchasing! nan
