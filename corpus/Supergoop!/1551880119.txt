This was one of my must have products before they change the formulation and packaging. Before it left you with more of a matte clean finish that would work for so many different occasions, it was a true setting spray. Now it makes your face look greasy and heavy. The spray nozzle is terrible. It spreads out like a fan and distributes the product unevenly. The old nozzle was more of an even mist and was more accurate. Extremely disappointed since it was almost a year of waiting for this to come back on to the market. Hopefully they go back to the old formula and nozzle spray, will have to find a new SPF settling spray. Complete letdown
