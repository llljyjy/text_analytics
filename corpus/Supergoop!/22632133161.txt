I only buy Supergoop sunscreen but this is not my fav product…it feels like it doesn’t fully absorb into my skin and doesn’t feel smooth, almost chalky? It literally smells like burnt hair and it sticks onto anything that touches your face (clothes, hands, etc.). I’d recommend skipping this product and going with any of the other Supergoop screens. nan
