The Supergoop (Re)Setting Refreshing Mist is a great way to add additional SPF throughout the day and to reapply sunscreen without messing up my makeup. I would not use this as your only sunscreen as obviously you are not applying enough product with a mist but I think it is a great boost to your sun protection. I have been looking for a way to reapply my sunscreen with makeup on and this is it. The product sprays on evenly and dries fairly quickly with no white cast evident (FYI I have fair skin). There is no greasy feeling that you often get with sunscreen and it isnâ€™t sticky like some setting sprays. Overall, I have to say that this is a fantastic product and one that will become a staple in my beauty routine, particularly during the summer. This product was gifted to me. Amazing! Great for reapplying sunscreen!
