So bought this. Was super excited about it because it’s a setting spray and spf. Yay. Always need sunscreen on the face. Got it in yesterday. So used it this morning. Omfg. It sucks majorly. First of all this stuff STINKS. can’t put my finger on what it smells like but it’s all I can smell. And it’s supposed to be a matte finish. Guess what it’s not…. A matte finish. My face looks like I just rubbed oil on it. And I put my normal matte setting spray on over it. It got all over the place so it’s on my shoulder and arm. Those feel super greasy and gross. I’m so annoyed. For the price I was expecting a lot better. Hopefully I can return this garbage. definitely not worth it.
