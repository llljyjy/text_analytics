Complimentary from Supergoop.  I was given this product free in exchange for an honest review. Honestly, I am surprised that Super Goop makes this sunscreen. They say they make “clean“ products but all of the sunscreen ingredients in here are not reef safe. They don’t even prevent sun rays from getting to and penetrating skin. Only mineral sunscreen fits the description as reef and protective. I would not buy this or any chemical sunscreens. Not reef safe
