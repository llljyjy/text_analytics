I received Glowscreen SPF 40-Sunrise as a gift.  It is worthwhile to have it! It is lightweight and can be absorbed quickly. Even after I wear it for the whole day, I still can feel it on my face and protect my face from ultraviolet light. It is also friendly for following makeup, wonâ€™t make me feel heavy and unnatural. Great Choice
