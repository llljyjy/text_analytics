This is my first time using sunscreen oil. I use face oils in the winter so an sunscreen oil seems like the perfect fit to my morning routine. It is super hydrating on my skin while adding SPF protection. Love this combination skincare products that both protects and hydrates especially in the winter. This product was gifted to me by Supergoop. Perfect Solution for SPF and Dry Skin in winter
