When I ordered it this I thought it was a regular sunscreen, instead, this is a makeup primer with sunscreen for day wear. It has a dewy finish because of the ingredients wich you can search on their website, targeted mainly for dry and aging skin. Well, still I gave this a fair chance and tried it. Indeed it has a pearlescent look to provide the dewiness wich I am weary because I have oily skin already. Needless to say I looked so oily after using it even after absorbing on my skin. Is this a bad product? I can’t honestly say because it’s not for my skin type. I’ll give it to my mom to see if it works better on her. So oily for me
