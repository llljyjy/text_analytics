Was happy to see new SPF50, this is an awesome newbie for upcoming warmer days. Love the cute small pocketbook friendly packaging. I was very pleased with this spf formula. It’s a watery and light texture, it does have strong spf scent at first but it does fade away. Totally and entirely melts into the skin and dries out quickly. It left zero greasy residue behind. And absolutely no white cast. Works very well under makeup, my foundation stayed put all day with it. As I gave ditched other Supergoop products in the past because of it burning my eyes or not been makeup friendly, thus newbie is finally their winner for me. I don’t think anyone who wear spf daily will be disappointed. SPF the way it should be
