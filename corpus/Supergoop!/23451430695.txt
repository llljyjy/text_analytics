I love Supergoop Sunscreens  and glow screen is my new favorite. It is such a beautiful golden sunscreen. It leaves a light golden tint on my face with a subtle healthy glow.  I pair it with a tinted moisturizer and it looks beautiful in itself and underneath the makeup too. When I opened it I thought Its going to be dark for my light medium skin but it was perfect.
