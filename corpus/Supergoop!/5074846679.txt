Looks really pretty on the skin. I have tan skin and this color worked well for me. Add a little concealer and I looked great! However! This broke my skin out SO bad. I have normal to dry skin and I always end up greasy when this is applied. My face started gradually breaking out and at one point I had about 7 pimples at a time from this. They were big, red and painful. They didn’t clear up until I stopped using this. Such a shame! If you don’t have acne sensitive skin, you’ll enjoy this. Not for Acne Prone Skin
