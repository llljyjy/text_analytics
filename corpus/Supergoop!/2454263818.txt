I absolutely love this product. I’ve been using it every day since I received it and it is phenomenal. I use it as my last step in my skincare before makeup and it has a thin, not sticky formula. I really think it would work with all skin types. It’s a great base for makeup, I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on my skin lately. I love knowing my skin is protected and will absolutely be using this in the future, this was complimentary from Supergoop but I will be purchasing. non greasy, fabulous, for EVERYone.
