I’ve never used a setting spray before and this was a nice surprise for me. I love that this has SPF and can act as a quick reapplication of SPF throughout the day on top of my makeup. Unfortunately it does have a strong smell and can sting the eyes and nose if you don’t close them right during application. The spray nozzle is not super concentrated so it’ll spread out during the spray. You may need a few sprays for coverage. Love reapplying during the day!
