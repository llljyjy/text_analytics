This is probably one of my favorite sunscreens I’ve ever tried! I’ve tried buying other sunscreens, mineral ones that “don’t leave a white cast“ and cheaper chemical options, and I just purchased this sunscreen for the fourth time. I also come back to this because it’s a reliable choice and have had no problems. I’m Southeast Asian with a skin tone that’s on the lighter side of the medium/tan range, so if I wear a 100% mineral sunscreen, my skin is light enough that it blends in but also dark enough for someone to tell that my skin tone looks off (sort of like a white cool-toned tint to my warm skin?). In other words, I just look a bit paler than usual and it looks unnatural. With this sunscreen, I don’t have to think about if you can see it on my skin or if it’s not blended. I usually put on more sunscreen than suggested (just to be safe), and this glides on extremely easily over my skin ( and I also didn’t notice any scent/an unpleasant chemical smell). It is a bit slippery (no oils are in this, just silicones), but your skin will feel soft after rubbing it in. Speaking of which, you don’t need to put in a lot of effort to apply! I had recently gotten jaw surgery and had switched to a different sunscreen (chemical, but had a white color that disappeared after rubbing in). I had incisions on the left and right side of my bottom jaw, which sunscreen would be necessary to prevent scarring, and I found that I had trouble rubbing in my sunscreen (walking into harsh lighting, I’d see white along the sides of my jaw from not blending well enough). I switched to this instead and had no problem, nor did I have to worry about having any weird coloring. The finish is a soft matte, almost similar to the Fenty Pro Filter Instant Retouch Primer. Overall, if you want an SPF that you would enjoy applying and wouldn’t have to worry about looking weird or greasy, this is perfect! An SPF You Won't Have to Think Twice About!
