I have an oily skin a very oily T zone , I was struggling to find a sunscreen that would keep my skin looking Matt and out of grease along the day, I felt like this was expensive but No believe me this sunscreen definitely worth every dollar I paid , I’m enjoying using it also blends perfectly with my foundation it gives me the soft Matt finish for my makeup it does work as a primer … love it!!! game changer
