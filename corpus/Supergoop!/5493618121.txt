The oil made my skin oily/glowy but I can’t attest to how protective it is against the UV rays and sun. I don’t burn easily and don’t use this oil when I’m doing any water activities. The bottle is the worst part about this product. If the bottle his not upright, the oil leaks out through the cap. It’s ruined my bag and clothes. Bottle leaks; mediocre oil
