So I never write reviews for product on here, but I had to just for this product. I’m fair skinned and hate wearing sunscreen mostly because it makes me look greasy or smells like sunscreen and I just don’t like it. This product is perfect for me. It goes on evenly, has no smell, and does not make you look greasy. It soaks into your skin and you don’t even know you are wearing it. I’m so happy I found this product. best sunscreen ever.
