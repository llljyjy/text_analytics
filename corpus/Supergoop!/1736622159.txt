Took this product on a tropical vacation. My friend and I applied liberally and often over a 3 hour beach stint and left completely roasted. In areas where we used other sunscreen we were fine. I’m convinced the oil attracts the sun! Not a good product for fair skin or those who aren’t in direct sun a lot already. buyer beware
