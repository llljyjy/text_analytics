This SPF has a creamy texture that glides nicely and feels lightweight on the skin. It provides minimal coverage while adding beautiful shimmery glow to the complexion. My combo skin seems to love this formula. No break outs, no excessive oiliness issues. Great sunscreen overall! Beautiful glowy finish!
