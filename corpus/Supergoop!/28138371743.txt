Not the best and not the worst spf I have tried. I probably would buy this again only because it does not break me out the way other spf’s have in the past. It also does not pill on my skin when using this in combination with primers, moisturizers, or foundation. Now I will say it is something I have tried because I have seen it everywhere on my socials and I’m not mad at it. Do I wish it had cleaner ingredients? Absolutely, but the cleaner ones tend to pill on my skin and this one doesn’t. I always use the recommended 3 fingers worth of spf and it can get a little too slippery on my face so I have mixed this with their unseen sunscreen, so 2 fingers worth of glow screen and one finger worth of unseen and I have found that to be a bit better for my combination/dry skin. With that said I do tend to have dryer skin so that’s another reason why this could work for me. The glow in this spf reminds me of the CT Flawless filter so I love that but if I’m using this product I’m definitely skipping any other glow type product as a primer. So yea I’m not totally blown away by this spf, but I’m definitely not mad at it either. It’s pretty good for what it is
