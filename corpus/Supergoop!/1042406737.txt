I’m on my 3rd jar of this stuff. I use tretinoin so I need hydration and also sun protection. I live in Florida so I’m exposed even driving my car. This is a very hydrating cream so if you want something lighter, it’s not for you. It can appear greasy at first but my skin drinks it up after a few minutes. I use it under my primer and foundation and it doesn’t pill. Performs like a regular moisturizer only with the benefit of spf. Love
