This product was gifted by supergoop in exchange for my honest review. The scent on this is super strong and smells like a sunscreen from the early 2000s with bug spray as well. That almost stings your nose kind of scent. It dissipates quickly but if you’re sensitive to that you may not like this. It applies really nicely though and doesn’t feel greasy at all. nan
