I love this sunscreen for my face! It gives off a slight shimmery tint, which I love since I don’t wear a lot of foundation in the summer. I also really like that it doesn’t have a super strong sunscreen smell. Feels like a lightweight coverage. It will be a go to for me on these bright summery days! Shimmery Sunscreen
