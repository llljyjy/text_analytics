I am usually someone who uses a powder spf to reapply my sun protection throughout the day. However, this got me interested for the hot summer days when a spray would be super refreshing while also adding sun protection, which I am a huge proponent of. I do wish this had all physical blockers, but I don’t find it stings my eyes when I apply. And the best part is that it doesn’t disturb my makeup at all, nor does it leave the large water droplets on the face like some other sprays I have tried. I do believe that there isn’t a way to get the whole spf 40 protection with the amount you spray on your face, but I appreciate having a way to help a little when using this spray. Definitely one of the better ones I have tried. This was sent to me complimentary from Supergoop for review. One of the best SPF sprays!
