Unfortunately, this product did not work out for me as a setting spray. The Supergoop ReSetting Spray was sent to my complimentary from Supergoop. I used it after applying most of my makeup, but before mascara. Then I went and applied my favorite mascara combo. Within minutes, my mascara had smudged all over my cheeks and under eyes. I will still try this product when Iâ€™m not wearing any makeup at all, but this will not work as a setting spray over makeup for me! Not For Me :/
