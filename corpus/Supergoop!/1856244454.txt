DO NOT USE THIS! I’m 32 years old and I’m lucky I’ve never had acne in my entire life. I got this as a sample and used it twice, a week apart. After the first time i used it I had little bumps and blackheads on my forehead, didn’t make the connection between the two yet. Then I used it again a week later and my entire forehead is covered in bumps, blackheads, whiteheads, and a couple deep pimples. And my pores look so much bigger than they’ve ever been all over my face. I’m so upset because it’s been a couple weeks and my skin still looks terrible. I never ever get breakouts and this happened.
