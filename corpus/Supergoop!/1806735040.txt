This is not at all what I expected. It made my medium-build liquid foundation and concealer look cakey and greasy after I blended everything out. It also doesn’t set your makeup the way a traditional setting spray would. My foundation was still transferring because there was a greasy layer on top. I was expecting it to be more of a matte looking setting spray but it’s far from it! I have suuuper oily skin so I’m always leaning on the matte side of products. I always end up looking “glowy“ (a bit oily) by the end of the day. I had to powder on top of the spray in order to tone down the greasy look. IMO, that defeats the purpose of what I was hoping for: a simple reapplication method to have as a top layer. It didn’t smudge or run my mascara, eyeshadow, or brows. It made my skin look really textured and emphasized my pores. I’ll use up this bottle to reapply face spf but not over makeup. I think this would be a great travel option for reapplying face spf, especially if you’re in a situation where your hands might be dirty or you need something quick. I don’t plan on repurchasing this Looks greasy, makes foundation look cakey
