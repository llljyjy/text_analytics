This is basically a tinted moisturizer, but it’s still a great product! It makes my skin look nearly flawless, yet is so sheer that you can’t even tell that I have any product on my face. It also doesn’t show up on clothes should you accidentally touch your clothing to your face which is really surprising!It does make my face a tad bit darker than my natural complexion, but it’s not to the point that it makes me look orange. I’d honestly prefer a shade lighter (hence my 4 out of 5 star rating), but it’s not a major complaint of mine since it just makes my face look sunkissed compared to the rest of my body. It’s not greasy either like other sunscreens, and it protects against blue-light! Best of all worlds
