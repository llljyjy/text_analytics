I am very impressed  with this product. It’s my first time seeing and trying a sunscreen that’s also a face oil. It left my skin feeling moisturized and it felt very lightweight on my skin. Left no sticky residue. It’s coming in handy right now with this harsh winter weather wrecking havoc on my dry skin.  Gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my honest review. Love this oil
