This product is terrible! The smell is really bad and makes me feel uncomfortable to apply to my skin, the texture is weird and hard to smooth out on my skin.Even worse, I started having break outs after using it, and it starts peeling in the middle of the day and make me look like I just got a lot dandruff on my face!Absolutely the worse! Throwing it away and will not buy from this brand again! Terrible, smells bad, cause breakouts, and peels!
