For reference, I have tan/brown skin, combo to dry skin type. No white cast, however: While it is very hydrating, it is also VERY GREASY. I used this with and without makeup. If you’re looking for a product to wear under makeup - avoid this. any makeup on top of it will look weird and sit “on top of your skin.“ For non makeup users- It is still relatively oily. Apply this last because if you apply this before any product, the product will just slide right off your face.It has a NOTICEABLE sunscreen smell. If you are sensitive to smell, avoid this. The smell also doesn’t go away after a while. you can feel it on your skin no matter how much you blend it or how little you use. It is also a thick consistency. I gave it 3 stars because this is definitely not my favorite, however It probably does it’s job with protecting you from UV Rays. I just can’t stand keeping this on my face because it is just so uncomfortable and slippery. OILY EVEN ON DRY-COMBO SKIN. HEAVY SMELL
