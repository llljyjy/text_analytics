I like this product to throw in my to - go summer back for a refresher of sunscreen when Im out in the sun when I am wearing makeup. I’ll be honest though,  I dont love this as a ’makeup setting spray’. The nozzle sprayer sometimes squirts out - not at all ’fine mist’. It’s great for a liquid sunscreen spray, but not as a makeup refresher spray. This was gifted by Supergoop for review. Good 2 reapply SPF over makeup
