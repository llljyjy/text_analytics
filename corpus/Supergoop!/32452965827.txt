I really love this product gifted by Supergoop! This is my first time trying a sunscreen in this form and I love that it doesn’t leave a white cast like many lotions . It feel great in my skin and a little bit goes a long way. I think I am officially going to make this my go to product for sun protection . I also love that it’s hydrating. Wonderful product ! Love this !
