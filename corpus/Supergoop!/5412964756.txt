I receive this Supergoop Glow spf complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It was simple to review because I’ve previously purchased this spf in the past and have liked it. Not loved, but liked. I have combination skin and noticed by the end of the day, it will sit in creases of your skin, like under-eye area if applied too heavily. I made the mistake of doing to the two/finger method and it was too much for me personally. I really like that it leaves a healthy glow, but for me, I have blemishes and it kind of enhances those blemishes. I do like this spf because it doesn’t leave my skin sticky or anything like that. nan
