I didn’t read the directions at first so I was putting it over my moisturizer as the last step in my routine. It was clumpy and gritty and I didn’t understand why it would get good reviews and it’s not the standard of supergoop that I’m used too! I finally read the directions and holy cow. What a difference! It feels so smooth and my skin looks brighter and I’m only moderately consistent. I’m so glad I figured it out because it’s now a staple!! Read the directions
