I really wanted to love this because it had such good reviews! I believed it would work well for me based on that alone so I purchased the largest size. Sadly this missed the mark for me. The Pros: Clean beauty, cute bottle, no white cast left on your skin. The cons: For me personally this was extremely sticky, it didn’t seem like it absorbed into my skin. It also had a greasiness to it which I kind of liked but the stickiness of this made it super uncomfortable. I have a cat and all her hair was sticking to me. I really wanted to love this and however, it just didn’t work out for me. Sticky sunscreen
