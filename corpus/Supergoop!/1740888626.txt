I have been looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t clog my pores for oh, I don’t know, twenty years? This stuff is a godsend. Can’t believe it. I do get some slight clogging around the edges of my hairline, which I think has been due to working out a lot more. This stuff does burn and irritate my eyes if I get it in there, which is the only thing I don’t like about it. Otherwise I’m so happy to finally have a non stinky sunscreen that doesn’t make my entire face break out. nan
