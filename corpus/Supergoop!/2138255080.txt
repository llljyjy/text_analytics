Not this face. The only pro I see with this sunscreen is that it leaves no cast and applies easily. But it burned my eyes and agitated my skin some. I usually just wear a tinted moisturizer after applying sunscreen and itâ€™s enough to give me a nice, even, glowy look. But that was not the case after applying my tinted moisturizer over this. The smell is also horrendous, like straight alcohol and I could feel it in the back of my throat. The overall feel remains pretty sticky too. nan
