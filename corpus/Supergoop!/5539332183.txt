I ordered this because I loved the idea behind an spf and vitamin C in one! If you plan on to use this as your only spf for the day, I recommend using this as your last step in your skincare routine. My face is definitely brighter and more youthful after using this product! The only con is that you absolutely need to set your face with setting powder afterwards. I usually just conceal my under eyes and add Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood filter to my cheeks and forehead. I definitely have to make another step and set my face with setting powder to cut the oil/shine on my face. I’m ok with adding the extra step to my routine but it would be nice if I didn’t have to. Great product but 4 stars for being super oily. it works great
