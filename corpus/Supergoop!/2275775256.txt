I bought this product hoping for a sunscreen that would provide a nice glow for the summer months. Applying enough product to provide any kind of SPF protection creates an unnatural shimmery/oily look. From what I have seen on social media, the people that RAVE about Glow Screen are using just a tiny amount of product, definitely not enough to provide any kind of sun protection. nan
