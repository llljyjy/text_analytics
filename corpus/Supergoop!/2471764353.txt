There are so many great ingredients in this multi-use skin care goodie! It’s pretty much a serum with SPF and you use it as the last step of your skin care routine. I took out my serum step and just use this on top of moisturizer now! I like the consistency of this since it’s easy to spread and absorbs quickly. There is no white cast even though it’s sunscreen, but make sure you use enough if it’s your only SPF (like the packaging states). My skin feels soft and looks smooth when using this during my day to day. Hoping it helps my wrinkles from getting worse! Super ingredients!
