Now this is a special SPF product. I am so impressed by it because  it feels like a high-end skin care.  It has a light texture and is slightly tinted, it literally melts into the skin and gives the most beautiful finish.  It feels amazing on the skin and has ZERO white cast. There is no film, grayness or peeling.  I have worn with or without make up and is perfect. So glad I discovered it. THE BEST SPF
