I’m actually really shocked by how much I like this SPF. I feel glowy, but not greasy. The formula sits quite thin in the skin, which I love as other SPFs can weight my skin down. I had some trouble layering under makeup (even with checking for ingredients that might not pair).Also, I did notice some additional pore congestion. Too soon to say if it was the SPF, but it’s the only thing I’ve changed in my routine.Nonetheless, still would reach for the on no makeup days. Not Too Bad
