I picked this sunscreen up during the spring sale because it was supposed to not be super thick and go on nearly invisible - a little white cast doesn’t bother me.  The white cast was very strong with this product and I found that I looked like a grease ball when I put this on my face (as in, it looks like I’ve used an oil cleanser on my face but haven’t washed it off yet).  I have also found that I cannot put makeup over this as it is just pills away. Finally, while the chemical smell isn’t terrible, but it’s definitely there.  I’ll use this stuff on my body when I head outside, but as for the face, it’s a no for me. Not For Me - Too Greasy for Under Makeup
