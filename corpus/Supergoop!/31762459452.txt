Okay, so I waited to write my review because I wanted to test the product out on a face with foundation, a skin tint, and also bare face. I didnâ€™t like it bare face because my face started feeling very greasy. However, with the foundation and skin tint, as a base, this product pairs very nicely! Gives a flawless finish and held my makeup in place. I do believe it pairs best with a skin tint, though. Nice makeup base
