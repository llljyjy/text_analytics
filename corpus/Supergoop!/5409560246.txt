I love how this sunscreen looks on my skin, it makes it look healthy and glowy. What I don’t like is that it never really dries down, it stays tacky. It doesn’t pill under makeup but since it’s sticky Id recommend using a makeup sponge vs a brush. It didn’t emphasize texture/pores but didn’t have the same blurring effect as Supergoops Unseen Sunscreen. Since it doesn’t dry down I think it could make oily skin look oilier.I think this would work best for dry/normal skin. Not For Oily/Textured Skin
