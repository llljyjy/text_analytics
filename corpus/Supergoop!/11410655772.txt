This product specifically, I bought for my father as he is always in the sun at the beach and is an avid sunscreen wearer. He also has VERY dry skin and I really wanted to help him with his dry skin. and because he already uses sunscreen everyday this product was very easily integrated into his daily routine and now his skin in moisturized and protected! He tells me that he LOVES it! He says he wants more of the product from now on for holidays and gifts lol His skin has really gotten better too, it was very flakey and dry before and now he is moisturized with no flakes! He is very pleased with this product and I will continue to buy it for him. On a side note, I love any product from SUPERGOOP! I have been using their basic sunscreen for years to protect my tattoos from the fl sun. It is the only product of sunscreen that does not make me feel greasy, or look cloudy, or smell like sunscreen. It absorbs right into my screen, doesn’t get on my clothes, and feels light! I won’t use anything else. Thanks SUPERGOOP! LOVE SUPERGOOP! SUNSCREENS
