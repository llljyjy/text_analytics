I look grey after applying. The texture is okay, I donâ€™t look greasy but I look grey. I tried to rub it in, I waited 20 minutes for my skin to warm the product up but still look grey. I have to put moisturizer on top of it (making it less effective) to get some of my color back. Im haunting my bathroom
