The bad reviews on this item are dramatic. It’s literally spray in sunscreen and works that way. I wore it over makeup and it melted down perfectly. I think perhaps it doesn’t play well with some products. For reference I had put on daytime skin care earlier in the day. It included the fresh deep hydration toner,  real complexion’s hyaluron skin essence, a very light layer byroe’s fog renewal oil and murad’s oil and pore control mattifier sunscreen. This was all over 2 hours before I put on my makeup hence the need for the reapplication of sun screen. I was definitely a bit more dewy in complexion after applying but I experienced no separation, the smell was very mild, and I waited until it dries to no burning eyes. I will definitely be purchasing this product for as long as they make it. Being able to apply sunscreen over my make changes the game. The bad reviews are dramatic
