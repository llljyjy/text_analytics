I literally never leave a negative review on a product but for this one I couldn’t hold myself back. I’ve been using this product for about 4 months now. I have super dry skin and moisturize prior to using this. I haven’t seen anyone else complain about this but this product leaves my skin extremely flakey, and if i glide my finger across my face, the entire product peels off. It doesn’t blend well at all. It also makes me look so greasy, not glowy. I genuinely don’t like it at all. Again, I am not sure if this has anything to do with my having very dry skin, but considering I moisturize in advance, I am very confused. Will not purchase this again. I do like their unseen sunscreen though. Its just this particular product that didn’t work for me at all. Disappointed!
