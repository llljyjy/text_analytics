I have the SPF 30 with Marigold Extract version. I like it because the spray works well. The product itself is nice ’cause it dries down quickly and doesn’t budge. I use it for when I want something waterproof when being outside during hot sunny days. It does have a white cast, but I like it since I use it for when I want the reassurance that it’s on my skin. It’s protected me at the beach, at a music festival, or all day at an amusement park. I can’t wait to try the SPF 50 with Green Tea version because I like the idea of higher SPF.
