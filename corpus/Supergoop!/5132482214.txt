Received this complimentary from SuperGoop. I want to really love it but firstly, the smell put me off. It’s not horrible but it reminds me of the sunscreens my parents put on me back then as a kid. I have combination skin and it’s okay, it doesn’t feel super sticky or anything. Also, I noticed it contains alcohol which I try to avoid. nan
