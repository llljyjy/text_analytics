I needed to figure out a waterproof make up routine for the summer. That wasn’t the hard part as a lot of brands do that, but I noticed my face didn’t have that healthy glow when I was using all the waterproof stuff. I decided to add this in order to 1) really set my make up as I do water sports and 2) give my face more radiance. While the idea is great -- a water proof setting spray that has SPF, the execution was lacking. These are my two main complaints:1) The bottle leaks. It’s not a torrent, but liquid does seep out so that the whole thing becomes oily and hard to handle. Not to mention it wastes.2) The sprayer is not fine enough. The liquids comes out in small droplets instead of a fine mist. It lands on my face and leaves tiny shiny dots all over. I would buy this again if I can figure out how to put it in a better bottle, but I will be looking for a different one in the meantime. Great idea, bad execution
