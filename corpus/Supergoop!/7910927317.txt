I have super oily skin and I don’t wear makeup. I usually use an SPF moisturizer but I wanted this to be able to reapply SPF later in the day and not make my skin more oily. Getting the powder to come out wasn’t a problem. The problem was that the first time I used it, I tried to use the brush to blend it in and smooth it out like you would with a translucent setting powder. All that did was pill like crazy. Not my favorite. So the next time I tried just dabbing the powder all over my face and waited for it to naturally absorb and mix in with my already oily skin. That seemed to work fine. It created a matte layer that looked smooth and I went about my day. However, a few hours later when I tried to apply the powder again (I’d like to at least try to get in the habit of re-applying every two hours if I can) it just broke up the first layer of powder and created a patchy, pilling mess.  So truly I can only get one good SPF reapplication out of this product. Which is better than nothing, that’s why the 3 stars but ultimately I wanted something that I could use throughout the day and this just isn’t it. I don’t think I will end up repurchasing as a result. Ok for one application
