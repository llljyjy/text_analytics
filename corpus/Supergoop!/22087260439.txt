I usually love supergoop products and absolutely love my unseen and am willing to pay the price for good sunscreen. 3 stars because it feels great on, a little goes a long way and I like the texture but it smells pretty bad and the smell lasts. I think it’s meant to be an un scented kind of scent so it doesn’t have a perfumey smell but it kind of smells like chemicals. smells bad
