Bought this a couple weeks ago and LOVE IT! I am a super huge Supergoop! fan anyway, but this is my favorite product from them by far! It sprays easily, no terrible smell (I am sensitive to smells so this one doesnâ€™t bother me, but may others). It is not super greasy, rubs in easily! I burn very easily, but have been using this daily and have yet to burn. Sad it only comes in 1 size. Non-Greasy, rubs in well
