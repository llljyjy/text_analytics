I never knew I would be obsessed with a SPF spray but the SuperGoop (Re) Setting is a new holy grail and necessity in my life! Personally speaking, if I’m wearing makeup it’s hard to re-apply cream SPF so I’ve been like spray SPF a lot but some that I’ve been using is around 30 so it’s really nice to find SPF 40. I really recommend this especially since summer is coming, but overall, this is nice to have everywhere you go, whether to re-apply SPF or feel refreshed throughout the whole day! It’s mommy first SuperGoop SPF product to try and I am INLOVE already! PS. *gifted by SuperGoop but all opinions + experiences my own. MUST HAVE SPF SPRAY! Easy to use & re-apply!
