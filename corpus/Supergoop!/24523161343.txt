I really like this way of putting on spf. I have dry sensitive skin and the kindest of products can cause my skin barrier to freak out. This product has become a holy grail for me, it has the ceramides for my skin barrier and spf in a zero white cast, eye stinging, oil that make my skin and look so nourished! This product is *chefs kiss*. Not sure how this would do for people with acne prone or oily skin, since I donâ€™t really suffer from acne and my skin type is not oily. New Holy Grail SPF
