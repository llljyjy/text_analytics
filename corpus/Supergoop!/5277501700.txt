I received this product complimentary from Supergoop.  I love it when a product does everything it claims to do.  This is an excellent setting spray.  Sprays evenly and dries down quickly.  It didn’t leave any greasy feeling on my skin at all.  This spray makes reapplying so easy!  And have I mentioned the scent???  It’s a refreshing mint smell that is so yummy!  Doesn’t burn my eyes or leave that weird sunscreen taste in your mouth.  Supergoop, you have outdone yourselves with this one! Makes reapplying so easy!
