Totally thought this item would be my new go-to for the beach and every day outings.When wearing makeup and tanning at the beach for several hours, my skin looked cakey when applying it. At the end of the day when I removed my makeup I had some redness/sun burn on my face. Note: I did reapply every few hours. CAKEY AND DIDN'T PROTECT:(
