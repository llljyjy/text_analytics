I am so pale and this is the first sunscreen I’ve ever used where I didn’t have any sunburns after a day at the beach! It goes on so smoothly- the mist is so even. It actually stays on in the water and isn’t sticky. I’ll never use another sunscreen at the beach or pool again! Love love love! best sunscreen I’ve ever used
