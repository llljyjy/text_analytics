I’ve been using supergoop! sunscreens for quite a while now. I love that this single face watery lotion with spf 50 feels so light weight on my skin. I also love that it doesn’t leave a white cast. I also noticed that it leaves my face well hydrated & not oily, it also absorbs into my skin quickly. Definitely a keeper. Received complimentary from supergoop! So good
