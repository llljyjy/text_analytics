Really wanted to love this! I was really excited to try a sunscreen with a bit of tint but this is not it. I tried wearing this under makeup and I looked so greasy you could fry chicken on my face. It has so much slip and never really felt like it sat on my face. If you have oily skin just avoid. Grease ball
