I bought this product bc a coworker recommended it to me and I really like it. I have been wearing for about 6 months and honestly since I bought it, I have maybe used my foundation about 3-5 times because I use this as my primer/ foundation everyday. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and even. The tint is beautiful and it matches my skin tone very well. It does not leave my skin feeling oily hence the name. Must have!
