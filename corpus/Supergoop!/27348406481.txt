This sunscreen is great! I love that it dries down and feels just like your skin. Itâ€™s perfect for me considering I need to layer my make up over my sunscreen. My only complaint is that it has an oily feel to it, but goes away once you rub it in. Great product and will be repurchasing! Great Product!
