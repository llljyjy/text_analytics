I am pleasantly surprised! I have been looking for some teeth-whitening products as I have developed a love for coffee. I have tried things like stripes but I noticed that they donâ€™t do a great job of being consistent. Who wants patchy white teeth?! They also take a long time to set up and complete. This product took out the hassle of setting up, waiting, and patchiness. I also had no discomfort, and there was not weird taste. My teeth look great! So happy I have this product! 10 out of 10 | 1000% Recommend
