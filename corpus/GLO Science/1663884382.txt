Doesn’t charge, won’t even turn on. Plugged the usb into the charger into my wall. Left in 9 hours. Nothing. Not even a light. Based on another recent review another user also has this issue. Looks like this is a product where product development funding went into marketing and packaging because it’s a cheap piece of crap. DO NOT BUY. Also- three 8 minute sessions for a week? Pfft. Whitening strips will likely do the same work. nan
