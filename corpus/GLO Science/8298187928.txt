Love this! Have very sensitive teeth, have never been able to use strips due to pain. I can tolerate this with sensitive teeth! I see major whitening results with regular use! The only thing is I find it makes my gums around the mouthpiece super red, which makes me worried. But I use infrequently, and it honestly has been so great. Highly recommend! The best for sensitive teeth!
