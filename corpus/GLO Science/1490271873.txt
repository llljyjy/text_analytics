I received a free sample of this product from PinchMe. It is a pretty big time commitment to use this device as recommended. However, I did notice some improvement to my teeth - nothing drastic, but a slightly whiter smile. I did like that it did not cause any tooth sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products. nan
