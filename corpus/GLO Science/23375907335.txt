Works Pretty Good, but a tad inconvenient. It would be great if you had to use it once a day instead of three times. It is better than doing through the dentist though. It didnâ€™t make my teeth sensitive at all though and it does make a pretty good difference. It would also be great if it was a little more affordable. Pretty Good.
