The GLO Brilliant White Smile Home Teeth Whitening Device does an ok job of lightening my teeth.  You have to use this 3 times a day, 8 minutes for each session.  Itâ€™s kind of a pain to have to do it 3 separate times, rather than all in one sitting.  the device also has a very slow charge and takes a long time. nan
