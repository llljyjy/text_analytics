I was unable to use the GLO Brilliant White Smile- At home Whitening Devise because I wear partial dentures so I had my adult son use it and he liked it. He said it was so easy to use that he was able to do gaming while doing the treatments. After the 5 days of treatments we both see he has a noticeably brighter smile.  I like that the kit is easy to store without taking up much space. Brighter Smile
