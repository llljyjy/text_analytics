So disappointed by this!! My main concerns were that it would cause discomfort and pain on my gums and/or that it wouldn’t work! It did not cause any discomfort but it simply didn’t make any change except wasting my time. I did this 24min a day (3 applications/8 min each) for nine days and I am just mad.I also talked to the customer service directly on their website prior to starting the treatment to make sure I do it right and they were rude and careless. Very bad experienceThe star is for the lip care cause that was the only good thing about this product So disappointed!!
