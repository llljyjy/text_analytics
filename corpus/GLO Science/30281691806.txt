Was looking forward to this product to whiten my teeth but was disappointed when it came. Didn’t like that I had to do 3, 8 minute treatments to do one complete treatment a day. Very annoying to have to go back to sink multiple times to spit, reapply gel and then whiten again. Also didn’t notice much difference in teeth whiteness at all after 5 days of treatment, as the package promised I would. Others may have better luck but I’m glad I didn’t pay for this Ok product but not worth money
