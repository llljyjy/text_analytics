I am so glad I tried the GLO BRILLIANT WHITE SMILE Home teeth whitening device set.  At first I thought I was not going to be able to sit there for 3 consecutive sessions of 8 minutes but once I started, and I did it while working so time just went by go quickly, I got used to the mouth piece.  It is very easy to use, press it once so it starts to warm up the mouth piece while you apply the lip balm and gel on your teeth.  When ready press button again to start your 8 minute session.  I did this for 5 days straight and cannot believe how much it whitened my teeth.  I did not experience and discomfort or pain and Iâ€™m very happy with my results.  I will continue with the monthly touch up like the product suggests and definitely recommend for anyone looking for a product that works at whitening your teeth. Love the results
