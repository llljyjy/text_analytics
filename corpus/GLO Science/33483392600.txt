I really liked the easy to  travel kit, it is very easy to use. The whitening product is minty and refreshing with no after taste. The light source for the teeth is good doesnâ€™t hurt at all and it is easy to apply. Just follow the instructions and this procedure is fairly straight forward. It can be a little messy so I recommend for you to have tissues a disposable cup or towel, or even be near the restroom in case it gets to messy. Overall I did see an improvement on my teeth and will definitely  continue using for more advanced results. Very refreshing teeth whitening device
