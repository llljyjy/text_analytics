I am an avid coffee and wine drinker, and my teeth definitely need a little assistance to erase those stains and keep my smile bright. The GLO to go pen has been a lifesaver! It’s small, discreet and I can throw it in my bag or purse for anytime use. After my morning coffee, I just excuse myself to the ladies’ room and swipe it on. The brush applicator is so convenient and easy to use, and I feel like I can cover each of my teeth quickly and easily.I love that it doesn’t bother my sensitive teeth and it actually works to erase the stains and keep them away. Bonus points for the formula being cruelty free and vegan! The flavor is quite cinnamon, but nothing too overpowering.If you’re looking for a brighter more high-wattage smile, you’ve gotta try this product! Highly recommend. A sparkling smile, just in time for the holidays!!
