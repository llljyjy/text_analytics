*I purchased this thru F+B website*This hydrosol changed my skin. I tried the 8 layer k skin method and WOW! My always-dehydrated skin that normally shows ever line, crease, and pore was instantly transformed. My face appears plump, smooth, and calm (no red!) I am usually a little red after I wash my face. All I needed after was to seal it in with some face oil. After 8 layers of spray, twice a day, I went through this bottle in two weeks. So maybe just a few spritzes a day to make it last all month! The one drawback: the blend of hydrosols in it give off a strong earthy aroma that I was not prepared for! It disappears quickly, but I was going for 8 layers each time.. whiff! Also the 50ml size is smaller than I expected. I took a picture of it next to a 100ml bottle. Promises to replace your moisturiser
