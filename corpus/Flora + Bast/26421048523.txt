I was so excited to try this - the reviews all looked amazing and the packaging is so cute! But unfortunately, the packaging ended up being the best part :( Did not experience any enhanced sensation or reduced discomfort, which was what I was really hoping for. It’s fine just as a lube, but not good enough for me to spend $77! I’m going to continue using it, maybe it’ll get better, but it’s nothing special right now. nan
