I have been buying this for over a year. I used to absolutely love it and really noticed a difference on my skin. I used a moisturizer over it and my skin felt great. I just recently purchased a new bottle that has a different look and pump and I noticed the color was darker.  It feels sticky on my skin and my hair sticks to my face now. I’ve never had that happen with the original formula. My skin doesn’t feel as soft as it used to either.  I am really bummed and won’t purchase again. Formula has changed!
