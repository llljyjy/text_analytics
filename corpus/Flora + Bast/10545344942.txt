I love using Lord Jones on my face and I thought this would be a cheaper alternative... it was not comparable. It was so oily and just kind of sat on top of my face. After a few days I started noticing red bumps and more texture to my skin. I might have just had a reaction to this product, who knows. I would not recommend this product, there are better CBD oils out there. nan
