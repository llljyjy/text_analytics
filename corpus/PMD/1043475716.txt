This works pretty well. Recommended if you want a starter device. It’s a step up from manual cleansing & exfoliation. But the shape of the head works best on broad flat surfaces (forehead/cheeks) and isn’t flexible around the nose; also, the silicone bristles are quite short and ultimately the sensory experience is sort of meh. Theoretically, the sonic vibrations do all the work so maybe how it “feels” is less important but it “feels” like I can’t clean around my nose effectively. Note that I’m comparing this device to the Clarisonic, which I’ve owned and used for over 10 yrs. It still.works great, but someday it’ll break so I thought I’d give this a shot. The PMD doesn’t feel especially nice and doesn’t leave me with the Clarisonic glow. I’ll keep it as a backup Good not Great
