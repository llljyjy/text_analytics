I wanted to wait before writing my review. I’ve been using the PMD Clean Pro Rose Quartz for 2 weeks and can say there has been a significant improvement to my skin. My skin is GLOWING and appears more youthful. If you are on the fence, it’s definitely worth the cost. There’s no need for replacement heads and I love that. The warming feature is so pampering, I use it when applying serums.  And the color and rose quartz. Sooo cute! Say yes to high tech skincare
