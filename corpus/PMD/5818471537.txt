Ye gods! This is not a toy. I was a little over-confident the first time I used it and started with one of the more abrasive discs (grey).  I did watch the video on their site (not actually very helpful), but should have watched a few other videos online.  I did not keep the device moving properly across my skin (it wants to get “stuck“ due to the intense suction) and ended up with significant red burns and abrasions on my cheeks and nose which are still there 2 days later.  Start with the gentlest disc! I’m giving it 3 stars because I think it’s probably actually a useful tool and am willing to try it again - this time with much greater caution and care. We’ll see how the second attempt goes in a couple of weeks. Start with the gentlest disc - trust me!
