As a 29 year old that was continuing to struggle with acne, this is a game changer when it comes to cleaning my face. It really helps get all of the dirt out when I wash my face and it feel more gentle (but deeper cleaning) than me washing my face with my hands. I highly recommend and it is well worth the money. It has 4 different modes, 2 for cleaning your face and 2 more ’massaging’ your serums and moisturizers in. It also has a heating side that is so nice and relaxing. Worth the money
