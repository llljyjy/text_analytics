PMD Beauty kindly gifted me their Personal Microderm Classic.  This is an at home microderm tool that gives results like a professional salon. It is very simple and easy to use at home. I use it two times a week and have been loving the results of it. It has an excellent suction. I have seen visible results after using this. My skin feels so much better, smoother and clean. Fines lines, wrinkles and pores look reduced. I am absolutely in love with this tool. Amazing Microderm tool!
