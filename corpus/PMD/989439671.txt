I have been loving this exfoliator from PMD beauty, I love how my skin feels after using it.  I also like that it contains sensitive discs since my skin is so sensitive and gets red easily.  It’s like you’re getting a spa experience but at home!  It saves me a trip to the spa when I feel like I must need a refresh.  Highly recommend it! nan
