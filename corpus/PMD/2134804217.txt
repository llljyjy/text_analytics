The PMD Clean Pro is definitely a game changer for me. This is my first time trying this kind of product and I can say now, that I see what all the hype was about! This really gives me a nice, deep clean unlike my other regular bristle brush which I feel just irritated my skin more than actually cleaned it. I really loved everything about this, I  like the soft silicon bristles,different modes, the heat option and the vibration just feels so good. When I’m done using this, my face feels so clean and refreshed, it’s basically glowing. The ActiveWarmth facial massager is the icing on the cake for me because it is just sooo relaxing and really helps gets those serums absorbed deep into the skin which I love because I’m guilty of using my hands and tugging a lot but this makes me want to do it the right way because it just feels so good. It’s also super easy to hold, waterproof, and rechargable ( a single charge lasts a long time too!) I am definitely a believer in the power of PMD! I understand the hype now
