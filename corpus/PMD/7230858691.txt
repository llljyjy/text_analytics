Anxiety when it comes to washing face at sink? If so, like me, high anxkety when washing face at sink, being too rough with my face cause i think i didn’t get all the soap off, wearing my hair up super tight, making a mess in the bathroom, water all over… we’ll say no more, or at least less of a mess with this lifesaver of a device!!! I’m legit so happy I bought this, and got it on sale!! This product is my lifesaver and probs one of the best things i ever bought. It helps me so much with my anxiety when washing my face at the sink, I used it tonight like not even an hour ago, used it with Origins Frothy Face Wash (Great combo!!!) and it works so well, lathers amazing with this device, it’s gentle, you can pick your speed (there’s 4 rhythms/speeds), i used 3 different speeds, and there’s also a backside to this device which is like a mirror kinda (i initially didn’t know what it was when i first used it and was rough with my face) but tonight 2nd time using this device at the sink was the best for me, i’ve used it 3 times so far, 2x sink, 1x shower, it’s waterproof. anyways, the backside of it warms up and is nice to put on the face and helps to see if you still have cleanser residue on your face, so that’s a bonus. Overall, I love this product and it helps me with my anxiety washing face at the sink, as i’m less rough, not rough with my face (cause i’m not using a cloth that i would rip my skin with :/). Love the color blue/teal, and the bristles on it are silicone so it’s not like a brush that hurts. I’m in love!! Hopefully from now on with using this device i’ll finally see improvement with my complexion and skin smoother. LIFESAVER!!! <3
