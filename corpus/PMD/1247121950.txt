The nubbly side is very basic (same as the foreos) so not much stands out about it but I do love how the rose quartz side heats up and massages in your serums and creams.  I also hold it over deep pimples to get the blood flowing to those areas to help heal.  It is definitely a nice gadget to add to my nightime routine if i have the time.   I only gave it 3 stars because I only think the quartz side is useful so took off a star and it is very top heavy so falls over a lot and I know one of these days the quartz is going to smash so took off another star.  I  got it on sale but donâ€™t think it is worth it at full price. Love the heated Rose Quartz side for night routine
