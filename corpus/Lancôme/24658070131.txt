The most amazing, rich, moisturizer I have ever put in my face. My skin gets so dry in the cooler months and that makes me look so much older. From the first day I used this cream, it hydrated like no other. My fine lines disappeared and my wrinkles are less from being so moisturized. My skin looks and feels younger. I rub the thick cream between my fingers to make it so easy to glide over my skin. It goes on smooth and my skin just soaks it up. You can feel it just deeply hydrating my skin. Lasts for 24hrs. I use it either morning or night. Over time my skin looks so much younger and healthier. Smells terrific! No harsh smells and it does not irritate my skin in any way. I will be using this forever. It is my go to cream now. Most amazing moisturizing cream
