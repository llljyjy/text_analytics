Absolutely love this moisturizer! It’s absolutely perfect for the winter months and it’s that good that my husband tried it once and automatically claimed it as his. Very mild yet pleasant scent. Super rich in texture and I wake up with my skin feeling super soft. Highly recommend if you live in cold climates. Amazing moisturizer!!!
