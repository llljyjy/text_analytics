This cream is such a pretty pink! It easily melts into my skin and feels very moisturizing. My skin is oily/combination so this version is a little heavy for me for daytime use, but it is perfect at nighttime and I love how soft it leaves my skin feeling the following morning. It is expensive but a little goes a long way and the jar is 2oz which is on the larger side. The jar itself is beautiful and itâ€™s great that you can buy refill pods for it. I did think that the box was a little flimsy and cheap considering the price, and it would have been nice if a spatula had been included to scoop the cream out of the jar. Apart from that it feels very luxurious and indulgent and is a great way to end the day!3 Pure luxury!
