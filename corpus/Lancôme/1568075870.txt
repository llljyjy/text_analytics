I received this product free for review purposes. I really love the consistency, formula and results of this product. The cream is thick but melts effortlessly into the skin. The formula creates such supple, hydrated skin that helps me wake refreshed and ready for the day. At over 40, finding a product that doesnâ€™t break me out or clog my pores is truly refreshing. The product does not have any strong fragrances and never made my skin  feel uncomfortable. I definitely recommend this for anyone with dry skin like mine Significant Hydration
