This is my first time using Lancome skincare, this stuff definitely lives up to the hype. I love everything about this night cream! I use this cream after washing my face, the texture is very creamy and moisturizing. My skin was instantly glowing and healthy looking upon application. I noticed after continued use that my skin was overall more healthy, firm and moisturized. I was super excited to see that this Lancome night cream contained hyaluronic acid and other skin loving ingredients. This cream didnâ€™t cause any skin irritation or breakouts for me. I would recommend this product and will definitely buy again INCREDIBLE
