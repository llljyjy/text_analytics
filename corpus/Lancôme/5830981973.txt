I love that this is a 3 in 1 serum and I don’t have to apply multiple serums like other brands I’ve used in the past! It’s convenient and allows for a quick daily morning and night skincare routine. I use it every morning and evening after washing my face and applying toner. I’ve been using this serum for 2 weeks now and have noticed my skin is much smoother and seems more hydrated. I love that My skin still feels smooth and hydrated when I wake up in the morning! I haven’t noticed a difference in fine lines but I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks, so I expect it to take more time to take effect.   I suffer from acne which means my skin is very prone to breakouts but I haven’t had any new breakouts or skin irritation from using this product. The scent isn’t overpowering and the bottle design is luxurious! I would recommend to family and friends that have extra money to invest in their skin. I will be buying a bottle once I run out, simply for the fact that it keeps my skin hydrated during the winter months! Smooth, hydrated skin
