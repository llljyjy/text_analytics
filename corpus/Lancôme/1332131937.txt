This serum is a powerhouse of wonderful ingredients- a combo of Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and Ferulic Acid, this serum targets a number of different skin concerns all at the same time. Each ingredient is kept in separate compartments until you use the product, which helps to increase the efficacy of each. I have been using this serum for several weeks now and see a noticeable glow to my skin. This product is really nourishing and hydrating, and I also notice that my pores seem smaller. I have yet to see a huge difference in hyperpigmentation but I will continue to use over the next few weeks, as Iâ€™m sure this process takes consistency. Thank you to Sephora and Influenster for sending me this product to try and provide my honest option! Powerful combination of ingredients!
