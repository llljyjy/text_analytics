The bottle is beautifully designed. I like that it delivers all three evenly. I’ve tried using this both during the day and at night and have found that I can’t use it during the day because it leaves my face sticky. I can deal with it at night since I’m sleeping so it doesn’t bother me. I’ve noticed after using it for a little over two weeks that my skin does look better but I can’t say much about the dark spots. Some days it looks like they’re fading age other days they look the same. nan
