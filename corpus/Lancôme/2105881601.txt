My wallet truly wishes I didn’t love this incredible cream, but alas. I do. This cream has a lovely, super delicate fragrance. The container is beyond luxurious. The texture is light and almost whipped, and absorbs so quickly. I’ve been using it nightly and can see such a difference in my skin’s moisture level. Late winter/early spring is a Bad Time for skin in the midwest...it’s still cold and dry, but this cream has kept my skin balanced and dewy. I have only used it for nighttime, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be used for day as well, layered under sunscreen. Worth Every Penny!
