I was previously using 3 different serums (Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Copper buffet) and I love that this has similar/ better benefits all in one! It is convenient and saves my counter space, but most importantly it works! I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and my skin looks and feels great. I have fairly oily skin sometimes and it hasn’t clogged my pores Convenient and works!
