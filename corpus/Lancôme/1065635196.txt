This is an incentivized post.  I received this product for free from Influenster and Lancôme.  I was so happy when I saw I was getting this box!  I couldn’t wait to get it and try it out. I’ve been using it for a little over 2 weeks, twice a day.  I do notice my skin is glowing and what I love is that it’s not greasy or oily.  The texture of my skin is more balanced and soft.  The only thing is that I don’t see much difference in the fine lines or pores.  Also the bottle is not the best. I have to keep it upside down to make sure all 3 of the serums come out together.  I would buy this for sure because I love that my face looks bright and glowing. good but not great
