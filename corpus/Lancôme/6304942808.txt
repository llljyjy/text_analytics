I received this product As a free sample. Unfortunately I was only able to use it for 3 days before I began having a reaction to it. I have very sensitive skin and this product, while it seems wonderful, smells good and feels silky, irritated my skin. This is not a slight on the product. Iâ€™ve purchased many that seem great and are eventually rejected by my skin. nan
