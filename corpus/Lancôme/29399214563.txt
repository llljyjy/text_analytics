I used this cream for my mom. I couldn’t use it because I have extremely sensitive skin and as soon as I opened it I smell the fragrance so I know I wasn’t for me. Although I gave it to my mom, and it keeps her skin looking great! The texture is light and absorbs nicely and you’ll have your sling looking great next day. Light night cream
