Because there are 3 cores containing 3 active ingredients, when I pump the serum into my hand, I see 3 separate colors from transparent, opaque white to pure white.  However, when applied to the skin, it will all blend together, leaving a transparent film with a scent similar to that of herbs.  The serum is thin and light, it takes about 30 seconds to absorb most of it, so I can continue my skincare steps immediately without waiting.My skin is not yet experiencing wrinkles, so I have not tested the wrinkle reduction effect (even though I have used it for 2 weeks) but I still feel the smoothness and admit that the skin is noticeably healthier.  , the condition of flaking in the dry season disappeared completely.  Usually with serums, I will have to test it longer to see the effect, but with this one itâ€™s different, the effect comes quickly so I can only say I love it! nan
