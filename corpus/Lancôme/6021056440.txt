I absolutely loved this product! The serum did not feel thick and really absorbs in your skin. Smells absolutely amazing. It’s in a light plastic container which worries me because it feels like if it falls, it could easily break but aside from that it’s fine. The bottle is easy to use & disperses the 3 combos well at the same time. After two weeks, I feel like My skin is really glowing & looks rejuvenated. Would purchase again. Smells good. Feels good!
