Let me start by saying I was given this product free for review,  but my opinions are entirely my own. This is a beautiful moisturizer. It leaves a glow unlike anything I’ve ever used. I use tatcha silk cream as my regular moisturizer, and I didn’t think ever like anything better than that. Much to my dismay, I like this better.  It isn’t greasy, or filmy, yet it leaves the skin with a noticable luminously, Which is visible even under make up.  Foundation sits nicely on top of it and doesn’t move around. The thing that surprised me most is that it didn’t cause my acne prone skin to break out.Bottom line I only gave this product 4 starts because of the price. I do think it to be a bit excessive. That said, I would purchase the smaller size, as a little goes a long way. Beautiful moisturizer!
