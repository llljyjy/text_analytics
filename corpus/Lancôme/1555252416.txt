I have tried so many eye creams and this is the only one that actually made a difference.  I have slight dark circles that’s not overly prominent (only noticeable to me lol) but since using this I have noticed it has brightened my under eyes area.  I can’t believe I have finally found this (and I have used the highly rated $315 brand too which did nothing for me).  Seriously ladies (and gents), try this!! I found the one!
