I use this in evenings and mornings. I really like it and I feel like I can see a difference in my skin after a few weeks. My skin absorbs it well and feels moisturized. It’s not sticky or think, the serum is perfect. Iv noticed my fine lines look faded. They definitely aren’t as noticeable. This my new go to product for my skin! Full disclosure, I did receive this product for free from influenster but I 100% love it and believe it works. Well worth the extra bucks!!!
