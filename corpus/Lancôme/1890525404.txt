This cream is thick, yet silky & luxurious on the skin and has a light rosy scent! Iâ€™ve been using it in the evening as part of my night routine for almost 2 weeks straight and have noticed a difference in my skin being more smooth, supple & bright. My only downside is the price which brings me to 4 stars. However,  the upside is that it is a huge jar, so although expensive, it will last you forever. Expensive , but very luxurious on the skin
