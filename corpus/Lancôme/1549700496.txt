Over the course of the three - four weeks of using this, my face has felt hydrated and plumper, which helped smooth out some of the fine lines around my mouth. I also have a few dark spots near my hairline near my ear that Iâ€™m trying to lighten and they are slightly getting lighter. I hope that with continued use those spots can get even lighter.
