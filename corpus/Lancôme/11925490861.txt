Lancôme has launched a revolutionary product housing 3 chambers of skincare products in one bottle. The pump has three holes to siphon the 3 products at one. The first serum is Hyaluronic Acid, the second serum contains a combination of a highly potent, but stable form of Vitamin C and Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), and the third serum is a Ferulic Acid. The fragrance is little and not offensive. It took a minute to get all the serums to pump at first use but leave the bottle upside down for a. day and they’ll come out together. I’ve been using this now, twice a day, for a few weeks and it’s made my skincare routine a breeze. The formulas are gentle on my sensitive skin and absorb quickly. I have seen a noticeable difference in my skins hydration and dark spots. The price is steep but worth it for those looking to condense their skincare routine and save space. 3-in-1 Skincare simplified
