After a few weeks of using this product twice a day, my skin has never been better. It goes perfectly with my Rx Tretinoin. It is easy to dispense, and I like that all 3 serums are kept sealed and separate. The only things that bother me are how greasy the serums are, and the scent. The bottle feels like cheap plastic. But even with these dislikes, the product is so good, I can over look them. Works
