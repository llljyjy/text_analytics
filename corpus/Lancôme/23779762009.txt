First off, I must say this is one of my favorite products in my skincare regime. Its extremely lightweight and feels so great on my skin! It does not leave a greasy residue and I have no problem with wearing this under my makeup. Some creams are so think, its builds up and clogs pores. Im very happy with this Absolue soft cream revitalizing & brightening moisturizer. I highly recommend it! Amazing skincare cream!
