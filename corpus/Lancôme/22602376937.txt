I’ve been using Lacome Advance Genifique Reparing Night Cream for about 2 weeks.  Since the first night I noticed my face softer, cleanner and radiant.  I noticed that in the mornings my face doesn’t look oily neither greasy.  The cream is so light when applying to the skin. A truely reparing cream!
