Iâ€™m so surprised and excited when I receive it. The cream is soft and smooth, quickly absorbed, does not feel sticky or heavy on the face. Suitable for many different skin types, including oily, sensitive or combination skin. I think it works well. Skin is brighter, healthier and more radiant than before, signs of aging, wrinkles have reduced but reduced a little, probably because I have only used it for 2 weeks. Must have!
