Since my early 20s I’ve had a skincare routine which mainly consisted of cleanser and moisturizer. Over time as I aged, my routine and budget have become more focused on different goals. Right now as I’m turning 50 this year, my skincare goal is anti-aging. I have tried many many products from drugstore brands to specialty brands to higher end department store brands. My go to brands have been Clinique and Kiehls combined with different serums and other anti-aging products from other brands. Every couple of months I will venture out and try different products to break up my routine. This Absolue moisturizer from Lancôme is just…WOW! It is so rich and creamy that when you apply it on your skin it glides so easily. It’s literally like spreading butter and my skin just absorbs it all in. It really feels luxurious and has a very light rose scent that you hardly notice but adds to the experience. I have been using it every day for 3 weeks as my nighttime moisturizer after all the serums and my skin has never felt more hydrated or plump when I wake up in the morning. My fine lines and wrinkles are less visible and my skin feels so well nourished.  I have never gotten this feeling from the other anti-aging moisturizers I have tried from other brands. It is worth the price for the larger 2 oz size (most other brands are 1.7 oz) and a little goes a long way. I tend to slather on the other brands because I feel I need more product to get the right amount of moisture into my skin. But with the Absolue Creme Riche  Moisturizer, just a small amount achieves even greater result. Pot of Gold
