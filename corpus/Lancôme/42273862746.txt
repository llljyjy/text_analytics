This is a very nice overnight cream! I love that it doesn’t feel “heavy” on my face, yet keeps my skin extremely moisturized. The combination of prebiotics and ceramides help to repair my skin barrier while I am sleeping so I wake up to refreshed, soft and healthy skin. I have oily skin and this did not cause me to breakout at all. I actually felt that it helped reduce any current pimples I did have since I have been using it. Great overnight cream for oily skin!
