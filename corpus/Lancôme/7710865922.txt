This eye cream has got to be the most amazing eye cream that I have ever used. It is exceptionally creamy. It doesn’t suprise me that it has Grand Rose Extracts in it, its as velvety as a delicate rose petal. It leave your skin feeling hydrated and healthy looking. It honestly didn’t take long for this eye cream to do exactly as it claims it will do which is to reduce puffiness under the eyes, help the look of tired, fatigued eyes as well as reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I have found that this eye cream is very moisturizerizing and it doesn’t leave my under eyes and around my eyes feeling sticky, greasy or heavy feeling. It soaks in completely. My eyes are looking brighter and firmer. I will definitely continue to use this and I highly recommend it! You won’t be disappointed. It does exactly what it says it will do!
