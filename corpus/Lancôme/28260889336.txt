I used Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream for about 3 weeks before writing this review.A few things to note:*I am dark skinned*I am African*I have sensitive skin*I have oily skinSo if you fall in those categories maybe this review will work for you.After using this for weeks, I didn’t see that much of a difference on my face. Or at least, not a difference that I would applaud. I had a few pimples that I didn’t have before. My skin did not get better and not necessarily worse because the pimples weren’t huge enough to be visible but I could feel the bumps when I applied it or washed my face.Additionally, I did have one pimple below my eye but I’m not sure if that was from the cream, but just in case it was, it might be information a person needs to know before purchasing this product.Prior to my use of Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream, my face was clear, no acne, no wrinkles no scars and I feel like it’s still fairly the same aside from the aforementioned tiny pimples (bumps) on my jaw line and above my brows.Maybe if you had problems on your face like wrinkles this would work, but I wouldn’t recommend it for someone with no issues. Did nothing for me
