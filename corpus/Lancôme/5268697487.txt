My skin looks is getting healthier and more hydrated. My skin barrier was compromised due to over exfoliating and this cream has helped my skin with moisture without my skin feeling oily. It penetrates and doesn’t just sit on top. Although a bit pricey it’s definitely a good investment for your skin. My skin loves it!
