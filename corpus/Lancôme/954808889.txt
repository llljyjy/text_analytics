I received this product as a sample and have used it day and night for over 2 weeks. I think I have tried almost every eye cream on the market from Chanel to Kiehls to drugstore brands. This product is extremely hydrating and definitely made a difference with crepiness and dryness. I cant say it will reduce your wrinkles, however, due to the hydration factor my lines were greatly diminished.  As far as dark circles I did not notice a difference. Another bonus was my under eye concealer went on smoother and by the end of the day my under eyes still looked very good. Overall I would recommend this product. Extremely Hydrating!!!
