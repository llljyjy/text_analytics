My five stars may seem odd, but hear me out! This product didn’t work for me - too greasy on my skin, no matter how little I applied. That said, it was perfect for my Mom’s skin - she absolutely loves it! Who doesn’t love Lancôme? The packaging is beautiful,  no need to put this one in your medicine cabinet - leave it out! The fragrance emitted from the rose - it’s all perfect - for my Mom’s skin! Amazing for mature skin!
