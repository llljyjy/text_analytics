I received this product free and am just providing my honest feedback.I have used this repairing night cream for the past couple weeks every night.I have a skincare regimen and always cleanse & moisturize before I lay down for bed. I have dry, sensitive skin. This cream had a nice, smooth, thick texture that absorbs nicely and quickly into the skin. It had a hint of pleasant fragrance, without causing irritation or being overpowering. I can see that my ever so small fine lines and wrinkles have dissipated some and I wake up looking more refreshed after use. awesome night time cream!
