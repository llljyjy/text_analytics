I grew up with my grandmother using Lancome, so I was excited to try this. First of all, the packaging is beautiful and at 42 I’m always looking for a good facial moisturizer. I really like it, it’s moisturizing and smells great. My mother even tried it and asked me to send her a picture of the container so she could buy her own. nan
