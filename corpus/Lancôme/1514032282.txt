Amazing moisturizer! I received this as a free sample. The scent and texture of this is so great. It is such a unique product. I have dry skin and this really nourishes my skin and leaves me glowing. I recommend to anyone looking to use a bit of hydration or to use during the winter months. A little goes a long way! As much as i love this product, it is a bit expensive. If you want to splurge on this product you should! :) nan
