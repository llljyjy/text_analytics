I was given the chance to sample this product and I’ve now used it for enough time to truly weigh in, although I was immediately very happy with it.  I typically use a different brand which is a more-expensive ’rich’ moisturizer and am thrilled with that product, but it’s quite pricey so finding one - still from a great/trusted brand - that feels as luxe as this does - this is fantastic!Upon first trying it, I noticed things like the wonderful feel of the product between my finger and how comforting it felt on my face plus that I looked truly moisturized when I woke up the next day (I used this as my night cream).  But now that I’ve had more time to try it, in addition to those first impressions, I’m noticing how healthy my skin looks, how soft my face feels, that I don’t notice dryness or drabness when I’m seeing myself on the all-day work Zoom calls. While I already liked Lancome, I didn’t think of it in terms of such a luxe-feeling/luxe-results-providing product.  I would definitely buy this product and recommend it to family and friends! Lancome's 'luxe' cream - you have a new fan!
