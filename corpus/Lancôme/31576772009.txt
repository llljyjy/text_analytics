I’ve been using this as part of my daily regimen for 1 month. And I love this decadent serum. It required a few pumps to get all 3 liquids to come out simultaneously. But once they did, they blended into my skin like a dream. I’ve been using this day and night and have noticed my skin looks so much more luminous and plump. At night I use it as my final step and in the morning I apply it under my sunscreen. Adding this to my routine has made my skin look better than ever, so much so, that I have actually started not wearing foundation. I feel like my skin looks radiant and even in tone, so why cover it up? I definitely plan on buying another bottle when I run out. A new staple in my routine
