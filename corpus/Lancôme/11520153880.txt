This is hands down the most indulgent, effective and quickly working eye cream I have ever used.! And believe me, I’ve tried a lot of eye products and nothing even comes close to the results I’m getting with Lancôme’s ABSOLUE Revitalizing Eye Cream! The texture is just heavenly. It’s thick, creamy and almost gel-like but surprisingly lightweight and breathable too. I apply it to the delicate skin underneath and around my eyes and this cream instantly moisturizes, smoothes and completely rejuvenates that creepy skin around my eye area. Most thicker eye creams like this just tend to settle into my fine lines and crows feet - really doing nothing at all. But this eye cream absorbs completely and quickly and goes right to work making the skin around my eyes appear brighter, firmer and more youthful looking than ever before. I swear in just as little as a few hours, I was blown away by how toned and firmed the delicate skin around my eyes had become. And in just one week, my fine lines and crows feet had become practically invisible, the delicate skin around my eyes was noticeably tighter and I started to look like I was having the best sleep ever because my eyes looked so refreshed and well rested. This cream also does an excellent job at drastically reducing eye puffiness and those unsightly under-eye bags we all hate seeing. With every application, I fall in love with this eye cream more and more. The gold packaging is so beautiful and this cream has a very, very light and delicate scent (fresh and floral) that I adore. A little bit of this eye cream goes a long way too, so one container will really last me for awhile. I honestly can’t imagine ever purchasing another eye cream again after having the absolute pleasure of trying ABSOLUE! Highly impressive! Highly recommended!! Impressive results!!
