I just recently turned 40 and it’s usually the age when you start to notice every new freckle and line. Enter Lancôme Triple Serum! I am beyond impressed with this product. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and my skin tone is even, skin looks fresh and radiant and I see some fine lines going away. Worth the price tag, a little bit goes a long way and one pump is more than enough even though the instructions say two. It absorbs fast, and it doesn’t leave skin feeling dry, and so far has worked great with two different moisturizers. It also doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Magic in a bottle. magic in a bottle
