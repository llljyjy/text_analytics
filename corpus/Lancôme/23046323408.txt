The packaging on this is unique and has a quality feel to it. The pump is very easy to use and I like that the 3 serums are separated until you pump them out, so you get a “fresh“ mix. The consistency is nice and light, it works into the skin easily and leaves it feeling soft and smooth afterwards. After using it for several weeks, I do notice an improvement in texture and “glow“ of my skin. The only downside for me was that it does have a little fragrance in it, which I try to avoid in my skincare. But the fragrance was light enough that I was still able to use it. Overall a very nice serum! nan
