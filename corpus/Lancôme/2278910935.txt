I bought the tiny size of this (because it is $$) to see if it worked for me. At first I was mostly “meh” but that was because use was inconsistent. I like to try different skin care products and jump around between samples and such. BUT when I started using this in the morning and evening consistently, I definitely started noticing a change. My skin is super soft. The skin around my eyes has tightened up quiet a bit. Pores (which are a major concern for me) are looking smaller. I realize you can’t permanently shrink pores but this stuff is making them look better. I also struggle with red, uneven skin tone and this seems to be helping that too. I ended up purchasing the two pack of this serum while it was on sale. I expect it to last me at least a year. The smallest bottle lasted me about two months when I started using it consistently day and night. A little of this is all you need to see results. I’m a fan! Use it consistently and it WILL work
