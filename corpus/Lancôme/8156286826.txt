The texture is lovely! It’s not oily, and it absorbs to the skin so nicely. It left my skin feeling moisturized even when I woke up the next morning. It has a luxurious gel-like feel with a flowery fragrance. It’s pricey, but it has performed much better than my other daily moisturizers. I would recommend trying it if you are able to. Lovely texture!
