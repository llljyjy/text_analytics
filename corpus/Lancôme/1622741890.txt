I got this free through influenster. This serum has 3 canisters that come out together when you pump it. I assume they keep it separate for the vitamin c to not oxidize. I’ve used it for 3 weeks now. I think the hyaluronic acid is definitely working as my skin is pretty hydrated. I haven’t seen any dark spots lighten albeit vitamin C and ferulic acid can take time to work (usually over a month). I have dry skin and this serum did not break me out. I liked the smell a lot (very luxury scent). Tip - keep the bottle upside down so that all three canisters dispense evenly. When right side up, sometimes one of them would not dispense. nan
