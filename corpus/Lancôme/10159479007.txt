I used this product for a month and I am pleasantly surprised! My skin is very sensitive so I started by using it three times a week because my skin typically reacts when I introduce a new product to my skin but I think since I introduced it this way it didn’t happen and I worked up to using it every night and I love the results! My skin is smoother and plumped and smaller pores and dark spots! And I love that is has hyaluronic acid in it already because I was using a separate serum so I’m also happy I can skip a step in my skincare routine. My skin definitely looks healthier,  I highly recommend this product ! A new must have in my skincare routine!
