I received this product for free in return for my honest review. I am so incredibly impressed by this product. I’ll start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin with my lupus and it’s so hard to find new products without breaking out in rashes. This product has completely cleared my skin up in 4 weeks of continued use, I will definitely be buying it again and again.  My fiancé has used it as well and loves it too, he works with auto paint all day and his pores get clogged but this has cleared him up as well. The only negative thing I could possibly say is I hated having to waste so much product in the beginning trying to get all 3 of the serums to start coming out. But after flipping it upside down it worked wonders. My new favorite night time ritual
