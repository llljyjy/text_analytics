I started using this product as a base layer. In a span of 2 weeks, I noticed considerable reduction in some textured areas of my forehead and my foundation was no longer clinging to the super dry areas around my mouth. The trio of serums work effectively together and would be great option for someone with normal or oily skin. Itâ€™s a bit light for my dry skin. I had to layer with lots of moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated through the day. That and the price is why I took one star off. The trio is a mixture of white, milky and clear serums and they absorb pretty well in my skin. Great for oily/normal. Not so much for dry skin.
