I absolutely adore every single thing about this cream! The texture feels so luxurious upon application; it is both rich and creamy and also light and soft. This beautifully textured cream is extremely hydrating and moisturizing and feels amazing on my skin. This cream melts into my skin, leaving it feeling so extraordinarily well nourished. It leaves my skin feeling so satiny smooth and so unbelievably soft and supple throughout the day/night. It is truly amazing how long the hydration lasts! Although most skincare products take time to see results, I noticed an immediate change in my skin after just one use. My skin definitely looks and feels healthier and the benefits keep increasing with each use (I’ve been using the cream for two weeks now). My fine lines have definitely lessened in appearance and my skin appears smoother and with a newfound luminosity. An absolutely amazing cream! I can’t say enough good things about it! Love. Love. Love. Additionally, the light scent is lovely and the jar is gorgeous. (I also really appreciate that you can purchase a refillable capsule, making the product more eco-friendly). Phenomenal Cream!
