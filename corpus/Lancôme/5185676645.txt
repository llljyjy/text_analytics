Very much enjoyed the product and loved the ingredients (hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C, and ferulic acid). Usually apply all of these separately and love having a product with 4 in 1. Formula is a little thick/greasy would recommend as a nighttime serum or for someone with super dry skin. Saw a big improvement in texture and evening in skin tone in just 2 weeks. Good product, great ingredients!
