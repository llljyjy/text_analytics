I received the Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum for free from Influenster and Lancôme in exchange for my honest review.I have been interested in incorporating ferulic acid into my skincare routine for some time now. I was excited to receive this Lancôme serum including ferulic acid with vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. The product comes in a plastic three chambered bottle, I did have to tap it upside down to get all three products to dispense at once. I tried the serum for a couple weeks, incorporating it in my routine in different ways to see how I liked it. I found I prefer using it in my nighttime skincare routine as I find it can be a little greasy looking if I use it in the morning. I like the texture of the serum and it leaves my skin feeling plump after use. I haven’t seen any specific improvements in my skin while using the serum but I believe it usually takes longer than a couple weeks for products to truly show a visible difference in the skin. A little goes a long way. I think it’s a nice product featuring good ingredients, however, it is quite pricey. There are different products on the market utilizing ferulic acid and I think this is a nice choice. It does have multiple actives that may be too much for sensitive skin types. I would consider repurchasing this product in the future but would wait for it to be on sale to save a few bucks. A nice serum featuring good active ingredients!
