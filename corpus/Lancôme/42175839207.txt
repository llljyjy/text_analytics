highly recommend this product! I’m in my early 30s and I’m noticing fine lines and changes to the tone/oil. I’ve been using the lancome hydrazen gel in my 20s and I’m starting to notice that it doesn’t have exactly the same effects anymore. it’s a thinner product in comparison to the night cream. the cream really locks in moisture and has a very nice pleasant smell. it’s heavy so that my skin breaks out but I do wake up feeling like my skin is hydrated. nan
