For me this works best as a primer. It’s not moisturizing enough on its own but it works well over my moisturizer and it provides a layer of SPF under my makeup.  As a sunscreen, it stings when it gets near my eyes so that doesn’t work for me when I run. It’s also pretty pricey for a sunscreen alone. Although this doesn’t have that heavy sunscreen scent, it is fragranced like most other Lancôme products and it causes breakouts if I use it too many days in a row.  It also contains an oxybenzone. All in all, there are better sunscreens out there. But it works well as an occasional multipurpose primer/spf under makeup. Good under makeup
