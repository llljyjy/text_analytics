This is my new favorite eye cream! In two weeks Iâ€™ve seen marked improvement in fine lines and puffiness around my eyes. Goes on luxuriously smooth, smells wonderful (but not overpowering!), and immediately I feel a cooling/soothing effect. Not at all sticky or tacky. I will definitely be buying more when this runs out--my new go-to! Wonderful!
