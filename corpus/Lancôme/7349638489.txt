I really enjoy using this product as the last step in my skincare routine. This cream is thick and has a luxurious texture. It immediately gives you a glowy complexion, and maintains the moisture throughout the day. I will say I have noticed a bit of dryness around my nose, eyes and mouth, and can attribute this to the actives in this product. Layering this with an additional moisturizer may be best for dryer skin types. nan
