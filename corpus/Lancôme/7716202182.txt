I enjoy trying new serumâ€™s and this one did not disappoint. If anything it exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a serum that makes a noticeable difference! It gives my skin a little bit of extra oil, but in a very healthy and moisturized looking way. The scent is very nice, And the bottle appears to contain quite a bit of product. I have really enjoyed using it and I will continue to do so! I am fair skinned with blonde hair and tend to have sensitive skin and my skin was not bothered at all using this product. Love it!
