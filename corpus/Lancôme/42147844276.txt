I received this skin care item for free to test & give my review. Honestly, I really wanted to like it but I was fairly disappointed. I applied this serum to my face morning and night for 2 weeks. It is 3 Serums in 1. The consistency felt nice on my face and did seem to make my face a little brighter and lighten my acne marks however, it made my cystic acne worse. So unfortunately I am unable to continue using this Serum. I recommend others try it because just because it did not work for me doesn’t mean it won’t work for everyone. My skin is just sensitive. nan
