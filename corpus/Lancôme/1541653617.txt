I added this to my routine since I already use and love the Lancôme Génifique serum. This product just feels so luxurious. I am a mama of 2 young kids so feel the sleep deprivation keenly and it’s so apparent in my eyes and in my skin. This definitely helps to brighten and de-puff my eye area, the wand applicator is wonderfully cooling. And my lashes!!! I noticed even after a few consistent uses, my lashes look thicker and fuller, it’s a subtle but great and very welcome surprise. I had a lot of my lashes fall out when I was wearing mascara everyday and this helped to get them back on track. A must-have in my daily nighttime routine and worth the splurge ! Am on my third bottle !
