I really liked this product it was a thicker cream but it absorbed very nicely. I got this as a free sample but I would recommend this to my friends. It really helped with my oily skin for the T-Zone area. In the morning my skin felt softer and smoother. In the photo Iâ€™m only wearing lip gloss. Repair cream
