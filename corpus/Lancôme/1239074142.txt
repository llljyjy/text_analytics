I really, really love this product. I have been using it consistently for a month and have noticed good improvement in my skin texture/smoothness and also overall evening of my skintone. I have some dark spots I’m trying to fade on my face (I’m 40) and this product is absolutely helping. Because this has 3 serums in one, it was easy to integrate into my routine and was simple to use. The packaging feels very high-end and evenly and easily pumps all three serums out. Really love this product!
