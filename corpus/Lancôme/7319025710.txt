I was surprised but I guess I shouldn’t with Lancôme because they delivered its very lightweight it melted on my skin didn’t feel like anything was on my face. I feel like it is helping my face a lot, if you constantly use it you will def see a difference. Get it don’t think about it unless your allergic to the ingredients then don’t get it. Love it
