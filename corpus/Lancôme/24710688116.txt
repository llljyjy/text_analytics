For me Lancôme is name of trust. Every product I use it’s always a worth for me and same with this one. This serum is little thick then other serums but it absorb quickly and doesn’t feel greasy . It smells very nice. When I woke up I feel my skin more fresh, clear and beautiful. I feel my skin feel younger. My dark circles start to fade and skin look even.It’s little pricey when I first think but after using for long I feel it’s worth it. Lancome serum
