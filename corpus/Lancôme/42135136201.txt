I enjoyed this serum, and I love that it contains hyaluronic acid. Lanc√¥me Renergie serum comes out in 3 separate liquids that you can mix before applying. I typically put 1-2 pumps on the back of my hand, mixed, then applied. It is pretty  light and feels like a mix between serum and light lotion. It also has a very light scent. The one thing I did not love about it is the grippy/lightly sticky feel after it is applied, which sticks around for a while. Great Serum
