Love this serum! A little goes a long way and spreads easily and evenly on the skin.  It has a faint scent that fades very quickly and I love how quickly the product absorbs into my skin.  I struggle with other serums leaving me greasy as the day goes on but I haven’t had any grease slicks at the end of the day since I started using this serum.  I’ve been using it twice a day for 2+ weeks and I can’t say I’ve noticed any fading of some pigmented areas I have but I do feel like my fine lines have decreased and that my skin tone seems more even.  Overall the product is pricey but worth the money!! Fabulous!!
