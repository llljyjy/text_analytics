Lancome Renergie H.C.F Triple SerumI received this item as a gift in exchange for an honest review. I used this product for more than 2wks prior to writing this review. I have a combination skin with acne scars and large pores. I’m also starting to have some wrinkles. My skin absolutely feels moisturized and hydrated throughout the day. It has no strong scent, applied smoothly, and gets absorbed on the skin quickly and doesn’t feel sticky. it seems to have lighten some of my dark spots and lines. My pores appeared smaller. I love that it’s an all in one treatment. It’s kinda expensive but its worth the price. I would definitely recommend it. I’m going To get another bottle after I finish this one.
