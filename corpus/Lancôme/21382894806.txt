If you are looking for your new go to moisturizer, no need to look any further as this Lancome Absolute Rich Cream Moisturizer is it. It leaves my face feeling absolutely fabulous and so silky smooth and moisturized all day and night long. It is a thick, rich, and firm cream and trust me a little bit goes a long way. I also absolutely love the subtle light natural rose smell to it too. I would recommend this to my friends and family and honestly anyone looking for a great moisturiser. Simply amazing
