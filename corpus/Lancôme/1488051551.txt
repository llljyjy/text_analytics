This product is so luxurious, you feel fancy just by using it…from the design of the gold packaging, to the thick, moisturizing and lightly scented cream. It’s still relatively early, but after using this product consistently for almost two weeks (day and evening), I do see a difference in the appearance of my dark circles. It is a bit pricey (ok…it’s VERY pricey), but a little bit does go a long way, and once you crunch the numbers…with moderate use it averages out to about 40-50$/month (which is what most high end eye creams cost regularly). I will definitely try it out again once I run out. So far, I see improvements…
