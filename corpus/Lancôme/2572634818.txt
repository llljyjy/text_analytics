you have to decide if you want a clarifying toner or a hydrating toner. This is a hydrating toner and I love it! it does not dry your face out like I find clarifying toners do. I tried so many toners from different brands before I found this one and they all dryed my face out then I discovered the difference between the 2 types of toner, a true ah-ha moment. I use my makeup remover, then my face wash, and then this with a cotton round, then my serum, eye cream, moisturizer and so on and so forth. LOVE
