I had the opportunity to try the Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream for free thanks to BzzAgent and I am so grateful I did. This night  cream is so moisturizing and luscious for my dry skin as the weather starts to cool down where I live. I also love that this product contains hyaluronic acid. The final bonus is this product is anti-aging. Would definitely recommend. nan
