This product is a new favorite! I love the way it makes my skin feel. It also gives a nice glow when used under make up. It’s interesting because you can almost feel it working. It’s gentle yet exfoliating at the same time.  It feels like I am getting new skin with continued use. I am also noticing that my blemishes are starting to fade. I noticed an extra pimple or 2 at first use which made me hesitant but that went away. The bottle is has a nice design and I love the pump feature — especially how the ingredients only mix when you pump it. I also love the way it smells. A must have!
