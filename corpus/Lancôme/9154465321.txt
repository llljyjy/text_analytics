I received this product as a free sample, and I am hooked. It is exactly what my face needs to feel rejuvenated during the dry, long and cold Minnesota winters. Ive been using it for almost two weeks and I have noticed a difference in a couple of age spots that were showing up on my face, as well as helping with skin elasticity. It is expensive, but worth it if my skin continues looking this good. nan
