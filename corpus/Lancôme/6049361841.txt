this mask is incredible, became one of my all time favorites after one use..your skin looks great after you remove the mask...but the next day after the mask is when you REALLY see results. My skin looks sublime afterwards. I also love that this mask doesn’t leave residue, so you can use even before makeup application. Some masks leave residue and is best used at night before bedtime. Also, since it’s a gel mask, it’s more flexible than paper based masks and I could eat and drink while wearing it..its very cool and comfortable on the face. I have sensitive fair skin, I have never had any issues with this mask whatsoever. I’m here buying more of these now, I’m here to say this absolutely worth the price. Incredible
