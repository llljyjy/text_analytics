Okay for starters - the packaging is beautiful. Also, I was so excited to see four hero ingredients that I love and regularity use (hyaluronic acid, vit c, niacinamide, ferulic acid) in a serum. Even better is that they are all formulated to work together, which isn’t always the case when you layer them individually. Especially if they are from different brands. I’ve been using this product AM/PM for almost three weeks and I feel like my skin looks brighter and my pores look smaller. Can’t attest to the anti-aging component since I don’t have wrinkles yet. Although I’m LOVING having a streamlined skin care routine with this product. I don’t know if I’d be able to pony up $130+ on ANY serum at this time so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase. Smaller pores and bigger glow!
