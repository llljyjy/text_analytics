I received this product free from influenster for testing. I was super excited to receive it- hyaluronic acid and niacinamide are already beloved in my skincare routine. This serum is good. It’s a little heavy, so I only use it at night for my combination skin. Because I already have a history of using some of these ingredients in my routine, I didn’t see a huge change in my skin, but it remained in a good place and I’m happy with that! In order to get it to pump all 3 serums effectively, I do have to store it upside down. So that aspect could use some work... nan
