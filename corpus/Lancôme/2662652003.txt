The radiance in my skin is incredible. I truly saw results after the second day I felt like my skin was a lot brighter , I thought maybe it was just in my head as I know I’m using this new product but then my husband even pointed out how good my skin was looking and described it as a glow. Safe to say I’ve loved the results my face doesn’t look dull it’s even out my tone and pores on my nose are soooooo much better. I will say that my face feels a little tacky for like 10 mins after use but I  just let it set in and apply my moisturizer and that tackiness disappears so it’s not a problem . The bottle is not my favorite -.- I appreciate the uniqueness of having the three parts combine freshly with each application. , however the bottle neeeda improvement I had to leave the bottle upside down to make sure I didn’t have any issue when I went to use it which isn’t a big deal but in that case maybe they should just design the bottle with that in mind. Other than the bottle issues this product is amazing!!!! So if I could I’d only take half a star away but since I can’t split the star 4 starts will just have to do because the packaging issue is something that really should be noted as to not have someone unnecessarily waste Product trying to get it to pump out properly Hello glow! Radiance and even tone
