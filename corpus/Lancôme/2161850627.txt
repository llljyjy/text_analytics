I enjoyed this cream and continue to use it. After a month of use, I notice from my before & after pics that my forehead lines are less deep. This cream is surprisingly moisturizing and I noticed that after a while, I didnâ€™t need another moisturizer on top or 2 whole pumps of cream, as suggested. I was surprised when I first used it. The combination of the ingredients from each separate tube being mixed together upon pumpking, created a warmth and at first I thought my face was burning and irritated. But it turned out that was just the chemical reaction and my face was fine. Around the first week or so, around my nose did feel a little dry and just slightly irritated but my face got used to it and my skin actually really enjoys it now. I am thrilled that my forehead lines are reduced. An innovative cream that shows results
