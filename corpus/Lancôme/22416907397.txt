I absolutely love how rich and creamy this moisturizer feels to the touch. It’s like no other cream I’ve had before. It leaves no oily residue and soaks right into the skin making it feel hydrated and youthful. The only thing I don’t like about it is the strong rose smell. Thankfully that smell doesn’t seem to stick around after application. I would definitely keep buying this product for the way it makes my skin look and feel. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family! So Rich and Creamy!
