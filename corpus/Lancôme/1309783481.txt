My initial reaction to packaging is appreciation. It’s a nice size bottle and its very cute the way they separate the three ingredients. The colors are pretty. Upon the first time using it my skin felt smooth and supple even before my other products. no unpleasant smell. Slightly greasy feel.Used the product for a few days, i notice my skin feels soft, but i still feel like its a little bit of greasiness that I can’t get over. I feel like its a little heavy for my skin type. not for me
