I received Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. I used this for two weeks, day and night. I only used one pump as two was too much and made my face feel sticky. The three serum include: hyaluronic acid, vitamin C+ niacinamide, and ferulic acid. During the two weeks, I did noticed visibly reduce wrinkles, and a brighter skin. Highly recommend and would repurchase. nan
