This product is one of the most beautiful serums I’ve ever used on my face. It also has such a lovely scent that my kids noticed right away and said I smelled so good! That was a bonus. I love that it absorbs into the skin right away and layers underneath other skin care items as well as makeup beautifully. Other products tend to leave your skin tacky and this one doesn’t. Using this product has made my skin feel smoother and helped with so many of my texture issues. Once I finish this bottle I will definitely be repurchasing another one. I am recommending it to my mom and sister because although they have different skin types I know they can both benefit from this amazing product. beautiful product & packaging
