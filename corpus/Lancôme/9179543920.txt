First thing I have to mention is the fragrance… it’s like putting perfume on your face, and it lingers. Thankfully it did not irritate my sensitive skin. My skin looks very nice and plump immediately after use, and it does seems to blur my pores. I can’t speak to long term effect, but I’ve been pretty pleased with the more instantaneous results. I’m enjoying it so far
