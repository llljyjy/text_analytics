I really, really, really love this cream.  It’s not one I would have initially thought to get; as someone with more mature skin (cough cough) I gravitate towards moisturizers with lots of snazzy anti-aging bells and whistles in the name.  But Lancôme Absolue is a reminder to me that sometimes simple is best.  It’s one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used.  The texture is marvelous; thick and creamy on your fingers, but smooths over your skin so lightly and easily; my face absolutely drank it up.  I love the scent (so did my 11-year-old, who immediately asked to try a dab because “it smells so good“).  It gives my skin a nice glow, and best of all, my skin feels soft and hydrated all day long.  I use a small dab in the morning and one before bed and during my first week with it I forgot to use it one night and I could definitely feel the difference the next day; my skin was dry, while on the nights I applied Absolue I woke up to baby soft skin.  And, while the quality of the moisturizer is what I love most, I also confess I love the gold jar that holds it.  I feel like I’m pampering myself when I use Absolue, and that means I start my day feeling good both inside and out.  Marvelous product; I recommend to anyone who wants a moisturizer that makes your skin soft as silk.  Definitely going to be a part of my beauty regimen going forward. Fabulous moisturizer
