Disclosure:  Lancome Renergie H.C.F Triple Serum.  I received this product as a free sample. Product size:  1.69 fl. Oz.  Packaging:  Sleek and classy packaging.  Pump is easy to use and smooth.   Texture:  Thick serum and as you are smoothing on your face it is very hydrating.  Experience:  Used this product as an overnight 3 times a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) for 2 weeks on my face and neck areas. I would apply at night after cleansing my face with a mild face wash. First impression is that that texture is a thick serum and after massaging it on my face is very hydrating with a light and pleasant fragrance.  Even after the first week, my face and neck seemed much more hydrated.  In the morning, I would just cleanse my face with a mild facial soap and my face still felt hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs hydration especially during the winter months. This feels very luxurious and definitely gave my face and neck area much needed hydration. Absolute must if you want hydration
