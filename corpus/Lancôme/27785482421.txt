I’m in love with this Lancome Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum, Lancom always delivers luxury skincare experience to its customers. This product package is eye-catching, what a nice bottle and design. This is not my first time using Lancome skincares, every time it surprised me with outstanding quality! This serum has a triple dose of Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Ferulic Acid which targets volume loss, reducing wrinkles and dark spots. It has a high concentration of ingredients but still gentle to my sensitive skin, I didn’t have any irritation at all.After using this triple serum daily for two weeks, I can feel my skin is so much softer, re-plumped and tightened, I don’t have fine lines so I can’t compare the outcome but my dark spots are visibly smaller and lighter. Now my skin looks younger overall, I’m very happy with the positive result and will highly recommend it to my friends and family. I enjoy this luxury skincare
