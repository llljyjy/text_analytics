I have been using this product for well over a month now.  I love the way this serum looks on my skin.  It makes my face glow.  The texture is so smooth and the scent is so subtle and perfect.  I HATE a stinky face serum.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  When you find a face product that works at 40, you donâ€™t change! Return buyer!
