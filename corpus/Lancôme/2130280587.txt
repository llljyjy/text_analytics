While I was home this week with Covid, I figured it would be a great time to really give the new Lancôme Régenerie H.C.F. Triple Serum a run for its money. I have to say, despite the luxury price tag, I’m not that impressed. This serum retails for $135. You do get a nice sized bottle but I was left wanting more. It seems there are three components to this serum as there are three tiny holes in which the product comes out of and then you mix it together. This serum left my face feeling too dewy and like I couldn’t wear makeup over it. The texture reminded me of suntan lotion. I’d second guess yourself if you were thinking of trying this and maybe go with a different serum. Just Eh
