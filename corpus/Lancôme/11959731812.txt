I must admit that I generally like Lancome products, they are high quality products, and this night cream is one more quality product by Lancome. It is very moisturizing, and hydrating, feels comfortable, and non greasy. My skin likes it, and I did not experience any irritation, it makes my skin smooth and firmer. However, I do not like alcohol in the ingredients even though I understand that it is for the formula. The cream has added fragrance, keep that in mind if you are sensitive to fragrance. I will continue using it to see the long-term results, but so far so good. I liked the idea of the prebiotics complex in my cream for strenghtening the skin barrier. Lancome quality.
