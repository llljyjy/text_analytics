It is a so so serum. I expect more from lancome. It’s good for people who have very very dry skin as it is very hydrating product. For my combination skin, its bit heavy. My skin looks and feels oily after 3-4 hours which I don’t like. I will give this serum a try in winter months. Good but not so good
