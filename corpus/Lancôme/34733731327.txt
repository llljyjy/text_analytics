Can I give 10 stars? Great product-CPAP users will LOVE this.  When I first tried this I thought it was crazy.  Three ingredients squirt out and mix together and I just knew it would be a gross mess...I was WRONG.  The serum comes together into a silky formula that sinks into the skin. Not greasy or watery, just lusciousness. There are 3 formulas in 1-hyaluronic acid, C+Niacinamide, and Ferulic acid that plumps up the skin and hydrates it while reducing wrinkles and dark spots and increasing elasticity.  My complexion is glowing and my dark spots are not as noticable. My skin feels smoother and my makeup just glides on. Now, for the CPAP people-you know how the mask straps leave marks.  I’ve tried everything and it’s still an issue.  Especially in the dry winter air, the straps make it worse with dry spots, cracking, and redness.  This serum has reduced this for me.  I don’t know which of the ingredients is responsible but over the last week I have a noticed a HUGE difference in my strap marks. They are not as deep or as dry/red and they seem to go away faster in the mornings. Maybe it’s just me-but I hope CPAP users try this product and see if it helps them, too.  I got this as a free sample but will gladly purchase more. Reduced my CPAP mask strap marks!  10 stars
