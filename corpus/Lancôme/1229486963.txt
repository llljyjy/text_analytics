I’ve heard pros and cons to using eye creams. Many feel they’re unnecessary. But with mature skin, it is even more important for me to protect and maintain the thinner skin on the eyes. In the past, I’ve found eye creams to either be ineffective, or too thick, causing breakouts or irritating my eyes.The Absolue Revitalizing cream has the right balance. It is emollient, but not too thick. It is also not too thin and watery, thereby migrating into my very dry and sensitive eyes.  I find it gentle on my increasingly sensitive skin. But I don’t know how extremely sensitive skin would react.One of the good things is that you don’t need too much product. With the hefty price tag, you can still get a ton of usage out of one container. So go light with usage as a little goes a long way. Great to use everyday - but use sparingly
