I received this serum (complimentary) – get this – the day before I tested positive for COVID. Sure, that sounds crappy, but it worked out because it gave me a solid amount of time where I could just take care of my skin and not wear any makeup. Also, that meant there was no makeup covering up my complexion, and I could truly see how my skin was progressing. Full disclosure: I use a prescription tret combo treatment every other night, so while I’ve used the serum on my face every morning, I’ve only used it every other evening. I’ve been putting it on my face, neck, and decolletage, and it feels immediately hydrating. It’s VERY serumy (does that make sense? It looks and feels like a serum and doesn’t absorb right away, but when it does… *chef’s kiss*) so I was concerned that it would make me look really greasy or not work with makeup, so I did put foundation and such on one day to test it. It actually worked really well with my makeup; my foundation didn’t separate or anything, but my skin still retained its glowy look. I can’t tell just yet how my fine lines and such are affected, but overall, my skin looks quite lovely; a bit tighter, younger, and brighter. Also definitely worth mentioning I have extremely sensitive skin, am prone to eczema on my neck, and even though there is a relatively strong fragrance, this serum did not irritate my skin AT ALL. I’m excited to see how everything progresses! Smooth, supple skin!
