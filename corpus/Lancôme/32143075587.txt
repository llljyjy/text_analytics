I have dry skin and as a woman with fine lines starting to show, I take my skincare routine seriously. I often look for an all in one when it comes to moisturizers. I want something thick and creamy that targets my dry skin while fighting the signs of aging.This cream is very thick and creamy. I use this cream at night as a sleep in mask and it makes my skin soft and works as an eye area cream as well. You donâ€™t have to use much of this cream, if you do, it tends to ball up when you touch your face, however, simply using less works perfectly. This cream does everything that I want it to and my skin looks brighter, healthier, radiant and feels softer.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this Lancome cream. It leaves me feeling great and looking more radiant than before. Fantastic Overall Moisturizer
