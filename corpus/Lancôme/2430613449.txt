I love this eye cream. It is very smooth and hydrating. I get dry under my eyes and I also get red bumps from irritation from many eye creams, but this hydrates and does cause any irritation. The jar is small, but a little goes a long way. It is quite pricey, but most eye creams are. I didn’t notice any changes to my dark circles and I use it twice a day. I don’t have prominent wrinkles around my eyes (yet) so I cannot speak on whether it helps with that. I would repurchase. it’s a good one
