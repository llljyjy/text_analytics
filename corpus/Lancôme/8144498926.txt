I received a sample of the Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Rich Cream, in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The cream smells amazing, not too strong and not too light. I have used the product for a week, and have noticed the difference. Brighter. smoother, and softer. Adds moisture that was lacking, without being oily. It is concentrated, so a little goes a long way. I have been receiving so many compliments on my more youthful appearance. When you look better, you take on the world a little differently. I can not recommend this cream enough. AMAZING! IN LOVE
