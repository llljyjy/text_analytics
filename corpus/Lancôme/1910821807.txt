I can only rave about this product - it has given me a bit of a confidence boost! I have rosy cheeks and rosacea and this has helped to visibly remove a good portion of that. Below is a picture of me and my husband unfiltered and just light makeup and you can tell the rosiness has diminished and I am feeling so hydrated. At 39 (40 in a month) I needed this product - its given me a confidence boost made my skin feel firmer and I am sure i do not look a day over 35 ;) *wink* I plan to buy this going forward and using this in my daily routine. Also, a LITTLE goes a long way - just a dab dab dab dab through your T zone and then rub in! Amazing Hydration
