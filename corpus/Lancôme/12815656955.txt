Okay, let me start by saying that I have never used a nightly moisturizer. My skin will breakout if I do, they are just too heavy and I have normal/oily skin. THIS cream, however, has not caused any issues at all. Iâ€™ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my morning skin is plump and moisturized. New step in my routine!!! nan
