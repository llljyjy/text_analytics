The Bad: I really do like the product! 3 in 1 I am all for. Especially when it involves a new way to do a Vit C serum. But this bottle / delivery system, leaves much to be desired. All three pumps dispensers would only work consistently about 85% of the time. Meaning you would not get the full impact of the formula. Often when this would happen is when I would get some kind of facial irritation. I’m the type of person that is more than willing to cut a bottle open to get all of the product out, or get the full benefit. However, the “ patented delivery system” does not make this an easy task. For 128 retail price, I don’t feel like the customer should have to work so hard to get a great product to work well! The Good: The serum does everything it advertises for! After two weeks of use, saw a great deal of improvement on firmness, which I didn’t even realized I needed. Also helps improve on sun damage and clarity, if used as instructed. Very please with the texture of my skin as well…which I feel is a big deal, and not always a result that is achievable with other products In all, would easily purchase…IF, the bottle wasn’t so darn annoying. Great Idea, Good Serum, So-So Bottle
