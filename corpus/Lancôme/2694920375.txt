This formula smells nice and feels smoothe going on the face. I used it morning and night after cleansing and have enjoyed using it. I will say that it’s a little heavy feeling and I don’t think the full size bottle will last much longer than another week or two, so that would be very expensive. I think the overall texture of my skin has somewhat improved, but I don’t think I see much of a difference in my lines on my face. I will keep using until the bottle is up to see if there is more of a difference later and then determine if I will buy it for myself to continue.I received this complimentary from Influenster. I’m a fan
