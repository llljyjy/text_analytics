The Lanc√¥me Absolute Revitalizing Eye Cream is the best eye cream hands-down! I have dark circles under my eyelids and decided to get this product. The eye cream feels so rich and velvety on my skin. It has the consistency of moisturizing lotion. The eye cream does not leave a sticky or tacky feeling which is a major plus for me. Instead, it leaves a cool lightweight feeling on my eyes. My eyes feel a major lift and I am so grateful for this product for helping me remove the dark circles under my eyelids. Definitely recommend for skyrocketing your confidence! nan
