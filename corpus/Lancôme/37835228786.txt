Here’s an honest review.. I absolutely love this night cream! I have been using this for roughly about two weeks now, and have seen dramatic changes already with the redness in my skin and uneven textures of my skin, which are my problem areas. Its moisturizing, not too overbearing, its lightweight, not cakey, doesnt clog pores, and the scent is very pleasant. For the price, its absolutely worth what you’re getting in the jar. I’m in my 30’s, and my skin definitely needs the help, but even if you’re not seeing too many issues with your skin, its never too early to be proactive with your skin! Highly recommend this product! Stop & but this now!
