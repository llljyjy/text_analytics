Lancome is a brand name I look up to. After trying this I have a couple of points:  First the packaging is definitely eye catching.  When using this product little goes a long way, its a bit thicker than some serums I have tried so use sparingly.  You will need to mix the serum together,  which is no problem but if you use to much it will show oily on your face. I have oily skin so that is definitely something to watch out for. After using it I did notice a smoother, moisturized, healthier look to my skin. The bottle will last a long time so the price isnâ€™t too bad. I recommend this for anyone that wants healthier looking skin. Glowy looks
