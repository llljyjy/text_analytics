I had been looking for a new hyaluronic acid, but at the same time wanted to try additional serums mostly to approve the appearance of pores and for anti aging. This is very convenient that you can have all the serums in a wonderful package so the serums retain their quality. The pump packaging is a smart way to go as it’s most sanitary. I hadn’t ever used niacinamide consistently, and I believe this was the item that made the biggest difference in improving my skin texture.  I like the fragrance, the feel of the mixture took some getting used to, it feels a little more tacky some days but feels fine when dry. While dark spots aren’t a big concern for me, I think it also evened out some spots or color differentiation that never bothered me. Unique, convenient for anti aging and spots
