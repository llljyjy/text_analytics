I received this from bzzagent. It’s such a great night cream exactly what I needed . Not a lot of creams is good on my combination skin. When I wake up in the morning I feel dry from a lot of the creams or masks I tried but not this one . It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy . It gives very nice moister that doesn’t dry me out through the night . My skin feels brightened, rejuvenated , plumped and hydrated in the morning. I see noticeable difference when I use this cream . It didn’t break me out and didn’t clog my pores which is very important to me. I highly recommend it)) Amazing night cream))
