I have VERY dry skin. I recently tried the Rich Cream in the same line and loved it, so I wanted to give the serum a try, too. The serum feels like a very lightweight lotion when it goes on. I didn’t apply a moisturizer over it because I wanted to see how the serum performed alone. Within an hour or so,  my face had a slight tight feeling and this continued throughout the day. Not sure if the tightening is intended for anti-aging, but that feeling isn’t comfortable for my super dry skin.  I much prefer a serum that is more emollient and continues to feel hydrating. Serum didn't work for my very dry skin
