This serum is really innovative. I love that the different scribes are dispensed separately in a single pump and you mix them before applying! It goes on silky-smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, but not greasy. I also really like the light scent. I don’t feel I’ve been using it long enough to see improvement in dark spots - only about 3 weeks. These actives take some time to work. Overall, I love this product and use it twice a day!
