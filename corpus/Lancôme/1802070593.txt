I always enjoy using Lancome products. Their anti aging formulas are always really well done. I like that this moisturizer gave me the perfect amount of hydration so that when I woke up in the morning, my skin looked hydrated & fresh. There was no scent. It was light unlike most night creams that can be very heavy or thick which I liked. I would definitely buy this product again. Great Night Cream
