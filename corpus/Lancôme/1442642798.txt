As someone with very dry skin, I can generally use a night cream as a day cream and it will work out just fine. This one, however, is definitely a bit heavier (in a good way) and is best suited for nighttime for my skin. It applies really nicely, and although it is scented it isnâ€™t overwhelming. nan
