Ok so first of all, I have to admit that this product actually works. Below are before and after photos of some problem areas I have with recent acne scarring. I was surprised myself to see that they had lightly but noticeably faded!!! I probably wouldn’t have been able to believe it myself if I hadn’t documented it. Just given the fact that this serum actually faded some scarring gives me the motivation and hope to continue and finish the healthy sized bottle of the Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Anti-Aging Triple Serum. I not only love that it is working but the smell is pleasant, which is a hige plus that I have started to notice and try not to take for granted. This Lancôme serum goes on smooth and light. I do still put a moisturizer over it once it has absorbed into the skin as well. It definitely has resulted some obvious positive results compared to serums I have used in the past that don’t have retinol in it. I highly recommend this Lancôme triple serum as it has softened, smoothed and faded dark spots on my facial skin, making me one happy customer. I love when I can give a positive honest review, they make the entire experience so worth it! It actually works! Be patient.
