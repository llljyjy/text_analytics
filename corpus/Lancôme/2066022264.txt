Lancôme has always been a innovator in beauty products always delivering an excellent product. Unfortunately, for me this product just couldn’t be all that it was hyped up for, it left my skin feeling sticky and after using as instructed for over 2 weeks daily I couldn’t determine any of its proclaimed benefits or could honestly note any improvement in my facial skins health and appearance. Maybe it was just me! nan
