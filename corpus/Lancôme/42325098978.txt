I had the pleasure of testing this product out for the last couple weeks and believe that I have used it long enough that I can accurately review it. I am a long time user of night serums and believe wholeheartedly in skin care routines. I have tried many products and definitely have my favorites that I splurge on. I was excited to try something new and this product most definitely did not disappoint. To provide an accurate review, I swapped this product out with my tried and true premium brand, for the last several weeks. This product arrived in nice packaging and a beautiful jar. The jar is easy to open and store. Applying the product is easy as well, just apply to freshly washed skin, as part of your usual skin care routine. The product is very light weight and non greasy. A little bit goes a long way and you apply nightly to your face and neck. After about a week, I could definitely start seeing a difference. I no longer needed a moisturizer in the morning after washing my face and before applying my make up - I have dry, sensitive skin and regularly apply moisturizer so that my makeup does not look “cakey“ on my face. In turn, I was also able to use less base and wear less makeup overall. My skin has a dewy appearance, which I would usually get after using retinol creams, but these tend to make my skin even more sensitive and dry it out. The cream was gentle enough that I could use it under my eyes as well and caused zero irritation. I am pretty pleased with the product, as I can essentially get rid of my eye cream and not have to purchase as much moisturizer going forward. This product truly gives you a youthful appearance and enhances your skin texture. I plan on adding this into my regular skin care routine. The cream does have a light perfume smell that I am not overly fond of. I prefer my creams to be fragrance free but it is not enough that it is overwhelming or would cause me to stop using the product. My new night cream!
