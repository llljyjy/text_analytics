I received this product for free from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. This product is a great add on to my night routine, and I really do like to apply this cream as my last step. Itâ€™s the perfect consistency with a nice and light fragrant smell. I like that it is not too thick and heavy for my skin and also not too thin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face glowing in the morning. My boyfriend has been using this for his face as well and the dry rough patches have healed up nicely! Perfect addition to my night routine
