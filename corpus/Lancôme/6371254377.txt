The product comes in a beautiful black glass jar which feels deluxe and heavy. The inner lid does make it travel proof however the glass jar might deter you from travelling along with it. The cream has a beautiful texture and it gets absorbed in the skin very easily. It is neither super thick not very runny but has a silky smooth texture. It leaves the skin feeling velvety soft, and not greasy or oily. However, my skin took quite a few days in getting used to it. When I started using it, I started getting small pimples/white-heads on my face which did scare me but I continued the use and they went away in few days. It did hydrate my skin well and I woke up with skin which felt smoother and healthier. Silky smooth texture
