OMG I had this product in the tiger year bundle and didnt buy the bundle for it but at my surprise it was like the best discovery ever. I dont think its like the most effective product and should totally be used with serums and all BUT the feeling on my skin, the smell, etc. I would have this product on my skin every minute of the day if I could lol its the best feeling ever. It is named confortâ€œ for a reason. I really recommand ! LOVE IT if I could put 6+ stars I would!
