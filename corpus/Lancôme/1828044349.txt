I have been using the serum now for 2 weeks and so far, I am really liking this serum. I have multiple skin concerns so was a bit worried how my skin would react to this serum, but no issues! I have very dry skin and thought this serum might be very drying, but it is actually pretty moisturizing. I still use my regular moisturizer over the top, but have used other serums in the past that still dry out my skin even with a moisturizer. Also, I have sensitive skin that is extremely prone to breakouts and this serum also has not caused me to break out so I’m thrilled with that aspect! I’m in my mid 30’s and tanned A LOT in my younger years so unfortunately I have some sun damage as well as acne scarring and this serum has definitely made an improvement in my overall skin tone in these past few weeks. I’m excited to keep using it to see how it helps with the fine lines on my forehead around eyes, but I can say confidently that this serum works if you’re looking for a more even skin tone/texture!
