I received 7 packets with an order to try out. Directions say to use Am & PM. There was barely enough product in the packets to use once, never mind twice a day and I have a small face. This product did absolutely nothing as far as plumping or smoothing out fine lines. Maybe if I had gotten enough to actually use twice a day I would see some type of results. Any samples I have gotten from Lancome and other high end products give the smallest samples I have ever seen. I am not spending $135 on a product that shows no results and whose company is too cheap to send decent sized “try me“ packets. nan
