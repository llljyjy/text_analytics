I was kind of hesitant about switching serums since I thought the other brand I was using was “the best“ but it was just a matter of a week of using these product that I starting seeing results. Instantly my face looks so much smother and brighter. After 3 weeks some of my dark spots cause by sun damage started fading. After a month my fine lines were VISIBLE reduced. My husband was very surprised. It also smell very good (that is a plus). I followed with my moisturizer. I’m very satisfied with this serum and I recommend it to anyone. By the way: It took me a day or two to figure out how to make all the product come out together at the same pump but then I realized it has to be hold on a horizontal way while pumping it. Much better results than I expected
