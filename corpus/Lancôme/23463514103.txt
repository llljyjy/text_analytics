Lancome Renergie H.C.F. Triple Serum is a life saver!!! As a recently separated 40 year old woman I was feeling depressed because of my fine lines and wrinkles  and I have tried so many products with none working  not even the expensive ones!I have been using this Triple Serum for four months now and I’m never going back. I apply in the morning and before bed. Using my ring finger I massage the problem areas first and then go over my whole face and neck/chest area. Its so silky smooth and not super strong smelling.  My face is now aging backwards thanks to Lancome! A little goes a long way so the bottle lasts and its pretty. Lancome never let’s me down! If you are 30 and up you need to add this Triple Serum to your daily routine! You can thank me later ladies! I LOVE Lancome!
