My skin regimen includes Glow recipe products in the morning. Using Lancôme’s triple serum cut application and drying time. Typically I wait for the products to dry before I apply sunscreen. This product allows me to apply sunscreen without clunking. Leaves my skin looking radiant.  I’ve used this product over a month and I’m seeing the same effectiveness as my other products. The biggest advantage is applying them at once and not leaving my skin too oily. I received this sample product to test for Influenster, but I plan on buying. Best combo thus far
