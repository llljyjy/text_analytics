This serum really DOES something!  It’s smoothed and softened my wrinkles, even deeper ones near my mouth.  My skin overall feels softer since I’m using it. It’s a bit pricey but it’s worth it because it does at least most of what it says it will do; you also don’t need much, so a bottle lasts a while, which also helps. A Serum That Works!
