I absolutely loved this serum that I received from influenster and lancome. The serum made my face feel amazing and has one of the best scents I’ve smelt in a skincare. I loved it. I know a lot of people were complaining about the bottle pump because it has 3 serums in 1. That each serum comes out in it’s each hole if that makes sense. So one of the serums did take awhile for me to get it to come out. But I sat it upside down for about a hour and shook it a lot and it finally came out and works perfectly now. Highly recommend this product to others!! Give it a try for sure. One of my favorites
