Iâ€™ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now and I have began to notice an improvement in the appearance of and texture of my skin. The lines around my mouth and my forehead do look smoother and my skin looks more plump in those areas. I noticed a small improvement in the appearance of my sun spots. My skin definitely has a smoother texture and feels much softer. The pump is pretty easy to use and works well. This did make my skin a little more oily but I have not broken out yet. Works well
