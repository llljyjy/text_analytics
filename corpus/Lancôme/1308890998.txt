This is a fantastic cream! I use tretinoin at night, so my face tends to need some extra moisture. This cream is a wonderful addition to my routine and it feels so luxurious. A little goes a long way, which is nice considering the very high price point. But it sinks into my skin well and leaves my skin feeling so soft by the morning. It has a bit of fragrance, but I am not bothered by fragrance in my skincare. Also, it does not seem to irritate my acne prone skin so far. nan
