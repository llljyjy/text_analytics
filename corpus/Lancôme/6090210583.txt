I have been noticing more fine lines in the past couple of years and I have been on the hunt for a new face serum that will help my skin look its best as I get even older.  As a 45+ year old woman, I am now starting to get the dark spot my mom had growing up and wanted something to also tackle that issue!  I tried this new Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum: For Plumping & Anti-Aging by Lancôme and found it hit most of my marks on products I like to use on my face at night.  It went on smooth and felt clean and nice after my shower (before bed).  It was nice and thick, which means I really didn’t need much to cover my whole face, which is a HUGE plus.  I did find the fine lines diminished after 3 weeks, which is a huge star on the plus side, and the dark spots too are starting to also diminish.  I am hoping after 3 or 4 more weeks, the dark spots I am starting to get will be gone.  So you may be asking yourself, why the 4 stars and not 5 stars?  Well one word, scent.  It has a nice smell, for sure, but the fragrance is just a bit too much for me personally.  I like a very light scent when I use these types of products because I use them and then go to bed. The first week my nose ran when I was trying to go to sleep, obviously after a couple weeks either my nose didn’t notice it anymore or maybe once you open it and start using it the smell diminishes (thankfully) but yeah, that is why I took one star off.  Would love a fragrance free version of this product, it would be my go to forever!  So if you dont mind a scent, this is the product for you!  Love it! Works!
