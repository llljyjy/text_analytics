Do I really do like this product.  It has Hylauronic Acid, C+ Niacinamide & Ferulic Acid all In one. I’ve added it into both my morning and nighttime skincare routines. My first time using it I noticed right away that it plumped up my skin and made it glow a bit. After a few weeks my skin looks healthier and more clear with less dark spots. It says it should help with fine lines/wrinkles but I feel it’s too soon to tell. I would recommend this but the price is a bit high. You are technically getting three products in one, so if it’s in your price range I say go for it. 3 serums in one
