**I got this product for free from Influenster and  Lancôme in exchange for my truthful and honest opinion.  This serum didn’t work for me and I found it to be incredibly disappointing.  I have sensitive skin and although this product claims to be suitable for all skin types, within 4 days of using it, it broke my skin out terribly.  I know it was a break out and not purging because my skin continued to do this throughout the two week trial. And it wasn’t until I discontinue the use of it and started using my normal every day products that my skin cleared up. It might work for you, but it just did not work for me.  Also, it is very expensive, and for something so expensive I felt like there should be more product than what is actually in the bottle. Incredibly disappointing.
