I have had this product now about 2 months and used it almost daily. And I must say, I have no clue what the hype is about lol I mean, it’s nice, the bottle is large and really pretty. But I don’t noticing my skin poppin more than any other day when I use this. I certainly don’t really see the exfoliating effects. It doesn’t break me out, so that’s good. But for a $95 exfoliating essence, i need to feel like it’s doing something and i don’t lol Meh… I DONT SEE WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT
