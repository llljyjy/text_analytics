absolue-tly love this!  The cream is nice and thick, smells nice, and goes on in a way that feels hydrating.  It doesn’t just sit on your skin, you really feel it is absorbed and leaves your skin feeling lush into the morning.  I think that it is brightening as my skin always looks refreshed and supple after using this.  The anti aging factors are really hard for me to see, so I can’t really speak of that, but all over as a hydrating moisturizer this is a new go to for me. nan
