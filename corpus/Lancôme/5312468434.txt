This cream is absolutely phenomenal! From the moment I ran my fingers across the cream when I first opened the jar, I knew it was going to be amazing. The texture is incredibly silky, rich and makes my feel super soft. I tend to have dry skin and this is a total game changer! The packaging is luxurious and has a nice weight to it. I don’t think Lancôme has any bad products! Silky smooth skin
