I received this product for free from Influenster and Lancome to give my honest review: First of all i love the scent of this serum, its not too strong but smell like quality skin Care, the pump which i read some people complaint about only failed once in delivering the 3 components, i waited to review it to see if i could see any changes in dark spots but unfortunately i didnt, anyway im pregnant so it could be the cause, Apart from that my skin looks brighter and firm, i highly recommend this product, plus: it comes in a bigger size than usual skin Care products Great addition to skin Care routine
