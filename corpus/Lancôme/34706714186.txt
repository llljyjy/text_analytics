I have been using this product for the last two weeks plus and have been very happy.  I noticed that during the holidays that my skin was changing a bit due to stress and fine lines were showing up a little more than they used to.  Within the first 24 hours, this product instantly brightens your skins and over the last two plus weeks, Iâ€™ve noticed a decrease in fine lines while my stress levels have stayed at all time high.  Great product - easy to apply, long lasting and honestly, I just feel refreshed after using it.  The fragrance is light and the product does have an aging lessening effect. Makes those wrinkles go away....
