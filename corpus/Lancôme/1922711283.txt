I’ve used another Lancôme eye cream in the past and absolutely loved it, so I was super excited to receive the Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream complimentary from Lancôme, in exchange for my honest review. The packing is classy and sophisticated and the jar is gorgeous gold. Upon first look of the eye cream, it is thicker and creamy and when I apply it, it soaks right into my eye area. Only a tiny little bit is needed, so this jar will last a long time. After only a few daily uses, using it day and night, my under eyes are hydrated and the fine lines have started to diminish. There’s almost no more puffiness or dark circles, which is a huge problem I have. I am in love with this and fully intend to continue using it long after this is finished. My fine lines are just about gone!!!
