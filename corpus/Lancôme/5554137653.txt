I would highly recommend this product. As an almost 40 year old mom who hasn’t had the best skincare routine over the years, my skin could use a little TLC. After using this cream for two weeks, I have been able to tell a difference in the softness/moisture of my skin and also some wrinkle reduction. The softening of my wrinkles could be due to the hydration but it certainly is noticeable and enough to make me want to continue using this cream.I had originally gotten a consultation for Botox and fillers but after using this cream, I am going to postpone for another month and see how much more improvement this could provide ! It’s a 9/10 for me - only drawback is price but this is considerably cheaper than fillers ! A definite must for me as I approach 40
