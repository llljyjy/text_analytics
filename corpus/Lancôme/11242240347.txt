I literally CANNOT go a night without my Lancome Advanced Génifique Repairing Night Cream!! It does so much good for your skin and keeps you looking fantastic for your age!! The formula glides effortlessly and absorbs without leaving behind any residue. It’s soo hydrating and helps keep your skin balanced and your tone and texture soo even. My fine lines and wrinkles soften and slow down completely and firms my skin that’s starting to lose elasticity. You wake up with healthy, glowing skin every single morning as long as you’ve used this the night before. It just works. It’s literally a miracle cream!! I definitely give this product a 100 out of 10, it is worth every single penny !!! I literally recommend this to everybody!! My all time hands down favorite product!! I’ve already got my mom and grandma using it faithfully every single night !! Literally a MUST HAVE to your nighttime routine !!
