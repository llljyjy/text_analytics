I bought during a sale not sure what to do with it..it ended up in the cabinet and I just started using it and Holy Moly ! Where have you been all my life..I put it on a cotton pad and swipe my face in the morning to remove last nights products..I have dry skin and don’t wash my face in the morning..this is so amazing and gentle I will use it forever..my skin is happier and smoother and I’m even willing to ignore the scent even though I wish it wasn’t there.. This has been a game changer for me ! What a great surprise !!!
