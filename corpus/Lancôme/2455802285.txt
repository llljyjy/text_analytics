I really wanted to find a good moisturizer with spf instead of putting on both a moisturizer and spf, and when I saw this was a primer too I got excited. I do really like this product, however, I think I’m still going to use a regular moisturizer with this for extra moisture, but I’m happy that this is spf and a primer, and it does seem to really prime the skin. The reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because it’s $40 for an ounce. Usually moisturizers give you 1.7 oz, I’m not thrilled with it, but I probably would buy it again. Good Product
