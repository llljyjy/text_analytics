The best and lightest eye cream I’ve ever had the pleasure of utilizing. There’s no fragrance,it’s not a heavy cream,nor thick per se;yet it gives the results of such. I’ve been using the Lancôme Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream for a little over a week and I’ve seen the effectiveness earlier than most other eye serums that are much more costly! What I like and find unusually gratifying is the fact that even though I haven’t used it for too long,I already had the notion to jump up and down with glee;and that’s a rarity with eye serums. The wrinkles were lessened to a very nice,noticeable degree;my dark circles were lightened and no more crows feet. Now remember it’s only been a week. Can you imagine when the jar is finished?! I will definitely be purchasing this specific eye cream and recommending it to family and friends;even if they don’t ask. (Or should ?) The best aspect I like is the timely effectiveness that was personally seen by me, and not to mention this eye cream did not seem like a cover up;it felt like it was a treatment;that when used on a daily basis,as instructed;with upward circling motions,will stand the test of time in all its’ claims thereto. And so will we… Lancôme’ Absolue is an absolute.
