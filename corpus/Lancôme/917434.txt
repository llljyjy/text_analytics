I’m a Lancôme fan but honestly haven’t always gotten the best results from their skincare; I still love the products due to the amazing textures and scents they have, but the promises don’t always deliver for me. However, I have noticed a difference with this new Génifique night cream! Nothing drastic as I haven’t used it too long, but a definite improvement in moisture and texture of my skin. This cream isn’t heavily fragranced like most Lancôme products. It also feels very light on my skin and absorbs really quickly, which I greatly appreciate in Florida summer! This is actually making a noticeable difference in my skin. Definitely recommend this new cream!
