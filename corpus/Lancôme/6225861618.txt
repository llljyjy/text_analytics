Lancome products are so lux and amazing I genuinely love their skincare and makeup line ! This moisturizer is non the less amazing , it’s a amazing moisturizer does not leave me sticky at all just perfect it also hasn’t broken me out which I tend to get when I try some moisturizers and have notice my skin getting brighter! A lovely soft scent which is a plus! If you haven’t tried this yet and your looking for a new moisturizer give this one a go! Absolutely worth it
