It goes on smooth and absorbs well into my skin. The bottle is gorgeous, I loved how it’s 3 separate serums in one bottle. I used the Renergire h.c.f triple serum twice a day for a month. Honestly I didn’t see anything improve really. I have fine lines under my eyes, between my brows and on my forehead. I also have freckles that I would like to see faded, but none of those areas looked better after using for a month. I did wear sunscreen daily. Also a warning about the bottle, be carful not to drop it. I accidentally hit mine off my counter and the push button broke on the top, and now it’s hard to get all 3 serums to come out at once. It’s a nice concept, but maybe the top should be wrapped in rubber as to avoid the breaking of the top. Not for me sadly
