This must be the most luxurious moisturizer I have ever used. My favorite part is the scent as it leaves you with a truly rose scent lingering in the air for the entire night. Quality: The moisturizer did a great job evening and brightening my skin tone. I used it morning and evening for three weeks and see a significant improvement in my skin texture. My skin was really radiant in the morning and my foundation make up applied on more smoothly. I have sensitive skin and did not have any breakouts which I typically get from moisturizers advertised to provide such great hydration. Appearance: The moisturizer is a beautiful pink shade and combined with the rose scent truly makes you feel luxurious. The bottle is a beautiful gold finish which looks nice on any counter and I could imagine the entire skin care line together would make a nice display. This moisturizer was so great it reinvigorated my entire skin care routine. I enjoyed washing my face every night and prepping my skin. With this renewed skin care, I even noticed my hyperpigmentation start to lighten. I highly recommend the moisturizer for a radiant glow. Truly a luxurious moisturizer
