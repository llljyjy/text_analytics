I’ve been on the hunt for a good all in one day serum that is light in texture but effective. I haven’t had much luck with Lancome in the past, but wanted to give this one an honest shot. The fact that this product said it had niacinamide made all that much more excited to try!First off, I love how the serum is packaged and also how it dispenses 3 different serums into my hand.Second, I love how this serum feel on my face,Not sticky at all!It is a little on the fragranced side, but if you can get past that, you’ll love this!My skin feels instantly revived, and as the days went on my skin felt strengthened,Not as dull and fatigued how it had been feeling. I’m glad I gave this one a shot
