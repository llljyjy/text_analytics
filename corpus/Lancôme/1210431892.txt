I LOVE LANCOME!! This is such a gentle yet moisturizing eye cream. It doesn’t leave you greasy unlike other luxury eye creams I’ve tried, and I think it works!! Although it hasn’t gotten rid of my terrible sleep lines, it brightened my skin and seems to keep any other wrinkles at bay. I only wish it came with some sort of applicator instead of having to use my finger. I LOVE LANCOME!!
