I would definitely buy this product - very light to the touch, smooth to skin and easy to apply! I like Lancome but I haven’t used many of their skin products - but like the feel of this plumping serum and smell is very faint. Also pretty cool how it’s a 3-in-1. The only issue I see is that when you push for product, some is left on the pump  - feel like this may an issue over time. nan
