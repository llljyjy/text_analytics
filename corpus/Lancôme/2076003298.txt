I have been using this for over three weeks now. I use it morning and night because I love it. it works well on my skin. i have oily combo and have no issues with it increasing my oil production.  I use a thin layer morning and night. I stopped using my serum during the trial. I don’t need it.  This moisturizer is amazing.  My skin feels and looks amazing with my foundation on.  This is worth the price. I am in my 50’s and my skin feels amazing. Great moisturizer
