I have been using this for a few weeks and have been enjoying the results. My skin is combo/oily with large pores and spots of dermatitis. I haven’t had any irritation, breakouts, or aggravation of my dermatitis. I have been seeing my skin look smoother and hydrated, even without using it every morning and evening. My only issue with this product is the packaging. I had to waste several pumps of 1 element before the other 2 started coming out. I’m assuming I’ll run out of that one first now. Lancome also isn’t cruelty-free though, so I won’t be repurchasing. Love it! Not cruelty-free though.
