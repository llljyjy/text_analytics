I want to start by saying that cream came in a really nice generous jar.Eight when you open it you can smell the cream. Itâ€™s not overly powering but it does linger and it smells like perfume . I did break out in the beginning since my skin was getting adjusted ,but the 2nd week I noticed my redness had calmed , my pores looked smaller and my skin was glowing more . It absorbs quickly ,does not feel tacky nor greasy . Overall great product but the price did not do it for me . The price was breaking for me since I know I can find a night cream that also works well for me for less . It just depends on your budget . I do recommend this cream if you want splurge .My photos is a 2 weeks difference before and after using this cream . Great Cream but Not worth the money
