Absolutely love this product!  I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and noticed quite the difference in my skin’s overall texture after just a few days.  My skin has felt more smooth, hydrated, and plump.  I’ve not really seen a difference in it lightening up my aging spots, but it may just take some time.  I also love the beautiful bottle and how much product there is!  A little definitely goes a long way! Love it!
