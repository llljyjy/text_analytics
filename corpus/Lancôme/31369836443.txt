I used this for a month and can say that I do see an improvement in the suppleness, softness of my skin and my skin feels more moisturized. I can’t say there has been a significant change in dark spots. I don’t have any complaints regarding the formula however the bottle needs some improvement. When it first arrived, the Hyaluronic Acid would not dispense with the other ingredients. It took about 10 pumps before it would dispense - yes, I followed the dispensing instructions.
