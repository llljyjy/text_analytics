At first site, the bottle appears awesome.  Itâ€™s pretty and the pump mechanism is easy to use.  I have used this for over two weeks on a daily basis.  It leaves my skin smooth and soft.  I took one star off because the scent is a bit perfumey, but it dissapates quickly.  Overall I would recommend to give it a try! nan
