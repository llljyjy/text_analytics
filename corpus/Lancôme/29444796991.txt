I was lucky enough to get a free sample of Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer from Bzzagent. I have used it for a few weeks now, and the results have been amazing! I’ve been using it morning and night,and my face is simply glowing! My fine lines are a lot less noticeable than they were a month ago. This Moisturizer is so silky and luxurious feeling. This makes me look forward to my skincare routine so much more. It’s pricey, but it’s my little treat to myself. I will definitely be repurchasing this! Highly recommend! Amazing results!
