Silk smooth. This eye cream feels  luxurious. The texture is thicker than most eye creams, which I like. I have noticed a difference in my undereye appearance. I have recently started getting black “circles“ under my eyes due to lack of sleep. Never had that issue before. Glad to have this stuff. It has definitely saved the day. I noticed the changes   pretty quickly. Small jar that packs a big punch!
