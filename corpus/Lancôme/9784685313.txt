The Lancôme Génifique Repairing Night Cream is so rich, and hydrating. Leaves my skin feeling velvety soft, and I wake up to super dewy, plump skin. The texture is thick, but absorbs nicely. The scent is signature to Lancôme products, soft and not overpowering. Overall, this is a great night cream, and will come in handy during the fall and winter season! Highly recommend! So rich, and ultra hydrating!
