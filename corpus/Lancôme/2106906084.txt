This is a great serum, I love the fact that it is 3 products in one. The first time I applied it my face looked a lot more brighter and my skin felt wonderful. I love the formula, it applies easily and a little bit goes a long ways, it is not sticky yet t has a slight fresh scent to it. I tried it for 30 days and in those 30 days I have not had to wear my regular moisturizer over it. It did NOT get rid of my fine lines but did improve the appearance of them, the  bottle is large and has a great shape that allows you to hold it firmly and does not slip out of your hands. The only part I did NOT like about it it that it makes my face look too shiny and if Iâ€™m greasy, specially my forehead. And no matter how much I wipe my forehead throughout the day it still looks greasy. Great buy
