I was surprised to see the result after the first use, my skin became much softer and more uniform, it was easy to apply makeup in the morning, as if I already had a primer.  Light texture, pleasant to the touch, absorbs quickly, does not clog pores (I mention that I have combination/oily skin ) Excited to see the long-term effect, since I start to use it for around 2 weeks. Softer skin after first use
