I started to apply eye creams on my eyes a few years ago after I started noticing fine lines during the colder months. Many eye creams I’m not crazy about since some thicker ones clog my pores up and leaves bumps or the gel ones that really doesn’t provide much moisture and the skin under my eyes are still dry. I’m so glad I received a sample of this Absolue eye cream. It really moisturizers and smooths out the fine lines under my eyes AND…it doesn’t leave me with tiny bumps under my eyes!  I recently had Picosure laser done on my face to clear out the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and when I went to the plastic surgeon for a follow up, he asked if I had makeup on (I don’t wear makeup unless I’m out on a special occasion) because my eyes and face looked brighter. I guess I might have fooled him with the eye cream I’ve been using cause it firmed and moisturized the area around my eye LOL. I might have to get some more when my sample runs out. A+++ Bye bye fine lines
