I have very dry skin, especially in the wintertime. Only a few moisturizers actually fully hydrate my skin throughout the day or night, and this is one of them. The texture is thick, almost like a combination of a balm and cream, so you only need a small amount to cover your whole face and neck. I feel like this will last me a long time. The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. I like using this product as a night cream - it doesn’t feel as heavy/greasy as other nighttime products. This product could also be used during the day in the wintertime or dry climate, but I found that it started pilling when combined with other products. But maybe that’s just me using too many layers of skincare! I’d recommend this product to anyone with dry skin who has a hard time finding truly moisturizing products and also wants to have the luxury feel of this beautiful packaging. nan
