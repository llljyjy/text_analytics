With its high price tag, beautiful packaging, and reputable name, I really had high hopes for Lancome’s Renergie Lift Multi-action Ultra Face Cream with SPF 30. The PROs about this is that it is a lightly scented moisturizer in a beautiful jar. It softens the skin on my face leaving it moisturized. Unfortunately, that’s all this cream has to offer. Although my skin was left feeling soft, it also felt greasy. This cream claims “This multi-tasking face cream visibly reduces dark spots, lifts, and firms“ - it does none of these things. I am a 47-year-old female who has been using this cream for over a month now with no visible signs of improvement in my skin whatsoever Not worth the price tag
