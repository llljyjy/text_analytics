This cream feels so luxurious and is absolutely perfect for my dry skin. I prefer using it in the PM since it goes on a bit thick (Neutrogena in the AM, but it’s way too light for PM). But by morning, it just absorbs into the skin so well, doesn’t feel greasy at all. I personally love fragrance in my moisturizers (I’m not allergic to fragrance) and this has a lovely floral fragrance. My skin is acne prone and I am very, very careful about adding new products to my routine and this did not break me out!!! My skin is definitely brighter (I use in conjunction with a glycolic serum and Sk II currently) - will need to use longer to gauge anti-aging benefits. On the pricey side, but I feel like this might last me for a few months - have to wait and see. Would absolutely recommend. Brightening and great for dry skin!
