I wanted to love this cream but it is too heavy for my oily skin. The presentation of the packaging is beautiful and the quality of the product is luxurious.  Compared to other night creams I’ve used, I prefer gel moisturizer rather than cream. This product absorbs nicely into my skin on my face but not under chin. After about three weeks of use I developed a large pimple under my chin. I’ll use it from time to time because I love the feeling of luxury on my face but I cannot use daily because I don’t want anymore random pimples. I would not buy it because it is to think. I would recommend it for someone with dry skin though. Nice but not for oily skin :/
