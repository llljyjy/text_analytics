This Lanc√¥me Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream is the best I have tried.  It has a nice thick creamy texture that is not heavy or greasy.  It applied to my eye area smoothly with out tugging my skin.  It also absorbed nicely into my skin.  I did notice that the darkness under my eyes was less noticeable after a couple days of using it night and day.  My eye area looked brighter.  I liked the fact that it did not affect they way that my under eye concealer applied.  My concealer stayed in place even with the eye cream.  I really enjoyed trying this product and will be buying more when I run out.  I must say that a little goes a long way.  I highly recommend giving this eye cream a try. nan
