I used Lacome Absolue for a week straight at night before bed by itself and saw vast improvements not only in my skin feeling very moisturized but also clearer and brighter.  It has a silky texture when applying and after applying makes my face and neck feel amazingly soft and supple.  I also saw skin firming as well after a full week of use.  After the first week I paired it with Lancôme Renergie for my morning skin routine and have used both products now together for about a week and I’m seriously impressed!  I don’t have to add any other products for moisturizing or any other serums as my face has never looked better and I can’t wait to see what this does after long term use! Best moisturizer
