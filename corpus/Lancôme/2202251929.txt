I really love this cream, itâ€™s not too heavy and yet my skin feels so moisturized. This is incredibly important as a middle aged woman entering menopause where things start to really change. I also noticed an overall smoother texture, more even skin tone, and plumper skin. I love it! Great for pre & menopausal skin!!!
