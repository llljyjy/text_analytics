I’ve been using this toner essence since October or November last year. It came in a Lancôme kit I bought. I use a few Lancôme products daily and have been for some years now…advanced genifique serum, wrinkle and dark circle eye cream Génifique and bi facial eye makeup remover. Love all three by the way. Now, introducing Tonique comforting toner into my regime, loving it and will continue to purchase. Does not sting nor irritate my sensitive skin! It moisturizes my skin and is soothing. Out of all the toners I’ve tried this one removes (the most) left over makeup after cleansing. Unbelievable how much makeup I still have on my face after cleansing! I don’t know if adding this to my regimen is the reason for my skin looking so much brighter, smoother, smoother texture and less visible pores but it’s the only skincare product I’ve added/changed. Maybe the honey in Tonique which is an antioxidant really works! Smoother texture
