Nice creamy texture that glides on and soaks effortlessly into my skin. My face is usually tight after a shower, and this keeps everything nice and moisturized. I’ve also noticed a difference in my overall appearance, things are definitely smoother. I also love the scent, to me it’s not overpowering but to some it may be. I think it has a subtle rose scent. Love this…if you want to pamper yourself or invest in your skin., this is a nice high quality product. Invest in yourself
