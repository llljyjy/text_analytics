I am loving the texture of this night cream. It goes on really smooth and melts onto my skin and leaves it feeling   super soft. I have pretty dry skin  so I seal it in with an oil. My only problem is the scent. It is a STRONG perfume scent that really lingers for a long time. It is pretty disturbing.  It would be aging if it was uncented. Great Night Cream
