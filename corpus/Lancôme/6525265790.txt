I bought this bc I was seduced by the commercials and hype; however, for the size, it didn’t last long and I didn’t notice any real change. I use other great products, so I was thinking with this incorporated, I’d be ’wow’d“. I wasn’t; plus, I couldn’t put it on in the AM’s that I got ready and put on makeup bc of how sticky/thick it is. It makes for a TERRIBLE canvas for other products to go on afterwards....if I did use it and put on makeup, the makeup would be very greasy/shiny and look terrible.  I am sticking with lancome Gentifique, it’s what i’ve used in the past and it absorts like water into your face. Way better out there
