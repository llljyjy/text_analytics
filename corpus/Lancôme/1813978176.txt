I live in Denver, where it’s dry basically all year round  so I love a good moisturizing night cream to make sure I don’t wake up completely dehydrated and flaky. I’m already a fan of Lancome’s Genifique line - I use the Genifique Radiance Boosting face serum regularly during the day so this is a great addition for my night time routine. I do want to note that there is a strong fragrance for those who are sensitive to fragrances. I personally like the scent a lot but it may not be for everyone since it is quite strong. I highly recommend this product for waking up to a fresh, plump face! Very moisturizing!
