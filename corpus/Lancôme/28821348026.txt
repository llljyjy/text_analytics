I’m just so excited at how well this cream preformed.  The Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night cream is amazing.  This absolutely does not compare to any other product that I’ve ever tried first of all because it absolutely delivered. The visible improvements are undeniable my moisture barrier feel both moisturized and replenished. This is a great product to own because you can reuse the jar it is refillable you do not have to be wasteful especially if your “friendly“to the environment.  I would absolutely purchase when I’m out of it.  I’m just glad a lil bit goes a long way. Visible Improvement!
