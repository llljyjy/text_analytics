I love that this is a 3 in 1 multi tasking serum packed with hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide. It leaves your skin nice and hydrated. I can see an overall improvement in my skin, it’s brighter and more smooth. While I do prefer scent free skincare, the scent of this serum is not overwhelming. I’m looking forward to finishing the bottle to see the full results! nan
