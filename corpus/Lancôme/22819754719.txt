I received this product for free from Influenster and Lanc√¥me for my honest review. I have dry, red and sensitive skin that gets irritated easily. I used this product am & pm for 1 month. It worked great with my sensitive skin. I did notice a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and the redness in my skin subsided over the month. I also noticed that after applying the serum my skin felt instantly hydrated, plump and baby soft all day. It made my makeup apply like a dream. My foundation went on smooth, no dry flakey patches. I am definitely going to be purchasing as soon as I run out, hefty price tag or not. This is an amazing product! My NEW Holy Grail worth a try!
