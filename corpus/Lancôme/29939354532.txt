I tested out a ton of moisturizers in the store before settling on this one. I really like how it doesn’t leave me feeling greasy or sticky. It just leaves a nice soft feeling. The fragrance is extremely strong which takes off one star. And also when I opened the package it was at least half empty. I felt so confused by this. The tester one in the store had more product than my supposedly brand new one. For 50 dollars that was quite the disappointment. I’m keeping it because it does work good, but wow. Half empty. I’ve bought lancome products before and they were always filled to the top but this one was not. I’m debating on whether I should exchange it for a different container but the effort almost doesn’t feel worth it. Half empty when I opened it
