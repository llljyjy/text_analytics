I received this product in exchange for my review.  I cannot say it has been long enough to noticeably change my skin from the active ingredients, but so far I have been enjoying this light weight and lightly scented moisturizer.  It feels nice on my skin, not too sticky, but also feels moisturizing. Lightweight and Moisturizing
