Good product works an does the job helps with brightening an of course hyperpigmentation. However the dispenser on the bottle disperses two serums an one for the product mixture an that is messy an a little strange it does not mix the product equally. Beautiful color packaging. Does have a hydrating feel however it soaks in so you can apply other products it is a little thicker serum. If you love Lancôme you will love this hope they find better product dispense cause that’s a little annoying. Lancôme does it again
