I really enjoyed this cream it has a very thick texture but it up absorbs nicely with no stickiness. My skin feels very moisturized and hydrated when I use it. It leaves my skin with a very nice natural looking healthy glow. I have not been using it long enough to see any of the anti-aging benefits but I look forward to continued use as the cream ingredients seem very promising! Great moisturizer for dry skin!
