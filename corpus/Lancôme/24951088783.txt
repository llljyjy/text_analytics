I received the Lancôme Advanced Génifique Night Cream free for my honest review from Bzzagent. So far, I am really enjoying it and it has really added a ton of moisture back into my skin. I really like the texture of the cream although I do find it a little thick. However, that can be a benefit because a little goes a long way. I would not rick mend this for oily skin but I do think it is perfect for mature and dry skin.￼ Great Night Cream
