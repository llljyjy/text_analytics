I have to say, out of all the facial serums I have tried in the past, Lancõme has set the bar very high. This is my new all time favorite premature aging serum because of the unique ingredients inside. Hyaluronic acid, ferulic acid and vitamin C+ niacinamide all in one fancy bottle. The bottle is so luxurious and beautiful. I love that the design of the bottle has its own unique three chambers that allow all three ingredients to pump out the perfect amount separately in my hand. I have noticed sometimes the pump can jam up if you don’t keep it clean. Besides that little con in the design of the bottle, I really enjoyed trying this product. As advised on the packaging for my very first use, I made sure to turn the bottle upside down and shake it several times. Then hold the bottle horizontally and press down on the pump until all three formulas come out. I made sure to apply this serum on my entire face and neck, followed by a soothing moisturizer. Before using this serum, my face was dull, I had wrinkles starting to show more and I had a few dark spots on my face. After giving this “miracle“ serum a chance for over two weeks of using this day and night, I noticed big changes to my skin. My face looks healthier, feels smoother, and I can definitely notice my wrinkles fading away; as well as some dark spots. I am not sure if this was suppose to help clear up acne, but it did for me! I was very hesitant seeing so many 5 star reviews, that I thought it was too good to be true. I was definitely wrong. Yes, this Lancõme serum is more on the higher priced end of skincare products but it is worth all the hype. I feel more confident with how my skin looks and I also feel more comfortable going out in public with no makeup on. That is huge for me. Best anti-aging product on the market!
