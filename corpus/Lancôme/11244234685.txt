I understand why certain beauty & skincare products are cherished for decades, this is one of those for me. I was expecting little outcome when I purchased this years ago because of the price and the brand and the fragrance. But I’ll be the first to say that this is a glove of moisture before you actually apply moisturizer. It sinks into the skin quickly, plumps it up and makes your skin feel less tight and dry all season long. This is probably my 4th jumbo because 2 of them lasts me all year long whether it’s applying both day and night - don’t be fooled, this stuff lasts and lasts! 10/10 2 year love of my life
