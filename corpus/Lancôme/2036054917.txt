WOW! just WOW! I’m not usually easily impressed by skincare so I approached this cream with some healthy skepticism. I really liked the packaging and the smell but I wasn’t sold until I started using it on my face...and even though this on the pricier side of creams I’ve used...a little goes a long way! I found this Lancome Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer to be really great at hydrating my skin without feeling greasy or too much! My skin felt moisturized and it became a favorite part of my skincare routine--- it made me feel fancy and worth it! definitely recommend! Great hydration-- a little goes a long way!
