I really enjoy the Lancome Genifique Repair Youth Activating Night Cream. A little goes a long way and the container lasts for a few months. I definitely saw results a few nights of wearing it. Itâ€™s lightweight, it has no fragrance, it lessens my pores, and reduces my redness. I highly recommend trying this product. Thank you #bzzagent for this opportunity to try this night cream. Highly recommended night cream
