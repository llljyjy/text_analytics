This product is so impressive and great - I do not know where to begin. Being multifunctional and having 3 products that I would typically have to use individually makes things SO EASY. I use it in the morning and in the evening, and I can immediately tell the difference in the plumpness, hydration, and overall texture in my skin. After a few uses, I shared some of the product with my mom, and she immediately went and purchased it, it is that good. Great for both younger and older skin, doesnâ€™t cause breakouts, and is such a great comprehensive product. Fine lines have definitely become to be less noticeable.  It feels very nice going on and leaves my skin feeling softer and supple. It also absorbs well and has a light pleasant smell.  For what it is worth,  I received this product as a free sample but have already put a 2nd one in my online cart, ready for stock up/repurchase! Fully OBSESSED
