The serum smells really nice and slightly floral. This is not as harsh as u beauty, however, my skin started getting sensitive after using it several days in a row. I have seen some of my skin purge while using this. It’d be nice to know if you should really use this daily or several times weekly (not in the instructions). I’d also use sunblock, also not in the instructions, due to the vitamin c. nan
