I’m loving this night cream! I’m an avid participant in skin cycling and this soothing night cream is so great for days 3 and 4, the healing skin days of my routine. This moisturizer is superb for sensitive skin and excellent for moisture retention! Lightweight and soothing, softening and hydrating. A little goes a long way. Safe and smart for everyone’s night routines. I’d not only recommend this product, especially for aging skin friends, but I would absolutely purchase this product again for myself. Totally worth it! Excellent moisture retention!
