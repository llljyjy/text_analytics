At first glance it looks like it’s made of metal, it’s not, and is made of plastic. Which for a product of this price was a let down. I also found the dispensing action fiddly & frustrating and messy the 3 holes the serum is dispensed from becomes messy and the serum can slip down the bottle. The three chambers dispense a gel, cream and emulsion that easily mix together to have a slick fluid texture that is quickly absorbed by the skin. As you massage in the serum, the slight tacky feeling disappears as the serum is smoothed to leave skin feeling soft and nourished. There is a subtle natural fragrance that has a slight sweetness, but it’s not overpowering. Don't like the bottle design
