The feeling you get after applying to your face is....ahhhhh, so luxurious. My face and fingers really like this product. It doesn’t leave any lingering residue and it blends really well with foundation. Before I started using this, my face had noticeable bumps and dry spots due to neglect. Since I was working from home, I wasn’t using anything on my face other than face wash and it took a toll. It has been a solid 5 weeks of testing and so far the bumps are gone and my blemishes have improved—I can’t wait to see if there are further results in another month. It’s a hefty price but I would recommend it since the amount lasted this long and it still has more to give. Soooooo luxurious
