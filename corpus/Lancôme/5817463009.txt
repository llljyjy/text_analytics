This cream is lightweight and non-greasy while delivering lasting hydration to skin. As it soaks into the skin quicky like a serum, this product works really well as part of a longer and more in-depth night routine with more products on top, or shines as a night cream all on its own. There is a bit of a scent to the product but it does not linger after application. Great as part of a routine!
