I love the packaging with the cute chrome and purple gradient. It’s a pump but the fancy kind lol. I love that the three different products are separated until you pump it out and mix it in your hand. It smells amazing and it glides across the face. The first day I noticed a glow and a smoother appearance to my skin. My pores were smaller and my seborrheic dermatitis Breakout was going away. By the end of the 2 weeks my skin is so smooth in complexion and texture! My dark spots are vanishing and I haven’t had anymore seborrheic dermatitis issues on my face since using this. It’s worth the $135 for sure. I used it twice a day. I plan to keep using it. 1st picture: before using this Lancome product. 2nd picture: day 2 of using Lancome product. 3rd picture: day 16 of using Lamcome product. nan
