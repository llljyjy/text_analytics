It is a very nice moisturizer that I use mostly during like a nightmoisturizer not everyday one. Well I like how it feels on my skin and my skin has improved I wouldn’t say I would wear it all the time because I’m because it’s kind of heavy and especially for coming out of the Winter time. I say this would be really great for everyday we’re outside in the Winter time because it’s so heavy and it would be good for the wind and stuff and how it it feels on your skin. I think as an implies it’s a great night face Creme. It is not for going out use. I feel like my skin plumber. Expensive moisturized face
