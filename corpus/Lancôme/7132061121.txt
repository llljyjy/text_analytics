I have been having issues with redness in my face for years, and with a damaged moisture barrier for the last year. So i was excited to sample this night cream! After 3 weeks of using this at night my moisture barrier feels better and my redness is reduced! I attached pictures of before and after. In the before picture i was using an oil over my moisturizer at night, so my face is shiny. But with this night cream i dont need an oil, just the cream is enough! Its nice to have fewer steps. It has a very light unobtrusive fragrance. I love the dewy feeling my skin has in the mornings after using this, and the ling term effects in moisturize and redness. I didnâ€™t, however, notice any improvements on my fine lines or wrinkles. Dewy finish, helps with redness
