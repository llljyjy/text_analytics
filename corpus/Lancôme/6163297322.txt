I can feel the softness and my skin is looking very smooth and moisturized.  It does not leave a greasy look or feel.  Makeup is easy to apply on top without it getting “goopy“.  It has a light floral  scent so I would be careful if it competes with your regular perfume.  I It moisturizes without a greasy residue!
