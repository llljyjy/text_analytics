I wanted to hate this product because I know how pricey Lancome can get, but I ended up really loving this night cream. It works amazingly on its own as well as layered with other products. I used it for about 2 weeks on its own, and noticed my skin was less irritated and the texture had smoothed out. I then started to slowly integrate my other night time products back into my routine and my skin loves me for it. This cream has already replaced my other one. New Nightime Favorite!
