I received the Lancome Absolue Soft Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer in exchange for my honest review.  I have oily skin with large pores. I was looking for a hydrating cream that I could use at night to balance out my skin care routine. This cream worked well. Not only did it hydrate hut I have noticed that my hyperpigmentation due to the sun has lightened a bit (a few weeks). I am really picky about my moisturizers because my sensitive skin breaks out easily. I had no major breakouts because of the Absolue. It took care of my needs. The rose scent is a beautiful added bonus! Full hydration
