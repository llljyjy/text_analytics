This eye cream is excellent and I feel how the texture of the skin around my eyes changes and how it feels brighter and softer, it really moisturizes your skin and keeps it soft and smooth for a long time compared to other brands that I have used the ones that do not hydrate me and I do not perceive any change in my face, this product is not irritating and it is helping me to hide those crowâ€™s feet lines in the eye area. It has a heavy and creamy consistency so I choose to use it at night, but it is a personal choice, this product absorbs very quickly. I must say that despite the cost it is really worth buying and adding to your skin care list. Great Product
