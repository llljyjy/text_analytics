I was very excited to try this product as I love Lancôme, however it’s not my favorite.  I love that I get the ease of 3 products in one pump however the cost does not outweigh the lack of results.  I felt my skin looked somewhat brighter but the difference after 30 days was minimal.  The product may however take a few months of application to see discernible results. nan
