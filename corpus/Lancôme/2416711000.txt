This is a moisturizer which sad to say that I can take it or leave it. I had very high hopes for it since I love Lancôme’s products overall and the scent of this moisturizer is gorgeous as well as it’s glass jar design. However, it did not work well with my skin. My skin was left with a very sticky residue which took a long time to absorb, once absorbed, I would of liked to feel softer and more hydrated result. After using it a few weeks, I did not notice any huge changes in the condition of my skin. With that said, I am more on the neutral size with this moisturizer compared to others which I have used. nan
