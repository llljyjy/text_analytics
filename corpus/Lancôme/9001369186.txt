This formula dries out my skin. I do not use it daily. It has a strong scent. After applying, the scent last awhile.  The cream is not watery. It is thick. It does absorb well.  After applying the cream, it is smooth and leaves my skin soft. I have not seen any improvements. all it does is leaves my skin soft
