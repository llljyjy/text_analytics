I’ve been enjoying this night cream ! It smells so supple and soft. I love that it melts right into my skin and doesn’t just sit on top like other brands have. I can tell it’s made with quality ingredients and a brand that I can trust on my sensitive skin. I also love that it doesn’t deep into my eyes at night. Great to add to your skin care routine
