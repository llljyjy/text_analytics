This is a nice serum for hydrating your skin. I’m usually very sensitive to vitamin C but this one doesn’t sting my face. It’s a great combination of ingredients and my skin right now loves this. I use it daily in the morning. Absorbs very nicely and I follow it up with my sunscreen. This has fragrance in it and usually I’m sensitive to it but this one I can handle. Take a star off for the price!! nan
