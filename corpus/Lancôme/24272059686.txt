I have super dry/ flacky skin in winter, it is easy to break out if i use a wrong products. I tried alot of American and Korean, Japanese brands before foubd this Lancome. Thanks God! It has light rose smell, very light and will be gone in 10s. No alcohol and super hyfrating. I feel like it does help my following steps to be absorbed quick and full. Plus, the price is so nice compare to others. Supper recomand it! A star for dry-sensitive skin
