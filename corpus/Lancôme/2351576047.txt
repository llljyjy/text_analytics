This is a really lovely serum! Everything from the bottle design, to the size of the product, and to the amazing idea of combining three serums together is unique, different, and definitely makes the product stand out from others. The serum feels like heaven, it goes on and immediately sinks into your skin - no pilling, no tackiness, easily can be worn under makeup. My main issues with this product are the overabundance of fragrance - someone with sensitive skin should definitely steer clear. I also think that retail value is overpriced in comparison to items already on the market with similar ingredients. Innovative, Interesting, and Over Fragrant.
