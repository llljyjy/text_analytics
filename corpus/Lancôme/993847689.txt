This is like the fountain of youth in a jar! My skin is dull, dehydrated and aging, and within about 10 days of starting this I received more compliments on my skin then ever before. It smells amazing and is very rich (I prefer it at night) and hydrating while instantly plumping the skin and giving it a gorgeous glow. It did not irritate my reactive skin and wears beautifully under makeup. Will continue using, and highly recommend it to anyone with dryer, mature skin looking for a luxe and effective moisturizer. Minus 1 star because it is very expensive and cost prohibitive for most. Absolue Perfection for Mature Skin
