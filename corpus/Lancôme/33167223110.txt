I have a very dry skin. My skin absorbs oils and moisturizers very fast and I need to reapply them several times a day. Since I can’t reapply creams at night, my skin is usually dry when I wake up in the morning. That is not the case when I use this cream. I have been using this night cream for two weeks now and my skin feels hydrated and fresh when I wake up. I haven’t used it long enough to see that much difference in my fine lines but this is a very moisturizing cream and I really like it. It’s on the pricey side but a little goes a long way so you don’t need that much to cover your whole face. Very moisturizing
