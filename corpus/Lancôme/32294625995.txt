I’ve been using Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream for about two weeks. I have used other eye creams before. The product glides on nicely and hydrates the skin under the eye to create a nice appearance. I feel like it works as well as other less pricey creams. At under an ounce, $132 seems way too expensive. Although I’m happy with the results I don’t think I would purchase it. If it were half the price I’d consider it but there are other brands at lower price points that work as well. I didn’t notice a super dramatic difference to warrant the price. So although I recommend the product, I wouldn’t purchase it. When you look at the price, for example, it’s more expensive than gold! Come on now! I recommend it because it works as well as any other eye cream I’ve tried. Nice but pricey
