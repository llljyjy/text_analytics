Great product that speeds up my skincare routine with 3 products in 1.  Quick to absorb, not greasy, and smells nice without being too fragranced or overpowering.  Skin feels smoother and more hydrated.  I also like that I’m not guessing at how much product to use. I’ll definitely be replacing some of my individual serums in favor of this product.  Only removing a star because this is suggested to use twice daily but Vit C and retinol don’t mix well and I use my retinol at night - so this is only an AM product for me. nan
