I really like this serum. I appreciate that it combines different active ingredients to target multiple skin concerns. It layers well with my moisturizer and other products and absorbs well without pilling. It has a light fragrance that isn’t overbearing. One pump easily covers my whole face. I find it fun that each serum is a different color when dispensed, but my partner who works with wildlife says it looks like bird poop (which isn’t too far from the truth). The packaging is also sleek and attractive. nan
