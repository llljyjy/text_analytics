I am 43 years old and I have stopped wearing foundation, concealer and powder. I have always loved Lancôme products, I knew this serum would be no exception. I was not prepared to actually see visible results in just two weeks. I regularly use the active ingredients in my regular routine. No matter how I change my routine, I always include Vitamin C, Ferulic acid, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. So I was surprised to see a visible difference in two weeks use, I am constantly getting MORE comments on my skin. I get asked frequently if I have gotten Botox. Nope- just skincare. Obsessive skincare. I seriously don’t think I’ve seen results this quickly and I try a lot of skincare products.  I normally would not have considered a $135 price tag on a serum with simple ingredients that I already use, but this Lancôme Renergie HCF Triple serum is spectacular. Shocking results in two weeks use
