I received this product in exchange for my honest review. My skin is dry and sensitive, and sometime ingredients can cause irritation. Happily, this night cream hasn’t caused any problems at all! I’ve been applying it after my serum, and I wake up with soft, hydrated skin. However, in the depths of winter I suspect I’ll need something with more hydration. I’ve noticed the area around my nose is a little dry now that the weather’s turning cooler. But this is a great night cream for summer! Good for sensitive skin
