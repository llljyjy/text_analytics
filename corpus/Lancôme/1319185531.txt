I have been aware of the Lancome Genifique line for years, but have never had the chance to try the Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream. I’m approaching middle age, and along with the years come the need to treat my skin to more nourishing and protective products. The Advanced Repairing Night Cream was incredibly moisturizing. The Hyaluronic acid and Triple Ceramide complex would penetrates deep into my skin, making it supple and radiant the day after using. Every person needs to have a protective and nourishing  moisturizer like this going into their 40’s and beyond. nan
