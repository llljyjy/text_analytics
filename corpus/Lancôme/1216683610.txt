The first two times I used this, I didn’t read the instructions so didn’t realize that this would pump out three different products. And you’re supposed to mix it together. My first time, a white product came out. The next time a clear product. It’s a very hydrating serum. But it feels thick.  I don’t mind it though because the product smells great! A bit of a strong shampoo scent if you are sensitive to smells. But I enjoy it. I took off one star because the packaging is so bulky. It’s pretty to look at but would definitely hesitate to pack this in my travel case. I would repurchase this full priced because I felt that the product was so moisturizing and rich. Great product but read the instructions first!
