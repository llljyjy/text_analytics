After using this product for a few weeks, I’ve noticed some slight improvements in my skin’s overall appearance. My skin feels more supple and firm and the appearance of some fine lines around by my eyes and mouth appeared reduced. I like that this product combines multiple serums into one. It is fragranced which I personally don’t mind but know that others can be sensitive to smells in facial products. The serums easily combine and absorb into skin without feeling sticky. I highly recommend this luxury skincare product. nan
