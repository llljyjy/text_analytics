I am so impressed with the Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream it’s just really hard to put into words. It is truly luxurious and almost feels like a mix between a cream with a slight bit of a gel feel as well. It’s sinks in beautifully and the hydration is truly, truly incredible/noticeable. Almost as if it melts into your skin. I’m a fan for life and so thankful to have this in my life! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Truly Luxurious and Hydrating!
