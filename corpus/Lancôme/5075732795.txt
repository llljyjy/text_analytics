Very happy with the results! But my like for this started from the moment I opened the package. Just gorgeous packaging. The concept of mixing all three serums is brilliant and definitely helps reduce the time needed for my routine. The serum soaks in quickly not leaving my skin greasy like many others have before. After using this for 2 weeks, I’ve noticed an improvement in my skin. It’s brighter, tighter, smooth & hydrated. Triple Serum = Great Results
