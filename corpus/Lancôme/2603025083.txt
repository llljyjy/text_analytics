Beginning with the packaging. I still believe this brand has one of the nicest packaging on the market. Glass and the beautiful logo on the black jar is very classy. This cream is wonderful for my skin type! I’m noticing more lines, uneven tone, and age spots. I replaced my regular night moisturizer with this and I really like it. It has a light fragrance, but nothing overpowering. A white, thicker cream, perfect for repairing skin while we sleep. I am waking up to brighter, healthier looking skin. I’m using in combination with the It Cosmetics Hello Results oil and its perfect. It’s non-greasy and absorbs nicely into the skin with a small amount of massaging. My skin drinks it up. It pumps, hydrates and protects my more delicate skin barrier. It’s definitely a keeper. I even used it around my eyes with great results and zero irritation. Just a great night cream that I would purchase again. I did receive this complimentary of BZZAGENT, but it in NO way influenced my honest review. Great night cream
