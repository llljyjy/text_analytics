Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream is an excellent add to your routine. The cream leaves your skin noticeably plumper and adds radiance. I use it as the last layer in my routine to really lock in moisture. The cream is decadent. It is thick without being too rich. It is easily applied, spreads delightfully, and doesn’t feel heavy or tacky. I don’t experience pilling of other products with this cream. The smell is light, citrusy, and floral. It quickly dissipates. I highly recommend this product. nan
