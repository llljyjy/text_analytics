After about a month of use, I haven’t noticed any changes in dark spots. However, I’m still very satisfied with the product! I can definetly see the glow after use, and there’s noticeable improvements in my skin. I do wish the pumping system worked a little better, sometimes it felt like it the product got a little stuck. Still very much recommend! Glowing, but what about dark spots?
