I have tried so many moisturizers over the years that have made amazing promises of transforming my skin.  Sadly, none of them ever really lived up to the hype.  That is until I tried Lancôme Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer.   This moisturizer is amazing!  It smells amazing and it’s texture is just the right amount of thickness.  It goes on the skin so smooth and keeps my face moisturized for a full 24 hours.  I have never had a moisturizer that lasted that long.  The texture of my skin has improved 100%.  It is so soft and I have zero dry spots.  Even though it is highly hydrating, it never clogged my pores or caused any breakouts.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!  Buy it, you won’t regret it! The Best Moisturizer I Have Ever Used!
