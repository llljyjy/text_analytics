I’ve been using Lancôme Absolue for about two weeks now, and I’m fairly impressed with the results thus far. First thing I notice about facial products is the smell. Being someone who has migraines and very sensitive to smells which can trigger migraines, I was worried this product might smell too rosy. I was actually impressed that the smell, while there, was not overpowering at all and you really don’t smell it at all after application – that is a plus in my book. Having only used the product for two weeks, I haven’t noticed some of the results that other have or results the product claims to help with. However what I have noticed is the puffiness under my eyes seems less in the morning and any puffiness I do have in the morning appears to goes away much faster than before using this product. My under eyes definitely look and feel more hydrated. It also works really well with my other face products and is not too thick.   Couple of side notes about the product: 1. Beautiful packaging and jar! 2. I didn’t get a set of instructions in the packaging, so I found I needed to go online to read about how to apply. 3. The opening of the jar is kind of small, and I had to start using the tip of my nail to get the product out once the level went down. I wish it came with an applicator or was a flatter jar, so I could continue to use the pad of my finger to get the product. 4. This product seems like it could last a long time, given the amount you use each time, so the price tag of Absolue doesn’t seem so bad. I’m looking forward to more results as I continue to use the product. Quite Impressed
