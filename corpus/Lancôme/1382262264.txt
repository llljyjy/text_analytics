I’m in my mid-40s, have normal-combo skin, and my concerns are hydration, plumping, and texture. I’ve always liked Lancome products and this one I found to be dependable as well. I’ve been using it for a few weeks as part of my AM and PM routines in place of my regular serum and before applying moisturizer. The three formulas are noticeable due to their appearance: one being white, one being transparent, and one being cloudy (in-between). Upon application, it glides and absorbs into the skin quickly without any oiliness and has a subtle, pleasant scent. It seems to leave a slight tackiness to the skin, but that went away after applying moisturizer. I did immediately notice that my skin felt bouncier and plumper. I have a faint dark spot under one eye which doesn’t seem to be as noticeable. I definitely will keep using this product until it’s finished to see the long-term use results. The bottle’s unique shape makes it easy to grip, and the pump releases a conservative amount, which is why two pumps are necessary per application. I did take quite a few uses before I noticed the third formula. Bouncy and Plump
