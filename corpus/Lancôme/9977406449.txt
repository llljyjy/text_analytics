I received this serum for free from Influenster and Lancôme for my honest review.I’m actually looking for a good serum so I’m super happy when open this time #voxbox. After 2 weeks nights of using, I can feel my skin is changed positively. The bottle is designed to fit into your hands and is attractive to look at. The three formulas are noticeable due to their appearance: one being white, one being transparent, and one being cloudy (in-between). Upon application, it glides and absorbs into the skin quickly without any oiliness and has a subtle, pleasant scent. With a full size sample like this, it’ll be easier for me to test and feel correctly. Thanks #influenster and #lancome. My 1st love with Lancome
