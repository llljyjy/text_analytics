After using this product I noticed my skin felt nourished and supple. It went on smoothly and was not sticky or tacky feeling, but still provided ample moisture. I didn’t love the scent but it wasn’t too overpowering to where it really bothered me. Really enjoyed this product! Nourishing night cream
