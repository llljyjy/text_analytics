I was so happy to get the Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum, I have tried Lancôme products before and liked them. The serum came out clear at first, but once I shook the bottle it is more like a watery cream. The scent is light and fresh and the serum feels cool on my skin. My skin soaked it up.I have normal to dry skin. It is moisturizing for a serum. I like that it is a 3 in 1 (HCF). It has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Ferulic Acid which I use separately usually, I mean I have separate bottles of each, and I did experience a brighter complexion using it like this all at once. I would need to use it longer for any lasting results, but for these couple of weeks it has been good and I have used it day and night skipping a couple of days for other treatments.I would recommend this serum, it is actually really nice and I am keeping it in my daily skincare routine.
