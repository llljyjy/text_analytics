I absolutely love how this serum takes the guesswork out of mixing different products and cuts down on my skincare routine. My skin was instantly plumper from the HA and after about one week I noticed a more even skin tone. For me this one did feel a little greasy and I woke up in the morning with oily skin so I only use this in the evenings rather then both morning and night. Make sure to follow directions when dispensing the serum or all three wonâ€™t come out, storing it upside down also helps with this issue. nan
