This product really hydrated my skin, I was a little hesitant because it was an oil, but it did make my skin more youthful looking. The oil is light weight and little bit goes a long way too. It’s packaging is a light weight plastic and stands upright on the counter, it also has a light rose petal smell to it, that’s not too overwhelming. Good for hydration
