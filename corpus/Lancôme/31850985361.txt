If you don’t mind scented products, this formula is great for an evening cream. It doesn’t leave my skin tacky and melts easily, leaving my face plump and smooth in the mornings. The only thing I dislike about this product is the scent–other reviews have described it as floral but it honestly smells like a citrusy floor cleaner. It was jarring at first but you get used to it. If it were unscented, I would have given this 5 stars. Love the formula, meh about scent
