This serum is AMAZING! I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this serum hydrated, smoothed, and reduced the appearance of some fine lines popping up. Not only does it work it has a very pleasing smell, it doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feel, and I love that three separate serums come out and you mix it in your hands! The pump gives just the right amount so you feel like you have just the right amount of serum without using too much! HYDRATING,Smoothing, and great for sensitive skin!
