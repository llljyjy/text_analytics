Lancome is an amazing brand. I have never tried a bad product from them. Although I love the HCF Triple Serum, it doesnt wow me to the point of repurchasing. This is an expensive product that included ingredients that you can get for less money. Almost every brand sells a Hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, ferulic acid and a Niacinamide. Technically you could buy each of these serums and create your own version of this serum as a skincare cocktail and likely get the same results. (Not mixing the ingredients, but layers the serums in your skincare routine). Dont get me wrong, this is a beautiful skin. My skin looks plump and smooth and hydrated! I love it! But not the crazy price. Beautiful Serum, Not so Beautiful Price
