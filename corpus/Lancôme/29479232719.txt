I’ve been using this product for the last 3 weeks and it has really improved the texture and appearance of my skin.  My pores seem smaller and my face is smoother and brighter.  Normally in the winter I need a heavy duty cream to moisturize, after about a week of using this, I noticed that I only need a light moisturizer.  The packaging is pretty, although I do wish you could see how much is left or used.  I hate to find out that I’m out of a product just when I need it most! The serum has a light scent that doesn’t stay on the skin. It’s a bit pricey, but truly worth it. this transformed my skin!
