I have been using this product for approximately a month now, and I really like it so far! I love that it combines three different ingredients to provide the most beneficial mix for healthy, beautiful skin. I havenâ€™t noticed any difference in my fine lines since starting, but it has left me with noticeably plumper, glowing skin. It is also super hydrating as well, and I have been using it in the mornings for an extra boost of moisture . My only complaint is the packaging. While the bottle is beautiful, it took a couple weeks of daily use before product started coming out of the third hole (despite following the directions). nan
