Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream is a god send. I have combination skin and had been struggling with dry patches on my face. No matter how much water and moisturizer I would use nothing was helping and with my upcoming wedding, I needed something fast. Enter Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream! I was concerned about using something outside my routine so close to the wedding, but I took a chance and boy am I glad I did. My dry patches healed and my face was radiant and glowing on my wedding day. I applied a thick layer at night before bed and rinsed in the morning. I used a smaller lighter amount in the mornings for 2 weeks. I would highly recommend this product! Must have!!
