I really like this Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum. It has three different formulas that dispense together but from separate chambers. This packaging makes for a unique serum. One serum containing Hyaluronic Acid boosts hydration and plumps. The other serum contains C+Niacinamide which offers anti-aging benefits and the third treats hyperpigmentation with Ferulic Acid. The final serum makes for a powerful skincare product that does it all. I love the way it feels on my skin. Upon application it makes my skin feel silky and gives it shine because of it has an oil finish. I only use this in the evening due to my combination skin. I could do without the scent but it doesn’t bother me either. My skin has definitely softened and looks more plump since I began using this and can tell further results are coming. This is definitely worth a try. nan
