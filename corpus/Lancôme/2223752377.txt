This serum is amazing! It is basically 3 products in one.  It’s very hydrating and made my skin feel smooth and look “glowy”.  I don’t normally purchase Lancôme skincare products but I will definitely be purchasing this one again.  I used it with my Skin Medica TNS serum and had no bad interactions. Best all in one serum
