I’ve tried the Lancôme Renergie H.C.F Triple serum for about 2 weeks and it’s really great my combination skin. It contains three different serums in one bottle. Hyaluronic Acid in creamy formula makes my skin moisturized. Vit C ➕ Niacinamide in emulsion formula make my skin brighter. Ferulic in clear gel formula is a great  antioxidant. I simplify my skin routine to this one bottle and it do works amazing. My skin looks  bright and smooth. nan
