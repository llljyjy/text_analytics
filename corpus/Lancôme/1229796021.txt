I LOVE THIS. This is one of the best (if not THE best) vitamin C serums I’ve ever used and I’ve tried quite a few. Before using this, I used the Drunk Elephant one which is pretty good but this is better. This one has hyaluronic acid, vitamin C+niacinamide, and ferulic acid so it’s comparable to the Skinceuticals version. For reference, I have very thin, reactive skin, still struggle with acne scars and have rosacea/redness. The DE was good for my skin but my skin really loves the Renergie HCF triple serum! It’s calmed down some of my redness, doesn’t sting or dry out my skin, and my skin just looks better. It also smells good unlike most vitamin C serums out there. It has a very light rose scent that I like. In addition to all of this, it’s really cool to use. This is a pump bottle (so the vitamin C won’t oxidize as quickly) and it’s separated into three sections so that when you pump it out, the the components pump out together. Just rub your hands together to mix and apply.I’m so thankful I received this for free. The only downside is the price tag but I will say I see why it’s priced $135. This really is a case of you get what you pay for so I’ll be setting some money aside to buy a bottle when I finish my free bottle and the DE serum I bought before. A must buy
