I have used this product for 2 weeks now. PROS: -You can definitely feel Immediate hydration once applied-You can also still feel the hydration the following morning, as you wash your face and get ready for the day-Texture feels decadent and soft - feels super moisturizing without feeling sticky at allCONS:-If your skin is at all sensitive this is not for you as there is a heavy scent/perfume. I like the scent and do not mind it but people that have reactions to these types of additives might not react well to the product-The price. A very hefty price tag for a moisturizing product compared to other more afforable ones in the marketIf Money is not an issue for you though, I do recommend trying this product. Feels great on skin! Good Product But Very Price
