I received this product for free from Influenster and Lancome in exchange for my honest review. This is probably one of the best serums I have ever used. No wonder it won an award. I apply this in my AM and PM routine. The texture is on a thicker formula, like a moisturizer but it feels lightweight on my skin. It has a slight scent that doesnâ€™t linger for long. I noticed that my skin is firmer, brighter and more plumped since I started using this product. My fine lines are now less noticeable. The improvement it did on my skin is remarkable in just 2 weeks of using it. I highly recommend this serum. The best serum ever!
