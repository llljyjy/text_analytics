I live in New England so my skin is super dry and my fine lines are so much more noticeable in the winter time. Going from the arctic weather outside to the dry heat inside has been absolutely killer on my skin. I have tried so many different facial creams and moisturizers, both expensive and inexpensive and I have never found the “right” product for my skin. The Lancôme Renergie triple serum is AMAZING. It is such a great texture and not sticky at all. I love that all 3 products are separated and I can tell that they do so much for my dry skin than other products that are already combined. My skin feels and looks so much softer and moisturized and my fine lines are less noticeable. I’m excited to continue using this product to see how much better my skin continues to get! nan
