I have oily skin so I am always worried about a product being too thick and greasy. This product has a nice creamy texture. I like it to use it at night with no makeup on. Itâ€™s very hydrating. Makes skin in eye area feel smooth. I would recommend it. If person has drier skin then its also good in morning under makeup nan
