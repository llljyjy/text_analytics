I have recently started trying Lancome products as part of my beauty routine and I must say I love this one. The scent is so soothing and my skin feels really soft an supple. I do see some difference in the skin texture in terms of ageing but will comment on that post long term use. But I love the fact that this works perfectly for combination type skin as well and like most moisturizers I did not experience any breakouts. So far m loving this cream and I use it as part of my night time routine. Love this cream
