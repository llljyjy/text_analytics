I was deciding between this and the Ren beauty shot serum, which I had a sample of and absolutely loved. In the end I decided to give this product a chance. While it did not make my skin too oily, I did not see much of a difference in texture and firmness. Iâ€™ve finished the bottle now and will be going back to Ren! nan
