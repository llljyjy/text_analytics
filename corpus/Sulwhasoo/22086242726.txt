This cream feels very lush, hydrating, but not too heavy. The texture of this cream is a dream- it applies smoothly, soaks into the skin in seconds and leave the skin looking healthy and radiant all day long. I love this especially underneath my makeup- it protects my skin all day long and it doesnâ€™t get as dry as usual after wearing a full face of makeup all day. nan
