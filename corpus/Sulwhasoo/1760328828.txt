Complimentary from Sulwhasoo for my opinion. This cream is amazing! My skin feels hydrated and looks radiant. The scent is fairly strong so I would be aware of this if youâ€™re someone who is sensitive to smells. The cream itself is fairly lightweight and perfect for summer. Giving it 4 stars only because of the price. nan
