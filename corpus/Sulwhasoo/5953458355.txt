Sulwhasoo products never let me down, and this firming cream is no exception to that rule. This cream is whipped and dense in texture. It applies to my skin like a hydrating mask. I prefer using it at night so that I can allow it to fully absorb while I sleep. I wake up in the morning and my skin feels like silk. So soft and plump! Iâ€™m so impressed with this cream so far.
