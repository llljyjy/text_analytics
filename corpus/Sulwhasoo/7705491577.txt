I received this product as a sample with my order. I’ve been wanting to try this brand’s skincare items for a long time, so I was excited to use the sample. But oh boy, the smell was something else! It smelled like ginger mixed with chemicals. It was a very thick/heavy cream. Not very watery, as I like my products to be. Since I only used it once, I couldn’t tell if it did anything for me. Smelly!
