This is my 1st time trying a high end (over $200) moisturizer / cream; it’s definitely an amazing experience. My skin age group / skin type: over age 45, mature, very dry, hyperpigmentation skin type; I would definitely recommend -if you can fit this in your skincare budget. I’d like to share, it does have an evident fragrance (which I do love). The texture is lightweight, creamy, & absorbs almost immediately. My skin looks apparently radiant & feels exceptionally moisturizing. It’s wonderful!* gifted by Sulwhasoo sample size. So wonderful!!
