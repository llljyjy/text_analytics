This product has a herbal scent. It has a medium thick consistency that sinks into my skin. The serum doesn’t feel heavy and absorbs quickly. It comes in a pump bottle for easy use. It helps my moisturizing products to absorb better. I didn’t notice a significant difference in hydration or brightness to my skin, but perhaps I need to use it longer to see any effects. nan
