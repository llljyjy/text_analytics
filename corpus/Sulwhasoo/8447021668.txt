First of all I really love the packaging - pump is so hygenic. The texture of this serum is very lightweight and cery fast absorbing. Thereâ€™s also very light, citrusy scent to it.After using this my skin immediately feels more hydrated and firm. Serum leaves very minimum amount of tackiness, which really helps for my foundation to stay for longer. Great serum !
