Item was Gifted by Sulwhasso. This moisturizer was great. Left my skin feeling hydrated all day, which was great with this cooler weather. I didn’t feel like I had to reapply. Face was also smoother and more supple. I am also normally very sensitive to new products, but I didn’t have an issue with this. nan
