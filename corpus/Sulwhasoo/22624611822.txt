I recived Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng renewing cream complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange of my opinion on this. It came in small 5ml tub so I cannot speak much about long term results. I have been using this for a week now and I still have a little left....may be used once or twice. So it can be easily figured out a little bit goes a long way. The texture of this cream is soft and easily spreadable. It get absorbed into the skin very well leaving it look fresh and moisturized. I definitely feel my skin has become smooth and even toned since my first usage. It looks healthy and glows. I can also see my dry spots reducing.( Yes I have dry skin which often gets dry flaky spots ).It does have a little fragrance but I liked it. It does not linger on for long. But might be an issue for those who are sensitive to fragrances. I am quite impressed with the results it has delivered within a week of usage. .The only con i could feel is it is exorbitantly priced. How i wish it was a little more reasonably priced ,I wouldnâ€™t have given a second thought before purchasing it. Amazing product but pricey
