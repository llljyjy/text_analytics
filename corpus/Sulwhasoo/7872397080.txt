I’ve been using the firming cream for about a week, and I definitely like it. It’s very hydrating without leaving my skin looking oily and it seems to be making a difference in the firmness of my skin. However, I would prefer if it was fragrance free! Other than that it’s a great product to add to your routine. nan
