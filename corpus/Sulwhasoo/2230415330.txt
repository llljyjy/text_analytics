I received this product for free, complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review.The serum feels like a toner, texture-wise, as it is thin and easy to apply because of the thin formulation. It has a light herbal scent and absorbs well into the skin. The serum leaves my skin feeling dewy, soft, and refreshed. What I liked most is the soft glow that my skin has after using the product. It is also very light weight and does not make your skin feel clogged or congested. After using this serum consistently, I feel that my skin has more elasticity as well and in time, more firm. Perfect light serum!
