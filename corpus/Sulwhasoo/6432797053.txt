I was skeptical at first, I usually use caudalie oil makeup remover but this was recommended to me and you canâ€™t beat the price of the small one ($13) this was so easy to use, and so quick, plus removed all makeup including the undereye eyeliner. this is my new go to make-up remover, plus leaves skin feeling so soft you need this secret weapon
