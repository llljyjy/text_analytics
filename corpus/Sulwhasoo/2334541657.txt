When I received the product, I was not impressed with how big it was. I was under the impression that it would be a full sized product since it was gifted by Sulwhasoo. However, it was smaller than even a travel size product , in my opinion. That aside, overall, the product is okay. I like the texture of it and that’s probably about it. I didn’t see a difference much in my skin and it’s hard to really keep using the product since it’s not a big container. I’m not sure if it does come in a bigger size, but as of right now, I’m indifferent. My skin looks and feels the same before I started using it. nan
