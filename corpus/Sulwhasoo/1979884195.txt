It is a rich moisturizer which is something I enjoyed. It does have sort of an odd scent which I did not love and it lingered throughout the day. I was given the smaller size so I can’t claim anything on the anti aging portion because it was not big enough for me to speak on, it ran out before 1 week. I would recommend it if you are looking for a richer moisturizer and aren’t sensitive to scents it does feel nourishing. nan
