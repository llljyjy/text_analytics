I love how this serum feels!! As soon as I applied it after washing my face, I can feel my skin being hydrated immediately. It’s like my skin drinks it up! The texture of the serum isn’t oily and feels very silky. After using it for 5 days (applied after washing each day), I can feel more bounce in my skin. It’s definitely very hydrating and leaves my skin feeling super soft! This product was gifted by Sulwhasoo but I’m truly impressed! I love this serum!
