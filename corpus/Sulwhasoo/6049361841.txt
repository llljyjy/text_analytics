Iâ€™ve been using Sulwhasoo products for many years, this moisturizer I believe was reformulated, I bought the original years ago and liked it but not enough to repurchase..fast forward to several weeks ago when I was happy to see this was available in a newer packaging trial size. I LOVE IT. I use it all over my face and my neck and I do notice my skin looks a little firmer and my complexion looks beautiful and refreshed. Definitely would repurchase and get the larger jar. Sulwhasoo is a little slept on, their moisturizers are incredible and this is my new favorite love
