I feel like I’ve just gone to a spa when I use this kit. I adore the scent, it’s so soothing. The cleanser is gentle and non stripping. My favorite product has to be the activating serum. Sometimes if I’m in a rush I will only use that and my skin feels so soft and supple afterwards. The balancing water is pretty interesting. It’s thick so you don’t have to worry about losing any when getting the product out of the bottle. The renewing cream is very moisturizing and leaves my skin looking so healthy and balanced. Overall I am really impressed with this kit and am enjoying using it. A spa in a bottle
