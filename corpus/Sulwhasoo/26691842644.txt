I received Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream Deluxe Sample size 5mL gifted by Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review..  It has a nice packaging, looks fancy.. The cream is a little thick, rich and creamy.. It feels good on skin.. It is like creamy butter that melts when it touches the skin and leaving your skin soft and hydrated.. It feels luxurious.. The smell, Im thinking like it smells like grass or kinda like that or maybe ginseng.. It’s not appealing for me and my liking.. It bothers me and I really dont like it.. This sample size cream is good for 5 days.. No irritation while using the product and it provides instant hydration.. I didn’t noticed any changes or results on my skin for 5 days aside from being hydrated.. Makes my skin hydrated..
