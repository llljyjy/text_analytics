This is the perfect kit if you’re wanting to try Sulwhasoo. The Activating Serum has been a favorite of mine for a long time now— since the moment it was released! It’s such a lightweight consistency that immediately absorbs into the skin making it feel open and ready for other skincare to be absorbed. The Balancing Water feels so refreshing and moisturizing. It has such a nice energizing scent too! I love how luxurious the cleansing foam is. It really helped make my skin feel clean and eliminate my mascara. If you love silky creamy hydrating creams then you’ll really love the Ginseng renewing cream because it’s super hydrating. I absolutely adore this kit and bunch of products and highly recommend it. Luxurious and hydrating
