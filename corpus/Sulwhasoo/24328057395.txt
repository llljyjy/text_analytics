Beautiful packaging. Easy to open. Easy to travel in my skincare bag. Just put the stopper back on it so in the case of the pump applicator getting pushed it doesn’t come out. One pump is all I needed. Doesn’t have a thick or heavy feeling to it. Foams and lathers up satisfactorily. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. Noticed a difference in my acne within a few days of using it twice a day. After the first full week of use, I noticed a BIG difference in my acne and face in general! This cleared up most of my stubborn acne. Love it!
