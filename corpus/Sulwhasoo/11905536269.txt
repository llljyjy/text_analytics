I was able to try the mini in this cream. It’s about the size of my cat’s paws. It has a whipped texture that I really like because a little goes a long way, even for such a tiny little jar. It does give adequate hydration but I’m not sure it’s worth the price tag. There are other creams I’ve tried for cheaper that gave me a softer and brighter appearance. *Gifted by Sulwhasoo Whipped and Airy Cream
