I liked that this serum is thin and easily applies. It felt immediately hydrating. It made my moisturizer glide right over my skin and I never experienced any pilling of product. It has a light, gingery scent that is identical to the cream in the same line. I’m not sure what ginseng smells like, so maybe it’s the ginseng. I think these would feel very luxurious when used together. I’m interested in seeing how well this continues to hydrate as the weather gets cooler and my skin gets drier. Hydrating Serum
