The brand gifted me this product in exchange for my honest review. Having used the Sulwahsoo serum and having restocked it more than a couple times, I was excited for this cream! And while it did hydrate my skin and make my skin feel softer instantly after application, I saw no real life changing differences the next morning. It did have a nice texture specially for the summertime, but I did not feel like anything about this product was life altering. I also think it’s too soon to tell (I’ve only been using it for about a week) if there are any long lasting effects like firmer, younger looking skin. Personally, as someone who has been into skincare for years, I think the price point is a little steep for the quality of product and the effects the product provides- and so I might pass on purchasing this one. However, as a brand loyalist, I will give it a try for longer and maybe this is one of those situations where slow and steady wins the race! Not worth the price point...
