This product is so beautiful and feels so nice on the skin. It leaves my skin feeling so moisturized and clean. It smells super neutral without any strong scent. It doesnâ€™t pill under my makeup. However it is SO SO SO SMALL. I have never seen any cream this tiny. It will last about a week. I do not reccomend spending this money on something so small So so small
