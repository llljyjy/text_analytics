This felt very nice on my skin after a 6 hour airplane ride. It has a light smell like an herb or a root, so if you want products that are 100% fragrance free, I would skip this. I have combo skin and it definitely didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. I think it would also work for oily skin, but you probably need an additional product if you have dry skin. Given the price, I personally wouldn’t buy this. I would want immediate results for that price, and I am on a tight budget. Sunscreen and having proper eyeglasses is key so you don’t squint and make more wrinkles! nan
