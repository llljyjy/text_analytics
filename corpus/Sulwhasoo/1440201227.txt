Packaging is very cheap and the pump fell apart before I put it together, so have to pour out of the cap which is not ideal and I get too much often. It’s a nice cleansing oil and for the face, it does wonderfully, but not strong enough to get all the eye makeup off - and I don’t even use water proof! nan
