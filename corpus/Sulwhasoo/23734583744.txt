This moisturizer is a true game changer in so many ways. I love the silky light texture that absorbs instantly by my skin. It’s nourishing but not overly heavy, leaving my skin looking plump and radiant after each ues. I have been struggling with sleeping problem for years now, and this instantly helps to de-puff when used at night, it’s also appropriate for all skin types. nan
