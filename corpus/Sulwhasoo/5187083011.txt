So far it’s been great. I really like this product. Before this product, I was using Tatcha for 3 years, but I noticed in the past couple of months it would cause my face to get dry. Sulwhasoo does not and I love that it’s a lot more creamier? It does a really good job taking all my makeup off So far so good
