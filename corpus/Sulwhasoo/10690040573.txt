I received this Bestsellerâ€™s Trial Kit complimentary from Sulwhasoo. This is the perfect set to try out these wonderful products and the size is perfect for traveling. The set has every step in your skincare routine. It starts with the gentle cleansing foam that leaves my skin hydrated, soft and balanced. Then I follow with the First Care Activating Serum by applying it to my damp skin and tapping it gently into my skin. It leaves my skin hydrated and nourished. The Essential Balancing Water makes my skin feel silky smooth, refreshed and radiant looking. The Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream is the final step in this routine and this anti-aging cream makes my skin look firmer, smoother and hydrated. All these products together keep my skin hydrated, nourished and looking healthy and radiant. I highly recommend this set! A great set
