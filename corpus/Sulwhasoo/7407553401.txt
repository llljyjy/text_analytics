The cream itself is okay, but I don’t trust the company. They asked to send me a full size product in exchange for my review, but they sent me a little tiny sample size product. At this price point, just buy a different brand of cream. It’s moisturizing, sure, but so is the stuff that costs 1/2 as much or less. And in my opinion, other creams are much better. Skip it
