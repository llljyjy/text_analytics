Been a long time fan of the Sulwhasoo line and this cream is the creme de la creme. Yes, it’s pricey but the ingredients in it are powerful and effective. It makes my skin so soft and supple, I notice a difference when I stop using it (and obviously a huge difference when I do use it)! It smells like ginseng which is their star ingredient from this brand (it’s a Korean herb) and it’s where this ingredient provides antioxidants and anti-aging powers. I personally like the ginseng smell, it does dissipate after application. The texture is very velvety, Will be my long time splurge item. Is the price worth it? That will be up to you to decide, not everyone can spend almost $300 on a face cream but my stars are based on quality, effectiveness and ingredients. A deluxe sample was gifted by Sulwhasoo for my review. My splurge item, pricey but you decide
