I received this to review and was so excited to try a new k beauty brand. The face wash is luxurious and works into a nice larger. It easily removed my mascara and didn’t irritate my eyes at all. My face felt clean and hydrated after using this and it’s helped keep my skin clear and smooth for my wedding day. Love it
