What I love most about this crème is how glowy and hydrated and smooth my skin looks after application. It really is one of those products that emphasizes the care in skincare. The consistency is thick, but not greasy, and leaves your skin glowing. My biggest gripe with this product is the price, although it is a great product so it all depends on what you’re looking for! Suppppppple!
