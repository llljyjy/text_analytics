This is worth the $$$ it takes off all my makeup up, sunscreen, waterproof mascara. I use this first and then rinse my face with water and it just melts everything away so smoothly. After I use a face cleanser to wash off the extra residue and my skin has no makeup left. It is pricey but worth the money I have used other oil cleansers but they didn’t work as well after double cleansing I would always have to go back with a cotton pad and makeup remover to take off anything that wasn’t removed. BUT with this product you do not need to do that. It does have a slight scent so if you’re not into scented skincare it may bug you. I usually don’t care to have fragrance in my skincare however this scent is aromatic. What I recommend is when you pump the oil in your hands rub it in and then take your hands and just inhale the scent for a few seconds and breathe in deeply. It sounds weird but it honestly just relaxes you. Perfect for the end of the day after all the stress you may have it just sets the mood for your skin care routine and grounds you. I’m telling you it’s a game changer! Inhale it for a few seconds and then go in and rub it on your face and let it do it’s magic. game changer
