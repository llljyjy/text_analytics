This product was gifted by Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review. I have seen this brand in k-beauty skincare shops, with beautiful packaging in gift sets. I have been curious as to how effective this brand is. The product that I tested, Essential Comfort Firming Cream, promises to tighten and firm the look of skin. It has a special blend of goji berries (anti-oxidants), black beans, and arrowroot that is supposed to be hydrating and help smooth skin. My thoughts:When I applied this cream, I noticed that the cream is very rich (and can feel heavy for some people). Although this is intended for all skin types, those with dry skin would benefit the most. The texture is creamy and somewhat silky. After applying before bed, I didn’t notice anything special but the next morning is when I notice the impact and effectiveness of the cream. While washing and rinsing my face the next morning, I can feel how soft and smooth my face felt! After using for about a week, I noticed my face felt more hydrated.  It doesn’t look like my face is any firmer, but that change may be more gradual and require longer term use. There is a very subtle scent which I can’t quite place. It may be from the ingredients rather than an added fragrance. This is a great skincare product, especially if you have dry skin. I’d love to use this cream together with other products in this line. Smooth!
