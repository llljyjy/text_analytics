I received this product for free in exchange for a review. The company generously sent me a teaspoon of product so that in my review I could speak to the results after “consistent use.” I will not ever be purchasing from this company because they contractually bind people like me who review products online into posting a skincare product review after only ~3 uses. To me, it’s unethical and feels like they’re just trying to increase their review count. So, the product is fine but not great considering the extreme price. It feels nice and smoothing right after application, but my skin feels dry again after an hour. I can’t speak to any firming or long term properties because I was only able to use it for a few days. I would not purchase from this brand in the future. nan
