This cream was gifted by Sulwhasoo in exchange for my review. Though I’m in my late 20s, I’ve noticed some fine lines around my forehead and mouth, so I’ve focused my skincare towards preventative anti-aging. Sulwhasoo’s Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream is rich and moisturizing but absorbs easily, great for a night cream but perhaps a little heavy for my sensitive acne prone skin in the daytime. It’s lightly scented with a luxurious herbal scent and so far I haven’t experienced any irritation while using this. I haven’t seen much improvement in anti-aging in the short time I’ve been using it, but the moisturizing effect does lessen the appearance of fine lines. Luxurious cream
