Sulwhasoo gifted my this Bestseller Trial Kit, and it is a nice way to explore the brand.Iâ€™ve never tried their products before and overall like them. All of them, the foam cleanser, balancing water, serum and moisturizer, feel lovely on the skin and hydrate and moisturize it well. They have lovely textures that layer well with each other and products from different brands. Keep in ming that all have a stronger, herbal scent to them which might take some getting used to though.Also, the moisturizer is very little. I finished it much sooner than the other products. Sulwhasoo does sell in mainland China which means that they are not considered a 100% cruelty free brand. great way to try the brand, small moisturizer
