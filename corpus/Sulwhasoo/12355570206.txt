I just tried a sample of this product and holy cow! I’m in love. The texture is amazing! Not heavy, not light. It absorbs fast leaving no oily residue but the skin very hydrated. My skin feels and looks very hydrated.  It has a nice lemon aroma, but I don’t like how high is in the ingredient list. I can see a sensitive skin not liking that. nan
