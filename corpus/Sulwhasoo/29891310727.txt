This product was gifted by me in exchange for an honest review.I received a mini sample size of the product. The product itself feels quite soft and silky. The cream sinks into the skin beautifully but for someone who has dry-normal skin, it does not feel hydrating enough. Also, the scent of the product is a bit too strong for my liking. I would say for the price, it does not seem worth the price tag. Just Mediocre, Especially for the Price
