This product is wonderful. Works great on sensitive skin with no adverse reactions. The formula is creamy and a little goes a long way, it soaks into the skin and instantly plumps the skin. It doesn’t clog pores and is great for an overnight moisturer or daytime. I was surprised at how small the sample size was, only good for about 10 uses however for the price and quality it’s understandable. It has an interesting scent, smells natural yet somehow still heavily fragranced. Gifted by Sulwhasoo. High end quality & luxurious
