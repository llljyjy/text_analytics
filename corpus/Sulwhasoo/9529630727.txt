This is the first moisturizer Iâ€™ve used and instantly saw and felt results. The cream is richly whipped allowing me to only use a small amount for my entire face and neck. After massaging it into my skin my pores appeared smaller, leaving my face feeling firm and ready for my day. The smell is very pleasant as well.. worth the price compared to other brands. Worth it.
