Originally received a sample then purchased a jar. I love this cream and the earthy smell, which is the ginseng. A little goes a long way and it absorbs easily, leaving soft skin. I would definitely buy this again although the price is a bit high, Iâ€™ve never come across a cream like it. Definitely recommend
