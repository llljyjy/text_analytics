This is a premium cream and it really feels like it. I only used it for a few nights so far and can already tell the difference. My face feel more hydrated and super smooth in the morning. The texture of the cream is amazing. It is not thick and absorbs quckly.  A little goes a long way which is a great thing since this cream is expensive. :) *Gifted by Sulwhasoo - my opinion is honest. I love this high end cream
