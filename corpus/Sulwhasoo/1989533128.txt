I was gifted a trial size to test out for my review, which is great since it’s a pricey cream so it’s nice to test before purchasing. I already love using their serum, so this is a great addition to my skincare regimen featuring Sulwhasoo products. I have dry skin and this is hydrating and firming without feeling greasy. I love the fresh, herbal scent (like their other products). nan
