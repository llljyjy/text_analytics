I received a trial size complimentary from Sulwashoo. Using this cream is such a lovely experience. The cream is very lightweight, yet incredibly hydrating and smoothing. My complexion just looks brighter and healthy after applying it. You don’t need too much either, a little more than a pea sized amount is enough. It definitely has a ginseng scent that I find pleasant and relaxing. I can’t speak to what it does for fine lines because I only had a sample size, but i enjoyed how smooth my skin looked. nan
