This cream was really nice. I was given a sample complimentary from sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest opinion. It was ultra light and not greasy. It made my face feel so soft without breaking it out. The biggest downsides are the smell and the price. Not a fan of the smell and the price is a little too steep for a face cream. nan
