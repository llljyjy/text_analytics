Magic! That’s the best word I can pick for this kit. The cleanser really cleans everything from your face but it doesn’t strip my natural oils either. If you have a cut or a zit it will sting. The serum is so light weight and absorbs beautifully. The essence applies so nicely without even needing a cotton round. The moisturizer is the icing on the cake. After everything absorbs into the skin my face felt like silk. It’s amazing. Magic!!
