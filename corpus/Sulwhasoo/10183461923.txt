As someone with dry skin, this serum was very hydrating! It absorbed into my skin very nicely and did not feel sticky at all. I love how hydrating it was and it gives you a slight glow, too. My skin felt more firm and plump! I can totally understand the hype on this brand. I would definitely gift this product to my family as well, and purchase a full-size for myself! This product is complimentary from Sulwhasoo but opinions are my own. nan
