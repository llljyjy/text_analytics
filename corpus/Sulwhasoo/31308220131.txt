I received this free in exchange for my honest review..I have wanted to try this moisturizer for forever and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. From the minute I removed the lid I knew I was going to love it. It has a luxurious thickish texture that literary melts into your skin. This moisturizer is great when your skin needs that extra tlc. By morning my skin is so soft and has this natural glow. So beautiful. Oh and the scent.. It has a beautiful natural herbal smell that I just cannot get enough of. I cannot speak to the firming benefits, as I haven’t used it long enough to tell. But I am obsessed! I know it’s a bit on the pricier side, but if you can afford it, GET IT!! You won’t be disappointed. Treat Yourself
