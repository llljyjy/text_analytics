I really like this foam cleanser! I’ve been using them for a few weeks and I can definitely tell my skin is tighter and firmer! The only thing I didn’t like about it is that it dries my face out quite a bit, so much so that it was peeling. Once I added a moisturizer into the routine, it got a lot better! I’d definitely recommend them to someone who needs to firm up their skin and doesn’t have a problem with their skin drying out easily.I received these products complimentary from Influenster and Sulwhasoo for testing purposes. #complimentary #sulwhasoo @Influenster @sulwhasoo.us nan
