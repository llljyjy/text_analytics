I love those makeup remover!! I’ve been using neutrogena makeup wipes for a while and it used to never removed all my makeup so I started looking for a new oily makeup remover that was gentle with my skin as well.. I fount this and I fell in love with it. Just about to get my second bottle. It removes all your makeup even waterproof mascara and it’s super gentle on your skin, you don’t need to rub to hard or too much. It’s perfect!! BUY IT!!! Soooo worth it BUY IT!
