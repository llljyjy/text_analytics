I have been wanting to try this brand but didnâ€™t know where to start. This is the perfect kit to try all their best sellers. I love using skincare sets which makes it so easy to know what to apply to my face. They all had a light, citrusy, herbal, and woody ginseng-like scent. The cream had the strongest scent but immediately goes away. The gentle cleansing foam felt great on my skin, and the serum was light, absorbed well, and left no stickiness. I absolutely loved how hydrating the balancing water was while the cream felt light and moisturizing. Overall, I enjoyed the glow and how smooth my face appeared after using this set. Each product was amazing, and I was very impressed with my results. MUST TRY this bestseller trail kit!!!
