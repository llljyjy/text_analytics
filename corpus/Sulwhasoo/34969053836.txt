This is such a lovely way to experience the ultimate in luxury KBeauty! There are more expensive KBeauty brands out there, but I doubt there are ones as trusted & time-tested as Sulwhasoo. Each product feels so luxurious & pampering! The cleanser is rich but not drying. The essence is slightly viscous & you need only one layer for deep hydration. The serum looks thick, but actually absorbs quite quickly to hold in extra hydration with the added benefits of ginseng. The cream is probably my favorite - rich & luxurious, with a potent smell of ginseng - it feels like nutrition for the skin! I love this set & would definitely purchase it as a gift for someone (after I get the full-size for myself!). Luxury Kbeauty for aging skin
