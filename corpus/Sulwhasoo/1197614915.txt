I was gifted this product from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review.  I found this cream to be nicely hydrating on my normal to combo skin. It wasn’t too heavy but provided just enough moisturizing that my skin felt soft & supple throughout the day.  After a week I felt that my skin was more balanced with less forehead oiliness occurring.  There does seem to be a slight white tea type of scent that I enjoyed.  It made the experience of smoothing it in feel a bit spa-like. My skin reacts quickly to products that are irritating and I haven’t had any issues with this cream. I would highly recommend it if you want intense hydration that doesn’t feel greasy or heavy. Great hydration, lightweight feel
