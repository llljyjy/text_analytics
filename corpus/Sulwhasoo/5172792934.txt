This is a nice serum! This was gifted by Sulwahasoo and I have been trying to make an effort to prevent unnecessary aging so I was super excited to try. It is pretty thin and goes on easily which I like in a face serum. The product smells fresh like ginger and citrus. It’s cooling at first which I love and leaves my skin feeling pretty smooth and hydrated. I don’t think I have used it for long enough to see firming or anti aging effects but I will update my review in a few weeks! Cooling & Hydrating
