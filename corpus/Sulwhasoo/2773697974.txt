This cream has a medium-heavy texture but sinks right into the skin leaving a natural and not dewy finish. This cream is pretty heavily fragranced and the ingredients aren’t a huge wow factor for me since fragrance is in a higher concentration than a lot of the beneficial extracts that have been added in. I’m not sure that this is worth the $120 price point, although my skin does feel nice and soft after applying. I’ve noticed hydration but my dry skin needs a bit more than just this cream. An expensive cream with just okay ingredients
