First of all, this cream has the best texture I’ve ever felt! I love how smooth & fluffy it is! It absorbs wonderfully into the skin as a final step in my skincare routine. Secondly, it doesn’t have much of a fragrance which is definitely what I prefer. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a highly moisturizing cream. nan
