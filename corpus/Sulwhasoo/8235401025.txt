This product was gifted to me by Sulwhasoo. I’m so happy to try this Korean skincare brand.  As soon as it arrived, I unboxed the package and incorporated it into my nightly skincare routine. I apply this cream during the nighttime. I use it for my last step in my skincare routine. After washing my face, toning it, and adding serum. I apply this cream to my face and neck and sleep with it overnight. This method allows the cream to absorb into my skin adding moisture that my skin desperately needs! The Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream has made my combo skin feel nourished and  super soft. It removed my dryness in my cheek area while making my face and neck area feel firm. However, this cream is for all skin types. The scent of this product is a ginseng scent and it’s not overwhelming. The cream is a lightweight consistency and not sticky, which is a positive for me. The texture of the cream is smooth, which is what I tend to like. I plan to continue using this as my nighttime moisturizer cream and ordering the larger size based off of my positive results I’ve noticed within a short time. Thank you to Sulwhasoo and this renewing cream for my skin flex. A must-have in my skincare routine
