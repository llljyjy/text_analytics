I have what I call “extreme combination skin“ where my skin is very oily yet flaky at the same time. I like to use this product at night after washing my face and before adding a serum or sleeping mask. It’s been helping my skin feel more hydrated without causing me to break out (which happens to me with a lot of other products meant for night use). This was gifted by Sulwhasoo. It’s pricey but a good long term investment if you’re concerned about your skin aging and need an extra hydrating boost like me. Would buy again whenever I run out of the bottle they gave me. nan
