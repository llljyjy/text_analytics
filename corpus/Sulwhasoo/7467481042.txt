I truly do not understand why this product hasn’t gone viral yet.  This overnight mask is a freaking DREAM. It smells like the spa, my face feels baby smooth and is radiant and calm when I wake up.  I may have slept like crap throughout the night and with this stuff, I’ll still wake up looking like Sleeping Beauty.  I will say, if you’re sensitive to scents you may want to test before you slather it on and do be careful around your eye area. Miracle Mask
