This is my first time trying out this product and brand. This is gifted by Sulwhasoo. I’ve been using it for almost two weeks now. I have to say I’ve noticed a difference in my skin. My skin feels more hydrated, firm, and I feel like my texture has minimized a lot since the first time I’ve used it. Over time, my face has gotten more firm and my skin feels tighter. The serum feels really soft on the skin and glides right on. I’ve begun skipping out on using a lot of makeup because this serum brings a natural glow to the face. I definitely will continue using it and am excited to my results 3 months into it. Definitely recommend
