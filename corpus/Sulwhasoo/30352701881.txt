I am using this facial cleanser in the morning and at night, it has a light texture, I have to be careful not to take out too much product because the pump does not work well, I love that it makes a lot of foam, it feels very soft on my face and when I use my facial exfoliating sponge I love the results, I really like this facial cleanser, its smell is mild and does not irritate my face.  Your bottle looks nice I recommend this product nan
