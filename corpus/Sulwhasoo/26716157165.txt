My social media has been all about Sulwhasoo products and the first aid serum! I’ve been using it for a few days and honestly I haven’t felt any difference at all. The cleanser is extremely gentle but for makeup I think I need something that’s a little strong. I like the moisturizer the most and that’s the smallest bit in the whole set sadly. The box too is very cheap material and mine was destroyed during shipping only. These sizes however are perfect for gifting and traveling and trying before you commit to the full size. Too gentle
