I was so excited when this cream was gifted to me by Sulwhasoo because I have had it in my cart for ages.  This silky-soft, powerful cream is perfect for my combination skin (in addition to my mom of toddlers tired skin lol). I was looking for a product that would combat my occasional dryness, fine lines and loss of elasticity. It did just that with this super lightweight but hydrating formula. It noticeably diminished visible signs of aging and helped my skin look firmer, smoother, and more refreshed. Helped with my tired skin!
