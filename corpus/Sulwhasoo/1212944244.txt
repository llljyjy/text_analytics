This cream is deeply moisturizing and hydrating while feeling lightweight and non-greasy on the skin. It leaves my skin feeling nourished, plump and dewy. It works great as a day cream and as a night cream and smells amazing, but the fragrance is a bit stronger than I would personally prefer. Lovely cream
