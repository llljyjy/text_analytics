This product is soo light and creamy! When you open it, expect a loose soft cream, nothing too thick. However when you smooth it onto skin it feels like a bouncy cushion of moisture. I do notice some slight plumping effects but that’s what skin does when it’s well-moisturized. I am excited to see how this product works over time but so far I really do love it. It feels so nice and as I age I want to make sure I have a good foundation of moisture. nan
