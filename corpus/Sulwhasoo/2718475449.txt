I love this set of products. Iâ€™ve been wanting to try Sulwhasoo products for a while, and happy I could try in a complete set. The cleaner is super gentle and makes my face feel very clean after. It feels soft and slightly sudsy. The activating serum makes my skin feel smooth. The toner leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed. The cream feels incredibly moisturizing and I notice a different in the firmness of my skin. After using these products, my skin feels soft, smooth, and my makeup applies better. I struggle with combination skin, and noticed it to be more balanced after using. nan
