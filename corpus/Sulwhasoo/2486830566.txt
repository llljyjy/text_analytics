this is the first oil cleanser I’ve ever tried, so there could be better ones out there, but it has been a total game changer for my skin. I don’t wear makeup but I use this to take off sunscreen before the rest of my routine. i use it in the mornings too by itself. i’ve been struggling with buildup and dryness and clogged pores but this combined with the Biossance BHA toner is completely rejuvenating the texture and look of my skin. I like the smell and haven’t noticed any irritation. Game Changer
