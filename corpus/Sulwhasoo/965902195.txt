When I first used this product.  I really wanted it to work for me. It was very thick and had a ok scent.  I applied the face cream and it felt like my face needed more moisture.  I would definitely not just apply a lot of this cream on because it really just felt very heavy on my face which made me feel very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, this is just one product that was just not for me. Ehhhh
