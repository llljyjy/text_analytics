Sulwhasoo keeps living up to high expectations. This cream is very nurturing and thick but it gets absorbed super quickly without leaving any sticky feeling. It makes my skin feel very soft and keeps it moisturized throughout the day. The cream has a very subtle ginseng scent to it, that is typical for all Sulwhasoo products. I really like it, it makes using it feel like a ritual. amazing cream
