I received this skincare set from Sulwhasoo complimentary for a honest review. Sulwhasoo is one of my favorite skincare brand from Asia. I have been using their skincare products for more than 10 years. When they sent over this set I was super grateful. I used up 2 bottles of their First Care Activating Serums before; it cleared up my redness and peeling from a retinol product (other brand), and kept my skin moisturized. So glad that I have this serum back in my routine. Cannot wait to try out their Gentle Cleansing Foam, Essential Balancing Water and Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream. Best value! Great skincare line.
