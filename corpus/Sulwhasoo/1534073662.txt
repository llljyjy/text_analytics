I am turning 30 in a few weeks so I was excited to try out this firming cream. As soon as I applied it I noticed the richness of the cream, it’s very hydrating and not as heavy as I expected it to be.  I really love how it doesn’t have a strong fragrance but a soft smell to it. I let this sit in my skin for 15 minutes to reapply to areas that need extra hydration. I can’t wait to see results with more continuous use. Hydrating
