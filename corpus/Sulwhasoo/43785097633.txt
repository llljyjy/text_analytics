First impression was the lovely smell and feel of the cream. This is my first K Beauty item used. The cream is very effective it applies wonderfully, sinks in quickly. Leaves skin feeling soft and supple. This is part of a skin regimen. The texture is smooth and cooling and definitely recommended due to its smoothness and effectiveness. Some reviewers said that they didnâ€™t like the smell but I found it herbal and luxurious. Renewal
