I love the texture of this cream, I find it very suitable for my oily type skin. I’ve been looking forward to trying this slightly higher end kbeauty brand for a while. I haven’t noticed any firming results but it leaves my skin looking very moisturized and with a dewy glow. Moisturizing but high price point
