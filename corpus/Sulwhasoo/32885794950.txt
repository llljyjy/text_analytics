This cream doesn’t disappoint, it does exactly what they claim and even more. I can honestly say that after each use, and prolonged use I can notice my skin is firmer and it’s also helped brighten my hyperpigmentation and dark spots. I love the texture, it’s not heavy or too thick, for me it’s just right. The Best for Firming & Brightening!
