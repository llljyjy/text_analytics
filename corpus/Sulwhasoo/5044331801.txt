I am almost 30 with slightly dry skin, so I’m always looking for more hydrating and anti-aging products for my fine lines starting to form. This serum definitely fit the bill, since it has a rich texture vs. a more watery one, almost like a thin oil. However, it didn’t leave a greasy residue when applied and seemed to sink in easily. The smell reminds me a little bit of ginger and I like it. I used it in the morning before applying a vitamin C serum and moisturizer and felt that it definitely plumped up my skin a bit, so will be looking out for more results in that area as I use it more long term!
