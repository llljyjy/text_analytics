This serum harnesses the benefits of ginseng in a really lovely way.  The smell is light and invigorating, and because ginseng is anti-inflammatory, my sensitive skin responds nicely to it and I’m seeing less redness.  I prefer to use this in my AM skincare routine because it’s scent is so uplifting. The absorption is immediate and I like the way it feels on it’s own, even without moisturizer because it hydrates without being heavy. Love the scent
