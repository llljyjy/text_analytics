I received a 5ml sample of this to try and review - however it’s hard to tell the long terms effects of a product like this with such a small size. So my honest review from the couple of uses I got from this is: it is moisturizing and has a pleasant texture - but in terms of having any firming effects I can’t tell of any difference. nan
