The gentle cleansing foam was very hydrating and did not leave my skin dry after washing.. The first care activating serum left my skin feeling very bright and hydrating.The essential comfort balancing water left my skin feeling plump and was very firming. I felt like it really balanced the serum and toner togetherThe concentrated ginseng renewing cream was a little thin for my preference when it comes to moisturizer however, it did feel really smooth and smells great. Great starter kit for glowing skin
