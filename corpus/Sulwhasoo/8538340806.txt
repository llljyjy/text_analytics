I adore this renewing cream. It has quite the potent smell that’s super earthy - not a fan - but with the effects, I don’t mind. After just one use I was able to have smoother skin - even in spots that have been an issue for years. The formula is super lightweight and creamy. The second you put it on your skin it melts right in. After a week or so of use I can see a huge difference in overall skin hydration & smoothness. * complimentary from Sulwhasoo Great for dry skin
