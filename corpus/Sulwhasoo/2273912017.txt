I’m obsessed with this product. I have been using it for a week plus now and I am in love! I had never use k beauty products before and I find it to be so effective. It is smooth and refreshing it cleans so well and this cleanser will be replacing my current one in my skin care routine. I’m currently pregnant and have splotchy skin on my face and some weird spots and since using this product partnered with their first step serum and their lotion it has been a game changer. My face is clear and feels so much nicer!I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! And have already added this to my Christmas list and purchased a bottle for a friend! A must have in your skin care routine!
