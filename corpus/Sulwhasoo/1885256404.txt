A must have serum! I have combination skin so that means I get to have pimples and wrinkles at the same time! :) This product is hydrating and not oily with a pleasant herbal scent. It calms down my skin a lot and evens out my skin tone. Since this is not a oily formula, applying make up over it is not a problem at all. Must have!
