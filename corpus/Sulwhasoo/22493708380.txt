I received this product for free from the brand in exchange for my review. This is a thicker cream that is best used at night in my opinion. The scent is citrusy and doesn’t linger for very long. I noticed that my skin is soft and moisturized after I used it, but I don’t think it necessarily does a better job than the less expensive moisturizers that I typically use. The sample I received wasn’t large enough to notice any long term anti aging benefits. I don’t think I would purchase this myself for the steep price tag. Not sure it's worth the price
