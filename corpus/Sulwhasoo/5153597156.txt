I wanted to use this for a little while before giving my 2 cents. This has been a staple in my skincare for 4 months and I just have to say, I have noticed a visible difference. My skin is always glowing, it has helped with my dark spots, the texture of my skin has improved, and the scent is just amazing. I use this after I wash and tone. Then I moisturize and apply my primer and makeup. My skin has improved so much that I am more comfortable not wearing makeup. The price is a little high but it is absolutely worth it!!!!! A must in my skincare regime!!!!
