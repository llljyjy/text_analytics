Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream I received this small product sample from complimentary from Sulwashoo. Initial application the smell is pretty strong but then it gets subtle after a few minutes. The cream is light to medium I’d say, it’s not thick but not so thin also. It dries down pretty fast and it’s good for using under the makeup. It’s smooth I’d say and not greasy for a cream.  I just think it’s too little it’s a very tiny container (5mL) to really tell and conclude how this product performs wish I could have had enough more time to use this product before I pcould really conclude my thoughts on this. nan
