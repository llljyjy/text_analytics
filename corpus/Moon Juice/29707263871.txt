This is a great liquid exfoliator for a quick and easy routine. It has a natural scent and I love the sleek packaging. It’s easy to use and you don’t have to worry about dispensing too much. Definitely follow up with a moisturizer after because it is effective at resurfacing. Gifted by Moon Juice nan
