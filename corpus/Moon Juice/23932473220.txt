I have been using Plump Jelly Serum by Moon Juice for my face. I love that it’s a clean formula and has many beneficial skin ingredients. The scent is lovely and isn’t a synthetic fragrance fortunately. My skin absorbed the serum almost immediately upon application. This is a serum for those that want to hydrate their skin, but have a lightweight formula. I have mostly dry skin, so this is good for me for warmer weather. nan
