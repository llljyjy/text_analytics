This is the only ’milk’ cleanser that leaves my skin feeling as clean as a gel/ foam cleanser, yet soft and plump at the same time. I have rosacea and only use ’clean’ beauty/ EWG verified skincare and this has one of the best ingredient lists. I also have super dry dehydrated skin and hate the heavy greasy feel of skincare geared towards my skin type. Other milk / gentle / dry skin cleansers I’ve tried just don’t feel like they clean very deeply and my skin doesn’t feel fresh and prepped for next steps. That’s somehow not the case here, although it’s milky, it’s also kind of a jelly? Either way, does what it’s supposed to and doesn’t aggravate my sensitive, dry skin. Proper Cleanse for Sensitive Skin
