I bought this to replace the Sephora brand glycolic acid pads that I had previously been using. I love this stuff. I put it in the palm of my hands almost every night and press it into my skin and then I follow with my moisturizer. In the morning I just apply my spf. My skin looks so much better since I started using this. Some things to note are that it is sticky, but bearable and it can sting a little if you aren’t used to it. The sting doesn’t last long though. nan
