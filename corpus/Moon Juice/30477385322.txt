There are a lot of other reviews that mention the scent of this product, and I would also agree that it’s…a lot. It’s a very woody and “natural” scent, and it’s not for everybody. I was a fan of the texture of the serum, though it is quite gooey, for lack of a better term. It’s closer in viscosity to a snail mucin type product, which I love. I enjoyed the way this serum made my skin feel, but I did experience some breakouts with it, and the smell unfortunately made me not want to use it. Gifted by Moon Juice. nan
