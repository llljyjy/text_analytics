Complimentary from Moon Juice I used the plump jelly a hyaluronic serum, after I use the acid potion and this has the most incredible texture I’ve ever used, and I’ve used a lot of different skin care routines I plan on using this day and night. It’s hard to explain how hydrated your skin feels with this on it. It even says to use it on your lips it’s hyaluronic acid and peptides amino acids and mushrooms and it delivers water into the cells. And it locks in that elasticity and plumps so beautifully BEST SERUM EVER TO TOUCH MY SKIN
