Honestly, I’m not sure that adaptogens do much for a person. Real, scientific studies on them are sparse, and these supplements aren’t FDA regulated or approved. Getting these gifted by Moon Juice was a good opportunity for me to try these out to see if the hype is real. I didn’t notice any adverse effects, and they’re probably not the worst habit ever— I like that they put me in a mindset of listening to and taking care of my body. It might be more about the placebo for me than anything else! nan
