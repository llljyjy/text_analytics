I bought this on a whim looking for a chemical exfoliator, I went in with no expectations and was blown away. The product comes in a beautiful luxurious glass bottle, it’s easy to dispense into your palm and dab onto your skin with no product waste. I noticed immediate results to my pores and my smile lines. My pores are completely reduced and unclogged, I have a noticeable glow. My smile lines have lessened in combination with my other skincare. This product is not so extreme that its caused any dryness or irritation. I use it on the exfoliating night of my skin cycle routine and it’s great for that purpose. nan
