Whoah! Truly a workhorse of a product! Fantastic for those with skin that has already seen a fair share of acids. (Me:) Might be too strong for sensitive skin or if you haven’t tried an acid formula. I like this so much because it not only exfoliates but it has some great nourishing ingredients too. And 25% of acids is a high amount of compared to other products like this so maybe test this on a small spot before you use this on your entire face. It smooths the skin on my cheeks and forehead like nothing else I’ve tried…they look so refined and dang I just wish I had tried this much sooner. Stunning results in little time.
