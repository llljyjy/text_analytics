When I first saw “nourishing” and “exfoliator” next to each other I thought wait a minute.. HOW?!? But you just have to try it to see for yourself. I used this at night about every other night (too much exfoliation can be harsh!) you could just feel your skin being resurfaced it feels fresh and new. Overall just a nicer brighter, smoother look.
