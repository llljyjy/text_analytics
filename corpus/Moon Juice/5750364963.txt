This product was gifted to me by Moon Juice.  This serum has more of a thicker jelly consistency and you donâ€™t need a lot.  It can feel a bit sticky after application but feels good once it is absorbed.  It kinda gives you that gorgeous glass skin and hydrates nicely.  I also noticed an herbal scent which does not linger on skin. nan
