Love me a good Hyaluronic Acid serum. This one is a bit gelly feels like snail mucin essence, pretty close plus it has a strong smell like dried herbs which i have no problem with. It keeps my skin hydrated make sure to follow it up with a good moisturizer. Gifted by moon juice. Gelly like and hydrating
