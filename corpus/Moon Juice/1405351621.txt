Did a good job at exfoliating without drying out or causing flaking. It didn’t produce any dramatic results but did help with appearance of pores. Also happy with the clean ingredients! The one thing I couldn’t get over with this product was the SMELL. It’s overwhelming. It smells like a strong, sour lemongrass. It makes it unpleasant to use. Overall I would say that the results didn’t match the value of the product. I have had similar results with products half the price. Strong, unpleasant scent
