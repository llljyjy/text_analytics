I was gifted by Moon Juice for my honest review. First off,  the smell is strong! It has a strong earthly like scent. I donâ€™t mind the smell but it definitely could be cut back. The texture was good. It did burn some of my acne spots on my face. It was not soothing. It did help mildly with hydration but nothing extreme. It leaves my face feeling a bit tight. My skin definitely craves a good moisturizer after it. I would not purchase this. A pass for me
