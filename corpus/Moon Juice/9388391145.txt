This is by far the best skin care product in my arsenal right now. My skin really started to change now that I’ve approached my mid-30’s and my skin hydration barrier has been on the decline for about a year now. With stress, mask wearing, and subsequent flakiness… I needed a skin miracle. This was it!! I traditionally never really had good experiences with any gel-like products before (I like water-based things that feel like my skin is drinking it up) and boyyyy did my skin drink this up. I use 1-2 pumps morning and night right after washing my face and BAM. My skin is hydrated and clear. This also works wonders after AHA/BHA masks when your skin needs some *milk*. This is my holy grail product, hands down… my ride or die. My holy grail. My ride or die.
