This quite possibly one of the best exfoliators I’ve used in awhile! My skin is super oily during the warmer seasons and the other exfoliants I’ve previously used didn’t really seem to help unclog my pores. First impressions on this, gently + effective! My face felt fresh + didn’t feel stuffed up on my t zone. Definitely recommend! nan
