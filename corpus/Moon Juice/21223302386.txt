Oh my gosh I’m so in love with the moisturizer! I got it on whim as I was out of my current moisturizer and needed to repurchase and saw this as I was getting the super you supplements. Context: I have a dry skin type but due to the heat and humidity currently it would  say it’s more normal leaning dry; I can’t speak for other skin types. The texture is lovely, nice and rich and creamy without being too heavy or too light that it absorbs into nothing on the skin. It leaves a beautiful glow and my skin instantly feel plump, hydrated and soft. It feels like a perfectly balanced moisturizer between being both moisturizing (emollient to soften the skin and occlusive enough to trap in moisture) and hydrating at the same time. It had a very herbal scent that I love but BE WARNED it does linger! If you don’t like herbal scent and/or do not like scent lingering in your products you will not like this! For me, I love the scent! I would love if they made a body cream in this scent as well. This does not irritate my sensitive skin (which I was concerned about with the scent) and in fact I find it actually calms my skin quite a bit. Had an allergic reaction to new medication the other night and had hives all over and after which using this during my skincare routine I found it calmed the inflammation down and left my skin feeling so comfortable. Will 100% repurchase. Other moisturizers I like to compare if you think my review would be helpful for you/ if our tastes are similar are: tatcha dewy skin cream, DE protini , Josie Maran argon oil daily spf 47, milk vegan milk moisturizer nan
