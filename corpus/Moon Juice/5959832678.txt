I have really dry skin with dry patches, so anything that claims to be intensely hydrating is right up my alley. I love the lightweight gel consistency and the fact that it doesnâ€™t pill or leave a sticky residue behind. It effectively hydrated my skin and leaves it feeling super smooth and plump! Complimentary from Moon juice but all thoughts are my own. nan
