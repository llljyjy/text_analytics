I was pleasantly surprised at how good this product tasted! It definitely tastes like mango which I love, and is an enjoyable morning drink in cold water before I go to work. I noticed energy which is awesome because I donâ€™t want to heavily rely on coffee anymore before work! I am excited to see how it affects my metabolism, too! This was gifted to me by Moon Juice! Yummy and easy!
