These were gifted by Moon Juice to me for review purposes. I was a bit skeptical on these but I do feel as though they have aided in my positive mindset lately! Easy to swallow, aesthetically packaged, and no bad aftertaste. I really like that this supplement is easy to incorporate into my routine and doesn’t overlap with the others I take (it has unique ingredients that I don’t take normally). Definitely worth a try!
