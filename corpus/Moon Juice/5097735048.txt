This gifted by Moon Juice supplement has been a giving me a nice energy boost since I started using it. I already start my mornings with a big glass of water anyway so this was easy to integrate into my daily healthy habits. I like that it is designed to specifically support energy & metabolism. This supplement is filled with good ingredients that I am familiar with with like mango B complex and ginseng. Sometimes it can be challenging to keep up. I like that this is an easy way to help that I feel is healthier. I like that they use a methylated B 12 because it actually supports serotonin levels. I feel more balanced and energized.  This is really easy to take and I like the like fruit flavor. I feel great and notice the gentle energy boost. Gentle energy boost that lasts all day
