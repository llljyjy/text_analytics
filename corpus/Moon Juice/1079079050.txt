This was very kindly gifted by Moon Juice and I think this is a fabulous dupe for P50 if not better! The blend of AHAs and BHA in a gentle but very potent formula show immediate results with my complexion. I use this mainly at night to avoid sun exposure and follow with spf 50 the next day. My skin is smooth, glowing, clear, and very soft. I have sensitive skin so I only use up to two times a week but it makes a massive difference! Great exfoliant!
