This moisturized is a light, gel-like texture that sinks perfectly into the skin before makeup application. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and goes beautiful under makeup. However I find it doesn’t quite give me enough moisture to be used all the time. It works great for warmer months or morning when I don’t need as much moisture. I would definitely recommend this for normal or oilier skin types, I think you would love it! But I think if you are dry, I’d recommend something thicker. Great light moisturizer, need more hydration
