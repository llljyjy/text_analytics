For reference, I have normal to dry skin, packed with hyperpigmentation, pores and fine lines because I didn’t take the proper care/protection when I was young.PROS:- Physical sunscreen: because it has a slight tint to it, it doesn’t leave too much of a white cast. - It doesn’t irritate my eyes: because of being a physical sunscreen, I can apply it around my eyes and over my lids. Chemical sunscreens irritate my eyes. - Great spf level (50)- It worked well under my makeup but I needed to use a matte finish foundation to compensate the extremely glowy finish that the sunscreen left on my skin (I apply one teaspoon on face and neck, which is quite a lot but necessary to get the SPF advertised)- Non scented formula: it doesn’t have any perfumes so it is perfect for any sensitive face out there - It has a good price.CONS- It has a lot of silicones.- It doesn’t have skincare ingredients (other than the SPF) I get my skincare from other products so I don’t rely/need for my sunscreen to provide them, although they are always appreciated.- I don’t feel it gets fully absorbed by the skin, unless you apply a very thin layer, looking too glowy and slightly slippery.- I don’t think this is for oily skin but for dry to very dry skinned people.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Good physical sunscreen but quite glowy
