I found the serum to be lightweight, easy to spread on my face, and was absorbed quickly into my skin. It did not take long to dry, and my face felt smooth and non-tacky. I have sensitive combination skin, and found that this did not irritate my face from use after 3 days (which was all I was able to get from the sample size). I also appreciated that the serum was not heavily scented. Itâ€™s a bit more expensive than my standard serum, so I will have to weigh that in when I consider my next purchase. All good indicators of promising product
