Compared to the original Moisture Surge, I found this to be far more hydrating. I have oily skin so it was too rich for daytime but it was great for my skin overnight, especially in the winter. I love that Clinique is fragrance free as I find scent can be irritating and cause my eyes to feel sensitive. Clinique always has the best products for my sensitive skin. Great product.  I received a sample from Influenster to test this product and would definitely purchase the full size. nan
