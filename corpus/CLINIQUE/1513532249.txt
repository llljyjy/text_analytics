Product was okay. I received a sample but it wasnâ€™t big enough to really use it long enough to get any benefits. I will continue to use my DRMTLGY moisturizer in the mean time. I believe this one may have also given me some systic acne because it was the only change to my routine and I randomly developed some. Not a big fan.
