I was pleasantly surprised with this product that I received in exchange for my honest review. At first I thought the container was small and I wasnâ€™t sure how that little bit of cream could make a difference but I was proven wrong. You only need a small amount of cream and this little bit goes a long way. It is a wonderful cream, not oily, and leaves my skin smoother and fuller minimizing the appearance of fine lines. nan
