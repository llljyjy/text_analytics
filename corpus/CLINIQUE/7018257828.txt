It lives up to its name! It truly is moisturizing and helps my skin feel moisturized even the day after I use it. My only complaint is I find it reacts with one of my other products so it occasionally makes me break out. Other than that I think itâ€™s great on days when my skin is feeling especially dry. I bought it when it was half off so it was worth the price I paid! Truly is moisturizing!
