I got this as a sample to try. I love the consistency of this product but not 100% sure it’s helped with my fine lines under my eyes as it’s only been 2 weeks. I think the concept is great would definitely consider purchasing this product as it gives my skin around my eyes needed moisture during these very cold days! Moisturizing under eyes
