This cream hasn’t reduced the appearance of fine line and wrinkles.  It didn’t instantly depuff my eye area. What I like about it is that the area around my eyes feels smooth and well hydrated. I wouldn’t purchase it if the product doesn’t give me results. I still recommend it. I have used it under concealer and it sets just fine. Nice eye cream
