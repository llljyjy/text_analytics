I received a free sample from TopBox and after using it 3 times  I went to buy the full size to replace my current serum.  I have combination skin, some dry spots and I have textured fine lines, after three days my skin felt more plump and I did notice a difference. I will use this serum for a longer period of time and let you know the results. So far so good I really like it So far so good
