I received the Clinique  Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream as a sample to try from Influenster. Ultimately, the cream does a good job. I received a small jar to try. My face can be sensitive and this proved to be a bit too strong. I would put it on at night and wash off in the morning. I would then apply my regular facial moisturizer with sunscreen. The correcting cream still made my face very sensitive to the sun even after being washed off. I feel like it was doing what it claims to do. It was just too strong for my skin. Good. Just too strong for me.
