*I received a onetime-use sample sachet of this correcting serum for free from Topbox in exchange for my honest review*Because I was only able to test out this correcting serum for one day, I cannot comment on the claims that it repairs, resurfaces, and reply is the skin while reducing the look of lines and wrinkles. I did, however, enjoy the light, creamy texture of this serum and it was very soothing when applied. It didn’t have a scent which I liked, and it quickly absorbed into my skin. Again, I’m not sure I can recommend this product after only one use, and given the price point I don’t think I will be purchasing this product in the future without feeling confident in its effectiveness. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Nice texture
