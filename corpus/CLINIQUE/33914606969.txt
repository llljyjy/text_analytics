This product is recommended for dry-combination skin, and it really is! Been using this for a while now and I love it. I always cleanse my face throughly but the amount of dirt I see on my cotton ball after using this amazes me every time! It makes my face feel so soft and I feel like I really have seen a difference in makeup application. I don’t really have any dry flakes, so I can’t say anything about that, so it’s just so refreshing and feels great on the skin, like my face is really clean. It may be a bit on the pricier side but it’s so worth it- the knockoffs just won’t do it for me!!! <3 Amazing for dry-normal skin!!
