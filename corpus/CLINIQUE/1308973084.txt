I received this as a sample. I have been a Clinique customer on and off for years. This eye cream was a game-changer for me. This cream proved to be able to stand up to my regular products. It was gentle enough on my eye are I had no irritation, and it definitely softened my fine lines. I was also able to immediately apply my makeup on top and it did not interfere. Itâ€™s light and fully absorptive. I would absolutely buy a jar. nan
