The Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum was really to my liking. I used the small sample back and noticed a slight difference after applying it right before work. I enjoyed the smell and the smooth lotion like texture was great as well. Overall will definitely try again and add it to my collection. freeproduct nan
