Let me start off by saying that I received this offer complimentary in exchange for my honest review. So here it goes…I liked it. My under eyes were hydrated and my makeup sat nicely when I used it. With that being said, I did find that it was a bit finicky and if you put a little too much on, it didn’t sink in, it would pill off and it was kind of gross. I don’t really think it did anything for my wrinkles, but I’m also 40, so I don’t expect miracles. Overall, I liked it but it wasn’t a miracle in a bottle. Great product but not exceptional
