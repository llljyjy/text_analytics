I used this for a week and didn’t see a difference at all. A little does go along way. So one positive is you won’t need more in a month. My biggest issue is it leaves a film. In the morning I had a layer of what felt like skin and peeled off. At night I do rub my eyes so sometimes I would wake up with gooey flakes. If it worked maybe I could ignore that but seeing no improvement, I would not purchase this product at all. The formula needs to change so it goes into the skin and doesn’t just sit on top. Same your money
