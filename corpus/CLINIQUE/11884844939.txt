I received a sample size complimentary to try and I must be candid that I cannot provide a full review. The sample was very small but I was able to try for a few days. I have combination skin and when I put it on I didn’t feel like I had anything on which is a bonus bc I do not like putting moisturizers that feel sticky. The aroma is also pleasant and so seems like a nice product. As I could only use it for a few days I didn’t notice a big change. I’m giving it a 4/5 for the scent and feel once applied. Seems to be nice
