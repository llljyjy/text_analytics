I really wanted to like this product but it just doesn’t seem to do anything for me. I am almost 40 and have fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I have been using the product for a couple months and no noticable difference. It does leave the skin softer, so I have it an extra star for that. However, I wouldn’t pay $55 for it. No noticable difference
