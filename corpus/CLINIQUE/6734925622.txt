I received this product from Influenster to try for free, in exchange for my honest opinion.So, here goes!I really would like to tell you that I tried this product, and that it did ALL of the marvelous things it claims to. The issue? It takes a few weeks to see results from most skin products. How am I to truthfully review a product, when the apple size is only enough for two or three uses? Unfortunately, the most I can say about this product is that it moisturizes nicely, there’s no skin aggravating scents, it applied nicely, didn’t make my skin oily, and didn’t cause my makeup to slip. As for the anti-aging claims, who knows?I added pictures of a tube of lipstick for size reference. Disappointed
