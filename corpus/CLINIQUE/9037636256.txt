I absolutely love this to take off makeup! It feels so smooth on the face, and you donâ€™t need a lot to take off a full face of makeup. Just rub it around the skin and then rinse off or use a reusable pad to get it off. I originally bought the mini size just to try it, and a little goes a long way so it lasts a while! Definitely recommend this nan
