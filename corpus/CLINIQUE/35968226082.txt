I received this free sample from #trywithtopbox for my honest review and overall the product was ok. The cream is a little thick but not greasy which absorbs nicely into the skin quickly. I canâ€™t say I see a difference in my wrinkles as the sample was too small and only lasted 1 week but maybe long term the results are favorable. Okay
