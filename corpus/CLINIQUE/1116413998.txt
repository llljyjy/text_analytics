I like this moisturizer so far, it absorbs in well doesn’t feel heavy or sticky. And so far it hasn’t broken me out. It’s too soon to tell if it’s working on helping with the wrinkles and fine lines but I am hopeful. It’s also at a great price point So hopefully it will deliver the results with time. So far so good
