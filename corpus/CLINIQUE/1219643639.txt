I’ve only been using this eye cream for about a month, so I don’t see any intense wrinkle correcting benefits yet. Although I don’t have have alot of wrinkles yet.  I’m 42 and just have tiny fine lines starting to form.  Let’s me honest though, no eye cream is going to turn back time.  If you are looking for drastic results, it’s better to go to a plastic surgeon, then to hope an eye cream will correct your wrinkles.However, I will say the eye cream is very moisturizing.  I have very dry sensitive skin and this did not irritate my eye area.  If you have realistic views of what an eye cream can do,  I would recommend this product. It also wears well and doesn’t do anything weird under my concealer. Very moisturizing
