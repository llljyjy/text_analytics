I have tried about every eye cream in the books. This one is wonderful! I saw instant results, and after using it daily for about three weeks now, have noticed an improvement in my dark circles and puffy eye bags (which are my biggest areas of concern). It does not irritate my sensitive eyes, either! Free of parabens  and phthalates. Works wonders!
