I received a small sample from Influenster to review. From what I could tell is it was decent enough, however I can not comment on the long term effects of using the product due to the small sample size. For the minimal uses I got, it seemed to moisturize, and leave skin soft. Will not be purchasing as I couldnâ€™t tell if it was worth the money or not. nan
