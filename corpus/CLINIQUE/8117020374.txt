The Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream is a powerhouse wrinkle fighting cream! I could see subtle results in just a week!  The rich cream smooths on easily and absorbs quickly. It only takes a small amount since the silky texture allows it to spread so evenly.  There is no odor and no residue or oily feeling is left behind. Just smooth, moisturized skin. My skin appears younger and feels more elastic after a few weeks use. The lines around my eyes and forehead have all but diminished. I am ecstatic in the results! I will be back at the beauty counter to buy this wonderful product from Clinique over and over! Wrinkle reducing powerhouse!
