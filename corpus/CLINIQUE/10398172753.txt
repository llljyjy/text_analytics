I have received this serum from #tryitfreefromtopbox and I absolutely love it! I started to use it every night after the eye cream and before the face cream. It had virtually no scent, a very light feel and went on so smoothly that it immediately made my skin feel good, and hydrated, almost plumped. I managed to make this last 6 days and had to have more  so I bought the line!! In my late 40â€™s my skin has started to lose it elasticity and firmness, I found this serum with the cream made a visible and noticeable difference, around my jawline especially. So thank you #freeproduct #tryitfree Visible Difference
