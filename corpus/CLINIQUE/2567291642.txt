I love the feeling of this when you FIRST put it on; skin feels super fresh, but then within 15/20 minutes, for myself anyways, it feels like it needs more... Not to mention that it feels a bit sticky but also slightly chalky when it settles, almost like a silicone feeling? I have the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel, and for me personally I find that works better. But it does provide a nice initial surge of moisture, it just doesnâ€™t last unfortunately? Might be good to use as a serum, under other lotions/make-up? Not long lasting
