I got this as a #free product from #topboxcircle. I like that the scent isn’t overpowering, and it didn’t irritate my acne prone/sensitive skin. I liked the light texture and my skin felt hydrated but not heavy after putting it on. I can’t speak to the effectiveness on wrinkles as I only had a sample size. I’d definitely purchase the full size of this product! nan
