I received this product free through Influenster to try and give a honest review. Was excited as Clinique is such a good brand and it was a new product.  Smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting cream is light and airy. No fragrance. I have super sensitive skin and haven’t had a problem. You do feel a tingling shortly after application. I haven’t used it around my eyes as I have a tendency to dry out badly and swell with applications.  I’ve been using for about a week now and would recommend a try. I feel like my skin is well hydrated and less fine lines with the applications of only a week. #clinique smart clinical repair# give it a try Worth a try.
