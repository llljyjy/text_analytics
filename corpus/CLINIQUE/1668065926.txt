Love this eye cream! Itâ€™s lightweight, sinks into my skin and goes on like silk. A little goes a long way. I was skeptical because I had a reaction to other eye products. But I even put this on a rash that was underneath my eye and it cleared it up within a few days when nothing else had worked. It also lightens my dark circles a little bit. silk-like texture
