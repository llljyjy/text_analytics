I just received the moisture surge from influenster! I used it today after washing my face. First thing I noticed was the cooling effect which I always love when applying a face lotion. I love that the product soaks right into your skin with out making it feel greasy or wet. I usually always have a lot of redness in my face, but I feel like this product may have helped take some of it away( could be from it being dry). I will definitely be purchasing this product as I love how soft it has made my face. Not wearing any make up has been normal to me lately while being pregnant, but a good skin regime is always a must. Love the cooling effect
