Super nervous to try this new formula as the 72hr was my Hg for spring/summer daytime moisturizer.  But so far I am loving it! I later this on top of my serum and my inlet list hylauranic acid and it keeps my skin nice and dewy moisturized for the whole day.  This pairs really well woth my chemical spf and think it could be a great pairing for a physical sunscreen since itâ€™s light and not heavy. nan
