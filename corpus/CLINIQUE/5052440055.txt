It’s hard to write a review of a cream that only contained 5 ml in the sample, so I can’t talk about long term results, but here are my first impressions: -good consistency; not too heavy for my combination skin;-I personally didn’t think a little went a long way, I had to apply quite a bit of cream to feel the moisturizing effect;-even though unscented, it had some chemical smell to it;-it wasn’t too heavy under makeup in July heat. All in all, not a bad face cream. If you want to give it a try, do it! Good face cream
