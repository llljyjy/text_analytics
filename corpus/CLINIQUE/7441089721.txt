I received this serum from TopBox for free. I use it before the moisturizer and it works amazing. It makes my skin supple and hydrated. The serum doesn’t cause any allergic reaction on my skin, which is great! The sample ran out after 3 times of use so it’s hard for me to tell the effects, but I will purchase the full size and keep using it. I like the serum in every aspect. Really recommended. nan
