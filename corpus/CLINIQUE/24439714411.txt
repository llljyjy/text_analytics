I was surprised at the finish of this one for it being a thicker cream. My skin soaked it up quickly and it has more of a water-gel cream finish. Had to go back for more pretty much every time, because it would just sink in. Nice finish in the morning, too. Ready for sunscreen and makeup without any trouble. Very easy to incorporate into my routine without any skin issues. I see faster changes in my face with other products, but will continue to use on the neck lines from looking down at my phone so much. Nice finish!
