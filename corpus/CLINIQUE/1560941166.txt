I received a sample size of this product to test (complimentary from Influenster) that lasted me about three weeks of use. I used only in the AM because I wanted the sample to last… Did it help reduce wrinkles? I don’t think so, I don’t think I used long enough to make that judgment. Did it maintain i.e. did I see any worsening of wrinkles? No, so that’s a plus, right… In any case, it did not irritate, in fact, it was nicely moisturizing on my combo dryness prone skin. This felt light on the skin, absorbed easily, and didn’t leave any sticky or thick residue on the skin after applying. This was not my last step (or first step) in my skin care routine and other products layered nicely. I do think my skin looked hydrated, bright, and healthy after use.I am torn on recommending due to this being a “wrinkle-reducer” and I can’t state I saw those results.  I am considering a future purchase as the product I am currently using that this would replace costs more than this product. Therefore, it may be worth a try given my experience over the last three weeks.  I think I recommend… but wait for a sale, that’s what I will do. Needed more time…
