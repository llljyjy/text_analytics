I love how rich n creamy this anti-aging cream by Clinique is. It’s dermatologist tested , allergy tested , 100% fragrance free and perfect for all skin types , even oily skin like mine. This Smart clinical repair cream is packed with multiple types of peptides , more than I can list. It also has hyaluronate , vitamin E , caffeine and natural ingredients like algae extract , St. Paul’s wort , whey protein and soybean seed extract. It glides on so smooth and feels so amazing , it also absorbs fairly quickly. It doesn’t feel heavy or feel like my skins smothering plus it doesn’t leave a film or sticky residue . It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and leaves your skin amazingly soft and supple.  I received this sample complimentary of Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest opinion and review. It’s a definite must try! Rich n creamy
