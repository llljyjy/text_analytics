I currently own this cleansing balm in both the smallest and largest sizes it comes in. I will say that the best and most thorough way to remove all of your makeup from your face and even if you don’t wear makeup, just sunscreen alone is through using a cleansing balm like this one. Most sunscreens aren’t easily removed with just facial cleanser alone. When it comes to makeup, you must use a separate product to thoroughly remove that, but all makeup removers definitely aren’t created equal. This one is honestly the absolute best that I have ever used. It breaks down sunscreen and makeup better than anything else that I have ever used before in my life, and it doesn’t irritate my skin or my eyes, and it also rinses away completely from off of the skin, without any greasy residue. You do have to thoroughly rinse this off, but as long as you do that, you should have 0 problems with it clogging your pores at all. This product goes on like a thick balm, but it immediately liquifies upon contact with your skin. It has a slight waxy smell to it, but it’s a balm so that is not a con, because the smell is not strong in any way and it definitely does not linger. I have very sensitive eyes and this product doesn’t bother my eyes at all. Honestly, if you came home late at night and were super tired and didn’t feel like going through your entire nighttime skincare routine, you could just use this one product and go to bed. This product is definitely one that I wholeheartedly recommend that teenagers, just as well as, adults get today. Because, it will make a huge difference in your nighttime skincare routine like never before. Plus, it will be able to 100% remove all of your sunscreen and/or makeup from your face at night, so that way, you won’t ever have to worry about possibly breaking out due to leftover sunscreen and/or makeup on your face that had not been thoroughly removed. This product truly is both life and skin-changing I swear! Best Cleansing Balm You Could Ever Buy!
