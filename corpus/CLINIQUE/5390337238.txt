This product was very hydrating for my skin. I have tried and used the original moisture surge in the past and I didn’t notice a significant difference with the 100H. It had a nice gel texture, which I prefer and didn’t have a sticky finish. I have oily skin and this did not make me shiny. It’s not a bad moisturizer, however there are better options out there! nan
