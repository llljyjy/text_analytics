I received a sample to review. I’ve been using it for almost a month. It has a nice smooth texture that goes on easily and doesn’t leave a residue on your skin. It’s been great at adding moisture without leaving you feeling greasy. I think my skin does look smoother after using it for almost a month. Nice lightweight anti-aging moisturizer
