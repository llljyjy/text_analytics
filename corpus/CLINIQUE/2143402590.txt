This is a good eye cream. It’s rich and very soothing on my delicate under-eye area. I have dry skin so I always try to keep it moisturized. I am a firm believer that’s a big part of aging gracefully. I’ve been addicted to Clinique’s Dramatically Lotion since my 20s. Now I’m in my late 40s, fine lines and firmness in the face is something to care for. I haven’t used their under-eye creams for years after having an odd reaction to it. So I was hesitant to try this. But went all in. No issues. Been using it for almost 2 months morning and/or night. And have enjoyed the texture as being substantial enough to feel like it’s effective but yet soaks in nicely. I have no issues using it under makeup. And I think it helps reduce puffiness I get in the mornings. I’ll keep using this to see what other results I get. A Moisturizing & Substantial Cream
