Have purchased this about 3 times now and make sure to replace it as soon as it runs out. It’s my most favourite makeup remover! The balm removes even the toughest of mascara. Although the consistency is similar to coconut oil, it doesn’t leave your face oily after its washed off and will not clog your pores. A staple in my skincare routine, won't clog pores!
