Believe all the hype -- Clinique’s cleansing balm is fantastic. My only regret? Wish I’d tried it sooner -- it’s just that good. Easily removes all my makeup, including mascara; doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. If you’re still on the fence, buy a travel size and see for yourself. Worth the money. Five Star Fabulous
