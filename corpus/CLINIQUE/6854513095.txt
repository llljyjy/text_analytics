I received this item for free from Influenster. This smart clinical eye repair eye cream has a nice texture and gentle scent. Not overpowering for those of you who are scent conscious. I don’t normally use eye creams, but using this has made me reconsider making it part of my daily routine at least in winter. After I cleanse, I apply my moisturizer followed by the Clinique cream under my eyes and on my lids. I don’t have many lines yet however my under eye area felt very moisturizer and quenched. The air where I live is very dry so I’m thankful for the additional gentle moisture this brings. Great for dry skin
