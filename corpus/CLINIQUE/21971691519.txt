I received this product for free from #topboxmarketing and I was so excited to try it. I have used clinique facial products in the past, and this is the first time I have used the “smart clinical repair“ wrinkle correcting creme and incorporated into my current skincare regimen for a full 7 days. After a full week of use, overall I’m pleased with my results. My face felt moisturized, replenished, and my skin appears to look smoother. I havn’t noticed any diminished fine lines or wrinkles. I believe those results would require more time & usage. I have always enjoyed Clinique products and I honestly think this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream should be considered a night Cream. I recommend you conduct your own trial run and see if you get the same results I did. I wouldn’t count this one out but I also can’t say it won me over. More like a night cream
