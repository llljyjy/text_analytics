I received a sample of this wrinkle correcting cream for my honest review. I used it once a day in night time. The texture is very creamy but not too greasy. I enjoy using it at night time as my last step of skin care. I found my skin very hydrate in the morning. I have tried my sample for 5 nights.  I am not able to see any result of wrinkle correction given the short period of time. Ultimately, I would say this is a very nice and hydrate cream. #freeproduct Nice Hydrate Face Moisturizer
