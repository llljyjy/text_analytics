I was honestly pretty skeptical that anything on the market would actually please my under eye areas! Many creams and serums boasted many incredible claims, and nothing has quite compared to this product! My skin fluctuates, seemingly with the planets and whatever is blooming outside. One day it’s dry, the next it’s so oily and I’m doing damage control! (I do live in Florida, so our weather is all over the place!) Because of my finicky skin, I decided to only use this cream at night, and I am super pleased! I’ve been using this cream for about a month, and the darkness I used to see is all but gone, my undereye bags don’t have their own personal carry ons, AND it makes the skin feel nice and hydrated without making it greasy! A little bit goes a long way, so this jar is going to last me quite a while! I also really like that the container is recyclable! nan
