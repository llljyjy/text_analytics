I was very impressed with this skin care cream. As I get older my skin screams for hydration.  This product definitely makes your skin feel moisturized.  The cream was on the thicker side but my skin literally soaked it all in with no greasy feeling or waiting for it to soak in.  I didnâ€™t even have to wait to start my makeup routine. Lightly scented and disappears quickly. A little of this cream goes a long way. Definitely recommend for hydration. I received this product free from Influenster and Clinique for my honest review. Great hydration for your skin
