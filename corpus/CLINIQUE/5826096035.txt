I got this product for free to give my honest review. I have combination skin (normal to dry skin). I love the gel consistency makes my skin hydrated but I do have to reapply it. Its has a light scent - so if you have sensitive skin this would be good. Not sure if it goes 10 layers deep - I might just have to more generous when I apply I guess. nan
