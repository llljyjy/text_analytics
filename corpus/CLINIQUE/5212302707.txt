I was given a #freeproduct sample of this product to test via TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I will admit I was hesitant at first to try a retinol-based serum as I’ve just started introducing that active into my skincare regimen (I’ve only tried it in a cream before testing this product). First usage I could feel my skin was responding well to it. After a few hours I noticed how my skin looked like it was glowing and smooth. I can see myself purchasing this down the road full-size, as I would like to see how my skin looks after a month of consistent usage. The foil sample I was given to test had enough for about 4 uses and if after that time I could see improvement in my skin texture, then I am convinced this will have even more amazing long-term results! Unexpected Favourite!
