I have really oily skin and this moisturizing gel works for me. I was hesitant to try Clinique moisturizer again after having a horrible experience with the original lotion a few years ago (I broke out so badly I actually have a few small scars and bumps to this day). But this is very different from the lotion IMO. The gel texture is light and refreshing and doesn’t exacerbate my oily skin; also totally unscented. It’s not mattifying exactly but it doesn’t make extra shine. When I wake up my skin looks and feels soft, not super greasy like most night creams I have tried. I use the Sephora mattifying moisturizer on my face during the day and use this gel on my neck and the two small dry patches I have on my chin. So far this routine is working well for me and I’m really happy with it. I would recommend for oily skin, this comes in a small tube if you just want to try it out. nan
