i received this as #freeproduct from #topboxcircle #tryitforfreewithtopbox  for an honest review. I love how non scented this line is i used it morning and evening. Doesn’t leave my skin greasy or oily with zero breakouts. It absorbed fast and left my skin feeling smooth, i loved using this in the morning under my foundation moisturizer. Not sure about any wrinkle remover like my other reviews on the sample reviews, don’t have enough to vouch for this product but the sample did prove it doesn’t leave my skin oily or it doesn’t break out :) Always loved Clinique for sensitive skin
