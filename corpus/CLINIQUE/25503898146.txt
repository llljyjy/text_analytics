This is a nice light serum. It’s slightly scented, would prefer unscented. I found it very hydrating on my skin. The sample size wasn’t enough to see long term results but the few nights I did use, my face felt fresh and youthful. I used it in conjunction with the face & eye creams.  #freeproduct Great everyday product!
