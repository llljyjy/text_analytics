I received this product free to try from Topbox circle in exchange  of a honest opinion. It cames as a sample size and there wasnâ€™t enough product to get the full effect over the time. But after just a couple of uses, this serum left my skin very moisturized, not sticky and I love the scent. It would have been nice to try this product more longer.  #freeproduct Very good serum
