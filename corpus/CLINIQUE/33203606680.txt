I really liked this moisturizer. It was hydrating and helped a lot with my acne. I used this cream with the matching spot treatment from Clinique and for a while it treated my teenage acne. It’s very light, doesn’t have and aggressive smell and is not sticky. I’m actually very happy that the smell is not too much, it’s a light smell of flowers and cleanliness. I definitely recommend it to my fellow people who are searching for a good hydrating moisturizer who can help some people with spots. By the way I have oily skin and it worked well. But I have to say this cream is a little pricey and I could understand why some would be hesitant because 55$ for a moisturizer is quite alot. If you have the budget I recommend if you don’t I’m sure you can find moisturizer as good as this one half the price. Excellent results but pricey
