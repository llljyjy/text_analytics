Definitely has helped clear my face from acne. I got off of birth control about 2 years ago and it was a nightmare having the hormonal acne that I did .I’ve been using this for over 2 years now and I tried to use and switch to things with more natural ingredients but they didn’t work but this worked like a charm, doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight and dry, my fave feels smooth. And I use the exfoliating cream that goes along with this once a week and my skin feels polished. Just wish the product was a bit thicker so I could use less (or at least have less squirt out of the bottle when I barely touch it) the company should look in to putting this product in to a pump bottle if they want to keep the formula this watery. works great
