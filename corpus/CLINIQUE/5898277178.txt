** I received these products for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review.**Clinique Take The Day Off™ Charcoal Cleansing Balm goes on smooth and comes off easily. It removes the oils and makeup really well. I was concerned that it was going to dry my face out but it didn’t. It left my skin feeling clean and soft.I absolutely love that Clinique Take The Day Off™ Charcoal Cleansing Balm doesn’t have a detectable scent. Works Great
