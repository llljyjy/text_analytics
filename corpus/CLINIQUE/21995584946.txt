I received the #freeproduct from #thetopbox in exchange for my feedback. It’s a shame that my sample was too small to give an in-depth review. However, I managed to use it for two nights and it made my skin feel soft and hydrated for the next days. I used it in combination with Clinique correcting Cream, so I can confirm it was a good combination… suited my skin type. nan
