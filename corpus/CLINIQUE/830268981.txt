Clinique wrinkle correction cream feels light and goes into your skin quickly. You don’t feel like you have anything there. It smells like a light floral. I have been applying it to my other eyes and in between my eyebrows and on my neck. I haven’t had any irritation. I feel like I’m seeing a little bit of improvement but I would definitely to give it more time. I think that the line between my eyebrows looks better. I think the lines around my eyes look the same. I received this product from Influenster exchange for my honest opinion. nan
