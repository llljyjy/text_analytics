This is a great cleansing balm!! It really removes every last ounce of makeup without leaving a funky film on the face. I only give it 4 stars because the charcoal gets in my eyes & gives me weird eye gunk everytime I use it. I would honestly stick with just their regular cleansing balm next time I go to purchase one because the formula is great! I received this product for free from Influenster & this is my honest opinion! itâ€™s good but beware!
