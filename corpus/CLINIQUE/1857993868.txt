I received this product complimentary from Influenster & Clinique to test. I thought it was a nice product. The cream is nice & thick & absorbed nicely. I found it very moisturizing. It kind of smelled like paste to me but it didnâ€™t bother me & the scent did not linger. I did see some slight improvement. I have acne prone skin so I tested this on my neck & found that the wrinkles did smooth out over time. I would definitely purchase to see if the results continued. Nice cream
