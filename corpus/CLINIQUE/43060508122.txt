I got a sample of this product from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. I’ve always wanted to try retinol serums, but didn’t know where to start. I was happy to get a sample of this one to try. Overall, the serum was pretty good. It absorbed quickly and felt nice on my face. I made sure to follow it up with a moisturizing cream because my skin will get dry quickly if I’m not careful. I didn’t really have enough serum to use it for more than two times, but I did like what I was seeing so far. Good first retinol serum
