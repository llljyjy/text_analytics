I’m actually impressed with the product, a dime sized amount of the watery gel like consistency is more then enough to cover entire face. The smell is barely there. My winter/spring skin is very dry, but coming into spring like it is now I’m very prone to pimples and breakout, after several uses I have had no breakouts and my skin feels and looks very hydrated. I’ll definitely be purchasing this as a daily moisturizer. It looks great under makeup !’ amazing
