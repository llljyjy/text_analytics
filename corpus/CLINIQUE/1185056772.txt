This cream is packed full of peptides and should help skin texture and health over the long run. It’s a decent cream and moisturizes well for normal/combo skin - I don’t think it would be enough for winter of for those with very dry skin. I can’t get over the weird chemical scent and that makes it unpleasant to use. For that reason I don’t think that this is worth the price - there are other peptide-forward creams out there for a lot less. Disappointing
