This was good while my sample lasted. I do feel that in order to see real results you need to be able to use a product daily for about a month or 2. It was definitely a hydrating cream and felt nice on my skin and was good under my makeup daily. There wasn’t really a smell which was nice because I don’t like my creams with a big fragrance. Overall it was nice and I would buy to use on daily. Nice moisturizer!
