I  received my clinical-smart-clinical-repair-trade-wrinkle-correcting-serum sample three days ago in the mail and immediately started the trial.The serum has a very pleasant texture it is both creamy and not too greasy.It is quickly absorbed by the skin and does not leave unwanted residues.No doubt it is too early to judge its effect.
