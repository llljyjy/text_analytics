I received Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from @topbox & @clinique for review purposes. I applied this to my face after cleansing. I really love the feeling of the serum on my face. It felt smooth, not sticky & has no scent. My skin looked nice & plump. Love that this will improve my fine lines and wrinkles. #freeproduct Feels nice on my skin
