I received a sample of the Smart Clinical Repair Cream to try and I have to say I will likely purchase more! I am 52 and always looking for something to hydrate my dry skin and combat my wrinkles and fine lines. This went on smooth and I did notice a slight change since Iâ€™ve been using it between my eyebrows and above my lip. It is fragrance free which I love, a little goes a long way. Would recommend!
