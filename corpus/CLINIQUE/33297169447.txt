Thanks to #TopBox, I received this product to try for free. While grateful, I do still get mixed feelings when I receive small packets of facial stuff to try because normally, you need to use such products over a period of time in order to see results. Hence, my review will solely be based on approximately 3 days of usage. The Clinique brand overall is affordable, looks pretty and in the past, has worked well for me. I used these products at night only. I do have a Clinique cleanser which I used first, and then I applied the serum, the wrinkle correcting cream and eye cream – in that order. So, for the 3 days at least, whilst I did not notice much difference, my skin did feel fresh and rejuvenated. I wasn’t overtly thrilled that the smart clinical repair (wrinkle correcting cream) had a LOT of ingredients – so I’ll probably refrain from buying either of these products. Besides, I also just learnt that Clinique is not cruelty free and so, I’ll probably refrain from using its products in future ☹ Such a shame, as I did use to like this brand. Sorry, not for me anymore
