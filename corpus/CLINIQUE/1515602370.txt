I have sensitive skin so I opt for mild facial products that pack a punch and this product is it!!! Initially, I was excited and thrilled to try this and my feelings still haven’t changed. I use this product on clean dampened skin applying to my neck and face every morning and night. You only need a pea size and nothing more. The consistency resembles a yogurt texture and really penetrates the skin. It glides so smoothly so you don’t need a lot. My skin feels quenched after using. The picture on the left was before the product was used. The picture on the right was 12 days later while using the product. As you can see, the frown lines around my mouth are diminished. I’m going to see what changes are made to my eye and neck area because I haven’t noticed much now, but that’s doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen. I would definitely recommend this to others!! nan
