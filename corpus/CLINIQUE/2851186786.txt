I used this sample for a free sample for a few days ago for my honest review. I can say honestly it had a light scent barely noticeable. I used this during the morning and night after I washed my face. I haven’t noticed a big difference with the fine lines around the mouth area that I’ve been using it for. I think if I used it for over a few weeks maybe more noticeable. #freeproduct Clinique smart clinical repair
