This moisturizer is super lightweight and soothing. It feels so nice and cool while applying, with the most subtle clean scent. It is so light that it leaves your face feeling freshly washed, without that tight after feeling. I enjoy applying this moisturizer at night before bed and also in the mornings as is wears well under makeup! 10/10
