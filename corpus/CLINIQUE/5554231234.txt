The product itself is great! Super moisturizing without being heavy or greasy which for an oily gal like myself, is a huge win! I had to dock off points for the fact that a giant multi-billion dollar brand like Clinique had to fish for reviews by sending customers pathetic teeny tiny 5ml samples. I get bigger samples from my local drugstore great product, so-so brand
