Works great to remove makeup and is super hydrating. Theres no weird smell and a little bit of product goes a long way. The only thing I would change is the color of the product. It was difficult to see if the balm was completely removing my makeup away because the balm is black as a result of the charcoal (which im sure has an added benefit to the skin). Overall, it did a great job at melting off my full face of makeup in seconds. Super Hydrating, Melts Away Makeup Fast
