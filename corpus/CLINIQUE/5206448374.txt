I used this product for a few days after receiving a 5ml sample through Influencer. It applies nicely on the skin, feeling soft and smooth but beyond that I was not overly impressed. The aroma was so strong it would make my eyes water which made it hard to continue using the full sample. For the price I would be purchasing a different moisturizer. nan
