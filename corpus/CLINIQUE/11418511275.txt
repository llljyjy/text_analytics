I got this #freeproduct for my honest review. After opening my free sample sized product I noticed it had a pleasant scent and I dabbed a little on my finger. The sample size was a tiny packet. I applied it to my face and it felt moisturized and soft. I used for several days until the product was gone and didnâ€™t see any visible results. I assume that use over a longer period of time would see results.  I would try again if presented with the opportunity. Sample size softness
