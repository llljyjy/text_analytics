The balm is really buttery and a little goes a long way. It was really effective at taking off my waterproof mascara and all of my foundation. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all and bonus points for not having a strong scent. Was a little worried it would stain my skin but it didnâ€™t and my skin felt so soft, clean and a little moisturized afterwards. Would definitely recommend to a friend! nan
