I received this as a free sample to review but I’m going to be honest. It’s just ok. I definitely did not see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and I used it religiously for over a month. I didn’t expect to see the lines go away, honestly but I WAS excited about the reduction in “crepe-y eyes“ it claimed but alas that did not happen either. So I waited to see if it would depuff or lessen dark circles- nope. So it’s just a really nice moisturizer. If you need a really luxe moisturizer, go for it! It's just ok.
