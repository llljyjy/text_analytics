Miracle worker! Before purchasing I read a review about someone getting it because they were having hormonal acne due to coming off birth control and it helped. That is the same issue I was having…until I got this product . It cleared up my face within just 2 uses. My acne was just a lot of little bumps on my forehead, they weren’t even read but it still worked and my skin is now smooth. Highly recommend nan
