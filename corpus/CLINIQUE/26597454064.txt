I received the Clinique moisturizer from Influenster for my honest review and I loved this moisturizer.  I have mature and dry skin, and I need to make daily use of moisturizers.  I loved the non-greasy texture and it left my skin lightly scented and fresh. It absorbs and hydrates the skin quickly. The only downside is that the sample was very small and I will probably have to buy this product to see the long term effects on my skin. Great moisturizer
