Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is quite lovely. It applies smooth and absorbs rapidly. My skin is instantly softer and more radiant. And my fine lines look less noticeable after a week’s use.  It doesn’t feel sticky or greasy on my face, so I don’t have to worry that half is rubbing off on my pillow overnight. I was only sent a single sachet to test, but a little went a long way. With continued use I can imagine even better results. Very nice wrinkle serum
