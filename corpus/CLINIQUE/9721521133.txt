This is hand down the best lightweight hydrating moisturiser that I ever use. I have been using it for the pass month and I really like the texture of it and it leaves my face feeling moisturized throughout the night. This has really improve the dry areas of my face and make the oily part less oily. I will definitely repurchase this product. Game Changer
