I really enjoyed this product! My only issue was the sample size and not being able to test it longer. I loved the texture of this gel-cream formula is went on so smooth and wasnâ€™t sticky at all. I have combination skin so I was very pleased that this formula was also oil-free. My skin was left smooth and hydrated and lasted two days before I needed to re-apply. I would definitely buy this product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know. Moisture Surge
