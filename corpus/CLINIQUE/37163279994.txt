I received a sample from influenster in exchange for an honest review. First, I found the sample size way too small to give an accurate review over a sufficient period of time but the results I saw after a couple of uses were not enough to convince me to purchase this product. I did like the lightweight gel formula but I didn’t find it moisturizing enough and certainly would not consider this to be a 100hr product. It absorbs quickly and I appreciate the true non scented formula but my face still had dry patches when using this product. It didn’t provide enough moisture for me to wear under makeup. Not the formula for me
