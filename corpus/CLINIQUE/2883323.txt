I recieved this through a sample size via influenster. It does a solid job in terms of moisturizing and not leaving skin greasy. I take a star off as it didnâ€™t seem to jive with my sunscreen and pilled easily. Also, for the price you could find a moisturizer at a lower price point that does a similar job. The scent is nice. I give this a solid B. Solid moisturizer
