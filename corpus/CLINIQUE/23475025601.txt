I received this product from both Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I used this product for a few weeks and I must say that I am impressed with my results. The cream is odorless and applied to my face easily. I used this product on my fine lines. The results are truly amazing. Additionally, I applied to my forehead too. I am quite pleased with this product. I recommend this product to others who are looking to correct their fine lines. Awesome correcting cream!
