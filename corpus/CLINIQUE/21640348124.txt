I have been gifted Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum by TopBox Circle. Their new de-aging line is engineered with CL 1870 Peptide Complex. I have been using it day and night on my face and neck and have noticed my face looks younger and my lines and wrinkles have been significantly reduced. Make sure to wear SPF and limit sun exposure while using Clinique’s Smart Clinic Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum, and the week after. #freeproduct A Smart Serum!
