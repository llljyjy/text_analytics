I donâ€™t normally like to wear eye cream because I hate the sticky feeling it leaves on my skin.  This cream completely changed my mind.  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome so my skin is more stretchy,  which means more eye wrinkles unfortunately.  This cream really hydrated my skin and minimized the wrinkles. Great eye cream.
