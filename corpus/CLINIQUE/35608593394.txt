I’m 52 years old and I’ve tried lots of different moisturizers. I love this new wrinkle correcting cream from Clinique! It feels like a drink of water for my skin. I use it all over my face and neck both in the morning and evening. It absorbs so well, doesn’t feel greasy at all. I love the way it makes my skin feel so hydrated and youthful. nan
