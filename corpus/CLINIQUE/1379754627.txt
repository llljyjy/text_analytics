I received a sample of this product through Influenster to review. My skin is on the dry side and I live in an area with very little humidity. This product is very light weight and scent free. I actually found it to be too lightweight for my dry skin. After the first few uses my skin felt dryer than usual (I’m used to heavier moisturizers). I wouldn’t recommend this product for dry skin, unless perhaps as a summer moisturizer. It’s light weight enough that it might be good in the summer or in areas of higher humidity. It’s scent free which is a plus. Normally I would use a skincare product for much longer before reviewing it, but the sample size didn’t allow for that, so I can’t speak to any longer term results this moisturizer may have. nan
