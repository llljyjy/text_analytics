I received this product to try out and I mostly love it! It’s lightweight and most importantly does not leave my skin feeling oily. The only downside is that I feel I need a bit more moisture or to apply more often but that’s normal for me with such dry skin. Overall I would say it’s a great product and my skin feels soft and smooth nan
