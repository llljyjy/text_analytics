This stuff is the only eye cream I’ve ever used that didn’t irritate my skin at all. I have extremely delicate skin around my eyes, and at almost 37 years old, I’m starting to see signs of aging like wrinkles, loose eyelid skin, etc. While I don’t think I’ve been using the cream long enough to see any major changes, it has felt like the skin around my eyes is softer, and a lot less flaky than usual.I did receive this product for free in exchange for this review, but I like it enough I would buy it again just for the hydration without any stinging like most eye creams give me. Hydration with no sting? Yes please.
