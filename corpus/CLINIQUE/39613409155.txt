I love how silky this eye cream is and it did not leave my combination skin too dry or oily. It is very lightweight and it helped to keep my makeup looking beautiful throughout and it did not set into any of my fine lines. Now the I am approaching 50, it is so important for me to find quality products that I can use regularly and this eye cream totally fit the bill! Silky & lightweight to help minimize fine lines.
