I received a sample of this product from#trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. I could only use it once on myface and neck area. I’ve used it at night as it’s fragrance-free and my skin felthydrated. I hadn’t felt anything out of the ordinary that this serum does with one use. I cannot vouch for its long-term benefits. As per the advertised results, you need to use at least 10 days tosee any significant changes like reduced lines and wrinkles. nan
