I received Clinique wrinkle correcting serum as #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange of my honest review. The sample was a small size but I liked the fee and the consistency of the serum. It was fast absorbing and super light on skin and didnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling and loved the light smell ofIt. Smooth and fresh feeling.
