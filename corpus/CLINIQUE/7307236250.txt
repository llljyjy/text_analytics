I have really enjoyed this product! this moisturizer is unlike any other I have used. I have normal to dry, sensitive skin. This moisturizer has a nice texture, not greasy or runny. No strong scent. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, and hydrated all day long. It layers under makeup well too. A new summer staple for me! A summer skin care must have!
