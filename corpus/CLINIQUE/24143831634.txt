I received a Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream #FREEPRODUCT sample compliments of Topbox in exchange for my honest review. While the sample did not exactly provide enough product to form an entirely well rounded opinion, I was still pleasantly surprised by the thicker, yet creamy textured fragrance free formula that absorbed quickly. I would most definitely continue to use it in the future. I also really liked the purple packaging and recommend this to anyone wanting smooth skin, plus reduced fine lines and diminished wrinkles from a gentle, clinical quality facial cream. Great starter sample - would love to try more
