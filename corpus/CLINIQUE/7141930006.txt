I received this product in exchange for an honest review with TOP BOX #freeproduct and although I didnt have enough for more than 2 triesâ€¦ i truly enjoyed the serum and recommend to anyone looking for a product that works on wrinkles and can be worn under any other cream or make up. Felt so nice and loved that the scent wasnt strong. And serum was not sticky. Great Serum!
