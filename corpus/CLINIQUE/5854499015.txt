This was the only facial sunscreen I could find while on vacation, and WOW what a white cast. This sunscreen is runny and leaves a heavy white sheen after itâ€™s been fully rubbed in. It protected my skin well, as far as I can tell, no sunburn nor freckles, but I looked like a ghost. There are far better options! Hello White Cast
