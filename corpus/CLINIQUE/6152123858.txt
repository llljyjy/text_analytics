I love this bronzer. Iâ€™ve tried other bronzers and  I always end up going back to this one! A little goes a long way and it definitely needs to be blended immediately after being applied to skin. If not, it will stain and not look blended and natural. When applied properly, this bronzer is the best and  makes your skin look naturally sun kissed. Love!
