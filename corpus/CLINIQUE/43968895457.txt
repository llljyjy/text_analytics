if you’re new to cleansing balms, i highly highly recommend this one. it is super gentle and safe to use around the eyes, something that i’m pretty reluctant to do with other balms. i like that the regular size has a little more product than others, and how easy this is to use. fancier cleansing balms are also nice, but this one never irritates my skin or breaks me out (but you should always be cleansing with a water-based cleanser after using a balm or oil to properly clean and minimize risk of breakouts) and is such a great product. the mini lasts a good amount of time too, and it truly does “take the day off“! BEST cleansing balm for all skin types!
