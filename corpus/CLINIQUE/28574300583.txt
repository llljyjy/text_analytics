I received this sample complements of Toobox Circle in exchange for my honest review. #freeproduct I love using Clinique products and was super excited to have a chance to try this serum. I found it to be a little runny to begin with but that’s typical of most serums. Even though it was thin, it was deeply hydrating and luxurious, quickly sinking into my skin leaving nothing behind. unfortunately, I was only able to use it for two applications so I wasn’t able to see a benefit but I’ve seen the reviews and they are fantastic. So far, it has messed well with my other skin care products and cosmetics. It contains fantastic ingredients and didn’t cause me to break out. I definitely love to try it on a larger scale to see all of the wonderful benefits it could bring. Super promising and luxurious!
