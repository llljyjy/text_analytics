I received a one use sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from TopBox in exchange for my honest review. I applied the product all over my face and it absorbed really nicely into my skin. My skin felt very soft and moisturized after application and it definitely makes my skin feel nice.  However, due to the fact that the sample was so small, I am not able to see if I will notice any improvements. Moisturizing!
