After using the sample I received I am impressed with the actual diminishing of my fine lines. The cream is smooth, light feeling and non greasy. I liked that it is fragrance free so I am not adding any unnecessary chemicals to my skin. A tiny bit goes a long way and it left my skin feeling moisturized and supple. An amazing product
