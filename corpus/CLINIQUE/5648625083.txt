I received a sample of this #freeproduct from Topbox to give my honest review. Unfortunately I was only given a one-time use sample so I cannot speak to long-term effects. The serum had no scent and had a watery texture which absorbed nicely into my skin. I used it at night before bed along with the moisturizer and eye cream. Together, they provided a nice smooth, moisturized feeling to my face. Overall, I would recommend the line. Clinique always makes high-quality products. nan
