This stuff is amazing! My new go to makeup remover. It’s a  silky balm that turns to oil that not only takes off your makeup so quick and easy, it also does not leave behind any greasy residue, like a lot of my past makeup removers have done. My face feels so clean and refreshed after using this product. A little bit of this product goes a long way, I’ve been using it for a week now and barely made a dent in it. Bye bye makeup wipes. I’ve found my new favorite makeup remover. Thanks Clinique you nailed it! This stuff is amazing!
