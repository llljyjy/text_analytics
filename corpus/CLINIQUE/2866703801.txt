I received this product to evaluate (#freeproduct) and it is scent free and is quickly absorbed into my skin.   It felt lovely and hydrated my face, but since there was only one application it was hard to see if it made an impact.  Samples should give you a couple of days to evaluate, but this is a nice product and Iâ€™d be willing to buy it. It was OK
