I like the feel of this product very much and it does not irritate my eyes at all like most eye cream does.  I am noticing a slight improvement in my overall eye skin elasticity.  I will continue using this product and I do recommend it for anyone looking to soften eye wrinkle appearance Great product - no irritation
