I do not recommend this to anyone with oily or acne prone skin like mine. This product felt very drying on my face and it also made my acne so much worse! The toner smell is very off putting - like a very strong nail polish remover. The mini cleanser and toner did last about 10 days as advertised, though the moisturizer lasted a lot longer for me. Luckily the moisturizer is the only product I actually liked in this set! Dried out my oily skin and made acne worse
