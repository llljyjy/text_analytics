This product feels really jelly on your fingers and face right when you put it on, so I wasn’t too sure how much I would like this. I prematurely judged. Once it soaks into your skin, it’s so light and makes your face so soft! I will more than likely make this apart of my skincare routine. I have dry-oily skin for reference. nan
