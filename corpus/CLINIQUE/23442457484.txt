I have been using the Clinique Smart Cream for the last month, I’ve used it every evening! It just takes a tiny bit for a full face coverage and acts as a great moisturizing night cream.  It’s really going to benefit my dry winter skin which is right around the corner. I will say I have a fairly normal skin but summer seems to be a little more oily.  It was a little heavy for me to use in the summer during the day and can easily be over applied.  I would recommend if you are prone to acne from heavy creams you use sparingly.  Overall it it’s a great moisturizer, not sure on wrinkle prevention but moisturizing is key to good skin beside cleansing methods. Great night cream !
