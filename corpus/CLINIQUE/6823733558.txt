I got a sample of this and thought this would be a normal cream but when I applied it, it felt soo soft and smooth. I feel like the texture might smooth out fine lines. It is hydrating and has a subtle perfumey scent. If you can afford it, I definitely recommend it but because I never see longterm results from eye creams and that this is out of my budget, I wouldnâ€™t repurchase. Feels like a silicone primer
