I received this Clinque Smart Repair for free from Influenster for my honest review.I really liked this cream I have pretty dey skin lately and this really seemed to work my skin soaked it up and left it feeling really nice all day it’s a very light cream to, it didn’t leave my skin oily either. It also has a pleasant smell not overwhelming. I’ve always really loved Clinique Products. Definitely gotta buy me some more cause this is the 1st outta many products to help my awefully dry skin.#CliniqueSmart @Clinique,@Influenster Loved It!!
