I received a sample of this to try.  The sample sizing was small so I cannot speak to it’s effectiveness but the texture was nice, there was minimal smell and I only needed a very small amount.  I only applied it at night but it’s recommended 2x a day.  I will definitely explore this product in future as serums are part of my daily routine and help my moisturizers sink in.
