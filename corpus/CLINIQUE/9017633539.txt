I have seen that some people prefer to melt away their makeup with this product, which I have tried. I personally prefer to remove as much as I can with micellar water and baby wipes and then wash my face with this to remove anything still in my pores/ any residue. I find it works great for this purpose and leaves you feeling fresh! Good for night routine
