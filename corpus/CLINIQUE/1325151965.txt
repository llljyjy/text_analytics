I received a 5ml sample size and was only able to test for 2~weeks. I like the silky texture and it absorbed well into my skin leaving me feeling moisturized all day & overnight. Unfortunately 2 weeks didnâ€™t seem to be long enough to notice and change to my fine line situation. If I was a Clinique devotee with wrinkles and fine lines as concerns, I would add this to my routine! A good not great moisturizer
