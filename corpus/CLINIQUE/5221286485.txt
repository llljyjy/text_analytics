I love this eye cream, is very moisturizing and I can see the difference when I use it, my eyes are not puffy but my under-eye is dry and dull and when I use this makes it very hydrated and bouncy, I like the fact that pairs really well with my concealer wich is very important for me because I use concealer almost every day Perfect pair with my concealer
