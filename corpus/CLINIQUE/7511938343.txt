I have been a Clinique ‘Take the day off’ user for years. It comes in balms, liquids and now with charcoal. I am older now and worried that the addition of charcoal may dry my skin out when I used it, but it did not. All of my make up comes off so easily and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not parched. Im a Clinique lover and this did not disappoint! I will definitely be getting more whenever I run out, but luckily a lil goes a long way, so I don’t think I’ll go through it too fast! I love this!
