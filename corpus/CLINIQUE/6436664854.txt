I had been using this product for years already before receiving a sample through Influenster! My skin is quite normal to oily in the Tzone and this product is about the only moisturizer that hydrates my skin without leaving an oily finish! It’s a true staple in my routine and would not go a day without it! It’s gel-like texture feels so soothing on the skin too! 10/10 nan
