I have been using this product for a couple of years now. I use it under my tinted sunscreen in the morning and after washing my face before bed. I have very delicate, thin skin that is dry and prone to rashy spots and peeling around my nose. This lotion is very thick, almost scentless, and calming. I would not recommend it for thicker or oily skin as it may not absorb well. I like to take a little bit of The Ordinaryâ€™s Hyaluronic Acid and mix it with this cream when my face is craving a bit of hydration along with moisture. This lotion is uniquely able to provide the high level of moisturizing and protection for my wimpy skin while also not clogging any pores or making my face look dull. Highly recommend. Excellent for delicate, dry skin!
