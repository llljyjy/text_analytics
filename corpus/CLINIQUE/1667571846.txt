I received a free sample of the Clinique moisture surge 1ooH auto replenishing hydrator moisturizer in exchange for my honest review. I previously tried Clinique products and this was an interesting one for me. I do like gel moisturizers and I was excited about one that sinks in quickly but also stays and hydrates my skin for that long. However I think the name is really misleading. I assumed it meant my skin would be well moisturized for 100 hours but that was definitely not the case. Not to say the product is not good. I like the gel consistency and I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. A little also goes a long way. However, I feel like I need to put more moisturizer on within a few minutes. I don’t find it very hydrating. I tried it both in the morning and at night but I didn’t really see any benefits. It missed the mark for me. Short lived hydration with this gel moisturizer.
