Literally ’sunshine in a sachet’ for my face! I use one sachet every morning on lightly dampened skin. It only mildly cleanses and therefore would be unsuitable for evening use and removing makeup, which is probably why instructions state to use in the morning. I massage this into my skin for about 30 seconds and then rinse off. Immediately there is a noticeable glow to my skin which I love, however I’m not so keen on the powder consistency - it’s so fine that when you tear open the top of the sachet and pour into your palm, some of it disperses into the air, so best to hold away from you. The first time I opened one, even though level to my waist, I could actually taste some of the powder as I inhaled. Now I just hold my breath when opening as I don’t think it’s all that beneficial to ingest this stuff! But nevertheless a brilliant product...non-stripping or drying in any way, on my normal/combination skin type. The Vitamin C in this gives me a lovely glow and the Salicylic acid helps with skin texture so I’m getting the best of both worlds when I use this.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
