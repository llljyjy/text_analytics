I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. First off, I have always liked Clinique products. I think iit is because it was introduced to me by my mom at a young age, and it’s because the products are good! I was very excited to receive this sample. Living in Arizona, moisturizing your face is everything! I feel like I use more moisturizer than most people because of the dry desert. I really liked the richness of the moisturizer. I felt like it did a solid job of hydrating. I didn’t see any breakouts or adverse effects. The only thing I’m not 100% sure about is the effectiveness of minimizing wrinkles… I don’t have a ton of wrinkles. I would definitely purchase this product after using it and feeling how hydrated my skin feels. Does the job!
