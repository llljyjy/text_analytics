I received the wrinkle correcting serum sample from #Topbox in exchange for my honest review of this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and I feel that this serum was effective. I used the product day and night twice and noticed my skin more hydrated and bouncy. It was quick absorbing and did not feel sticky afterwards. The scent was light and did not bother me at all. #freeproduct light scented serum
