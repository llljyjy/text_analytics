I received a sample of this as a #freeproduct. It was a very small sample so I only able to use it for a few days, using it only at night. I didnâ€™t see any significant differences in my skin during those two days, but I really like the smooth texture of this serum and how well it applies and absorbs. My skin has been aggravated by other products that contain retinol, but that did not happen with this serum...a huge plus for me! nan
