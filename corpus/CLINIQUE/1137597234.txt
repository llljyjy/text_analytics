I received this cream as a sample so it is hard for me to speak about the long term effects on my wrinkles. Using it I did notice my skin was smooth. But I was not very impressed with the level of hydration through the day. It is a fine cream but I am not sure it would replace the cream I currently use. Nice Enough
