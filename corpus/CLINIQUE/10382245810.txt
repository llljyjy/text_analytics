I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. It was a nice consistency and made my skin feel hydrated. I think I would have had to use it for a much longer period of time to notice any difference to my wrinkles. It didnâ€™t make my oily acne prone skin irritated or greasy. Overall a decent product Nice serum
