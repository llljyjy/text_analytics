I do not like the feeling of slathering on heavy-duty moisturizers and thick, greasy night creams. Yet water-based or gel moisturizers like Tachaâ€™s water cream do not seem to quench my thirsty skin. This moisturizer has the light consistency that I like, and leaves my skin dewy and supple. I put it on at night, and wake up the next morning (in my dry apartment!) with my skin still all plump and refreshed. Plays well under makeup too! Clinique is a classic for a reason. A light gel that quenches like a heavy cream!
