I just turned the dreaded 40 and am big on facial maintenance- so I was shocked when I noticed a big difference between this and my normal eye cream.  I have very sensitive combination skin and had no issues with this product causing drying or any issues.  It went on smooth and I thought my eyes improved within a week of using it. A staple for my new to 40-self!
