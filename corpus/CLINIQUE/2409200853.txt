I got to try some of the Clinque Smart Clinical Repair Line free from Topcircle. The Wrinkle Correcting Serum was okay. I just wish there was a little bit more. I didn’t see the effects of the serum on my face it wasn’t that hydrating. I wish I got to try more of this sample to see better results. #freesample #topboxcircle It was just okay
