I was gifted this product by Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been experimenting with many skincare products this year. This cream does what it says it does. It’s not too thick. It smooths out my fine lines temporarily and made my skin feel soft and hydrated. I don’t know how it will perform long term as I only tried a small sample. From what I experienced I would recommend. One star taken off due to the packaging. I had also received a sample of the eye cream and the container looks exactly the same. It was difficult to tell which one I was picking up. The print is very small that says “eye”. So I would recommend the company make the packaging clearer. Moisture
