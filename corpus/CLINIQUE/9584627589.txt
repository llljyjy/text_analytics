This is a nice anti aging cream. It feels kind of like a water cream it’s very lightweight in texture, absorbs not nicely. I got mine free and since the amount was a sample size jar, I don’t have enough to really judge the true anti aging components but it does moisturize well. My skin does look a bit brighter and more even. I think long term useage this could really work! It's light and smooth
