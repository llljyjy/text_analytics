I’ve recently really fallen in love with gel-creams instead of the usual thicker cream moisturizers. I’m on a quest to find the one that’ll be my go-to and this one is a definite contender. It almost feels like a primer with the way it smooths out the texture on my skin while I’m applying it? But it’s lightweight and still leaves my skin feeling hydrated for ages (even in my dry “electric heat” apartment air haha). If you like gel-creams, I’d definitely give this one a shot! nan
