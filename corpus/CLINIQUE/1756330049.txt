I really like this moisturizer for using under the make up. It is lightweight, provides good hydration and makeup applies great on top of it. It is not going to improve your skin or work some magic on your pores and dark spots, it is just a nice daytime moisturizer, thatâ€™s all. I usually buy it on sale and standard size 125ml lasts me all year. Great for under the make up
