It’s lightweight and not greasy at all, although it’s still so hydrating. I love how light it is on the skin and it gets absorbed so quick but still keeps my skin hydrated. I can actually feel to touch how my skin is hydrated. It doesnt have that greasy feel at all. It doesn’t smell too strong. I have combination skin. nan
