The Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream has a thick, rich texture and a little bit goes a long way. It is very moisturizing and I used it in my am and pm skincare routine; it worked well underneath my makeup as well. I noticed after only two weeks of use a definite firming and strengthening of my skin. I also noticed a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth especially. I would recommend this product to try for yourself. #complimentary #CliniqueSmart @Influenster Great cream
