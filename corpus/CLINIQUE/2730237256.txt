I received a free sample from Topbox in exchange for my review. I love Clinique products so I was excited to give the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting line a try. The sample I received was a sachet, so I cannot comment on wether or not it is wrinkle correcting, but I was able to use the sample both in the morning and evening for a couple days. I loved the consistency of the serum, and didnâ€™t feel sticky on the skin. It applied very smoothly, had my skin feeling hydrated and glowy. Definitely worth giving it a try. #freeproduct Glowing Skin
