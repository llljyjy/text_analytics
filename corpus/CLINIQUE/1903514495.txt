I have been using Clinique‘s dramatically different moisturizing lotion for a long time but I’ve never tried any of their clinical products and I am really pleased with this one so far. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming, and the texture is really nice and thick which is great since I’m using it as a night cream. I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to see results but I really enjoy how it feels on my skin and definitely keeps my skin hydrated overnight which is difficult in the dry climate where I live. Excited to keep using this one and seeing the long-term results another win for Clinique!
