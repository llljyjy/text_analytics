This product is great at taking makeup off and it does not irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts. I love it. My only downside is that it completely clogged my sink and nothing in the directions warns about this. Now i make sure to wipe it off with cotton rounds before i rinse, but i feel like they should warn of the drain clogging issue or suggest wiping off before rinsing. Great product but it clogged my sink
