I used this at night before bed. I liked that it was a lightweight serum but it did leave my skin feeling tacky. It didn’t have much of a scent and absorbed quickly (aside from the tackiness). It did not impart much moisture on my skin. I can’t say if it helped with antiaging to the small amount of product. The packaging is nice and the pump is a great addition. #freeproduct nice to try
