I really like the texture of this oil balm and the way it melts without becoming clumpy. I was worried the black color would stain my white sink or skin, but it all came off without issue! It removed all of my makeup, including my liquid lipsticks and waterproof mascara with minimal scrubbing and left my skin feeling very soft before I washed with a gel cleanser. My only wish is that it were cheaper!I received this cleaner free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. nan
