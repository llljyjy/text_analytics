I used this product for 10 days before writing this review. I felt immediately after only one use that the area under my eyes looked brighter. I don’t have issues with dark circles so I was impressed with how much brighter my skin looked. I also felt that my fine lines when I smile were fewer and less pronounced.Additonally, this product hydrated really well. Overall, I’m impressed and looking forward to seeing full results after more use. Great eye cream!
