I received this product as a free sample from Clinique and Influenster. First off I would like to say I did enjoy the cream. However, I only gave it four stars because I was only able to use it for about two weeks as it was a sample size. The moisture from the cream Absorbed into my skin lovely and was light weight and did not feel heavy or greasy. My skin felt glowing and healthy. I do wish I wouldâ€™ve been able to use it a bit longer to see if the wrinkle reduction happened. Seems nice
