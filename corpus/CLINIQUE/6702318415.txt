This is better than a regular daily moisturizer. I recently travelled and brought this with me for the plane, and it did a ton to help keep dry skin at bay. That being said, I didn’t find it long lasting, and while it did a good job at keeping my skin hydrated, it didn’t help on the dry patches that I already had. Overall, though, for regular maintenance, I’ve added this to my regular rotation.Disclaimer: I received a sample of this product from Influenster. Good product
