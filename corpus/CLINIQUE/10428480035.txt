This light Serum leaves the skin feeling prepped and hydrated for the rest of my skincare routine. It has retinol which is the best antiaging ingredient proven to fight fine lines and wrinkles. I like that this line is fragrance free. I can not speak about long term benefits as I only tried a small sample but it did leave my skin feeling soft and supple and caused no irritation. Gentle retinol serum.
