I received a sample size of this product from #influenster and fell in love with it. In the winter my face gets dry and flakey and since using this my face has felt very hydrated and not dry. I apply this before putting on my makeup because it helps moisturize, dries fast and hasn’t made my skin break out. It’s definitely a product that I will purchase a full size of.
