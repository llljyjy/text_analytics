This is an okay moisturizer. I can’t say much about this or its claims because the sample wasn’t enough. It has a lightweight consistency that absorbs quickly on the skin. It leaves the skin feeling soft, but I need a thicker cream at night. This product would be good to use under makeup. There are other moisturizers out there that I prefer over this and are Cruelty-Free, which is very important to me. I have dry skin for reference. nan
