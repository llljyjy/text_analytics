I received this #freeproduct from Topbox Circle in exchange for my review. The sample I received was enough for three uses, so my review is based on that. The serum is a nice texture, and absorbs quickly. It made my skin feel very soft. I think this would be a nice addition to my regular skin care routine. Nice Light Serum
