When it comes to creams and lotion, I can be like “meh, all skincare goodies come from serums, creams just keep it all blanketed in“, so I tend to overlook creams and al of their promises and claims. I just never figured that they could pack a nutritional punch like my beloved serums. But heeellloooo this stuff! I received it as a sample, and figured it wouldn’t hurt to try. I am absolutely floored with thr benefits I have derived since using as a topper to my serums in the PM; my skin hasn’t ever been this hydrated before. The fine lines are diminished, and my skin feels glow all over! I’m buying the full size, and this is getting a top shelf placement on my vanity! ❤️❤️💯💯💯 A new staple in my routine!
