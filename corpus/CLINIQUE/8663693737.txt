I received of sample size of this #freeproduct serum from topbox. It didn’t irritate my skin, absorbed nicely and the smell was not off putting.I didn’t noticed a huge difference in my fine lines but I feel that I would need to use it for a longer period to notice any changes in my skin. It does feel like a nice serum though and worth a try! nan
