I received #freeproduct sample from #Topbox for my honest review. It was disappointing it was so small for this serum, in particular, as it claims to be as effective as one laser treatment over 16 weeks. The sample I received was enough for three daytime applications. It went on smoothly, and while at first I thought it was going to be greasy, it absorbed well. The other products layered on top easily. I had no adverse effects as I’ve used a retinoids and vitamin C regularly for years and wear sunscreen with high SPF daily. The price point is the biggest thing holding me back from purchasing a full size bottle. All together, my other serums, retinoid & Vitamin C are still far cheaper than this combination product. For those seeking a powerful one-step alternative and are willing to bear the cost, I’d recommend this serum. Would love to try more
