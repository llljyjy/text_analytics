I received a complimentary pot of this new Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream with CL1870 Peptide Complex. I’ve been using it for about ten days now, every night and occasionally in the morning also, and my eye area is noticeably firmer. It has a lovely texture that spreads well so a little goes a long way, which is a huge benefit. It’s extremely gentle despite being so effective. I even got a bit weepy over a nostalgic Meg Ryan movie after applying it one night and accidentally rubbed some into my eye - no stinging! Although I received this one for free, I’ll definitely buy it myself again in the future when I’m stocking up on my Clinique favourites.Thank you so much for the lovely treat, Clinique! It feels luxurious and it works!
