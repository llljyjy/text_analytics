I received this free product to try from top box. It’s always a staple to add and try new products that will help with my skincare especially from clinique.This serum was added to my night time face routine. It was a small sample size so it was only used at night. The serum is light weight and hydrating and absorbed nicely on my skin. It wasn’t too thick and there wasn’t a strong scent. I would try this product in the future to see it’s effectiveness. #freeproduct #highlyrecommended Amazing staple routine!
