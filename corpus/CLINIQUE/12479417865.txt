I have use this product in the morning and night for a week now and I love it. It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. I can see small improvements with fine lines an wrinkles. I think in the long run, using it for a longer  period of time it will do a great job with wrinkles and fine lines. It has a nice texture and a soft scent. It absorbs fast into my skin without leaving it dry or oily. Great for under makeup. My skin looks radiant!!! Great product!
