I received this deluxe sample for free in exchange for my honest review thanks to TopBox! My thoughts of this product are that it works incredibly well! GoesOn silky smooth, not overly greasy and is delicately scented. Upon applying to my skin the cool and refreshing cream was absorbed quickly and left no greasy residue. Over the last week I have included this product in my skincare regimen and have seen definite results and would absolutely buy a full size to continue the progress. great
