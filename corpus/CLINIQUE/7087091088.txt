This product doesn’t really work for my skin. I have combo/oily skin, and I found this product didn’t really moisturize my skin. My skin felt more oily than it did hydrated. The texture was wet when I was dispensing it onto my hand, but it felt dry when I was applying it to/spreading it across my face, which was strange to me, for a moisturizer. I needed a lot of product in order to spread it across my whole face. I received a sample to try in exchange for my review and I had enough product for 3 days of application. My skin was definitely shiny after using, but I found it didn’t absorb right away. I used this product when I had to go to work and on my days off. I still have to wear a mask to work and I found that my skin felt gross and oily at the end of the day. My skin felt oily under the mask and I really just wanted to wash my face as soon as I got home. Even when I tried this on my day off, i had the same experience. I don’t recommend this product for people with my skin type, especially considering the price. I won’t be switching my moisturizer - my regular moisturizer is much better and my skin feels firmer and fresher even at the end of my day. My skin felt oily, not moisturized! Save your $$
