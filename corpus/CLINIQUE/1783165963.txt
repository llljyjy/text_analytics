I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest opinion. As somebody who usually uses La Mer, I approached this hesitantly. The texture is light and milky, it doesn’t really have a smell, and my skin felt hydrated right away. My make up set well on top of it, And overall it was a pleasant surprise. If you’re looking for a high-quality option that is slightly less expensive, this is worth a shot. Pleasantly surprised
