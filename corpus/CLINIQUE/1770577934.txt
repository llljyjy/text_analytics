This product has a nice light gel texture and dries matte. Feels good on the skin, didn’t break me out and has no scent. My skin felt smooth and was able to nicely apply makeup on top.  Unfortunately I didn’t see any major changes to my skin compared to my regular moisturizer.  One thing to note is that I did get this as a complimentary sample and the amount provided was only for 3 days and I usually like using a product for at least a week before providing a review. Nice gel moisturizer
