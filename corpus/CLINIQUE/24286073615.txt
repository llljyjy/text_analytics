I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am 36yo, combination skin. I use tretinoin which make my skin extra dry in some areas. Sometimes the skin around my eyes gets irritated from tret, and when that is the case every cream leaves a burning sensation except for a few very basic ones like cetaphil. I tried this clinique cream on my eyes when they were irritated to really put it to the test and was pleased surprised. It provided a good deal of hydration and didnâ€™t burn at all. It is very lightweight because of the gel like texture, it sinks into the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed. I am considering buying a bigger pot now! It was good. nan
