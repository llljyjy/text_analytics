I have combination skin. I’m always on the hunt for a good moisturizer that will leave my skin Dewy without looking oily. This did a good job at quenching my skins thirst but to be honest I didn’t notice much else difference. I wish it provided that glow you know? That wow did you just get back from vacation glow that some moisturizers can give. I had high hopes but it didn’t completely reach it. Overall a good moisturizer for those starting out. Good solid moisturizer
