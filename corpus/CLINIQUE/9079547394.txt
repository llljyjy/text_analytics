I received this product from #trywithtopbox in return for my honest review. I was able to use the product for a few days to see its impact. The serum went on my skin fairly smoothly and the moisture felt locked it. It didn’t feel oily at all. I didn’t get to see any wrinkle correction effects but it felt nice on my skin. Quick absorbing serum
