I received this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox and I enjoyed it. This cream was easy to apply and seemed to absorb fairly quickly into the skin. It was not sticky or uncomfortable feeling. I like to use it before bed to let it do itâ€™s job. I am 66 years old and I noticed my skin looks a little smoother and brighter. My wrinkles are a little less deep but I think I would have to use it for linger for the best results. I am happy with this product and I would recommend it to people to try. I really like it! Good product
