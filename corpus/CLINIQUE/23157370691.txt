This was my first time trying out a cleansing balm and this works great. It literally melts into my hands and on to my face and does a good job removing my makeup. It is very light and doesn’t feel oily on my skin. There is a very light smell to this product but it’s nothing overpowering or strong. A great cleansing balm!
