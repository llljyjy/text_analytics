This cleansing balm is very easy to use. It has a harder texture that turns into an oil when exposed to the heat of your fingers. It removes face and eye makeup quickly, and is easily washed off from the face. I like that it doesnâ€™t leave oily residue that can clog pores. Easy to Use & Non-Irritating
