I received this product free from influenster to try. I have tried many moisturizers over the last few years trying to combat the Canadian winters. My fat my skin gets fairly dry around this time of year. I found this moisturizer to be really nice and light and a little went a long way. This moisturizer was nice and hydrating and it lasted most of the day. It went on really nicely under my makeup. nan
