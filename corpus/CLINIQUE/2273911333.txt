I have always liked Clinique products. I received a few items from the line as a #freeproduct. I enjoyed the minimal fragrance in these products. I used them from 2-4 days for my combination skin. But this line tends to irritate my skin causing some light discolouration. I would suggest a test area before using this all over your face. Not a fan of this line
