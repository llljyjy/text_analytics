I am an avid user of Clinique products. So I was super excited to try this. This product is decent. I have to say I wish it was slightly more hydrating because it is winter. I can’t say I noticed a remarkable difference in the reduction of fine lines or wrinkles. Also it hasn’t helped much with any hyperpigmentation issues which I hope for my eye cream too. I am all around not extremely impressed with this product. I expected more from it than it ended up delivering as for results. Not As Hydrating as I would like for it to be.
