At the age of 41 I was happy to receive this product in the mail from Influenster. The cream felt nice and was nice too heavy, meaning it did not cause me any milia. But sadly, I didnâ€™t notice any difference in my under eye area. Maybe this is better suited for people suffering from crows feet, where as my main complaints of my under eye are dark circles. Just ok
