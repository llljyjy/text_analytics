I received a sample of this product through Influencer. The sample I received was small so I canâ€™t give a long-term review but here are my thoughts. As it was a small tube sample I cannot speak much on the packaging but the product itself was really nice. I found it highly moisturizing without being heavy but at the same time it definitely did the job. It wore very well under my makeup.The sample was enough to let me know that this is definitely a product I would try again in the future and seem like a good all over face moisturizer. Great moisturizer without being too heavy!
