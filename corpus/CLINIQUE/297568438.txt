I have been using this for years to take my makeup off. It is a reliable quality product. It takes all of your makeup off without stripping your face. It can even get the hardest waterproof mascara off your lashes. It’s best to put it on rub it in a little water to make it foam, and then use a washrag and sweep it off in a downward motion. It’s the first step to my two-part cleanse at night and I will continue to re-purchase this as long as they make it. A must have for nighttime cleansing
