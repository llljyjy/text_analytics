I received this product to test from Influenster, and while it seems that the cream works well, and has a good texture and scent. I use Shiseido serum and cream, and when comparing the two, I feel like the clinique does less for my skin. I’m sure if you’re a die hard Clinique lover, this cream will be your go-to. It’s just not something I would put into my everyday routine. Good, but not for me.
