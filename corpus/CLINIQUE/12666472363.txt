I was looking for a new cleanser that was fragrance free and stumbled over this one, which also contains salicylic acid. I don’t have a huge acne problem, but I did have some stubborn acne on my forehead. After a month of using this product, it has disappeared. My skin has become really smooth and the stubborn acne has disappeared (after a bit of purging, of course). I find this product easy to use and not overly drying for the skin. The product is fragrance free, but does have a smell. It doesn’t bother me too much, as I rinse it out anyways. Overall, very impressed and will buy again. Great product
