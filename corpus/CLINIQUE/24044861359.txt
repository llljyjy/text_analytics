I got this in one of the Sephora bestsellers kit (so a very small portion). I’ve been wanting to switch off of makeup wipes and I wanted to try this. It’s pretty good? Makes me feel a bit more oily then usual so not for oily skins like mine, and if you hate the feeling of oils then also not for you. It takes off makeup including waterproof makeup pretty well, but if you get in in your eyes when removing eye makeup it makes your vision a bit blurry so be careful. If you’re someone who wears makeup on a daily basis, this would be pretty good for you. Will I be buying again? Nah. Will I end up finishing it because I hate wasting product? Yes. pretty good!
