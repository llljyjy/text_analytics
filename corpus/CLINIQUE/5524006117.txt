I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. I just received a small sample, enough for two applications, but I liked it. The serum has  nice light scent that doesn’t linger after application. The serum absorbed evenly into my skin, leaving it feeling smooth but not sticky or greasy. The serum went really well under my lotion, makeup, and SPF. I’d love to try a larger sample of this one! Soft, smooth skin
