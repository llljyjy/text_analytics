i recieved a free sample of this product from influenster in my voxbox. it was exciting for me to try this product since i have been looking for a good moisturizer that can help my extremely dry skin. i used this product for a week, and my thoughts were not bad at all! i had to apply at least 2 times a day, but my skin is very dry and flaky so needs a bit more that normal.  may be for some of you it may last the whole day as it promises. it has a very mild fragnance, not disturbing at all and on applying feels light on skin,  non sticky and gets absorbed almost instantly. i may purchase a full size in future,  not too too sure, but again, not bad at all! light weight long stay hydration!
