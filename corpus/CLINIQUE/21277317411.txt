I had the pleasure of testing Clinique smart clinical repair serum for free as part of the Topbox Circle Product Review Program.  I was really looking forward to see what this lovely serum had in store for me. Not only did I see and feel the benefits of the serum on my skin, but I also loved the fact that my face never felt sticky or cakey when it was applied. No patches! As an added bonus, I loved that I did not experience any ’breakouts’ throughout my reviewing experience. In all, this was a winner. I will certainly be recommending it to family and friends and would love to purchase it in the future!#gotitfree #trywithtopbox Wow!
