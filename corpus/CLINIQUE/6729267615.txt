Clinique has a wide variety of moisturizers and if you have oily or even normal skin, this is not for you. it is definitely lightweight and sinks into your skin but it ends up leaving a heavy film on your skin after. I find that if I want to go in with makeup afterwards, I have to wipe this product off of my face. For an everyday moisturizer from clinique I would suggest their dramatically different moisturzing gel. Not the moisturizer for oily skin
