I received a sample of the Wrinkle Repair serum from #trywithtopbox and #Clinique campaign. To be honest, I cannot comment or review on the effectiveness or long term effects of the serum because the sample lasted only for a few days. As such, the serum has a light texture and blends well in my skin. Might buy it to see the difference in the future. nan
