I really like this product. The creamy texture is lovely and a little goes a long way. For me this is important when I’m buying a product, I really want it to last. My skin did feel refreshed when I put it on and I’m starting to see some small results. The skin appears brighter, a little less puffy, and slightly firmer. I look forward to seeing what the long term results will look like. As I get closer to 50 I’m noticing some sagging and light lining… gotta fight back!! Why four stars and not five? I got a bit in my eye and it itched…. All day… even after rinsing. Maybe I’m just sensitive. I did receive a sample product from @clinique @influenster for my honest review. Creamy and lux!
