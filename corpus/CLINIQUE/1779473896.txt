I received a sachet sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from #TryWithTopBox and Clinique for free in exchange for my honest review. I can’t comment on the long-term effectiveness and “wrinkle correcting“ ability of this product because it was just a 1mL sample. The serum has a light fresh scent. It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It didn’t feel sticky and didn’t pill under the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream.#freeproduct nan
