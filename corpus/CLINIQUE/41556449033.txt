I received the Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from TOPBOX #trywithtopbox.  only received the sample size but it lasted me a few days. I applied this serum twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. The serum is very hydrating and left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I will consider buying a full size of this serum to try it for a more extended period of time as I do think with consistent use it would help fine lines. Smooth serum
