I was given a single use sample of this serum in exchange for my honest review.  While I was not given enough to gauge the long term effects of this serum I can say that it was a nice thickness, worked into my skin well, it did not have a strong or unpleasant scent and my skin felt nice after using this product.  More product would have to be used to see if it left my skin feeling good long term. A nice serum
