I received this product complimentary from Influenster. So far, I like it. I personally don’t have any wrinkles, but preventative care is always great! It’s good for allSkin types, but I’m giving it 4 stars because I’m not fond of the scent. It’s not the worst but I don’t like it. It’s not too thick and it leaves your skin feeling nice! Overall I like it. My mom will love it nan
