I have combination skin. I have been leaning to a more dry side the last couple years. Before using this product my skin has had dry patches I just couldnâ€™t tackle. After using, for a couple days noticeably less patching. Overall experience of using is so pleasant, I love the texture and application that leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft highly recommend! Dry Skin be gone!
