I received a sample of this product from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest opinion. The texture of this serum is incredible. It feels so smooth and silky on my skin. It does not have a strong fragrance. Skin feels hydrated and very soft . My skin feels and looks smooth. Weightless texture. A little product goes a very long way. A great Serum
