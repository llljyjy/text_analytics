I was so surprised by this eye cream! I focus on my eye area a lot, so I’ve used tons of eye creams. There’s always something more I want from one or something I would change. This one checked everything on my list. It’s rich and creamy, a little thicker than you might expect. A little dap will do you!! It absorbs within seconds, there’s no dry time. It doesn’t leave a oily feeling but it also doesn’t leave that weird film that causes the delicate skin to feel a bit stiff and look like a crumpled paper bag.  Sooo moisturizing and hydrating. I can’t speak for long term effects. I will say that I don’t see how all of these qualities could be anything but amazing with long term use. Loooove
