My initial experience with the serum is that it has a silky, almost milky texture that takes a bit of time to absorb, but does leave the skin feeling a bit plumper. I don’t see much difference in skin elasticity or texture after one use, but that is to be expected. There is little scent. While there is dimethicone, it’s not bothersome and I wouldn’t be concerned unless it’s an ingredient you react to. Overall, this is a serum that I would be interested in exploring to assess longer-term benefits.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox Good first impression
