I received a tiny 5ml sample to try and review.  I did like the texture of the product.  It left my skin feeling moisturized.  There was no sticky feeling.  I wish I could have tried it for a long period of time to see how my skin would react.  From the 2 applications I got I have no complaints. moisturized!
