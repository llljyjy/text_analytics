Received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle in exchange for an honest review. I received a sample size so I had enough product to try for about 3 days. After using it for a few days, my forehead skin does feel softer and tighter. The small minor wrinkles don’t appears as deep too. The formula itself feels gentle, not greasy and most importantly, it’s fragrance free. Which means less chances of irritation. I recommend this cream for sure! Give it a try!
