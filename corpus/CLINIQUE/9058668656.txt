I really enjoy using this moisturizer. Iâ€™ve also used the eye cream and both have a pleasant gel/cream hybrid type formula that absorbs quickly and feels refreshing on the skin. I wish it had spf in it though. I feel like all face products should. Especially for something that claims to be an anti-aging product considering sun damage is #1 in causes of aging skin. Feels lovely, needs spf
