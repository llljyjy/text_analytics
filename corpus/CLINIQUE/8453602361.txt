I’ve used clinique since I was a tween and now in my 40s I still have nothing but positivity. These products work as they say and for a variety of skin types. The container is smaller than some other products which I like just as well for price point but this is still a solid winner. I’ve had it in my makeup bag and believe you will love it as as a staple too. A Solid winner
