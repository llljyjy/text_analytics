I received a sample of the CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum to test to test and review for free from TopBox Circle. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox.I was able to use this serum for two days, morning and night before I applied my moisturizer on a clean skin. This serum is very light, ha no scent and absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it well hydrated and creating a great canvas for other products to use as well as makeup. Overall, a great product to add to a skin routine. Great Light Product
