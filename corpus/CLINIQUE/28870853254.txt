I don’t know what happened to the formula but I used this a few years ago and loved it. I decided to buy it again because it’s winter and I don’t want to dry out my skin. This seems more waxy and greasy. It doesn’t take the mascara and eyeliner all the way off anymore. The formula is not as good as it use to be. What happened? Disappointed & Sad
