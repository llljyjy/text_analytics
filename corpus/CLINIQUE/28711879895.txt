In return for my honest review I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correcting cream to try for free through #Voxbox #influencer and #Clinque. I love the feel of this cream! It is so nourishing and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth, the formula is not greasy at all. It sinks in quickly so that I can go about my makeup routine after wards. It seemingly makes fine lines, skin looks visibly brighter after using this moisturizer. This is comparable to other expensive creams and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hydrating cream that are looking for a wrinkle corrector. A great wrinkle corrector
