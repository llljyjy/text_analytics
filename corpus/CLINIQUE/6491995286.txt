I received a sample of this serum #freeproduct for my honest opinion. It’s hard to really tell if this product works long term because the amount I received was enough for one application. However, I really liked the serum. It applied easily, didn’t have any harsh scents and kept my skin hydrated through the night until I washed my face in the morning. I liked the texture of the serum it wasn’t runny or oily but felt just right. I would definitely purchase this item again for longer term use. Loved this Serum!
