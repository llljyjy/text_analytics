When I first got this product I was skeptical as I am with any eye cream. It was sent to me complimentary in exchange for an honest review and while I was intrigued, I wasn’t expecting much. For an eye cream to do what’s advertised is like finding a needle in a haystack. I was sent enough for 10 days of usage. On the first few days I really only noticed that my eyes looked a bit brighter and I also really liked how it soaked into my skin. Over the rest of the week I did actually notice that my eyes looked less puffy to the point other people started noticing as well. My husband usually doesn’t notice anything that doesn’t have a golf club attached to it so that’s saying something! I would give it 5 stars if it would’ve made a difference with my wrinkles but again, after just 10 days I don’t know that that would be possible. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10 and I’ll probably be repurchasing this. I really noticed how well it worked after it ran out! Almost Perfect
