This serum is nice, it absorbs quickly into my skin so I could apply moisturizer on top. I didn’t find it had any scent which I love!! Unfortunately the free sample I received was very small and I only used it once. But what I did see I really liked. I used this at night before Clinique wrinkle correction repair cream and I woke up with my face feeling so hydrated. My skin is usually pretty sensitive and I had no reactions with any of this line up. I will be adding this to my Christmas list too. If you want quality products Clinique won’t let you down.
