I really love the Clinique charcoal cleansing balm.  It removed all of my makeup and when I rinsed it off my skin was not oily.  I did follow up with my facial cleanser as I would normally do after removing my makeup.  The cleansing balm left my face feeling hydrated and soft.  Definitely will be added to my routine. nan
