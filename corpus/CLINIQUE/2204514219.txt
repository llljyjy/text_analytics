I liked this serum! It felt hydrating and the formula felt nice. It was easily applied in the morning under foundation. It didn’t mess the longivity of my makeup. I aplied it for a couple of days and my skin felt good. However, I didn’t see any improvement of the firmness of my skin. For the price, I’m not sure I would recommend it. #freeproduct nan
