I received this product as a #FreeProduct. This serum was so wonderful. I was worried that it would leave my skin irritated and greasy. The serum was so smooth and not at all sticky. It glided onto my skin so nicely and wore well under makeup. It helped lessen how noticable the fine smile lines forming are. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Serum Review
