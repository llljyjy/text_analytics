I received a small sample of serum from Topbox Circle. I have to say this serum is quite lovely on the skin. It went on and soaked in nicely, leaving my skin feeling smooth as soft. The scent wasn’t too strong either which is really nice. I had no sensitivity reactions either. Because it is so pricey, I’m not sure I’d buy it again as the sample was just too small to tell any longer term results. Smooth, soft luxury for your face
