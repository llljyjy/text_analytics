I received this complimentary from Influenster and Clinique in return for my honest review. I received a sample size so I didn’t use it every day regularly and liked that I could put it in my purse when I needed to reup on my moisturizer throughout the day. It had a nice thick silky feel and very moisturizing. I felt it to be a little too thick for a regular face cream but probably would be great as a nightly cream. I didn’t notice any scent which I liked and didn’t use it long enough to really see any anti aging benefits. nan
