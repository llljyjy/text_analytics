I received this serum as a #freeproduct from Topbox to try. I really liked that the serum is light and absorbs quickly without leaving a film or tackiness on my skin. I used this serum day and night. I didnâ€™t have any issues with the serum under makeup. I wish I would have had a larger sample to try so I could see if there was any change to my fine lines. I would probably buy this in the future depending on cost. nan
