First of all, my skin is very acne-prone. I started using it about 6 months ago, in April. And I can tell it works well for me. I use the mask together with Caudalie Vinopure (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer), and they are also with salicylic acid, even though organic one. In the first couple of weeks, I didn’t see anything, that’s why I used it not very regularly. But then decided to use it minimum 2 times a week, sometimes even 3, just to finally finish it and buy another one (don’t like to overconsume). And I must say after 6 months of REGULAR use it works well. I don’t remember when I saw actually my skin really oily. Maybe it’s a good combination with oil-control Caudalie moisturizer, I don’t know. But I have good results on my skin. I usually do it at night. One thing that I noticed is when you keep the mask longer than 5 minutes on, in the morning my skin is oily than it usually is with all these products. So I leave it on strictly for 5 minutes. A good additional treatment to my skincare routine
