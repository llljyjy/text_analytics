I received this product as a free sample. Wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin! No reactions or burning. Felt light and easy to blend into skin. Unfortunately because it was a small sample that I was able to use about 3 times, I cannot confirm if prolonged usage would have a different affect or cause flare ups. Loved the feel, the smell and the packaging A sensitive skin must have!
