#freeproduct #topboxIt’s a fragrance free product so I less appreciated it. Is great for sensitive skin. I appreciated the texture and feel; it helps to moisturize. It’s not sticky and absorbed well. I didn’t observe effects due to the small quantity to be test. I did the test at night before sleep. Would need more quantity to try to make a solid judgment. My favorite!
