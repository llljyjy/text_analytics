Ive tried other Clinique products in the past and Iâ€™ve always had reactions to them, nothing serious, but I do get itchy where I place the product. It does feel really nice on the skin and I really do feel it all day long, also works really well as a base for my makeup. My only issue is this does irritate my skin and is slightly sticky and sometimes is pilling. Do a spot test if you have sensitive skin.
