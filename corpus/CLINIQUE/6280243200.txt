I absolutely love this moisturizer, I’ve been using it for a few years now. Recently I developed skin allergies and this was one of the few items I DID NOT have to stop using. It’s fragrance free which is rare to find these days! It absolutely does what it promises to do - hydrate! I use winter and summer with no regrets. It’s a bit on the pricey side so I took a star off for that but still love and continue to purchase! Love!
