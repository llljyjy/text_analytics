I LOVE this product. I received a free sample of the 100h from Influenster, but had previously bought the 72h and the moisture surge overnight mask. It’s a wonderful gel formula that feels cool and wonderful when you put it on. I have dry skin so it’s perfect for me. I’m not sure I notice a huge difference between 72h and 100h, but I love the product and definitely recommend it! Love this gel moisture for dry skin!
