I think this cleansing balm is more for oily and combo skin girls. As someone who has dry skin this cleansing balm is not for me. It made my skin even dryer and it would leave  my skin flakey. I believe that is due to the charcoal in the product. As a makeup remover it did good as a first cleanse but I would still have to use a toner after my second cleanse. I still prefer the original balm which works best with my skin type. Itâ€™s a no.
