I received a sample from Influenster to try. This cream is a little thick and sticky for my liking. When it went on it was very cool and refreshing but as it dried i was not a huge fan. If I rubbed my eye it would peel off a bit. I know at night you usually sleep through that but it would have been nice for it to absorb better in my opinion. I will possibly. Try to have a lighter application to see if that helps. Cool & Refreshing but sticky
