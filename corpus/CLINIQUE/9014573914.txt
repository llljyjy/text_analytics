I received this sample from #trywithtopbox and I used it for a few days along with the Wrinkle Correcting Cream and the Correcting Eye Cream. Since the sample size only lasted a few days, it’s hard to notice any long term effects. The serum felt nice on the skin and it absorbed quickly. Didn’t feel harsh on my skin at all. May consider picking up in the future for skincare routine. Serum Savior
