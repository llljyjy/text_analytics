I have been using Clinique products since I was 10 when my mother got me started on a skincare routine back in 2006 and have always kept a Clinique product in my routine. Since 06’ specifically I have always used the clarifying lotion 2 (purple liquid) but back in May switched to 3; I have sensitive, non-acne prone skin with rosacea patches all over my face and neck. It was recommended to me to switch to the clarifying lotion 3, as even though I do not and have not suffered from acne (besides a brief period of hormonal acne as a result of health issues for a few months, which has since cleared up) I was told this could help with my rosacea - other rosacea treatments I currently include in my routine is the use of an azelaic acid serum at night and BHA serum in the morning. Since the switch back in May (this purchase is my second bottle) my rosacea has almost completely cleared up and this is the longest I’ve ever gone without a flare up (summer is the worst and I would have one almost weekly). The patches on my forehead have completely cleared up, only half the patches on my cheeks and one patch on my neck is red - but significantly lighter in color; but for my whole face and neck - all of the other physical side effects of the rosacea has cleared. I can’t speak on behalf of people who suffer from acne, have oily skin or dry skin; but I can say that this has been a drastic positive change for my rosacea. The product also has not dried out my sensitive skin - but I have always followed the clarifying lotion with a hydrating essence before any serums, a thick moisturizer, and sunscreen. Huge help for Rosacea
