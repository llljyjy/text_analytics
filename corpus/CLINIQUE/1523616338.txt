Three things I look for in an eye cream: effective, non-greasy, and doesn’t cause milia.  This eye cream seems to meet all 3!  Very lightweight, fragrance-free and plump your eye area the bext morning. It’s also very rare for me to find an eye cream that doesn’t clog the skin around my eye area.  This is a new fave for me along with my mainstays like the Take the Day off line. Love
