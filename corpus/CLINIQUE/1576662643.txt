My skin is going through a seasonal transition where it is oddly dry. I feel like this is a good moisturizer as a base to layer with other moisturizers. It feels nice in the skin and not too greasy or sticky which I typically like in a moisturizer. Iâ€™ve heard a lot about this product in the past and glad I tried it! Definitely something I would use in the summer months as a lighter moisturizer versus in the winter when I might want something richer. I would recommend it to oiler skin friends. nan
