Loved this product 5/5. Received free Clinique product sample from topbox. I used the entire sample over the course of 3 days morning & night. I layered the Smart clinical serum, eye cream and wrinkle correcting cream. All three products did not have any offensive fragrance, greasy or texture. They absorbed quickly and hydrated my skin well. There was no stinging or drying. Nice alternative to perscription retinol. Super hydrating and lightning fast absorption
