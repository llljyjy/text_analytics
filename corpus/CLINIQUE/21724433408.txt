I freaking love this moisturizer. This moisturizer and Cerave’s are the only ones that don’t break my sensitive, acne prone skin out. I’m very picky on what I use for obvious reasons, but this works and keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Really helps with acne because dryness leads to more pimples. I absolutely love it, would highly recommend to any acne prone/sensitive girlies and guys. best for acne prone and sensitive skin!
