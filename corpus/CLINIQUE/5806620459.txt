I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. It has a nice gel consistency that makes for easy application. I find it is slightly tacky afterwards, but will set down eventually. It sits nicely under sunscreen and makeup without trouble. I find it very hydrating and a perfect product for those with dry skin but want something not a heavy feeling to use in the warmer months. I also think that a little goes a long way with this product. I canâ€™t make note on anything in terms of long term benefits, but I have always had good luck with Clinique moisturizers. This is one that I would definitely consider purchasing. Perfect for summer months!
