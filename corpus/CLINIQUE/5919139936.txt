It has a light scent and a nice consistency. I enjoyed using this at night before my moisturizers! I found my skin to be plump and smooth in the morning. Iâ€™ll have to keep trying it longer to see any long term effects, but it is great so far. My mother also tried it and she loves it. #freeproduct A nice serum!
