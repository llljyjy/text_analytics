I received a sample of this product to try c/o Influenster. It was a really nice light moisturizer for the summer. It did not irritate my sensitive skin and didn’t leave a greasy feeling on face. It also works really well under makeup.I would not use this in the winter when my skin is especially dry, but it’s perfect for summertime. Drier weather for me means a cream moisturizer over a gel. Great summer moisturizer
