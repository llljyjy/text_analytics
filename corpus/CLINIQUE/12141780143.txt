Thanks to my allergy eyes I’ve only been able to start using the wrinkle correcting eye cream the past few days so I can’t speak on wherher it’s made any difference in the fine lines around my eyes yet or not. However, I can say that it’s very easy to apply, feels nice & light with no greasy residue feeling. Plus, it doesn’t mess with my sensitive skin like other brands do. I’m going to continue use to see if I see any difference after a couple weeks. I’m a regular Clinique user so I can truthfully say that this is a product I would likely purchase in the future. ** I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary sample of this  from Influenster & Clinique in exchange for my honest review. nan
