i tried the cream and serum together. if i have the opportunity to do it again i will try one for 2 days then then other .after using this product for 2 days both morning and night combined with serum it might of been a little to heavy for my skin as 2 large pimples appeared .i loved the serum it felt silky on my finger tips as well on my face.after adding the cream my skin did not feel heavy but he texture was nice and a very very light smell. time for a trial
