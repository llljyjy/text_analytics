I can’t tell if I love this product or not, I was debating between a 3 or 4 but it does lean more towards a 4. It moisturizes so well initially and feels like a spa treatment but it kind of soaks up fast and dries up on the skin quick and no longer provides hydration (atleast thats what it feels like, maybe it still does granted it does say 100 HR moisture). But to the touch of my skin it will just feel dry. Not that my skin is still dry, but as if I didn’t put on anything. I personally like to keep feeling the hydration on my face though, so maybe that affects my opinion. This product also never caused me to breakout which is a plus, but its such a simple product that I kind of worry that I should switch to something that has more “skin benefits”. I might try something else and come back to this product. Its definitely worth to try because its genuinely nice, I think this is a great beginners moisturizer! Debatable love
