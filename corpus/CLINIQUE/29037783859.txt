I received these products for free from Influenster and    Clinique in exchange for my honest reviewThis might be the best ice cream I’ve ever used. I love how thick and creamy it is and that you don’t need to use a lot when you’re putting it on for it to work. I love that it doesn’t cause me to break out in the areas that I put it on my face. The tiny little jar will last me forever which is amazing! Super Love it!!
