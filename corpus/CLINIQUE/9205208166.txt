I received a small sample of this complimentary to review from Influenster. It has a gel cream texture, no scent that I noticed and did not feel greasy or sticky on the skin. I have oily skin and I tried it under makeup and I did look a bit shiny after several hours. I tried it as a night cream and would have preferred a thicker texture and more moisture for that. I think it must be meant for combination skin as a day cream. Overall, seemed to moisturize pretty well. Fairly good moisturizer for combination skin
