The wrinkle correcting serum itâ€™s cloudy semi liquid, a gel like texture. Dries as a glassy finish that does not stay dewy, absorbs and adheres well. I applied this at night on its own as a way to see how it reacts to my skin tone. It worked amazing for brightening my skin. Clears skin of any blemishes and this serum does not cause breakouts. My face had some redness although when I applied the serum it lightened my skin without a trace of redness. Serum has no scent. It said to avoid eye area although no irritation occurred when I used the serum that was good. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum has so many additional benefits. #freeproduct Brightening Clarifying Serum
