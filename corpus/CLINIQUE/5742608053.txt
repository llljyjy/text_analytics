I received a sample sachet size of this product in exchange for a review with my honest opinion. The main things I like about this product and Clinique in general is the lack of fragrance - I never worry about having an adverse reaction to my skin. I used the serum in conjunction with the wrinkle cream from the same line but the 1ml sample was not enough to make me curious to buy. Clinique is a good bet for those with sensitive skin. I did not notice any difference in the moisture level of my skin when using this serum so I don’t think it’s worth the price. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct nan
