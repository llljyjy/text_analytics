Had the opportunity to try Clinique Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer and really enjoyed it. I have dry acne-prone skin and my dermatologist recommended to only use oil-free moisturizers. This product hydrate my skin well and keeps it hydrated throughout the day. I love that it has hyaluronic acid because hyaluronic acid pulls moisture from the air and it made my skin looking plump and supple without making it look oily. The texture is very lightweight, almost like a cloud. It has a very delicate scent to it and although I did not wear this moisturizer for 100h because I wash my face on the morning and at night, I would say that this made my skin feeling and looking hydrated for the season. The only reason why I have 4 starts is because I’d have to see how this moisturizer works in the winter, when it’s cold the air is more dry. I received this product as a free sample. Hydrating!
