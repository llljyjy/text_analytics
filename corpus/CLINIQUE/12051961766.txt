Definitely not my favorite product. It does eventually loosen makeup from your face, but I really had to scrub it- especially eye makeup. It felt like coconut oil, so after this ran out I just tried using coconut oil- and honestly it worked much better with less scrubbing and much cheaper! Just get coconut oil- all natural, cheaper, easier to use. nan
