Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream is a very nice under-eye cream for everyday use.  I use it under my makeup and for my nighttime routine, with no issues.  It leaves my undereye area moisturized all day long with no breakouts.  A lot of heavier eye creams will make my skin breakout, but I did not notice that issue with this one.  I can’t say that I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles.  The first photo was taken on Dec. 22 and the final one was taken on Jan. 21, a full month of using the product, and I don’t notice anything different.  It could also be that I don’t have many wrinkles to work with, but I am using this as a preventative measure.  For reference, I am 38 years old with combination skin, and my under-eye area tends to be on the drier side.  The major issue I have with this eye cream is that it comes in a pot and not in a tube.  When the cream is constantly exposed to the elements, it loses it efficacy. It's a nice Eye Cream
