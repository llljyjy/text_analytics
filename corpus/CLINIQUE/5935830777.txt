Yeah Clinique you did it again! Thank you Influencer as I did receive this for free for my honest opinion. I have been using Clinique since I was 11 years old. I am about to turn 50 so this cream came out right in time for me.What I love is the lightness of the cream, it absorbs quickly and did play well with my other products. No smell but very smooth and cooling going on. It did seem like a little goes a long way. The photos are after 10 days of only using this cream, I did see fine line go away. I am very curious to see if I keep using this how it may work on making the stronger lines in my face softer. I also liked that it made my skin soft. I would have given it 5 stars if I noticed more of the heavy  lines fading- really noticed the fine lines filling in very nicely.  I also like the price- it a good value for the price, so really I would give it 4.5 stars.  Who knows maybe in a month I will come back and give it 5 after feeling itâ€™s long term effects. I don't look 50 anymore!
