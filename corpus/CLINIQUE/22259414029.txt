I got this product via influenster to review. I find that this is a very good product for combination skin. Lightweight, felt hydrating. I usually have very sensitive skin but had no reaction to this product. I first used this product after a night out of partying and sleeping with my makeup on. Instantly felt hydrated after applying it. I would recommend for people with combination to dry skin. Loving how my skin feels after a few days. Good for combination Skin.
