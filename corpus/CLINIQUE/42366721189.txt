I got this product from topbox as a #freeproduct in exchange of my honest review and the quantity was not enough for me to make a judgement. All I can say is that as a serum it has the perfect texture and really makes skin glow and hydrated. It might work on fine lines and wrinkles but I have not used it enough to notice that. Skin does stay nourished and feels smooth and plumped throughout the day. Clinique smart repair serum
