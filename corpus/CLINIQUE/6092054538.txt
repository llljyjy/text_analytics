Being in my 30s, it’s been hard to find something that is for my age range. This is a cleanser, but it does have that soft sand like texture. It doesn’t hurt at all and really helps clear any acne I have. I use this 3 times a week and even if I use it every day, it doesn’t over dry my skin. I continue to repurchase before I run out because I refuse to go without this. The price is a bit higher than I’d like, but this does work! Fantastic for skin aged 30+
