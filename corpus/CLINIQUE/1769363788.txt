I received a small sample size to try, a little goes a long way. It’s lasted a couple of weeks, and I can honestly see a slight difference in my skin. It doesn’t leave your face looking super greasy, absorbs well and leaves you feeling hydrated. My skin looks more firm and has a more healthy glow. Definitely will purchase the full size.
