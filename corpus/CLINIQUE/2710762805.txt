it removes makeup very well, especially if you emulsify it with water after warming it up a bit on your face. i’m giving 3 stars because it messes with my eyes really bad if it gets in there. everytime i remove mascara, it makes my vision go all weird and takes a while to go away. i repurchased it but i’m thinking i might try something new next time. messes with my eyes
