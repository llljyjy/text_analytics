I received a sample of this for testing purposes and I really liked it. The moisturizer sunk into my skin well and left it feeling moisturized and plump the next day. I didn’t use it for long enough to notice a distinction in my wrinkles but I enjoyed the moisturizing properties and it didn’t irritate my skin. If someone needs major moisture it may not be enough, but it didn’t feel greasy or heavy on my skin so I really liked it at night.I’m going to use it for a longer period of time to see if I see better long-term effects. I think it’s possible, I just haven’t used it for long enough to say for sure. Nice well-balanced moisturizer
