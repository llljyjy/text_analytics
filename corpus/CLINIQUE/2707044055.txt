I just received my sample, and used it along with my nightly routine. I was pleasantly surprised that it’s not at all like other Clinique creams I’ve tried. This one was easily applied and did not feel heavy or oily. I’ll come back when I’ve had a few days in and update on how well it works on my minimal wrinkles. nan
