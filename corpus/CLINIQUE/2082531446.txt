I received a sample from Influenster for my honest review of this product.  I was only able to try this product 2-3 times due to the size. However, the gel texture didn’t leave my face feeling greasy or sticky. My skin felt plump and I had a dewy glow the next day.  There isn’t any scent to the product which I appreciate and I didn’t break out after using the product. Great for Sensitive Skin
