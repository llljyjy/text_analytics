I received a sample gifted to me by Topbox Circle #freeproduct the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair.  The package was quite small and only lasted for 3 days.  Overall, the product was pretty good.  It was very light in texture and absorbed really quickly on my skin. It would be nice if the sample product would be slightly bigger to at least try for 2 weeks to see if it would have much effect on my fine lines. nan
