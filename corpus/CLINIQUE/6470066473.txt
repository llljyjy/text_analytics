I received a sample from Clinque and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really loved this moisturizer for my very very dry skin. It was thick, extremely hydrating, and leaves a healthy glow. It wore very nice under my makeup without any piling. I received a sample size so I really canâ€™t tell you if it helps to reduce wrinkles but a little goes a long way. I was definitely impressed with this cream, and will definitely be purchasing a full size. Hydrating and Glowy
