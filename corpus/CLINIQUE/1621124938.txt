I received this product as a free sample to review. To be honest it felt very nice when I applied it initially to my skin. Super hydrating with a gel consistency. However after 30ish minutes I felt like it just disappeared and I would start seeing it kind of flaking which I didnâ€™t like. It did provide my dry skin some juice so hence the 3 stars but I would need to use it longer to say if its really is impactful. Indifferent
