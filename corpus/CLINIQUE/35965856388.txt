I used this sample for about 3 days (morning and night). After washing my face, I would apply this serum. There’s no scent and that’s great! I like the texture of it. After application, I found it does help with the dryness of my skin. My skin felt and looked hydrated and moisturized. I know that this product is marketed to target fine lines/wrinkles, however,  I cannot comment on whether or not it reduces wrinkles as I have not used this product long enough to see results. I do like this serum - how there’s no scent and how it quickly absorbs into the skin. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
