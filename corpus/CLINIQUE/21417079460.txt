I was sent a 5mL sample in the mail and didnâ€™t believe it would do much. I small drop goes along way and lasted me about 6 days. I am just getting over a cold and had very dry skin around my nose and first use it was already looking better. Day 6 and my face and neck are silky smooth. I would recommend this! Love it
