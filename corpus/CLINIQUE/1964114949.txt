I have combination to oily skin. I get oily in my T zone. Though the sample I received was quite small it was hard to say whether it made a dramatic difference. The moisturizer has a great light feeling consistency. I love the fact that it does not have a strong scent. It felt really great on the skin.  My skin looked plump and smooth the next morning. I wished that the sample size was a bit bigger to allow me to see itâ€™s true effects.  I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Clinique to test and give my honest review. Super lightweight.
