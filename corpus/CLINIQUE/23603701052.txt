I’m in my late thirties with combination oily skin showing signs of aging. I’ve been using this clinical repair cream for almost 3 weeks now and I am impressed with the results. My skin feels stronger and looks smoother. The lines on my forehead are softer and not as noticeable. The cream itself is lovely and light, a nourishing moisturizer that melts into my skin. I like that it doesn’t leave a greasy residue. I use a few other products from Clinique and this is another to add to the list. Stronger, younger looking skin
