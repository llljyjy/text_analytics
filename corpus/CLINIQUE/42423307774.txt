I had the chance to try this product: #freeproduct #trywithtopbox.Time have damaged my skin, leaving more and more obvious marks and wrinkles. This product was perfect for me. The moisturizing of the serum quickly penetrates the skin and leaves a soft effect on the skin. It is not sticky and it applies easily. Itâ€™s easy to add to a skincare routine, but the effects take time. I was only able to use this product for a short time (small sample) and saw no difference. The product is nevertheless pleasant on the skin and its feeling is great. Great but no fast results
