I replaced my regular primer with this in my routine and I absolutely love it! Nice to get the sunscreen and primer in one so I didn’t have to add another step and just an added bonus that it’s much bigger than most primers are. Leaves skin soft, keeps make-up in place well too! My new favourite daily primer!!
