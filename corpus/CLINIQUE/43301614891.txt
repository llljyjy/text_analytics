I received this #freeproduct sample from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. The sample size is very small so I can only comment on the texture and immediate thoughts – I applied this serum in the morning immediately after washing my face, and I felt that it absorbed very well and dried down quickly and didn’t leave behind a sticky tacky feeling. I find that this serum pairs well with the Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Cream layered on top. Good but very expensive serum
