I truly love Clinique products and this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream is a wonderful creation by Clinique. The first thing you notice about the eye cream is that its thicker than your average eye cream so it does take a bit more effort and a lot less product! With that being said I enjoyed trying out the eye cream. After two weeks of using the product I did start to see the area around my eyes become fuller. A Little Goes a LONG Way!
