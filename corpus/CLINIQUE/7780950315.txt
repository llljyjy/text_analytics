I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I used it under one eye to see if I would see a difference.  The cream itself is very thick so a little goes a long way. The formula absorbs easily however it did seem to leave a residue . It does moisturize I did not notice much difference except the hydration which makes the puffy wrinkles actually not so much anymore. Hydrating
