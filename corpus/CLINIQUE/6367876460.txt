I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have oily skin and found this to work really well for me. Didnâ€™t add any excess oil and I find a lot of moisturizer does. I used this mainly on no makeup days but it does preform well under makeup also. Left my skin feeling supple and hydrated all day. No stickiness, little goes along way and absorbs quickly. Definitely recommend. I will be purchasing the full size for myself. Great
