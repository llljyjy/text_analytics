When I received notice that I would be getting to try a sample from Clinique, I was so excited! Clinique is such a classic brand that lots of people seem to use and like. Unfortunately, Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream is not the product for me. The cream is a nice thickness and texture with only a mild fragrance. I tried it for the first time at night. I woke up with my skin red and feeling very tight. I skipped using for a few days and then tried it again. Same issues again with a slight burning sensation. I don’t really want to give it more of a chance now. I haven’t done a deep dive on the ingredients to see whether something in particular is irritating my skin, but I have had a similar reaction in the past to other anti-aging products, so maybe it is a me issue and not a Clinique issue. nan
