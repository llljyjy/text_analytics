I love this moisturizer! I have tried other name brand ones within the $40-60 range, and I always end up going back to this. Fragrance free, doesnâ€™t leave an oily residue, and works AMAZING in very dry climate during winter. For reference I am in Alberta, Canada. I use this as my PM moisturizer and I always wake up looking well hydrated. Ultra hydration
