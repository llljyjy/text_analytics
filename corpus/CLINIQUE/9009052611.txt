Got this product sample free to try and review from #Topbox circle. I only got a small sample tube. I used it on my face after a good gentle exfoliation and toner product. The serum is a liquidy gel texture with noticeable odor. It goes have an opalescent pink shimmer appearance. I used it on my forehead and around my eye corners. It absorbed well and I didnâ€™t have to use too much. Skin felt soft and not sticky after. Hard to know if it makes a difference with such a small sample but has decent ingredients like retinoid, hydralounic acid, algae etc. Overall a decent product but price point is a bit high for me. Quality product but would need to use for longer .
