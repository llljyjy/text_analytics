I have been a fan of this moisturizer for a long time and find it great for all skin types. I have oily/combo skin and the lightweight gel texture really works for me as it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrating without that greasy feel. I love that it is oil free and I never run into issues applying makeup on top of it. I will definitely repurchase! Lightweight and Hydrating!
