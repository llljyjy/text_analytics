Received this complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have a very acne prone combination skin, so I only use light weight moisturizers... at first i didn’t like the texture of the this moisturizer, but after a few hours, my skin felt really hydrated. I’ve only been using for days, and no break outs yet. I think this product works best for dry skin. Hydrating Moisturizer
