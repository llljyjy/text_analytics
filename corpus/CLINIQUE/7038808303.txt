I received the Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serumas a #freeproduct from topbox circle courtesy CLINIQUE.I have moderately ,dry, sensitive skin This serum is sticky – it is not very moisturizing  and remains sticky on your face for hours. It does not absorb, and I’m unable to forget it’s on my face. I like the fact it’s fragrance free, but I wish serum sample came in a small tube rather then sachet which would allow enough product for more an adequate review since it’s anti aging serum. I love serums But I other ones that I personally enjoy more. It's okay
