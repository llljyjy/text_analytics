Usually I am wary with samples becuase I donâ€™t think I will see a difference with the small amount that I am given. I used the Clinical Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for just a few days and I noticed the dry creases near my eyes and mouth started to soften and appear more hydrated and elastic. It felt lightweight with a subtle scent and cooperated with my other skincare products/makeup. An easy and welcome addition to my skincare lineup #freeproduct A no brainer addition to skin care
