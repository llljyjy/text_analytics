I’ve used this stuff for years, mainly during warmer seasons as it can be a bit drying. I use it a few times a week. I don’t use it daily as I have redness and broken capillaries on my cheeks that are sensitive. This really removes all the dirt and make up without over-drying my skin. I use it on my neck too. I have sensitive combination skin. nan
