I recieved a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum in exchange for my honest opinion. Simply, I have only positive things to say about this serum! Itâ€™s creamier than other serums, yet light. It absorbs well and it takes only a very small amount to leave the skin feeling nourished and smooth all over the face. I used this serum for a few days in the morning and at night. Although my sample was small, I am thrilled to say that this wonderful serum did improve the overall look and feel of my skin. I have some fine lines on my forehead and those did seem a bit less prominent after regular use over a short time. I have no doubt that longer term use will lead to a more dramatic improvement in the look of fine lines and overall appearance of the skin. I highly recommend this product! #freeproduct Excellent Serum!
