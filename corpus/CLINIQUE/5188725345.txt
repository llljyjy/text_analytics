I have combination skin and I have usually used thicker moisturizer, especially during the winter months as it can get dry and flakey.  This moisturizer is lighter and perfect for the summer. It has a gel like consistency and lasts most of the day, but I would not say it lasts 100 hours as it claims. nan
