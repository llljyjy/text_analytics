First off, I’m not a big Clinique fan (or I wasn’t in the past) but this product is kind of a game changer! I never feel like mid range priced eye creams do a ton for the skin but this one actually made me notice my eyes looked perkier and smoother. My favorite thing about this is the texture - it’s like a whipped cream feel but it absorbs quickly and plumps the fine lines around my eyes instead of drying sticky. I’m only using this at night but I do feel like I look more rested in the am! If you want a retinol eye cream - start here for sure! whipped, creamy, and plumping
