I received this serum as a sample from Topbox and got to try out for a few days. It’s got nice slippy texture, easy to apply, doesn’t smell and absorbs fairly quickly. Combined with the cream, I believe I saw some faint improvement to my skin, but if I had more to continue, I’m certain I would’ve seen more improvement and results. nan
