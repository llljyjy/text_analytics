I received this free from Influenster and clinique in exchange for my honest review.   The picture shows 12 week results, but I received a small size that wouldn’t last that long so I dont know if I can give the best review of results.  The cream does have a scent (ur basic face cream smell, a lot of them smell the same) , not bad or strong.  It is very thick and moisturizing. A little goes a long way. It does make ur skin feel good. As far as anti wrinkle results..maybe...I dont know, I think i needed to try for longer.  This is a good night cream.  I do like it. Probably won’t purchase though. It's ok.
