Love the brand Clinique. When I use it, I notice a big difference in the health of my skin. This product is a refreshing gel, probably best for hot weather as my oily skin was able to remain matte throughout the day. Oily skin is usually dehydrated so this hydrating product worked great and stopped the shine. I would say it is a great product for that. It instantly feels cool upon application and dries down quickly. I was more than satisfied with it but I didn’t not use it enough to notice a big change in skin texture or anything else as my skin is getting to the mature stage and I would have loved that. It will hydrate your skin very well if that’s what you need. I reckon it would be amazing for adding hydration to dry skin as well. I would highly recommend this product if you are only  looking for hydration. nan
