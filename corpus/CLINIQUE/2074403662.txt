The cream has a lovely consistency and soaks in my skin well. I know it says *fragrance free* but mine had a definite smell to it that I didn’t really like. I received a tiny sample jar and didn’t notice any amazing results. I’m sure there may be some if I was able to use it longer. I did get a slight breakout on my cheeks. My other moisturizers do not give me breakouts. So I most likely would not try this again. nan
