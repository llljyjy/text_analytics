I have dry to dehydrated skin that is sensitive and reactive. I didn’t have any reaction to the product which is a big plus for me. It’s filled with glycerin which is something that you should always have in a moisturizer. My skin felt pretty plumped without the greasy-fill that some moisturizers high in hyaluronic acid have . I could not see any specific change in my skin since I did not have a full size product to try out. The moisturizer has a gel-like consistency which can suit nicely people with oily or acne skin. It’s not heavy on the skin and goes nicely under mineral sunscreen, and doesn’t pill. However, the moisturizer claims to be long-lasting hydration but for anyone with dry skin, this is not enough. At the end of the day, my skin was ok but the plumpness disappeared and my skin did not feel as hydrated vs the other moisturizers I have. This is probably due that my dry skin prefers shea butter, glycerin, ceramides  based moisturizers. A bit pricey for what this is but I do understand why would buy this especially people with oilier skin types or just want for their makeup to look nice. I would not recommended for what it is, there are better and/or less expensive products out here that provide similar results. I will not purchase this item. An ok product.
