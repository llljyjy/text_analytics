I had the chance to try this Clinique product along with the eye cream and the night/day cream because of Topbox #freeproduct and I can say these are doing wonders. I really enjoyed that the serum did not leave a oily and greassy feeling on my skin and it felt nourished and beautiful. I love putting this in the morning and felt like it added a little natural glow so I really enjoyed this. Would recommand! Light and nourishing serum
