I received a free sample of this moisturizer and used it for a week. I typically shy away from moisturizers that have a gel like consistency because I find they don’t do much for my dry skin. With that being said I found this to be very hydrating and perfect for my skin on warmer days. It doesn’t have a fragrance which my sensitive skin appreciates. The formula hydrates but doesn’t leave skin greasy on warmer days. It also works really well under my makeup! Great Summer Moisturizer for Dry Skin
