As part of Influenster I’m supposed to write a review on a product I never received. And I must complete the campaign requirements in order to receive future boxes however they never sent me anything. I’m extremely disappointed and the fact they didn’t contact me back to emails is even more disappointing. How I supposed to give a review regarding that?I have used this product previously so I was excited to do a review for once. my review though has nothing to do with the product itself. The product itself smells great and is a great moisturizer Product itself is great
