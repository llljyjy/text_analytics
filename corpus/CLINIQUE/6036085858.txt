I’d used the Laura Mercier face polish for years until they discontinued it and have been hunting for a replacement ever since. This is it. The fine grit of this really gives you a deep scrub but is still gentle enough to use a few times a week. I have sensitive inflammatory rosacea prone skin and I’ve had zero issue with this. So happy!
