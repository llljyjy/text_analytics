I got a #freeproduct sample of this serum.Honestly, I don’t see the hype. Yes, it’s a nice serum, but it’s not 90$ nice. Maybe it’s because I just haven’t used it enough, but I can’t say I see any wrinkle or fine line improvement. But I did find it very nice and hydrating underneath a cream. It just adds that extra oomph.All in all, nice serum, but nothing groundbreaking. It's  like most serums
