I received Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum as a #freeproduct to try for my honest review. I have been using Clinique for about 20 years and have always liked their products. I liked that it didnâ€™t make my skin feel oily like some other serums I have tried. It was trial size but I will be purchasing it as soon as my current product is finished. nan
