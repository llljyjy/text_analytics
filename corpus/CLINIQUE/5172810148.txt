Great at taking off waterproof makeup and especially waterproof mascara. It’s been nice on my sensitive skin and is part of my daily routine. I don’t see much of a difference between this and the non-charcoal version, but I also don’t see any negatives to it. I would say it’s more of a personal preference thing if you want the charcoal or the regular. Overall I like this product and would recommend it. Gentle remover for stubborn makeup
