I received this moisturizer for free from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Overall itâ€™s a thick creamy texture, very hydrating. I cannot attest to any wrinkle reduction claims because sample size was too small. If you have dry or combo skin, this is a simple effective hydrating moisturizer, that will keep your skin soft and supple. Good moisturizer
