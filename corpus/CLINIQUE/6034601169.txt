I always come back to this! I’ve tried soooo many balm cleansers including some super high end ones and this is consistently the best. It gets everything off, doesn’t leave a waxy residue like many of them, feels beautiful on the skin, doesn’t dry skin out, and just does what it’s supposed to do. Holy grail balm cleanser!
