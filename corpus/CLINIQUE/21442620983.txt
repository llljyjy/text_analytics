I have very fair and sensitive skin and break out easily and some products tend to irritate my skin.  Thankfully this one did not.  The texture was so smooth and it had an almost cooling feeling.  I didnâ€™t notice a lot of results immediately but over time I do think it helped the skin around my eyes looked smoother.  I would recommend this product. pretty good stuff
