I bought this when I was travelling and the sales associate pretty much forced me to get it so it wasn’t considered liquid and I didn’t need cotton pads. I was expecting to hate it and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was for my mascara to melt away. I did find it effectively worked when I’d do it twice, with very minimal product) takes but wow it works! I followed with a quick rinse of my face to remove any “stuck” residue. The skin around my eyes has been dry lately and this is gentle enough to keep that skin dry. I purchased the larger bottle when I returned because I’m hooked. I wish I tried this sooner, countless sales associates have been hyping this for years and I was too stubborn lol. I’m getting old… Melts mascara away like butter
