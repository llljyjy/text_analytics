The sample was a 2-3 time use.I used it in the morning after face wash and it felt great on the skin.I did see the packaging the store and itâ€™s a lovely purple also the bottle looks pretty amazing.It is fragrance free  the consistency is watery and almost melts in your skinThank you Clinique,would surely consider buying the full size Smooth
