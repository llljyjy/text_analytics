I do love Clinique and I was excited to try this product. Granted the sample I had wasnâ€™t enough to show long term benefits but I was able to get a feel for the product and really like it. It did seem to smooth my skin somewhat and I liked the consistency and feel of the product. I would definitely continue to use it! nan
