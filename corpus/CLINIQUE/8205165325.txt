I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. The majority of my positive review for this product was for the repackaging and putting more effort into using sustainable/post-consumer materials. As far as the product itself goes, I find it doesn’t live up to its name. I use the dramatically different moisturizing gel (which I love) as my regular day time moisturizer for oily-combo-normal skin (fluctuates) and I don’t find this to be much different than that. Some other moisturizers I’ve used that have really packed a punch in comparison are the YTTP superberry dream mask and the Farmacy honey halo. I know this is supposed to be more lightweight than those but I honestly feel like the Neutrogena hydro boost is more effective for a fraction of the cost. I wouldn’t purchase a full size of this or continue to use it. Doesn’t Live Up to the Name
