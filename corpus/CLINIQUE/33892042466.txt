I received this #freeproduct from #Topbox to test and review #trywithtopbox. I found it really hard to write a full review with such a small sample. I canâ€™t review the long term affects of this wrinkle correcting serum. However, with the sample I received I was able to notice that it is very moisturizing and absorbed nicely and smoothly into my skin. It also has a nice light scent, which is a must with skin care. Overall, a nice serum! Youma29
