I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I liked the fragrance free smooth consistency and how it did not feel sticky, it rubbed in delicately.  I have been using it for almost two months and I do see a little bit of a difference for sure. I am 48 and have smoked cigarettes for part of my adult life with one or two small wrinkles in my upper lip area that feel like they are going away. I donâ€™t notice them as much. Definitely a change!
