This serum is a gem. I tried a small sample as a #freeproduct and was so impressed the very first time I used it. It distributes across the face easily so there’s no product wasting. It absorbs into my skin quickly so I don’t have to wait much at all to begin to apply my other products. Best of all, it has such a luxurious feel on my skin that it almost feels like a mini-moisturizer. To me that means that aside from it doing the work of a serum it also boosts the work of my wrinkle correcting cream/moisturizer. I have to admit, I prefer the feel of it to the luxury brand serum that I presently use that I thought would be tough to beat. #topboxcircle I’m Very Impressed
