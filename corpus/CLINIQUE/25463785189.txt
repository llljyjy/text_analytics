I  received this product as a free sample from Influenster. This was a 5ml sample, therefore I’ll be reviewing my initial reactions since I cannot assess the longer effects. I loved that it is light weight and has a gel like texture. This moisturizer goes on smoothly and absorbs well into my skin. However, I have dry skin and I felt like this was too light of a moisturizer for my preference and it didn’t have the longevity of moisturized feeling on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a light weight moisturizer especially for the summer time. Good product
