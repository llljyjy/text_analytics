I used this sample for 2 day (4 times morning and night). My skin is combination. This moisturizer is gel like and very easy to apply. I used alone without any other of my skin care products because I wanted to give an honest review. When first applied my face felt sticky, but as it absorbed into the skin it left my face feeling soft and very moisturized. I did notice that my skin was moisturized all day which was good. It was also good to use with makeup, didn’t mess with my make up and that’s a plus. I think it’s a really good moisturizer and I would recommend it if you can afford it. Giving it 4 starts because I only used it for 2 days and can’t really tell if it could cause breakouts eventually as it didn’t break me out or be a good moisturizer in the long run. Okay moisturizer
