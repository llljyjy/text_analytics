I received a sample of this eye cream in exchange for my honest review. I have been using Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for 2 weeks. I have been applying it after I wash my face at night and before I apply my makeup in the morning. Since I began using it, my undereye area looks smoother and more supple when I’m bare faced. It is a bit thick, so I have noticed a little more texture underneath my makeup in my undereye area. I remedied this by tapping a little facial oil lightly on top of the eye cream to thin it out a bit before I apply my makeup. All in all, I am pleased with it and will continue to use it. I’m excited to see the long-term benefits this eye cream provides. Smooths Undereye Area
