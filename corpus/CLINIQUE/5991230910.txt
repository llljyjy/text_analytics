I’ve lost count on how many bottles I’ve purchased throughout the years and when I do purchase it, I buy three to four at a time because I’m just that committed to this sunscreen.  I love EVERYTHING about this sunscreen!  My skin is combo acne prone and I use this all year round.  I love dewy it makes my skin after applying it.  I don’t wear much makeup nowadays so this is perfect for everyday as it does have a slight tint to it.  The tint helps blur slight imperfections for me (minor dark spots, fine lines and pores).  This sunscreen does not pill up when I reapply or clog my pores so it’s a winner in my book.  Holy grail product for me and if Clinique ever discontinues this product I will cry for the rest of my life. Holy grail sunscreen for me
