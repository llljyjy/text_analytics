Really like this product! Nice and light and feels smooth on my skin. Texture is light and gel-like and not greasy at all. Blends in nicely. I have super sensitive and dry skin and haven’t had any issues. Giving only 4 instead of 5 stars because I’m not sure I buy the 100H part…like I said, my skin is super dry. It’s a solid moisturizer but 100 hours was not the case for me. Still highly recommend. Great moisturizer! 100 hours is a stretch
