Was told by the sephora associate that it “melts your makeup away“ and “a little goes a long way“ both of were inaccurate. I wear full coverage makeup and this product didn’t help much. I had to use this in 3 steps to get most of my makeup off. Use rinse, repeat...and it still didn’t remove all makeup. Makeup remover wipes work way better. If you wear full coverage makeup, don’t waste your money. nan
