After using this product I felt my skin feel smooth/silky. I used it Day and night and I really felt a difference in texture. My skin is sensitive, so this product didnâ€™t have a strong scent to it. I received this #freeproduct as a Sample from top box circle. I would invest in the full product size for sure. I recommend this product and others from this brand! Clinique correcting serum
