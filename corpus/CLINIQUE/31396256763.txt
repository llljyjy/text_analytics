I’ve used a ton of cleansing balms and the main problem I’ve had is eye irritation. No matter how hard I try, a little always get into my eyes (I also wear contacts so that doesn’t help the problem… they absorb chemicals). I found out that many cleansing balms have  fragrances, and those fragrances oftentimes contain linalool and limonene- surprisingly common eye/skin irritants! When you see lavender, rosemary, citrus, or really any essential oil steer clear around your face. If Farmacy’s balm hurts your eyes it’s probably the linalool/limonene. This balm doesn’t contain any of that. It doesn’t have any discernible scent at all, which is great if you’re sensitive. Works best as the first step in a double-cleanse. Doesn’t Irritate Eyes !!
