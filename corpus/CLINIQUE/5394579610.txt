This serum worked really well paired with the matching face cream and eye cream. It has a lightweight texture and doesnâ€™t have any greasiness to it. My skin just drank it up when I applied it and it felt smooth and soft.  I love that it has hyaluronic acid and retinol included. This product was sent to me in exchange for my honest opinion. #freeproduct Lightweight!
