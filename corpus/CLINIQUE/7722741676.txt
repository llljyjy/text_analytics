I received this sample size to review and even that small sample was plenty to try and review. A small amount goes a long way. In the summer a gel moisturizer is perfect. I have sensitive dry skin, but the ingredients being parabin and scent free keep my skin happy without any reaction! It keeps your skin moisturized without being oily, and it lasts. Perfect summer product
