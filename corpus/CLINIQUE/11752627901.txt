I used the serum on my face in the night before the correcting cream. It has a nice consistency, not sticky and absorbs easily. It has no strong scent as well. Canâ€™t really see wrinkles going away with just a small sample but having hyaluronic acid and retinol will definitely help skin in the long run. A great serum to try!
