Clinique Smart Clinical Repair cream worked great. It’s a light application to the eye area and does not leave a heavy feel. It’s has a vague natural scent and can be easily applied before you set up your makeup for the day. You can see a difference in the wrinkle removal after the 1st application and a more enhanced change with daily usage. Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream wakes up your eye area and keeps your face looking fresh. I would highly recommend trying this product. nan
