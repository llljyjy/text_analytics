Not including sunscreen and serums/moisturizer, the only makeup I wear is a healthy dose of mascara. This takes 98% of it off with minimal fingertip rubbing and leaves my skin so soft! After, there are a few little black speck in my under eye area but it’s worth it since I don’t need to use a cotton pad to forcefully rub rub rub my eye area. Love this product so much! nan
