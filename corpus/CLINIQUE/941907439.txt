Not too shabby!  I received this as a sample eye cream from influenster and I think it’s a great second choice to the eye cream I already use (I’m devoted.. lol). I really liked the lightweight formula of this, while it continued to be hydrating.  I hate it when eye creams are heavy and oily,  but this eye cream absorbed easily and was gentle on my sensitive eyes. nan
