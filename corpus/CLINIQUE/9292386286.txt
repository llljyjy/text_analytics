I received this product complimentary of Influenster for my honest review.My skin is combination to normal. I used this moisturizer in the morning and night, as it can be used at both times. My skin after using this feels supple, and nicely plump. This is a classic moisturizer that has a gel texture , yet it deeply moisturizers. Because my skin is somewhat dryer on my cheeks and side of my mouth, I found myself reapplying every 3-4 hours. I will probably purchase in the future during the summer times.
