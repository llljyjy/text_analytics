I appreciate that this eye cream is fragrance-free.  The texture is rich, thick, and refreshing upon application.  I notice an improvement in overall hydration as the skin around my eyes feels less tight/dry- which is especially important when facing the snowy New England winter!I’ve found, however, that the cream is incompatible with my winter makeup routine of more cream/serum-based formulations.  The eye cream pills with minimal friction and makes long-wear makeup melt off within a mere hour of application.  I don’t mind the product for nighttime use, but it’s a no-go for daytime for me. Good for overnight, no-go for daytime
