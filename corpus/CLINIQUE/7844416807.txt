I like it! I love how silky smooth it is, it just glides onto your skin and does a really good job of removing every trace of makeup, leaving your skin soooo soft and hydrated. It only takes a tiny bit, so this will last a long time! I probably wonâ€™t repurchase, as I prefer a cream based cleanser, but this is a top notch product. If cleansing balms are your thing, I 100 percent recommend this one! Excellent!
