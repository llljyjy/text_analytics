After trying a #freeproduct from Topbox for a week, I can say that this was not my favourite serum. Firstly, the fragrance on Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum is too strong for me. I found this serum had a very silicone-y feel so I am unsure if it actually reducing any of my fine lines. nan
