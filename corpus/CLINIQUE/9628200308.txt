This was unfortunately my least favourite of the three #freeproduct that I received from TopBox. The smell on this product was off-putting and I only got one use out of it. The texture was nice, I was expecting it to be more liquid-y but it was halfway to a light cream. I didn’t find that it really plumped my skin, having enough for 10 days (per their 10 day claims) would have been great to test out to actually see if that claim was legit. Texture alone wouldn’t have me making the plunge into trying this product. nan
