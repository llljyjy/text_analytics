I used it for the first time with moderate cosmetic application. Liquid eyeliner, mascara, pencil eyeliner, and filled in brows. It took everything off in a matter of five seconds. Not a trace of mascara or eyeliner on my lash line. I will say, be cautious if you wear contacts. I did this while still having contacts in and the balm must’ve seeped into my eyes because my vision was BLURRY. Surprisingly, no burning or stinging. I’m not going to trash a product simply because of this, just be aware of it. I would recommend following up with a cleanser. Beware of Contact Lenses
