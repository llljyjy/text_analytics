It works very well. I’ve tried the original cleansing balm from Clinique and I definitely prefer this one. I’m not a huge fan of cleansing balms but this is definitely a good one. I’m not sure if I would reach for this more than the other balms I have but it does work well. I have very dry skin in the winter months and this did not strip/dry out my skin. I’m usually weary of products with charcoal as it sometimes dries out my skin but that was not the case with this product! •this is an incentivized review but all opinions are my own• Works well!
