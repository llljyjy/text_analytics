Fav product for acne!! I love all my Clinique products and they work well for my combination skin. I have sensitive skin so I sometimes get the occasional pimples after wearing makeup, and I use this every night as a spot treatment in my problematic areas. I use it right after the toner and before using other serums and finish off with the dramatically different moisturizing gel. nan
