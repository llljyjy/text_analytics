Used this for roughly 2 months, I love the consistency of this serum, it’s super smooth and feels almost like a thin moisturizer on the skin, I think the salicylic acid did a good job as far as my texture and preventing acne but I honestly did not see too much of a difference with my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. So I like it in ways, but it’s just too expensive to keep going with and wait for possible results. I would skip if your on a budget… nan
