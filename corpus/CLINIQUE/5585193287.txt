I did receive a sample of this in exchange for my opinion. I have used this for the past two weeks in the morning and evening. A very tiny bit goes a long way. It is a very pleasant smelling cream, it is thick and creamy and you need to make sure that it is blended into the skin well. Very lightweight, and for a sensitive spot, it is very gentle on the skin. As for me seeing a difference, I think it has been very subtle, but has slightly smoothed my underwear area. I would continue to use for a longer period of time I order to see over time the changes. The fact that a little goes quite a ways, I feel value wise it would be a great bargain. I would recommend giving it a try. A little wrinkle corrector cream goes a long way
