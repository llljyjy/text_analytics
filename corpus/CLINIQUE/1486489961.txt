I am so grateful to Influenster for allowing me to try out this product for free! All opinions are my own. First of all this eye cream is very thick and hydrating. It applies smoothly and sinks right into the skin. The skin around my eyes stays hydrated  and plumped for hours! The only downside that I would say is that if you are prone to milia, this might be a little thick for you. Holy hydration!
