I received a sample from TopBox for my honest review. I found that this serum works at softening my skin. I apply it at nighttime and it is absorbed quickly into my skin. It has a light scent and no greasy feeling. My skin looks firm and smooth the next morning. I only have a sample sized sachet to test, so I cannot tell whether it would get rid of wrinkles in the long run, but I would be willing to buy the full size version to continue using it. #freeproduct nan
