I received a free sample of the Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer from Influenster and absolutely loved it for my dry skin. It is a gel formula and goes on smoothly. It absorbed quickly into my skin and did not cause any irritation with the few uses in the tube I was provided. It is not scented either which is important to me in a moisturizer. Not only did this give my skin a natural glow on its own, but it worked well under all my other skincare and did not pill or cause any weird interactions with my other products or foundation. I found this moisturizer kept my makeup looking better throughout the day by keeping my skin hydrated. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this moisturizer to any fellow dry skin sufferers. I’d definitely invest in a full size! Amazing for my dry skin!
