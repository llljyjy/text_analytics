I recieved a trial size of this product for free from Influenster. The first few times I used this it didn’t make much of a difference, but after a few days my skin was starting to look and feel better. I feel like this is a good long term choice, but not for someone who wants an automatic hydration look/feel. It was good, but was it great? I’m not sure for the price tag nan
