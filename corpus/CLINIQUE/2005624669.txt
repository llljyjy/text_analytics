I received this moisturizer through Influenster and I need to preface this review by saying I can’t give a legitimate one as the sample size wasn’t enough to discern whether this moisturizer was good over the 100 hours, or really gauge its effectiveness at all. That said, I did like that it was scent and oil-free and I love gel formulas because I have combo skin. I have used Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizers in the past and loved them so I’m sure this would be great long term, I just didn’t have enough product to test the accuracy and effectiveness unfortunately. The Clinique site says you can also use this as a 5-min mask, and for those who often mask up with clarifying or detox masks, you can add a 3rd application/day to help combat the effects of those. I was able to get just barely 4 uses out of the sample size I received over 2 days (AM/PM) and the application did feel nice and smooth. (Sample was 5ml) 2-Day Trial Size Sample - 4/5 stars ⭐️
