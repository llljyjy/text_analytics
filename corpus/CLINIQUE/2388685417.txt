I received a sample of this Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. I used this serum in the day and night after cleansing my skin and applying a toner. I like the feeling of the application of the product as it makes my skin feeling nourished, smoother, and younger-looking. Although I do not have fine lines and wrinkles, my skin does become a bit dry, especially during the cold seasons. This serum is perfect for my dry skin. I did not notice a scent while using the serum, but if there is a scent, it must be very light. Excellent serum for younger-looking skin!
