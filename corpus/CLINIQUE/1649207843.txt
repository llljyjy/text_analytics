I got this Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum sample for a review. I really like this serum. My skin looks hydrated and smooth. And feels softer. I am 40 so starting to deal with little wrinkles. I wish the sample was larger cause I was starting to see a decrease in wrinkles. Will definitely purchase. nan
