I have used many eye creams in my life varying from drugstore purchase to department store.  This eye cream rates in one of my top 5 for sure.  The eye cream is thick and rich which I really like for the dry winter months.  A very small amount of product goes a long way!  I immediately noticed that my eyes were not NEARLY as puffy in the morning when I applied the product the night before.  Puffiness and dark circles are my biggest concern at the moment so I am happy with the improvement  that was nearly immediate.  I will most likely be purchasing this product in the future for our cold winter months. Thick moisturizing eye cream - perfect for winter
