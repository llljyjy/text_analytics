I received this from Topbox in exchange for my honest review #freeproduct. I have to honestly say at first use I wasn’t a fan at all. It felt really sticky and heavy on my fingers. It absorbed ok but I had to actually wash my hands after since the residue was unpleasant. This did abate somewhat and i continued to use. It was a small sample at 5ml so I can’t give an accurate opinion on the wrinkle part. It did stay nicely on and absorbed fast. It had no unpleasant fragrance at all which is nice and expected for Clinique products. Not enough for an in depth review
