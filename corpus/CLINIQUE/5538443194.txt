Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is lightweight and unscented. It sinks quickly into the skin and leaves it moisturized. This serum is hydrating and works well with other products from Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair line. I used it at night under Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I received a #freeproduct sample in exchange for my honest review. Sinks right into the skin!
