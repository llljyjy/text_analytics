I received this product to review through Influenster and I was surprised by how moisturizing it was. It went on smooth and felt light on my skin but I was shocked by how long my face felt hydrated and looked dewy! During the change of season my skin gets so dry and this product seemed to protect against any dryness I usually experience. The only thing I would change would be the scent. I was hoping for a wonderful scent to accompany the aloe vera and other natural ingredients. Loving this Moisture Surge !!
