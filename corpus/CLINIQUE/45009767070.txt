I’m impressed with this product . I used it all week and I haven’t had a reaction of any kind. It is very smooth on your skin, didn’t have to use force while removing my make up & my skin was left very silky , not oily . I really like the fact that this product had no scent. My daughters also used the product on their skin and really admired how easy the product with es off mascara. I know this is now my go-to product . A definite must-have product
