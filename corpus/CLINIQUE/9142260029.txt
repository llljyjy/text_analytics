I received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle. It was a small package of sample so I am only able to review it based on a few times of useage. I apply this serum in the morning and at night. I like the feeling of the product on my skin. Aborsored very quickly, and no sticky feeling after applying it. I also feel my skin was hydrated after that. It worked quite well combined with the wrinkle correcting cream. It could keep my skin hydrated all day. nan
