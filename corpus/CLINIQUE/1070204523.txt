I have been using Clinique Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum every night underneath my moisturizer.  The serum is non-greasy, light and fragrance free. It is fast absorbing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not shiny.  I received a free sample in exchange for my review, but it is too small to see a difference in the look of my skin, but I do like how the serum leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Non-greasy
