When receiving a product called Moisture Surge, I expect a product that’s going to be BURSTING with long lasting hydration, and unfortunately this was not it. Upon initial application, it is a nice lightweight gel moisturizer, with little to no scent that made the skin feel soft. However, not even 10 minutes later it felt like I didn’t apply anything to the skin, defeating the purpose of this moisturizer Just OK. Nothing crazy
