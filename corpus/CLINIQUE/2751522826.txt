I received this serum from #trywithtopbox #freeproduct to give my personal impression. I really liked the feel of the serum on my skin! Non greasy, spreads easily! The fragrance is subtil. Iâ€™ll surely buy the regular version because it made my skin smoother in just 2 uses. Seems very hydrating! I would recommend for sure Loved it!
