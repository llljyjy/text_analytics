Received this product complimentary from Clinique & Influesnter in return for my honest review. The moisturizer is thick and silky. Applies so well to the skin and absorbs quickly. Leave the skin soft and super hydrating. I have combination skin in the summer. I did apply this moisturizer twice a day. It being such a small sample it did last me a week. A very little does go along way. I didn’t see much of a difference maybe because you need more time to show results. If your looking for a hydrating soft, silky moisturizer this is good for that. I don’t know about the wrinkle reducing & repairing part of this moisturizer but with long term usage it might work. Wish the sample was at least a jumbo sample that’ll last at least 3-4 weeks to see results. I’ll definitely buy this for my winter moisturizer because of how moisturizing it is and doesn’t break my sensitive skin out. moisturizing & hydrating
