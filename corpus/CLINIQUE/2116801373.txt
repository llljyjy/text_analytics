I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really liked the whipped texture of this eye cream and felt like it was very hydrating. After a few nights of use, I felt like my eye area was stronger. We have a newborn, so anything to help depuff, hydrate and smooth is extremely appreciated. Reliable eye cream from Clinique
