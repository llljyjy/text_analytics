I was able to use this product a handful of times even though it is a small sample. I really liked this product and used it every night. I woke up with my skin feeling hydrated and the thing I liked the most was I did not feel like I was washing off the product the next morning which sometimes happens with other moisturizer Iâ€™ve tried.
