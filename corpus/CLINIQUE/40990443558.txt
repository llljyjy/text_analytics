I love this product. I live in the high desert so finding something that is moisturizing with lasting effects is crucial. No greasy or thick feeling like you get with most hypermoisturizers. Perfect for daytime use but I feel like I get most benefit and can see visibly reduced wrinkles around my eye area by applying at night before bed. A moisturizing must-have!
