I have been using this product for a few months.  I purchased a Shoppers Drug Mart Exclusive with deluxe samples of serums.  I had the option to try one for free and choose the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum.  Itâ€™s light and not too heavy.  It corrects fine lines and wrinkles and smooths skin.  Love this product! Great addition to my skin care!
