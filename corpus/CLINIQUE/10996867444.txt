The serum has a nice texture and is fragrance free. I used this in the evening and found that it absorbed quickly into my skin. It didn’t feel heavy or tacky, which I appreciated. I can’t speak to any long term effects as I was only provided with a few uses in the free sample provided for review. Quick absorbing serum
