I have really dry skin and have been looking for a new lightweight cream moisturizer to the replace the one in my routine. My mom said she’s been using this one since the 80’s(!!) and we have similar skin, so I figured if it worked for her, it’ll work for me. And it does! I only need one pump and it glides across my whole face (after serum and essence) with a little left over for my neck. Absorbs really nicely and leaves my skin plump and soft the next day. I feel like the people saying it’s greasy aren’t aware that if you have *truly* dry skin, it’s good to have an occlusive lipid layer on top of the skin that doesn’t absorb right away in order to help retain moisture. A moisturizer that absorbs right away and doesn’t leave anything behind won’t do anything in the long term for dry skin. If it really leaves your skin feeling oily, you may have dehydrated skin that needs hydration rather than moisturizing (even though the terms are used interchangeably.) I wouldn’t recommend this moisturizer to anyone who doesn’t have truly dry skin, because if your skin is merely dry in the winter due to humidity changes, you need hydration from things like hyaluronic acid. THIS however works for dry skin which lacks oil. Hope that helps!! My new favorite moisturizer!!
