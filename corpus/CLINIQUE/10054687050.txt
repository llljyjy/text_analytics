This is the best sunscreen for my skin so far. I have been using this for 2 years so I decided to write the review. My skin is very sensitive and lots of acnes at all time. Eventhough I use the sunscreen for acne skin, it does not work well until I found this. It does not matter how dry or oily my skin is, it does not make any break out during past 2 years. I recommend this for anyone having sensitive skin MUST TRY for SENSITIVE SKIN!
