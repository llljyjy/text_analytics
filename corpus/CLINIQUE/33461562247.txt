I am beginning to get fine lines and wrinkles on my neck and face. So, this came at the perfect time. It smells great with a very soft subtle scent. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave an oily residue. After applying, my skin feels soft, smooth, and after using it for about a week I can already see my lines and wrinkles are beginning to fade. Overall, I am very pleased with the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream and highly recommend it! Saved by Smart Clinical Repair
