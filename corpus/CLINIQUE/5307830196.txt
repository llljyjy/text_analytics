I’ll start this review by saying I have normal skin. I love the formula of this moisturizer and how it makes my skin feel refreshed but not sticky. If you apply too much it can feel sticky but once you find the “sweet-spot” for your skin, it dries nicely. I believe the claim of being a 100 hour moisturizer is extreme and misleading. It helps me stay moisturized thorough out a day and is good under my makeup, but I wouldn’t say it improved my skin long term or for 100 hours. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product for someone looking for a decent moisturizer that isn’t going to hurt their skin, but warn them that it isn’t going to greatly improve any one concern either. Decent Product for a Great Price!
