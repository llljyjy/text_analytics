For those sensitive to scents and color, this is for you. Personally I like soft, fresh scents in my skincare but when my skin flairs for no good reason I am happy to have a product such as this in my arsenal. A little goes such a long way. It has such a silky-smooth luxurious feel to it but it is by no means thin. This thick emollient cream has the potential to take me all the way through the winter with healthy moisturized skin. I find that it works well on it own and as the cream stage in my skincare regimen by sealing everything in. Just in time for cooler weather
