This serum hit different and I think I like it! I really enjoy using serums, and they’re typically something I tend to only use at night because they can make my face look oily/a bit too shiny for a while. This serum was almost creamy and really felt great to put on. I felt that it went directly into my skin and I didn’t have that greasy look afterwards. I’d feel confident using morning and evening. There is little to no scent. I wish I could give an opinion on the actual results of the serum, but, unfortunately, the sample size was too small to give an informed opinion. #freeproduct Very nice
