I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.This wrinkle-fighting cream is heavy, but absorbs well. I’ve been using it at night since it feels too thick for the day. It has no perceptible fragrance.Since I was gifted a sample size, I haven’t used it long enough to notice any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles.It is moisturizing, but a bit greasy for my combination skin. It am not impressed really. Moisturizing night cream, not impressed
