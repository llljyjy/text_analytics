I like the texture of this moisturizer, it’s slightly thicker than a typical gel moisturizer. Also fragrance free, which is great.I love the initial application, it sinks into my skin almost instantly and gives a nice hit of hydration. However, I don’t feel this penetrates deep into skin and the hydration is not long lasting for me.Dislike products with gimmicky/outlandish claims like 100 hours, especially since this does not hold up.Definitely didn’t experience any glow, if anything I found this to be mattifying.I only received enough to sample for about a week, but overall I would just say this is a very average moisturizer and there’s other’s I like better. Feels great, at first
