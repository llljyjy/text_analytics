I received a small sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum in exchange for a review. Product is lightweight, absorbs quickly and felt good on my skin. I canâ€™t comment on the long term effects of diminishing wrinkles but I was happy with the product. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
