I enjoyed the creamy texture & light scent of this cream. It reminds me of a Lancome cream I like. My skin felt soft, fresh, & hydrated when I woke up but I didn’t use it long enough to speak to its effectiveness. My opinion is that it’s overall a pleasant cream with some good wrinkle fighting ingredients.I received this sample size from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. A Pleasant Cream
