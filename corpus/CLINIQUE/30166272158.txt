I recieved this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for an honest review.  I recieved a small sample of the serum so I cannot judge how well it works on wrinkles. I used the serum in the morning before I addrd the corresponding cream. I found a little went a long way. It absorbed very well into my skin and it wasnâ€™t greasy.  I put it on and let it dry then added the cream. I am very much interested in buying the serum to see how well it works for my wrinkles. Love it!
