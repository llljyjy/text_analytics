I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I found the cream moisturizing and left my skin feeling hydrated and soft. I give four stars because there was a bit of a learning curve in application. I found if I applied too much, it would pill under my foundation and would run off both if I tried to blend. However, once I figured out how much to apply, I was satisfied with the results. Left my Skin Hydrated and Soft
