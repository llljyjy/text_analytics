I’ve used a lot of eye creams and this is by far my favorite. I get flare ups of dermatitis around my eyes and it hasn’t happened since using this and it doesn’t sting upon application like some others I’ve tried. It doesn’t really help with under eye bags, but I’ve noticed my crow’s feet are less pronounced. It’s a little pricey but the smaller size lasted me around 2-3 months. nan
