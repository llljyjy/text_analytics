I wanted to give this five stars because it is a nice product, but I probably will not purchase it. I have fairly dry skin, so I prefer a rich cream moisturizer over something like this which is a gel. This might work well for me during the day, but not overnight. It just didnâ€™t leave me feeling moisturized enough overnight. Nice but not for overnight on dry skin
