I received these products for free from Influenster and COVERGIRL in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now and I’m loving the way my skin looks. It feels so soft and I do think the fine lines around my mouth and eyes look less noticeable. It hasn’t broken me out either and that’s always a concern of mine as my skin is rather sensitive that way. It absorbs completely and doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and there is no scent which is nice. If you’re on the fence I say go for it,  I think you’ll like it. A solid addition to my skin care routine.
