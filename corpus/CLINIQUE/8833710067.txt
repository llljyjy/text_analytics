I had used this product in the past and enjoyed it so, I thought I’d go back to it but this time around it definitely wasn’t for me. It wasn’t hydrating at all & left my skin feeling dry. It even exaggerated my dry spots after it was on my skin for a few hours which is crazy given the 72 hour hydration claim. Not hydrating at all!
