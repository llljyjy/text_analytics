I’m a Clinique fan to begin with but I haven’t tried anything for wrinkles. Being in my early 40s, I’m starting to notice fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I can really see a difference in these lines in a week of using this product. I will def purchase a larger size so I can continue to reap the benefits. It’s smooth and you Can feel a subtle tightening after you apply it. It also has a light pleasant scent like most of their products. Overall, I really like this wrinkle cream Quick Effective wrinkle cream
