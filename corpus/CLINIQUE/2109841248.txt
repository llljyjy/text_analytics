I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. For some unknown reason at first I thought this was meant to be used as a night cream only. So I substituted my normal night eye cream for Clinic’s for a week. My under eye area is very dry so the whipped thick consistency was so nice for me, the level of humectant and moisturizer is so high that I could still feel it on next morning. Don’t get me wrong it doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, but it left my under eyes smooth and moisturized. After I realized it was meant to be used even under make up I added it to my morning routine. I got to be honest, I was thinking worried it wouldn’t do great under concealer and makeup. I was happily surprised of how well it performs under even creamy concealer (tarte’s creamy shape tape) with minimal  to no creasing at all. I also tested it with Laura Mercier concealer and it had no creasing at all. I haven’t seen any PERMANENT wrinkle correcting benefits, yet. But I’m gonna keep using in the next months to see any improvements. Due to all the creaminess and humectants I would say it does have some good temporary wrinkle correction effect, though. Great for extra dry under eyes
