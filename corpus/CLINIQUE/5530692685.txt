I received a small sample of this cream to try. I have fairly dry skin and this cream did help with hydration. My face felt soft after application and it lasted most of the day. I like that it is not oily and does not leave your skin looking greasy. I do wish some of the ingredients were a bit cleaner. Overall I enjoyed using this cream but did not have enough to see if it has positive long term effect’s from using. I only had enough for about a week! It is a thin cream so if you’re looking for a thicker cream you might not like this one. It is very lightweight which I prefer. I would purchase this face cream! Good Moisturizer
