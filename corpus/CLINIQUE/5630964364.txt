I got a small sample of this moisturizer to try for free from Influenster but all thoughts are my own. This moisturizer was ok, hydrated my skin, little to no scent, and a gel-cream consistency. I have more oily skin and found this was a little too hydrating for me but I think this would be perfect for those with normal skin! Overall decent - but I think there are better cheaper alternatives. Not bad - not outstanding
