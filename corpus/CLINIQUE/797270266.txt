I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review.  After using this eye cream for a couple of weeks, I found that my under eye area looked smoother and felt a lot softer. My fine lines were also less noticeable after using this product. This eye cream has a great whipped texture that is light and airy, but is also very moisturizing. A little bit goes a long way and my eye area stayed hydrated all day. This eye cream didn’t irritate my skin and I also found it to be more effective than some luxury brand eye creams that I’ve tried in the past. I’ll definitely buy this when my sample runs out. Fantastic Eye Cream
