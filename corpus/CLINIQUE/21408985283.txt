Absolutely obsessed with this! It comes in a big purple glass bottle so you get your money’s worth and then some. I would use one dispense of this on my face nightly and alternated the use in the mornings. I love retinol so very much and found this to be all the best skincare products mixed into one. If you’re looking to spend big on just one product in your regime, I would definitely suggest you consider this product! I found it didn’t have a noticeable odour, it was easy to use and absorb and I didn’t experience any burning or stinging. nan
