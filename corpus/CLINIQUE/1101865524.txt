This product was sent to me by Influenster to try out. Not something I would normally purchase as I donâ€™t use Clinique but over all I would say it is pretty good. It dries down right away so you never really feel it on your skin, so if you have oily skin that is a bonus. It has a light smell that fades away quickly. I think this would work nicely under lots of types of foundation. nan
