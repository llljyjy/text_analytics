I received a sample size of this cream to test out and I was pleasantly surprised. The gel like consistency of this cream is really nice and silky. It absorbs really well into my skin and left it feeling soft and hydrated. There was a very smooth feel and no sticky mess or residual product as it all went right into my skin. Silky and hydrated
