I received a small one use tester of this product, so I can only speak to my first impressions.I used this at night and it absorbed nicely with no irritation. Not overly heavy serum with a light smell.I really like this ingredient list, thereâ€™s lots of peptides and other anti aging ingredients along with a retinol. This is a tester that I might actually purchase as it seems promising. Great ingredients paired with a retinol
