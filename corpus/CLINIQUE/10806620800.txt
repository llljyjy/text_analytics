I received this from Influenster as part of a campaign and was thrilled because I normally love Clinique products. But, I used it for a few weeks and I wish it worked better for me. The cream itself has a nice texture and feels great and refreshing. I started using it as a night and day all-purpose moisturizer but noticed it was too heavy to wear under my makeup, and some break-outs happened, so, I started using it only as a night cream but couldnâ€™t even use it for 3 nights straight when I noticed some breakouts happening, again. Figured it could be something else causing those and started using it only once per week, well, guess what, breakouts again. Sadly it will be a no-no for me, but if you have super dry skin, it might probably do wonders for you. Probably for dryer skin.
