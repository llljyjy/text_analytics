I received a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster. It has a great gel-like consistency which is perfect for warmer months of the year. I have normal to dry skin and it applied beautifully, soaked in nicely and was not sticky or greasy. It also worked well for my sensitive skin and did not cause any irritation or breakouts.  I would use it as a daytime moisturizer but I would want something more rich for my nighttime skincare. Due to the sample size I am unable to comment on any long term effects. Great Daytime Moisturizer
