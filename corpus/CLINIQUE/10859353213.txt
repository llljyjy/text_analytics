I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.Your start to a good base begins with a good serum. The Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum offers a strong anti-aging regime by targeting fine lines and wrinkles while resurfacing the upper skin for a smoother texture.The serum has no scent, which means those with scent sensitivities will be able to include this in their skincare routine. It’s also good if you’re layering with other scented products and don’t want a mixture of smells.The texture is medium in consistency, neither thick like a gel and not quite watery like a toner. I found that its absorption rate is quite fast, so you don’t have to wait long to layer your moisturizer, sunscreen, or makeup. I didn’t observe any ample hydration with this product, but as a base for layering, it works well for my needs. I do appreciate that it is not oily at least, which means a better effect when I wear makeup on top. nan
