Overall I didn’t really love this product. It left like a stickiness to my face when I used it, same with my hands from applying it. I tend to have really dry skin and this moisturizer didn’t really do anything for me. I found after an hour I felt super dry again and needed to apply it again or something more. I think this might make a great lightweight moisturizer for someone with combination skin and probably in the summer- I don’t see this helping much in the colder weather! Not my fav…
