I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. Unfortunately the smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum that I received was a small sample size so I only tried it for a few days. Due to this I cannot tell how well it works in the long term. I did find that my skin felt rehydrated after just a few uses so I imagine it would work well with prolonged use. I also like that it is oil free, fragrance free and sulphate free for my sensitive skin. I look forward to purchasing it in the future to see itâ€™s full potential! nan
