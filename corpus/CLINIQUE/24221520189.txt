I have received a free sample of this serum from TopBox in exchange of my honest review #freeproduct Even if I didnâ€™t get many uses out of the sample, I really enjoyed the texture and the feeling on my skin. It is lightweight and soaks into the skin effortlessly. In particular, I love it almost gives a blurring effect, so it would be perfect to use before makeup as well. As the rest of this line, this serum is unscented and I would definitely be interested in getting the full size to experience the anti-aging claims. nan
