I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I really liked this serum! I only had a 2 day sample and I wish I couldâ€™ve had more to see if it does correct wrinkles or not though. There is no fragrance to this product and its so easy to apply. Doesnt feel greasy at all until you add the wrinkle correcting cream from Clinique.#freeproduct Wish I had more!
