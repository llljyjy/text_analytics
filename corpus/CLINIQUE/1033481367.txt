I received a sample from @Clinique and @influenster to try and give a review. Iâ€™ve been using the Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting eye cream for three weeks. I am very impressed, my crepe skin under my eyes and the fine wrinkles around my eyes look way more plumped and less noticable. I am 51 with dry, sensitive skin, even when I touch around my eyes the skin texture feels better. The product is thick and creamy but also feels almost whipped. It has no noticable scent which I love. This may be a new holy grail for me. I would recommend it to family and friends. If you try it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. New Holy Grail Eye Cream
