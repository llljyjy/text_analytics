Sadly, my review is kind of tainted because I’ve been having some problems around my eyes (NOT BECAUSE OF THIS CREAM!!! My skin issues have been happening since late November way before I tried using this) So I could only use this on days my eyes weren’t bothering me. Even with the sporadic use... I did notice a small difference in the fine lines around my crows feet area. This eye cream is super creamy and absorbs into your skin very well. The skin around my eyes was left feeling extremely hydrated. Obviously I have sensitive skin in this area, and this cream caused no sensitivity reactions. I have a feeling if I was able to use this more consistently, I would have noticed more of a difference. Nice whipped texture.
