After trying this product for nearly 2 weeks I have noticed a couple of positives. I can feel a little firming under my eyes about an hour after using it.  I have noticed that my eyes are not as puffy and when I wear makeup after using this product I see a noticeable difference under my eyes.  Overall I would say itâ€™s good, but I also have noticed it is a little heavy. Reduced eye puffiness, firmness added!
