Received this for free in exchange for my review. Was excited to test this out, but this moisturizer is not for me. I have dry, sensitive skin and this product didn’t do much for me. Still had dry patches on my face even after using the product for weeks. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with dry skin — this moisturizer simply isn’t rich enough. nan
