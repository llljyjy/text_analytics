Thanks to tik tok “dermatologist” I have been staying away from eye creams. Many tik tokers say they are just expensive moisturizers and aren’t necessary. I am 35 years old and a SAHM. My skin is aging and I want to make sure I take care of it! I received the new Clinique Smart Clinical Repair eye cream and was asked for my honest opinion. I have been using the cream every night before bed for about 3 weeks. At first I didn’t notice any changes, I kept using it because I figured what do I have to loose. The consistency is thick and luxurious, not thick like a patrol run but thick like a heavy nourishing cream lotion. Upon first use I felt like my under eye area was very moisturized but again nothing noticeable. It wasn’t until the 3 week mark I noticed my eyes looking less tired and my bags weren’t as dark as usual! I feel younger looking and look more awake! It takes a while to notice results but consistency is key!! The jar is also small however a little goes a long way and this jar will easily last 6-8 weeks. The price point is reasonable considering the amount of product and how long it will last you. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone worried about aging skin. I’m a believer of eye creams now and hooked on this one! Consistency is key!
