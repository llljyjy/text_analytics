I received this product as a free sample from Topbox. I really like how this makes my skin feel and look. I’m in my early 40s and if I can keep the look of aging at bay I’d be grateful. So far this product seems to be helping as my skin feels plum and soft. This is a hydrating cream that has worked well under makeup and at night. The formula is the perfect consistency and absorbs well into the skin. Although too soon to tell if it actually corrects wrinkles, I do feel a difference in the suppleness of my skin and it feels smoother. nan
