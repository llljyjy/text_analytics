I like using this serum as a first step then apply the Clinique wrinkle correcting cream and lastly applying the eye cream. It absorbed into the skin and left no sticky feeling. I feel itâ€™s important to let the serum sink into the skin before applying the face cream but using all 3 products the way it was intended is the best! I would recommend! #topbox #freeproduct New to serums
