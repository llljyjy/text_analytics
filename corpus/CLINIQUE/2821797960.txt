This serum was highly spreadable with a very faint scent. I was only able to use this product a couple of times on the entire face/neck area due to the small sample I received to test this product. I will say, however, that it was convenient to have both hyaluronic acid and retinol in one product. I would be interested in purchasing this product to see more of its long-term benefits. I received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox. nan
