I will start it by saying this stuff is pretty nice.  I was overall shocked when I thought in my head that I was actually liking a Clinique product as they tend not to be my favorite.  I used this product day and night both under make and on a naked face and it felt nice and my face through out the day felt comfortable.   I would recommend trying this product out of you are going to be dedicated to using it.  I didnâ€™t see any temporary instant fixes ( which was fine). Worth trying !!!! I used it all!!!
