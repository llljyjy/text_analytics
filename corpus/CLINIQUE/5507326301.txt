I’ve been a Clinique user for decades. This was a nice addition to my typical Clinique skincare routine. This cream is thick but doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It absorbs nicely and leaves me feeling hydrated, I also think my skin looks and feels smoother. It has no added fragrance, which I enjoy and caused no irritation. Highly recommend! Great addition to the routine
