I received this small sample from Topbox #freeproduct.  I was very happy to get a chance to try it out--love Clinique skin care :)  This did not disappoint!  I put it on in the morning before my day cream.  It’s a serum, with a very nice texture.  It’s not thin like most serums I’ve tried.  I targeted my main concern wrinkles and noticed my skin appeared more youthful--I would recommend and want to buy the full size now.  Great addition to 35+ skin care nan
