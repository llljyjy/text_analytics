This moisturizer feels great on initial application- it gives a burst of hydration and leaves your skin feeling smooth. I find that on my skin, it doesn’t last as long as I’d like (and definitely doesn’t last 100 hours). I would have to re-apply the moisturizer midday to feel the hydrating effects. I think that it’s a good moisturizer but for the price, I don’t see myself replacing what I currently have in my skin routine. nan
