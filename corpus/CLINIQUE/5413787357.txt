I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. #freeproductAlthough it is suggested to use it twice a day (morning and night), I mainly use it at night since it is a sample size and I wanted to try this product for as long as possible. On the website, it is also mentioned to “Limit sun exposure while using and for the week after“ so using it at night looked like the right thing to do. I applied the serum before the cream and eye cream.The product is not too thick nor oily which is great as it is easily absorbable by the skin. As the consistency is overly fluid/liquid, it was also easy to apply on my face. I actually ran out of the serum before I finished the cream from the same line so it is hard for me to comment about the wrinkle correcting feature. My skin did feel nourished the next morning though. Not greasy and easily absordable
