I normally use Albolene, which is miles cheaper for more product, but I am driest of the dry skinned human. I received this free from Influenster to review. That being said: this balm is good a a first step in a double cleanse. It effectively cleanses off makeup and sunscreen, has no scent, and should last a decent while since I only have to use a little at night. It’s pretty non abrasive, and washes off easily without irritating my eyes. The black color is aesthetically pleasant, but I don’t really think the charcoal is doing anything for me other than hanging out and coloring the product. My pores don’t get easily clogged, so I can’t speak for any detoxifying/pore unclogging benefits here. Decent Balm
