I received this #freeproduct Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from #trywithtopbox program.  Unfortunately it was just a small sample size pouch enough for 2 uses.    I was only able to use the product for 2 nights and but I can honestly say that the product is light feeling, nice texture with no perfumey smell that similar high-end products have.  I usually breakout with heavier serums, but trying this serum for 2 nights I did not.  Looking forward to trying the regular size. Light Feeling Serum
