I absolutely love the feel of this moisturizer. the gel texture feels heavenly going on and it’s definitely not greasy like a lot of heavy moisturizing creams are. that being said, I feel like the 100h claim is a bit far fetched. I received this product free as a sample for testing so I was only able to use about 3 applications but I didn’t feel like this was the most moisturizing cream I’ve ever used. I have normal to dry skin and I was left wanting more moisture based on its claims. I did really love that there was no scent to this but aside from how luxurious it felt and the lack of scent I felt like this missed the mark. perhaps as an every day moisturizer under makeup this would be great but I was expecting more. feels great, 100h claim is a bit much
