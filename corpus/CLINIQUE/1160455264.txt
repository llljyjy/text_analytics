I received this product on 12/21 from Influenster. I’ve been using it religiously twice a day. Morning after cleansing and evening after cleansing. I saw a difference in three days. It was minimal but I could notice it. Since then I’ve seen more improvement. A little is all that is needed. I use it on my eyelid and under eye. My under eye area has become crepey and I’ve tried a lot of products. This one really is making a difference. The product is not greasy and absorbs quickly. Minimal smell or perfume. I will purchase this when my container runs out. It really is magic. Do you believe in magic?
