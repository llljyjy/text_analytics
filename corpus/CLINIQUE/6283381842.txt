I am so surprised by this product I have been using it for  about a week and I love it! I have oily combination skin, and usually I use the blue tatcha water cream day and night. However, when I wake up and later in the day my forehead is oily. With this project I use it day and night and it is amazing! No dry patches, and no oily forehead! It’s worth a try if you’re sick of feeling slick throughout the day. It’s Great for Oily Combination Skin!
