I’m surprised by how much I love this sunscreen/primer. I have very sensitive skin with an oily t-zone. When I first put it on I thought it may be too oily, but after letting it sink in for 5 minutes my skin looked matte and more even toned which lasted all day. Most importantly I didn’t get a sunburn or any irritation after a full day at the beach. I’ve worn this several more times and it has not let me down. It also pairs well under makeup as a primer. Love this product! Awesome Sunscreen and Primer!
