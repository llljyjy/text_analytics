There’s some thinking that having a separate eye cream to your moisturizer is unnecessary. And it may be true. But there is something so nice about gently patting a nice eye cream. This one worked well with my skin type and made me feel refreshed. I did not notice much wrinkle change but I don’t have too many eye wrinkles to begin with (or maybe my lasik is starting to fail!). Overall, I thought it did a beautiful job moisturizing the area while absorbing quickly. nan
