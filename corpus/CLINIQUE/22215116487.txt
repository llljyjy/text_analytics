I received a #freeproduct from Topbox of the  CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum in return for a honest review. I was able to use this sample for three days and I found that it was extremely hydrating. I didn’t feel too heavy on my skin and sit on top like other serums do. I find that this Clinique line really works well with my skin. It is very silky formula, it left my skin feeling really hydrated. I am very curious to see the results you would get for using this product for a much longer time. Love the formula!
