I got to try this product via Influenster. I will say it is a very nice eye cream. It is fragrant free - Which is good because sometimes products that have fragrances can cause irritation. I will say it does feel like it sits on top of the skin instead of absorbing faster than most eye creams but I will say I do like it better than the other eye creams from Clinique that I’ve tried. Those with older skin will appreciate the moisture from it and the smoothness of application. As I am getting older I find that I like moisture rich products to keep my skin looking younger and it’s a good product that’s not super expensive if you were looking for an eye cream that has extra benefits to it. Nice eye cream just a little thick
