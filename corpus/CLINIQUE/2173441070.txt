This eye cream burned my under eyes. I used to use it as a teenager and decided to go back and give it a try but itâ€™s awful. Not sure if the ingredients have changed or my skin has just gotten that more sensitive. I have fair skin and fairly thin under eye skin.Would NOT recommend. Not Good for Sensitive Skin
