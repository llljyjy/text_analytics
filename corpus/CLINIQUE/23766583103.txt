I had a breakout of deep cystic acne for literally weeks with barely any signs of improvement and typical salicylic acid with no effect. In 2 days (once daily) the acne was noticeably a lot better, and almost completely gone after a week. It dries out your skin A LOT though so I use a heavy moisturizer, sometimes even twice. Clears acne FAST, works well for cystic acne
