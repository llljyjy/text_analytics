I recieved this #freeproduct as a sample from Topbox. It’s an hydrating serum, it feel soft on the skin and it doesn’t have too much fragrance. I was happy to try it but with only 1 ml it’s hard to tell if it correct any wrinkle. Don’t forget your sunscreen when you use retinol! Good hydrating serum
