Received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin and really wanted to like this. It just did not work for me. I prefer a lighter weight moisturizer amd this felt heavy and filmy on my skin. Although it did provide a good amount of moisture to my skin, it was still heavy and after 3 applications I started a few break outs. I normally donâ€™t break out at all. I liked it was fragrance free. It may work for you but just not for my skin. I was glad I was able to try it out! Not a fan
