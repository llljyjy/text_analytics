I love this cream and it is hydrating enough and at the same time not greasy. I use retinol 2 to 4 times a week even with my retinol underneath I don’t get an adverse reaction or rather it doesn’t break me out. I have a really sensitive skin and if this works for me it will work for most of the people as well. I can’t say I have seen a huge difference for my wrinkles as it is too early to say that because it takes the skin a month at the least to see any results. But I would definitely say to give it a try I received a free sample from $topbox Good cream
