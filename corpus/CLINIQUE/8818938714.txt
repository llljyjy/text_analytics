I absolutely love this serum! It has given my skin amazing moisture after being so dry all winter. It is light weight, doesn’t clog your pores and smells nice too. I have very sensitive skin and honestly.. it feels great. I’m quite impressed. You don’t even need a lot, less than a pea sized amount and it spreads out evenly. Amazing
