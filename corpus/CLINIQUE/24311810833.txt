Glides on smooth, has a light, pleasant scent, and soaks into skin leaving it feeling moisturized. I received a sample of this cream so I didn’t have enough to speak to its wrinkle reducing properties. I didn’t notice a significant difference after using it twice a day for a week. Decent enough to give a try. Good, needed more product
