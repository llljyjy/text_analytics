I have fairly normal, olive colored skin, with the regular oily spots (T zone). This cream felt lovely going on my skin, moisturizing, and soft. Non greasy, felt like it adsorbed completely but left a light dewy glow. I wish this was a miracle cream to actually diminish wrinkles, however, I only received a small sample size (for free in return for an honest review) and didnâ€™t see a large difference in wrinkle reduction. Maybe with more regular, long term use, wrinkles would diminish? Definitely would buy and use this cream regularly as a staple in my skin care routine. Lovely, but no visible changes
