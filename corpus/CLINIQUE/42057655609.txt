This has to be the nicest serum I have ever used! It slips onto my skin really smoothly and leaves my skin feeling buttery soft like silk. It has never pilled with any of my other products and 2 pumps is all I need as it spreads so effortlessly. I love that it is fragrance free and I could not detect any fragrance whatsoever. It is easily absorbed and very easy to layer. There isn’t any stickiness once absorbed. I love that it comes in a bottle with a pump instead of a dropper as I find this to be more hygienic and easy to use. The texture of the serum is a medium consistency and is pearlescent in colour and once applied to my skin it isn’t shiny at all. This serum doesn’t itch, sting or make my face feel tight or flake like other products containing retinoid. I didn’t experience any sensitivity or irritation. As for results I have been using this serum for almost 4 weeks now and over the past week I’ve certainly noticed how different my skin has begun to feel. When I apply my skin care I just cannot get over how smooth my skin is compared to before. It’s feels flawless, dreamy and is gleaming. I now find myself taking my time to apply my skincare so I can feel my new smooth skin for longer. I have noticed that it has plumped my fine lines and they look more hydrated. This serum has allowed me to trade my enlarged pores for smooth glowy skin. It works!! Best serum.
