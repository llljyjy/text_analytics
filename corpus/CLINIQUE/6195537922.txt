I received a sample size of this moisturizer to review via Influenster. I found tis moisturizer really lovely. It doesn’t really have a scent, which is good for sensitive skin, and I love the consistency! It’s a gel cream so it’s that perfect inbetween of not being too runny or thick. A little goes a long way and it doesn’t make my face feel sticky or leave any residue behind. Instead it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized! Lovely moisturizer
