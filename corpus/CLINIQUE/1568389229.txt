I received a sample of this serum through Topbox Circle and loved it. The serum is easy to apply and absorbs easily and hydrated my skin for most of the day. Hard to say whether my wrinkles are going away but the ingredients of retinol and hyaluronic acid shows promise. Would be interested in trying the full sized product. nan
