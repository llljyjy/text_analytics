I got a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster. I’m not usually a fan of gel moisturizers because I have dry combination skin and don’t find them to be moisturizing enough. This moisturizer does make your skin feel soft right after you put it on but for me I have to use it in combo with another cream moisturizer. Doesn’t irritate sensitive skin and there is no fragrance. Not sure I would buy it myself though. There are cheaper options that are similar. Good but I’ll save my money
