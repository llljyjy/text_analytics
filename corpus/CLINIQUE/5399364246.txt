I received a #freeproduct sample to try from Topbox but I have also tried this before as a deluxe sample. I really like this serum, it has a bit of a thicker texture but still very easy to rub in. I prefer to use it at night as it does contain Retinol which means it’s extra important to wear sunscreen. My main recommendation is that if you aren’t used to Retinol to incorporate it slowly and to make sure you don’t use it at the same time as other conflicting actives like BHAs/AHAs/PHAs. A great serum
