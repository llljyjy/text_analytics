This is a nice moisturizer. Moisturized my skin really well. Has a nice cooling texture, is not sticky. There is no scent to it if you sensitive to that. Iâ€™ve used it only a few times so far and seem to like it so far. Not sure how it works in other seasons or other skin types but I do like it personally. My skin type is normal. Really Nice
