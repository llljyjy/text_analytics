I was so excited to receive clinique smart repair eye cream in exchange for my honest review. This stuff is amazing I wear it under my makeup without any problems and wear it alone before bed it never disappoints. When I apply it softens the look of fine lines and absorbs without leaving an oily residue I am pretty sure they took the grace from an angel and added it to this formula. I love this little miracle in a jar. Miracle In A Jar
