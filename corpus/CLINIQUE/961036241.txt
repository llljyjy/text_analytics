#freeproduct Received a sample from Topbox. This serum contain retinol. So I wasnâ€™t sure if it will be too strong before trying it. I did not have any bad reaction to the serum and it was easy to apply et non sticky. I will probably purchase in the near future, because I was in the hunt for a retinol serum in my regimen. nan
