I received this product as a free sample. Honestly, I think it’s a NAFE safe product (no denatured alcohol, fragrance or essential oils) and it has got some good ingredients. It’s a gel type consistency, not too sticky, and with little amount you can apply it all over your face. I feel it’s like any other gel type product, and I couldn’t tell if my face felt hydrated. Since I got a sample size product it is really hard to tell if it made any changes on my skin. Usually, it takes about a month or so to notice some differences or improvement on the face and my product lasted for about a week and a little over, hence the 3 star. What I can say with the product that I have is that I like the gel type texture it does feel you have applied something, it’s a good moisturizer because of its clean ingredients, and probably good for oily, combination and sensitive skin. NAFE safe product. Not bad.
