The product is simple yet effective. Itâ€™s super light on the skin yet very moisturizing. What makes it very light is that it is in a gel consistency rather than a cream. There is no sticky feeling after applying. I also like that it is fragrance free. I removed one star given the price as the product is relatively simple. Effective
