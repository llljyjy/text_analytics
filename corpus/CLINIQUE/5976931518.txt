I didn’t feel this was penetrating and didn’t feel hydrated after using it. Maybe would work for someone with oily skin who may only need a surface level moisturizer. It has a consistency more like a cleanser. I just put it on and my skin does not feel replenished. The texture is nice in the sense it’s not sticky or anything nor does it leave behind a residue Not for dry skin
