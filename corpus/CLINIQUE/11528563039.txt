I was gifted this product in return for an honest review of it from Influenster. I’m normally hesitant to try anything new on my skin because of how sensitive it is, but I’m glad I tried this product! I have always used Vaseline to take off my makeup, but hate that it leaves my face sticky and oily. This product was very smooth and spread on my face nicely. The color is a bit jarring because it’s charcoal but it all rinses off immediately. After I washed my face I found that it was hydrated and smooth - I rarely ever experience that after using a new skin product! It doesn’t have a strong smell but it’s nice and airy. It’s very smooth and light on your fingers and simple to apply.The only issue I had with it was I found it awkward to take off my eye makeup without it irritating my eyes. It did take all of it off with ease on the first try which I didn’t expect.Overall, I would recommend this product! Especially when it comes to taking off skin based makeup, maybe I would avoid the eye area. New Makeup Remover
