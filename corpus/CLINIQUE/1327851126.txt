I really like this eye cream. It’s super hydrating, without feeling greasy, and has a nice subtle cooling feel when applied. I would imagine if you kept it in your fridge it would feel even better! If I’m 100% honest I don’t think it completely got rid of any fine lines or wrinkles, but I did notice a slight difference in appearance, and it did it make the skin under my eyes feel more youthful, bright, and resilient after a few weeks of use. I’ll definitely pick up another jar when this one is gone. nan
