I received this product to try for free as part of a mission from Topbox Canada. Clinique’s smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum is one of the products part of Clinique’s clinical repair line. Although I received a 1ml sachet of this product which was enough to use twice. I used this product as part of my night time routine. The serum absorbs quickly into your skin and does not feel greasy. It does have a light scent but it’s nothing strong. The product is perfect for all skin types which I found a great bonus. Overall, I noticed very minimal difference on my skins appearance. #gotitfree It's alright
