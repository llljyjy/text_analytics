I received a deluxe sample of this from Influenster. I normally like Clinique products, but this was a big miss for me. Pros:the texture is nice, not greasy, absorbs well. Cons: irritated my skin, especially around my eye area. Had small whiteheads morning after using it on my face. Because it was a deluxe sample, after using it on my whole face a few times and noticing whiteheads the next morning, I switched to using it like an eye cream. First coupleTimes it was ok, then I noticed a Milia spot and had some mild burning irritation on application. Just a no for me overall. no for me
