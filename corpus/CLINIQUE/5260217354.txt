❤️Review ❤️I was excited to received the New Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream complimentary from Influenster and Clinique. I often fight insomnia, so the fine lines & wrinkles around the eyes get the best of me depending on my sleep routine. I religiously take care of my face night and day, so I have tried sever eye creams. I was definitely interested in Clinique’s new product. I was ready to remove the saggy skin under my eyes and the crow feet that had gathered at the corners of my eyes. I applied this product both in the morning and evening with just using a dab applying with my ring finger. The cream is very light, it does not leave any residue, no mo odor, and does not change my concealer nor my foundation. I also have sensitive skin, which the product did not irritate my skin at all. As I use the product, I notice the lines and wrinkles began to disappear. In addition, the skin under my eyes began to firm which then my bags under my eyes became less visible. Clinique has created an exceptional product that I will continue to use!#CliniqueSmartEye #complimentary @clinique @Influenster @sephora #sephora #influenster #influencer WHO SAID I WAS 50, NOT CLINIQUE!
