I received this @freeproduct from topbox circle for my honest review.  I like how lightweight this product is and that it left my skin feeling smooth and soft.  I really didn’t think the sample size would do much as it was just a tiny sample but a tiny bit of this serum goes a long way.  No greasy feeling and it didn’t feel sticky like some serums I have used in the past  It did make a difference for sure to some fine lines I have on my face. A little goes a long ways
