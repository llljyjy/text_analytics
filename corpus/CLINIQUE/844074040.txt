I have very dry skin and this serum gives a nice boost to the moisturizer. I like it for a bit more moisture especially as the weather gets colder. I love Clinique products because they are fragrance-free. I received a sample sized #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox so I haven’t tried it long-term yet and can’t comment on its anti-aging properties. It’s a bit expensive but I trust and like Clinique products so I would definitely consider purchasing. Great boost for dry skin
