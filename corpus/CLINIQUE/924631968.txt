I got this eye cream in voxbox and really like it. Goes on nice and smooth, not greasy or sticky. It seems to moisturize pretty well. It’s been a few weeks and definitely seeing some reduction in fine lines. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is I don’t particularly like it before my concealer compared to other more moisturizing eye creams. This seems to dry up on the eye faster, so concealer is not as smooth. nan
