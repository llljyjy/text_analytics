I received a sample of this Clinique wrinkle correcting serum and although I don’t have noticeable wrinkles yet, it’s always good to start adding an anti-aging product into your skin care routine. I liked the serum but Didn’t notice much change as I would need more time to try the product to see the full results. #freeproduct Nice addition
