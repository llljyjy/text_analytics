I received this product from Influenster. I have combination skin - usually more oily with some dry spots. I found this product to be light and absorbed well - makeup went on smoothly after the product dried down. Left my skin feeling super hydrated. Would be interested to see how it does on my skin in the winter. Influenster review - Not a bad product
