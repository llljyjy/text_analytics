I got this product sample from Influenster.  I have a combination skin type and it is important for me that the cream does not make my face greasy, when I first applied the moisturizer I liked that it has a light texture and is quickly absorbed and does not make the skin greasy, it can be used under makeup.  My skin after applying the cream became soft and moisturized, radiant.  I liked that the cream is fragrance-free, great for sensitive skin.  A good composition of the cream - aloe soothes the skin, hyaluronic acid instantly saturates the skin with moisture and gives radiance.  I definitely highly recommend it! Hydration and radiance of the skin
