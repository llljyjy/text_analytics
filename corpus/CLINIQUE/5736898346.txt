This whipped creamy texture felt silky during application. It took about a minute to fully absorb into my eye area.  It does not leave any residue behind. Non oily. I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It did seem to calm some under eye discoloration. But It Did not depuff my eye area nor did it minimize my lines.  However, I have not used the product long enough to see any long term results. I will continue to use this product until it runs out.  At that time I can reassess and decide if itâ€™s worth purchasing. just ok
