The. Best. Better than glow recipe papaya, better than inkey list oat, it gets waterproof mascara off and completely emulsifies. It doesn’t feel like there’s a film on my face like some oil cleansers do, and my skin doesn’t feel dry either. Worth every penny, the liquid version is great too if you don’t like scooping from a tub. I don’t think I’ll ever buy a different oil cleanser. I warm up a small scoop in my fingers and gently scrub all crevices of my face and gentle on the lashes then add a bit of water and do it again and rinse and there’s NOTHING left which is nice because then my cleanser gets to actually just clean my skin. THE. BEST.
