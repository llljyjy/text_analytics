Wow! I wasn’t expecting this product to work the way it does. I received a sample size for review purposes and I really enjoyed this product. I usually do not go for gel moisturizers as it usually feels like it isn’t doing enough for my dry skin but after trying this Clinique moisture surge, I would reconsider switching over to this moisturizer in the summer. It is light weight, it is smooth and dries slightly matte but still enough to moisturize my skin. This would definitely be a good summer staple and sits well under makeup. nan
