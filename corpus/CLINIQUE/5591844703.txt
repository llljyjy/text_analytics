I need to test this out longer to see how it is taking care of my wrinkles, but I love how moisturizing this is, and how soothing it is to my under eye area. It’s not scented, so now worries there, but it is also not greasy, which is nice, and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I usually apply it as a part of my nighttime routine, but even when I use it during the day, I don’t notice any unnecessary shine or greasy look. Just nicely moisturized skin nan
