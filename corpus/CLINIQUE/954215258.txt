This cream is super creamy and hydrating and I could definitely tell that it softened lines and wrinkles. I can’t tell if it really helps with dark circles yet, I will keep using it and see how continued usage works. I do like how it doesn’t seem too heavy and it wears well under makeup creamy, hydrating eye cream
