I’m sorry but even receiving this free in exchange for my honest review isn’t going to change my mind. What little sample I received was not enough to do anything other describe it and it’s texture which I’m not fond of. I would not be able to tell you or not if it helps wrinkles. It’s fragrance free and a heavy moisturizer. Probably better used in the winter than right now in the heat. I found it oily feeling after absorbed and sticky. It mixed well with my other products. nan
