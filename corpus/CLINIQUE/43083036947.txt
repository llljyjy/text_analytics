I received a sample of this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. The serum is easy to apply. It feels nice and hydrating. It also absorps quickly and doesn’t leave skin oily. I used it during morning and night. The smell is okay and not overpowering. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to see any changes because the sample that I received only lasted for two days. okay
