I received this product free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. Itâ€™s a heavier crew so I only used at night. It goes on smooth and absorbs nicely. I cannot speak on the wrinkle aspect as it was a small sample size and I would need to use for a longer period of time. No obnoxious fragrance which is a plus. nan
