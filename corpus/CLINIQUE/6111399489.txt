I received this free product to try in exchange for an honest review. Because it was a sample size I cannot comment on the long-term effectiveness however I will mention that it is very nourishing overall. The sample lasted approximately a weeks time and I did  notice better hydration of the skin although no noticeable changes in wrinkles. I would consider it giving it a longer trial. Longer trial period needed
