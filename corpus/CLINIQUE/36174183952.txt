I received this #freeproduct to try in exchange for my opinion.The sample was small and I used it 3 times before it was done.My initial impression is neutral. I did not notice anything special change in my under eyes. The serum did not sting but it did nothing special. Maybe after weeks of use, I would notice results. But for now itâ€™s just ok. It was ok
