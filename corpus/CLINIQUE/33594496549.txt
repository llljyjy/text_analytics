Bought this as a Moisturizer. My eyes would get so dry that my eye shadow would clump up and peel off. I saw results the first night. I had no eye shadow peeling off or clumping all day the next day. It really does last a long time at least 48 hours for sure. I donâ€™t know about the time it claims tho. Very little goes a long way and every night is too often to apply it. love it
