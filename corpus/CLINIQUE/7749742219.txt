I got this as a #freeproduct sample from a review program. I’ve been using it for close to 6 weeks, as I wanted to give it a fair shot to work. I found that I could only use this at night, though the recommendation on the product is to use twice daily. It was just too heavy to use in the morning for me, and would make my makeup slide around if I used it under my usual products. I did notice some wrinkle smoothing upon application. However, like many others I’ve tried, once it dried down, those effects faded. Over the 6 weeks I’ve been using it, I didn’t really notice a permanent difference. I do have noticeable lines around my nose and under my eyes specifically, and it doesn’t appear to have done much for them, though it could have just come down to only being able to use it once a day. If you have drier skin, this might be a good fit for you, as it’s quite moisturizing, but I need a lighter option and one whose effects last longer than just right after application. The price of this prohibits me from re-buying hoping to see results eventually. Not the most effective long term
