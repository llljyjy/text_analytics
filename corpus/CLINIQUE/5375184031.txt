This is the first cleansing oil I’ve tried that didn’t break me out. I looked for one for such a long time because the idea of a cleansing oil sounded so much less harsh on the skin than using cotton pads with makeup remover or makeup wipes. My skin has never looked better. I use this first to remove my makeup wiping away with a damp microfibre cloth, then I double cleanse. My skin irritation has gone away completely. Super thrilled with this product! The best cleansing oil I’ve tried.
