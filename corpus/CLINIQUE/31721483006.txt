I received 5he Clinique Take the day off cleansing balm for free from Influencer in exchange for my honest opinion.Clinique uses Sunflower aseed Oil to effectively break up natural oils found on the skin, and also dissolves hard to remove makeup. This make-up melting balm cleanse thoroughly and rinses off completely leaving your skin feeling soft and younger looking. Iâ€™ve always had problems with removing. My eye makeup completely, but this find takes care of that. With the added Japanese Charcoal as a second key ingredient to help detoxify the pores.. I recommend this product using it daily in my cleansing routine. A great find
