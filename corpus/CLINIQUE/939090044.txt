This cleansing balm is the bomb! It’s very dense until you swirl it around and then it becomes soft and creamy. Since this is a balm it’s slightly greasy but wipes off to reveal smooth, clean and beautiful skin. This is unscented so no worries about allergies. My makeup comes off easily and effortlessly without any residual remnants.  The mini lasts longer than you would think. Definitely recommend if you are a cleansing balm person. Take The Whole Day Off!
