Absolutely love it.I have oily skin and had difficulty finding right lotion that provides moisture without getting all shiny/oily all over the face and this one did just that.While I enjoy water like moisturizers as well, they tend to dry much faster due to the fact that I live at desert state with very very dry weather. This is more cream-like lotion/gel compared to others that I use and seems to last longer on my skin.My skin feel more moisturized and soft, no break outs or skin troubles at all! Works perfect
