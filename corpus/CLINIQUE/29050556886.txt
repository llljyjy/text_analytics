I am so impressed with the cream. At first I was a bit skeptical because usually when I try wrinkle creams, they are too rich for my skin, but this one is different. In fact, it has somewhat of a rich feel, yet it is oil free and looks great alone or under makeup. I did notice an immediate difference in my skin texture and pores seemed to look smaller. I saw a slight smoothness to the horizontal lines on my forehead. Overall, I am very impressed and plan to use it longer to see if more results will show. Great Cream!
