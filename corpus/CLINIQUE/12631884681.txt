I received this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. I have been using this faithfully for about three weeks now twice a day. I have not noticed a difference in my forehead wrinkle but I have by my eyes. My crows feet appear smaller and more smooth. I really like this cream as an all over the face moisturizer. It is super hydrating without a strong smell. I have enough left for about another week or so. Hopefully it will continue to work. A good moisturizer
