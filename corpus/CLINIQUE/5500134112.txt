I received this in exchange for my honest opinion from @influenster. The key Ingredients in this cream boast many benefits such as fighting the look of wrinkles by boosting natural collagen, which helps strengthen skin’s natural support structure. It contains Sigesbeckia  orientalis extract: A powerful procollagen extract, prized for helping skin maintain its natural density.Hyaluronic acid which helps flood your skin with hydration and helps restore suppleness and visibly smooth fine, dry lines. However, despite those promising ingredients it fell short of making an actual impression on my fine lines around my eyes. The texture is creamy yet thin. It is not too thick and spreads evenly on your eyes. I prefer scented products but can appreciate that it is scent free especially for an eye product. I love Clinique’s other products but will be passing on this one. Pass for me
