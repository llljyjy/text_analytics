This serum seemed like it may have slightly improved my fine lines. My skin absorbed it super fast and I felt like I needed to keep adding more to cover my face. It did leave a little bit of a greasy feel but would work as a primer under makeup for a smoother look. I tried out this product as a sample and did not have a large enough amount to tell real results for anti aging over time. Iâ€™d love to try it longer and see. #freeproduct Promising so far.
