I received this as a free sample #freeproduct from Top Box Circle in exchange for a honest review. The Clinique Smart Clinical Wrinkle Correcting Serum performed fine and I think it is nice. I canâ€™t say much in terms of results as it was a small sample and only a one time application. I used this at night. I liked the consistency of the serum as it was thick and not runny. I like the fact that the product is fragrance free. I would recommend this serum, five stars. Would recommend this serum
