Sooo sneaky and for good cause.  This lightweight but powerful eye cream rocked my world. I’m a under eye serum needed kind of girl, nurse night shift six kids you understand, by day four I went naked.  Yep no under eye anything and felt great.  I noticed my fine and fabulous lines got a little smaller too… win/win and at that price it’s a steal because a little goes a long way!! Clinique delivered… less noticeable lines uay!!
