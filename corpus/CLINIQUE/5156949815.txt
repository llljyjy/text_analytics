I had the privilege to try this eye cream before it was released to the public, and I have to say it is good! The cream is whipped and thick so only a dab of cream is needed! You don’t need to use a lot of it just touch your finger in the tub and Pat on your eyes. I used it under my eyes for my puffiness. It seemed to work almost immediately, and as days went on it got better and better. Again, don’t use a lot of the cream, it will chunk up if you do. I would say to everyone to give this a try, it can work different areas for everyone! You can never have enough good eye creams! Clinique smart eye
