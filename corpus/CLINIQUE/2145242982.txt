This gel like consistency may work for some combo/oily skin types but it didn’t work for me. I have dry skin and while this felt nice and cooling upon application, it almost felt sticky even after 10 minutes and I didn’t feel like it absorbed well into the skin. It also didn’t feel super moisturizing hours later. Won’t repurchase. better for oily skin
