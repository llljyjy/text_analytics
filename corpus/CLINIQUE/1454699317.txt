I received a 1ml sample packet of this product from Topbox. I was not able to see any real results in terms of wrinkle correcting with such a small sample. I used this as part of my night routine for a few days. I did like that the serum was easy to apply and absorbed into my skin quickly. It did leave a sticky feel after applying and it has a subtle scent. #freeproduct nan
