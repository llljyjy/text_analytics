I received this product complimentary and Ive been using it twice daily for about 2 weeks now.  So far I’m really enjoying this eye cream.  The whipped texture is cooling, soothing & quite hydrating.  I feel it immediately smooths and helps to depuff my sleep induced puffiness more quickly. It hasn’t caused any milia in my eye area, which is a common issue I face when using richer creams as opposed to gel or serum types. Nice product!
