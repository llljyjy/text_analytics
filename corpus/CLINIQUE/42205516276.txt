I received this cream as a sample from TopBox to try. I have a sensitive and combination skin and there are very few products that suit my skin. This cream is very hydrating and light weight. It absorbed into my skin pretty quick. It’s not at all sticky and that’s the best part. I have used it daily before bedtime for over 10 days now and I do see visible difference in my face. It not only helped with my fine fines but it also makes my skin feel so smooth and healthy! Gentle enough for people with sensitive skin. I highly recommend this cream if you are trying to get rid of wrinkles.#freeproduct Must try!!
