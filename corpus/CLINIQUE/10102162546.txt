So, @influenster sent me yet another, complimentary, new product to try out(!), and I’m sold! It’s the BRAND NEW @clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream. The texture is divine—creamy and smooth—the kind that actually “feels” like it’s doing something from the moment it touches your skin! And the packaging? It’s a rich purple, the color of royalty, and it sure did make me feel as though I was using a luxury cream! The product itself was able to deliver for me—mainly in terms of hydration, and that isn’t anything to downplay by any means. Still, it is marketed as a wrinkle correcting cream; in this way, I really did not notice too much. Of course, I don’t really have many lines that need correction. Nevertheless, hydration is a necessity, especially in terms of skin elasticity, and to this end, I can say that I really did enjoy this new product! Thank you again, @influenster and @clinique for the opportunity to be a part of this new product launch! Well done! #Complimentary #Clinique #CliniqueSmartEye #influenster Good Hydration!
