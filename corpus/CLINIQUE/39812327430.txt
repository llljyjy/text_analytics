I received this product as a test and would have been happy if the test product a bit more to be able to give better review. The content was good enough for 2 uses, used it day and night. The consistency is light and I really love that. the feel on the face is great too, very soft and application is easy. I did not break out but my skin did feel soft after application. I cannot comment on the wrinkle effect but so far I think itâ€™s worth a try. Smooth to the skin
