I’ve been using this anti-aging cream for a couple of weeks, and I like how it feels on my skin. It’s very rich and creamy, and it doesn’t take much. I have the sample size, and I think it’s going to last me at least a couple of months. I pat a tiny bit around my eyes, forehead and the top of the bridge of my nose. It also has a pleasant, clean scent to it, and it has a softening, hydrating effect on my skin. I received this product from influenster in return for an honest review. Skin-softening anti-aging cream
