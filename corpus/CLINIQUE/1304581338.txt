I received Clinique’s new Take The Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm for free and really enjoyed trying it out. Because it’s a balm it wasn’t messy and went on very easy. I loved that it is fragrance free so I don’t have to worry about my allergies acting up. It was easy to put on and washed right off with water - no washcloth or scrubbing needed. It left my skin feeling extremely soft and clean. I love this and appreciate Influenster and Clinique for the opportunity to try this great new product! Deep cleaning with no leftover residue
