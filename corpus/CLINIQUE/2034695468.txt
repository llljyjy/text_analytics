First I have to say that thankfully I haven’t got a lot of wrinkles and fine lines. So in essence I’m using it as a preventative. The first thing I like about is the texture. It’s super creamy and feels good on the skin. I didn’t have any adverse reactions which is good because I have sensitive skin. It absorbs easy and hydrates the area. I would assume that that hydration helps with wrinkles. I hope I never have to find out lol . Stop them wrinkles before they arrive
