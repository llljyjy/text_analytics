I was given a #freeproduct sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream from TopBox and was asked to review the product. Although I was only able to use the product over the course of a few day, I really liked what I experienced. The product is smooth and luxurious, left my skin feeling refreshed without being greasy. I cannot review on the wrinkle repair aspect because it was just a small sample but I would recommend this product for the way it makes my skin feel. Impressed!
