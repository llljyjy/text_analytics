I received this complimentary from Influenster and to me it’s your basic moisturizer. I liked how it was very light and didn’t make my skin feel sticky. I didn’t notice a difference in hydration. What I liked most about this product is that it didn’t make my face feel oily or sticky after. Would I buy this product? Probably not. But I do love other Clinique products. nan
