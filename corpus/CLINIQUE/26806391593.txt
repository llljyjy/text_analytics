I received a sample of this product courtesy of Topbox and Clinique in exchange of my honest review. I used this serum at night before putting on Clinique moisturiser. This serum is light consistency and fragrance free. It gets absorbed into skin very quickly. I didn’t notice any difference in my wrinkles as sample wasn’t enough for prolonged use. Hydrated skin
