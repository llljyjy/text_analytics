The scent of this cream is a bit strong for me, but the texture is marvelous…. Thick enough but not weighty, and absorbs well. I haven’t found the formula has made any noticeable difference with my wrinkles. With highlighted ingredients like Peptide Complex and Hyaluronic Acid, it does a decent job of hydrating skin so that it looks a bit plumper, but doesn’t really address skin turnover. Hydrating but not "correcting"
