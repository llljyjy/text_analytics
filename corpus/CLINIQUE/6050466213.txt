I received a sample from influenster free to try for my honest review. The packaging is nice the signature Clinique green box and the cream is in a nice purple container. I used the cream morning and night for about 5days. I have extremely dry skin and this cream applied and absorbed nicely. I did notice my skin appeared more hydrated and the few fine lines I have appeared less noticeable. I also used this cream with my other skin care products on the last night and it worked well. No pilling etc. I will continue to use this creamI highly recommend! Love this cream!!
