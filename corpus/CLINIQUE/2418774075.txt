To remove my makeup, I begin by using this, rub it in and let it penetrate for a few minutes. ThenI rinse a little bit but the oily film doesn’t come off and the makeup is still on. Next, I use micellar on a cotton pad to remove everything. Final step: rinse, serum and moisturiser. As a stand-alone, this does not work for me. Would I buy it again? Perhaps but I wouldn’t be afraid to try alternative products. Added to Makeup Removal Routine
