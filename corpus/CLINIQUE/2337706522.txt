I have very dry skin especially in summer. I love how this product gave an extra boost to my skin in general and seemingly has helped fill in that middle wrinkle between my eyes I call my “grumpy mark“ over the last week. It has a nice light scent and smooth refreshing texture. I’m grateful to be able to try it. Works well!
