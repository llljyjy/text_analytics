I have always trusted Clinique on my skin. I have sensitive skin so it is  not always easy to find a right product. I was able to try this correcting cream under the #freeproduct opportunity. I like that it is a lightweight and not scented formula. Usually during the day time my face gets oily but trying it at night helped. I got a sample size but it still served to convince me it is a must in a healthy skin routine to reduce wrinkles! Lightweight and fresh!
