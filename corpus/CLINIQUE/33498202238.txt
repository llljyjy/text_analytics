I’ve used this cream for a week and,  although it’s too early to see visible results, my skin feels more supple and nourished.  I apply at night and wake up in the morning with my skin feeling hydrated, plump, and pampered despite the blasting A/C in this So. Cal heat wave.  The cream feels rich, glides on silky smooth, and has no fragrance.  It does stay tacky feeling for quite a bit, but I feel that’s due to it being ultra-moisturizing. Fabulous night repair cream
