I was given a sample of this product to try and review. It is great for oily or combination skin. I have combination skin and this kind of moisturizer is perfect for me. It melts into the skin and doesnâ€™t leave an oily residue. It leaves me feeling refreshed. It brings moisture to my face all day. great moisturizer
