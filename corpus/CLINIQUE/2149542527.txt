I received this with an influencer package and tried it right away. I used it for a few days as it was such a small sample it was hard to give a accurate review. When applied it felt light and dries up pretty quickly. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue or smell which was great. It did feel hydrating but didn’t last as long as it stated. I would have preferred a bigger sample to use longer to see if it made a difference with my skins nan
