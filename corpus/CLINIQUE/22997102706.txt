I was very happy to receive a free sample. The bottle wasnâ€™t large enough to give a long term results review. I have combination skin. I used right after washing my face. The texture is very light and airy which I appreciate. I do not heavy or a greasy feeling on my skin. It sank in right away. I had an immediate glow and woke up to plumper skin. I am very tempted now to buy the full size product. I think this is a great cream. Silky satisfaction!
