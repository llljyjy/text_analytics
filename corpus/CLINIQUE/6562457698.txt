I got a small single use sachet sample of the smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum with the wrinkle correcting cream and the wrinkle correcting eye cream from top box circle. I have used this with the correcting cream and I am not sure which of the two products induce the tightening feel. But for a single use sample you can visibly see a softening of the fine lines. It is also scent free which is a plus. It is smooth to apply and non greasy. I have purchase a bigger size to check if it does what it says. scent free and non greasy
