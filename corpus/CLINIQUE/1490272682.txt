Wow! I was expecting a nice moisturizer because Clinique is so consistent, but honestly this is amazing.  I have a little sample size and will be purchasing as soon as I am able.  My skin loves this.  I have been using it in the morning and at night.  My skin definitely looks plumper and firmer.  I generally have good luck with peptides.   The texture on this is lovely--it doesn’t hang out and stay sticky.  Looks nice under spf and makeup.  No pilling.  I’ll be a little sad when I run out.  Me: mature, very dry skin.  This is now a favorite. nan
