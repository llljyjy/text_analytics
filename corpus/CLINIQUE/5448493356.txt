I tried a sample size of this moisturizer and I really like it! There’s hardly any scent and it goes on smoothly. It’s light and doesn’t leave any noticeable residue. It was perfect for my combination skin as it did not leave me feeling extra oily! I would definitely try it again! Great moisturizer!
