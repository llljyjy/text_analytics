I received this product as a small sample with #topbox to try.  I only had enough to apply once, but I can say it went on nicely with a light scent.  I do love the cream that joins this serum, happy with this line of products. If this has results the same as the moisturizer cream, I will definitely be purchasing!  The price point for this serum seems high, but again, I would purchase as I love the cream that matches this line.  Pleasantly surprised with Clinique this time! Happy with this line of products from Clinique!
