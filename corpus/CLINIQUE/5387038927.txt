I received a sample size jar of this product to test. My skin is normally dry. I liked the product and felt like it helped hydrate under my eyes. I did not notice a reduction of fine lines, but noticed the hydration and decrease in visibility when I used it. The texture is creamy and thick and absorbs well. Overall I liked the product and would use it again. Great for Hydration
