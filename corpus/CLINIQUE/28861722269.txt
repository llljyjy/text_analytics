I had a great experience with the 75h version and received a this sample of the 100h. This multi-tasking formula can also be used under or over makeup and also as a 5-minute hydration mask. I opt to use  this sample as a quick mask. The product is extremely light-weight. It is  giving the skin a feeling of relief and cooling. It makes my skin very soft and plum. This time decided to buy a full-size one because I fell in love with it! Perfect for warmer weather.
