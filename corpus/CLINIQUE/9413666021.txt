While it does hydrate at first, my T zone is always very oily by the end of the day. I have combination skin, and live in a super humid climate, and I don’t feel this moisturizer does enough. If you have normal skin this would be better for you. My cheeks and chin are thoroughly hydrated but my forehead is a oily slip n slide. I’ve even put HA on before the moisturizer to see if it would help my T zone but it still didn’t improve much. Will be looking for a moisturizer with more humectants. Not for a humid climate like FL
