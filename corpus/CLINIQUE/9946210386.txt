This product is hydrating but I felt it caused my pores to become slightly clogged. I also think the scent is a little too strong in my opinion, and would opt for something more natural smelling. I would use this product in winter if my skin was extra dry however I donâ€™t think is suitable for my combination skin on a daily basis or when humidity is high. It works well as an overnight mask. nan
