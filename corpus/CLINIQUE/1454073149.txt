I received this sample from Influenster and was hopeful for a good eye cream to brighten and get rid of my dark circles. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it is hydrating and smoothing, light and not greasy. However, it hasn’t done anything for my dark circles and I didn’t have any significant wrinkles to begin with. I will continue to use it, as it does feel nice but am not super hopeful that it is the eye cream I’ve been looking for. nan
