This makes no dramatic difference to my skin. It’s light and almost scent-free, but almost hydration free for my combo skin too. Summer Fridays Cloud something and Farmacy Daily Greens are also gel based and work for me. Sometimes I need to re-apply them in the day if it’s really dry or cold. Very light, no scent, but hydration lasts 10 mins
