I have been a user of the Smart Clinique Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for a while now and it is a great product. It is probably the most gentle retinol product out there.  I donâ€™t know if it makes my wrinkles any less visible but I do think it gives my skin a smoother, glowing more plump look.  This is fragrance free and quick absorbing and I put it on before I put my moisturizer.  Even though this product is fragrance free, I do find there is a little non irritating mild scent to it. #freeproduct The most gentle retinol
