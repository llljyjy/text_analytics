I received this for testing purposes through Influenster. Right off the bat the packaging looks and feels really nice quality. I also like that there isn’t a strong smell to this since it’s a cleanser, I don’t want to feel all perfumed up, I want to feel clean after using. I can also use this with other scented products. I took a star off for the fact that the texture inside the container is really solid and hard to get out. I had to dig it out with my finger and a lot got into my fingernails. I would worry for people who had much longer nails on than mine... It would be hard to get out. However once it gets into your face it melts on and really thins out. It almost seems greasy on the skin so I was worried since I already have oily skin however it washed off nicely and didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. Disclaimer, I washed off in a shower not in the sink so it came off really nicely for me. Overall seems to work good. Seems to work well
