I have previously used the 72H formula and had some left to compare with this 100H product.  I didn’t really notice much of a difference except that the 100H felt like a thicker gel.  It does provide some immediate hydration and it is easy to apply, however, I’m not sure it actually works for 100H.  It doesn’t feel sticky, has a mild scent and provides some quick moisturizing effects.  I’m not sure I’d use this as a full out moisturizer but I will definitely use it on some of my problem areas. Easy to apply hydration
