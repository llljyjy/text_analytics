The wrinkle serum has a nice light texture to it that blended well into my skin. So many serums leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy where this one did not. The light/no scent also made it easy to use any time of day, but I preferred to add it to my night time routine. That being said, I had no problem packing powder onto it once it dried - it dries very quickly. #freeproduct #topbox A nice texture
