I have been using Clinique products for years but have never tired this line. I received this product thanks to #topbox #freeproduct with 2 other samples. The consistency is nice and not sticky at all like other serums Iâ€™ve tried. I applied under the wrinkle correcting cream at night and on its own in the morning before applying makeup. It slightly smoothed out my forehead wrinkles and made makeup application smoother! nan
