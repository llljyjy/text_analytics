I received the CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from #topbox. I applied the product in the mornings and it felt really nice on my skin at first application. The product didn’t have any strong scent/ feeling and was very easy to use. Its hard to see long term effects from a small sample, but I’d be wiling to purchase and try this product again. A good serum to work minimal Wrinkle lines
