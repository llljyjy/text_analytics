I love where the air hurts your face and this is the perfect product for winter skin. It’s a balm, as described, so it goes on very smoothly and feels balmy and creamy. This product does not dry out your skin!!! You’re skin is left feeling clean without that dry feeling some cleansers have post wash. There isn’t a better product to use in cold, winter air. Great Winter Product!
