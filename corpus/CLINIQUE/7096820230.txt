I received this product from Influenster and Clinique for my honest review. Since this was a sample size product, I’m not sure about it’s wrinkle prevention yet, but it is very hydrating. I also used a pearl sized amount because a little goes a long way. My face stayed hydrated all day long. I would recommend this product I just wish I had a larger sample to see if wrinkles were decreased but I have no other complaints. Hydrates well
