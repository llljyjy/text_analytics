First off I want to say this is one of the first eye creams that if you sweat and it gets into your eye it doesn’t burn . So I appreciate that a lot !  I had a lot of bad experiences with eye creams in the past that have done that . I also like that it doesn’t have a smell and a little goes a long way . At first I didn’t notice a difference but it felt nice but lately even when I do my no make up make up I can see the difference . My eyes look rested even though I haven’t been sleeping well do to stress . I have been using it for almost a month and a half and there is barely a dent of how much I use it . I apply it in the morning and at night and with this dry weather it’s really helped my eyelids not to look dry . Do I see less fine lines ?  I want to say yes and will continue using it and give a update on my progress . If you have sensitivity to eye creams give this a try ! Did not expect to love it
