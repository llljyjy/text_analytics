My skin is typically quite dry, as well as aging. I have normal to occasionally sensitive skin.The Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream applied nicely with a good consistency and spreads out well when combined with the natural heat of your skin.  Allowing just a tiny amount to really spread far and yet still get good coverage. Although I haven’t seen any wrinkle erasure/“correcting“ results, I don’t believe I have used it long enough to have seen any results, so I can’t really speak on that fact. But what I can say is that it does leave my eye area immensely soft and supple feeling.  I would recommend it to anyone, just based on it being a really lovely feeling, soft eye cream. It does have a scent but it didn’t affect my eyes or skin in any way. I’m quite pleased with this product. And would possibly repurchase based on if I ended up seeing any difference in fine lines. So soft!
