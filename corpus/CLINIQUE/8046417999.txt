I received this as a sample for my honest review. I always favor Clinique products so I was excited to try this new wrinkle cream. I gave dry skin and am starting to show wrinkles. I absolutely love the way this cream smells and feels going on. It’s thick but soaks right into your skin. Since the sample was so small it’s hard to say if I am able to see a difference yet but I will likely buy it and give it the full test. I love the smell and feel of this wrinkle cream!
