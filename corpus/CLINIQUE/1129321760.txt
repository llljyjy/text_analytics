I used this serum underneath the wrinkle correcting cream. I used it both day and night for two days as that is all I had in my sample package so I can’t speak to long term results. It was a thin consistency that went on easily and absorbed quickly into my skin. My skin felt smooth and non greasy after applying. There wasn’t a noticeable scent. I received this #freeproduct in a sample package for a few days use.  #tryitwithtopbox nan
