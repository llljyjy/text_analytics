I received this free sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream to try for my honest review. With it being a sample sized product, I havenâ€™t been using this product for ver long but,  it goes on smoothly, soaks in nicely leaving my skin feeling moisturized and refreshed. It has a light yet pleasant scent to it, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I am pleased with this product and wiuld recommended for others to try. #CliniqueSmart Smooth
