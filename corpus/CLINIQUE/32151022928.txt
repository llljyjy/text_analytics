I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review #freeproduct.  I really enjoyed this product, it was light scented and very moisturizing.  I used this in conjunction with the Wrinkle correcting eye cream for he night routine.  Donâ€™t need to use a lot of product as it spreads nicely and a little goes a long way.  Non greasy and quick absorbing will definitely recommend and use again. Nice addition to Daily routine
