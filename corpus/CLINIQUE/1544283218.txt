I had the opportunity to try this for free #freeproduct from #Topbox in exchange to provide my review. I have been using this product in the morning and at night as per the instructions. The cream has a good thick consistency and the faintest scent. It goes on nicely and soaks in right away. I didn’t find it to be greasy at all. I can’t really so how well it worked as it was a small sample and am thinking if using more over time, I will probably help with the wrinkles. It did make my skin feel soft. I will buy this to see if how it will really help with the wrinkles and fine lines as I liked the texture and how it went on. Luxury Cream
