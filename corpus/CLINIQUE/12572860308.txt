I will never be using another facial cleanser ever again. Clinique saved my skin in my middle school years, I donâ€™t know why I ever strayed away. I had been using the Tula acne cleanser without any results. I switched over to this because Clinque worked so well in the past. The best thing I ever did! My face cleared up instantly. Even through my cycle I had minimal breaking out. I cannot recommend this stuff enough! get it!
