I was gifted this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This is a lightweight gel moisturizer that has a cooling effect when applied. It reminds me of the glam glow hydra moisturizer. This would be fantastic for the summertime. It has next to no scent, and it made my skin feel baby smooth and soft. a good moisturizer
