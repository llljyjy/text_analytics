Not a product that I can say changed my life in any drastic way, however I can attest that it does exactly what it claims to do. After years of using makeup wipes that tug at and irritate the skin to micellar waters that require cotton pads, it only takes a little of this cleansing balm to remove a day’s worth of my makeup. It also works quickly, and I haven’t found any leftover mascara residue on my lashes (and I wear waterproof). I rarely post reviews, but after returning a largely ineffective Josie Maran cleanser and buying this instead, I am most pleasantly surprised. nan
