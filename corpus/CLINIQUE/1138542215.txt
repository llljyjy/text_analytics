I have fairly dry skin this time of year and this has really helped! When I recieved the sample, I had just come back from Mexico and my skin was pretty beat up from the sun.  This helped bigtime!  After 12 hours, I can still feel that my face is soft, but not greasy. It has a delicate, but pleasant scent and goes on smooth. Highly recommend this product so far! Will come back if my opinion changes. Great so far!
