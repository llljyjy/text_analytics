I received this item complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for a month now and I do notice subtle changes as soon as I apply it but nothing lasting. It almost works as a filter on my fine lines but by the next morning they are there again. I like the texture it’s very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. As always with Clinique the item is uneven red which I appreciate. I would purchase this again & recommend it to my friends with fine lines. I don’t think it’s going to make any plastic surgery style differences but it’s a good product to have. nan
