I received this as a #trybeforebuyit from #topboxcircle. I’ve been using the Clinique wrinkle correcting serum at night after cleansing my face together with the Clinique moisturizer and eye cream. I’m already noticing fine lines disappearing, and a skin stronger and moisturized. It really helps strengthen, nourish your skin and make wrinkles go away! Great serum.
