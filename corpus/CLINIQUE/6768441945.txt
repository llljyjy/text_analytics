I have been using this for two weeks so with that being said I can’t comment on its full effectiveness but I will say I do like it and can tell I’ve been using it…I’ve tried lots of this Clinique line and never been able to see any results..has minimized small lines under the corner of my inner eye which is HUGE for me..I’m 41 and I would like to stay looking as young as possible ..4 stars because I don’t like being asked to review something before the promised results would be visible Good so far
