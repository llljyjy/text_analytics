I received a deluxe sample of this cream to try. I felt it wasn’t very moisturizing. It sat on top of my skin and would not sink in due to the texture. It felt a bit waxy. I do not get cystic acne but I experienced it while using this product. I got deep, large and painful pimples that took a while to heal. I cannot be 100% certain it was this product but I didn’t change anything else in my routine and when I stopped using it my skin cleared up. Not impressed
