This product reminds me of many other cleansing “balm“ type products.  Same consistency as most on the market now.  Cleans well.  Removes eye makeup.  Does not irritate my skin or eyes. Skin feels clean and soft afterwards.  No residue.  LOVE that it is “fragrance free“.   No complaints or regrets at all. worth trying
