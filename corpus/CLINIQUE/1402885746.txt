I received a sample size of this moisturizer as part of the Influenster program and it lasted almost a week using it day and night (mind you I also used an essence, 2 serums before putting the moisturizer on). The moisturizer was not sticky and it did absorb into my skin. It leaves a silicone like finish, so it could also dual as a primer for those who don’t want to put a primer before makeup. I felt my skin was hydrated throughout the day and it didn’t feel like anything was on my skin. This texture is like other water creams or gel creams on the market. I wore it under makeup and it did not separate my makeup which is good. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for pure hydration for their skin or someone who is an entry level skincare user. nan
