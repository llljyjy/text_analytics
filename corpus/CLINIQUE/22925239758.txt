Received the #freeproduct from top box to try. The texture of this serum is nice and light. The cream absorbs very quickly without leaving a sticky residue. Even though this serum contains potent retinol I didn’t experience and redness or itchiness from using it albeit I only used it once. My skin feels nice and smooth in the morning but since I only had a sample I can’t speak for any long term effects Good serum
