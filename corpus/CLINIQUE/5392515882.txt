To begin with I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  I only received a foil packet so was able to use this just a few times but what I did notice was that a little went a very long way and  so just a couple drops are needed to cover my face. It left my skin feeling very soft to the touch and quite smooth. If this did not contain barley it would have been nearly perfect for me Absorbs well, leaves soft skin
