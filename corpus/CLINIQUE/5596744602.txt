My skin type is very sensitive, reactive, and combo oily. I have had issues with the emulsifying agents in cleansing balms/oils irritating my skin. This is extremely gentle, worked well to dissolve sunscreen and light makeup, and when rinsed off my skin felt extremely soft and not disturbed (some cleansing oils make me feel...stripped isnâ€™t the right word, but like your skin balance is all out of whack? This did NOT do that!). I think this would work for ANY skin type honestly! All around just really good stuff. very sensitive and reactive skin
