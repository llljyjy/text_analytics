I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. This applies nicely and wears well both with and without make-up. I always get nervous trying new product on/near my eyes, but I’ve had no issues with this. And a little goes a long ways so it will last a while. As far as actual improvement to any aging and/or dark under eye circles, I’ve only been using it for about a week so I’d need more time to determine that. So far, so good...
