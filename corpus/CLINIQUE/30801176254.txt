I received a complimentary sample size of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from Topbox and Clinique to try in exchange for my honest review.I never tried any Clinique products before so I was elated to finally get a chance to try out their products.This texture and consistency of this serum is what you would expect out of serums for the most part, watery and light. As it is of a thinner consistency I feel that it can be a hit or miss sometimes in terms of how it sits and absorbs into the skin. This serum in particular absorbs really well and doesn’t leave an uncomfortable sticky layer on the skin and it doesn’t pill with application of other skincare products afterwards.My skin felt more hydrated and glowy after using this serum and I topped it off with the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream.I must say, I was a little disappointed to receive a sample size, as considering this was a product for wrinkle correction, which would take a while to see results, this small sample really wouldn’t highlight the potential of this product and I wasn’t able to see any results in that aspect.
