The serum is thick (more like a gel) and easy to apply. I did find I had to use quite a bit to get a good coverage. As stated, it is odorless and does not leave your skin greasy. The sample provided was only good for 1 use, so I will not comment on the anti-aging properties. This serum might work well for some, for me, it just wasnâ€™t enough hydration for my VERY dry skin. #freeproduct I received this product to try from #topbox. nan
