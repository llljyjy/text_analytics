I tried this on after a shower which really dries out my skin. The last two years I’ve had more sensitive skin that’s more combination with some dry spots. The gel felt nice and thick to put on which was nice and dried nice leaving my skin soft, not sticky and ready to apply makeup. A nice gel moisturizer!
