This serum packs a lot of moisturize! I love a rich and super hydrating serum, and this one does exactly that. It absorbed into my skin easily, and felt great. I used it in the evenings before the wrinkle correcting cream. My dry skin was so thankful that I received this #freeproduct from TopBox. Full of Hydration!
