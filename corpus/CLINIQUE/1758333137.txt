I received a small sample of this product for free to try out. I can’t speak to long term results, only first impressions. I combined this in my night time routine with the rest of the wrinkle repair line samples I was given. It was light and absorbed very nicely into the skin. The smell was pleasant as well. It didn’t feel sticky like other serums I’ve tried. I would loved to have tried this for longer to speak about long term results. nan
