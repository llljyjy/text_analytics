I’ve been using this eye cream for about two weeks now. I love the texture…it’s creamy without being too thick. I apply at night and there is no greasy residue/oily look when I wake up in the morning. It leaves my skin feeling noticeably moisturized and soft. A little goes a long way, so this is not something you need to slather on to feel a difference. I would definitely recommend this product and will be keeping it as part of nighttime routine! Perfect addition for any nighttime routine
