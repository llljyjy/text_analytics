I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review:I didn’t find this moisturizer to be anything that was overly special I was a little disappointed in it. It just kind of sat there on my skin for awhile it took awhile for it to be absorbed into my skin and  was a little too thick feeling on my skin. As for how it worked to actually moisturize my skin, it did an alright job overall. I just don’t think I could justify spending in the future the price on this as I’ve had cheaper options work better for me. Worked okay not my favourite
