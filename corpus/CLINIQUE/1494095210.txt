Simply put, if your skin is dry, it will likely not be enough. If we were talking simply in terms of the texture or the initial feel, I’d say it’s lovely! If you prefer a lightweight moisturizer, I might say give it a try. However, my dry skin soaked it up WAY too quickly, and I found myself needing to reply after 1-2 hours. Glad to have had the opportunity to try it through Influenster, but not something I’ll purchase in future. nan
