I’ve received a sample. It really feels great on the skin,  lightweight yet nourishing,  I really like the texture and it did make my skin feel better,  less dry. However I am not sure about the wrinkle treatment, as the sample was small and only lasted around 3 days for me, I’d apply twice a day following cleanser and moisturizer. Feels great on the skin! not sure about wrinkle
