I tried out this serum together with the eye cream and regular cream from this same Clinique line. Everything in the line is fragrance-free and perfect for sensitive skin. They also blend more chemical ingredients with natural extracts. This serum, for example, in addition to containing retinol, also boasts caffeine, St. Paul’s Wort, sunflower seed extract, cucumber, extract, algae extract, etc. I always appreciate when skincare companies try to incorporate these sorts of ingredients and it’s particularly tricky when also ensuring the finished product is fragrance-free and won’t irritate sensitive skin. Lucky for us, Clinique know what they’re doing! While the eye cream and overall face cream led to noticeable results, I’m not quite sure what this serum was doing. It helped serve as a great base for the other two, but I’m not quite sure how necessary it is, as compared to a more affordable/basic serum. It may just be that it takes a lot more usage to see results (and I only used it for a few straight days). Be prepared to wear a sunscreen when using though, as it is a retinol product! For a serum, I find that pretty high-maintenance.I received this as a #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. Decent serum, not sure if a must-have
