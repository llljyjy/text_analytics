I am honored to have received a trial sized sample of this product to try and review. I am 35 with smile lines on my eyes. They arenâ€™t too deep yet, so I was so excited to try this product! So far, I have used it for a week and have noticed a slight decline in my smile lines. I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to other women with beginner wrinkles. Love!
