I have combination skin. I’m over 40 so I definitely look for wrinkle resistant products or for fine lines. I liked that this was fragrance free. It absorbed well. So far it did not cause breakouts which other products have done. I can’t say for sure it produced the results I’d expect but I’d have to use this longer than I did to really give feedback on results. Worth a try!
