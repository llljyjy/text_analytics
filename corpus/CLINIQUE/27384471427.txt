I received the Clinique wrinkle correcting eye cream complimentary from @influenster and @Clinique to review. I absolutely love this cream! The packaging is good quality. The cream is just the right consistency. Itâ€™s not too thin nor is it too thick. It only takes a small amount to dab around each eye and it absorbs perfectly! It made my eyes feel so hydrated and soft. After using for a a week I have seen my eyes tighten up in the corners and seem brighter around the underneath part of my eye. I really appreciate the opportunity to review this product and will definitely be purchasing more. I would recommend this to all my friends and family. So refreshing
