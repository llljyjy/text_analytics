I recived this complementary in exchange for my honest review. I used it every morning and evening along with my normal skincare products and in place of my normal moisturizer. I really like that it is truely unscented. After using this product for the last 4 weeks, I have seen a difference in deep wrinkles. I do feel it help with hydration which can help with the appearance of wrinkles but Iâ€™ve had better results with other products. Was happy to have been able to try it. Really good moisturizer
