I received a small sample as a #freeproduct from Topbox and gave it a try. I like to use a serum in the morning as part of my skin care routine and as a makeup base. I have dry, sensitive skin and foundations and BB creams dry my face and I find that this serum helped reduce the dryness and left my skin feeling silky and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product. Smooth skin
