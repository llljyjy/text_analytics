I received this #freeproduct as a mission from TopBox and I was excited to be chosen!  While I enjoy testing new skincare, I was especially excited to try this higher end product line.  I loved that the serum is the fragrance free, absorbed very quickly without leaving a tacky feeling. While I was only able to try this sample a few times, the results were remarkable.  If the packaging sample was larger, I would of really been able to put it to the test,  however it was really only a few uses that was available in the package.  Further testing would be best suited to try over a two week timeframe.  On a another note, I did not have any irritation or breakout. Clinique - Smart Clinical Repair Serum
