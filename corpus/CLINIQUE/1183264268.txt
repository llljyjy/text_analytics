I received this at no cost for my honest review. I enjoy the texture of the eye cream as a night treatment. It was very moisturizing without being too heavy feeling.  As a daytime option, I prefer a lighter formula under makeup. Fortunately, I have been home and makeup free more over the last few weeks and have applied twice a day a few times. It is very soothing though I have not seen any dramatic results. nan
