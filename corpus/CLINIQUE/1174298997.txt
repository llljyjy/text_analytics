Clinique’s All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly is the best scrub that I’ver ever used. I used to use Clinique’s Pep Start scrub before it was discontinued and it was the best I’ve ever used, but this scrub is better than it’s predecessor because it doesn’t contain any dye unlike the original Pep Start which had a brownish dye. I have sensitive skin and it’s difficult for me to find skincare products that don’t irritate and beak out my skin. This scrub doesn’t irritate my skin and it doesn’t make me break out. It washes my skin clean and it feels clean. This scrub is a 2 in 1 cleanser and exfoliator which means that you don’t have to use a toner after because the exfoliating part is already in the scrub hence in the name cleansing + exfoliating. Next, I moisturize with Clinique iD Dramatically Different Hydrating Clearing Jelly + Active Cartridge Concentrate for Imperfections. The combination of this scrub with Clinique’s iD Dramatically Different Hydrating Clearing Jelly makes my skin clear, healthy and not irritated. This scrub is worth giving it a try and try it with the clearing jelly. I’m on my second tube of this scrub. Take it from someone who has struggled with break outs and skin irritation, this scrub works. Best facial scrub out there
