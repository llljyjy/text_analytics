I have been using the product for a week now & so far have been enjoying it. The product takes the makeup off & does not leave a residue behind. I have used the original take the day off for a few years now as itâ€™s a really good product & have purchased several tubs over that time. So far I think I like the original over this one due to the consistency of the product but will see if that will change over time as I do like the charcoal benefit in this new one. I was sent this product for free In exchange for my honest review. nan
