I have dry/combination sensitive skin, but was excited to try this out to see if it would leave me waking up feeling hydrated and soft. I liked the gel like texture and putting it on felt silky smooth. Unfortunately, it made me break out and I felt just as dry in the morning. Might be good for someone with more oily skin, but I need a thicker cream. nan
