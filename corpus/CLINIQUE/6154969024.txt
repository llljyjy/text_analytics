I have repurchased this moisturizer multiple times over the years, and it continues to be my everyday, go to. I have oily skin, and this does a good job of moisturizing my skin without making me me more oily, or greasy, and it wears well under my makeup. I use something a little heavier at night, but this is my favorite daytime moisturizer. My Go to Daily Moisturizer for Years
