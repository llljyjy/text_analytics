I received a sample in exchange for my honest review. In my opinion, this eye cream wasn’t my favorite. It left a residue on my under eyes the following day after my nightly application and I didn’t feel like it absorbed well. I also don’t like that it isn’t a clean formula. It has a creamy consistency, which is nice but it didn’t remove dark circles or fine lines. Overall, it’s okay but nothing special in comparison to competitive eye creams. Nothing Special
