I just this mask a few days ago and I love it. It’s more like a thick cream and not really a mask. I’ve been using it nightly and every morning I wake up with very calm and soft skin. Also, it hasn’t clogged my pores and caused breakouts, that was my major worry. I’ll be buying more from now on. Works great.
