This is a great balm that gets rid of impurities and makeup easily. No fragrance so it kind of smells like old playdoh to me but I could get past it. There is no scoop included so you have to use your fingers or get your own tool. Be careful of using this to remove eye makeup as your vision will be cloudy afterwards for a couple minutes. Eye drops can offset this quickly. I finished the entire container but will not repurchase only because of the smell. If you have sensitive skin and need something no fuss this is a great option.
