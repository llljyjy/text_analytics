I received this product to try through Influenster! I very quickly fell in love with this cleanser; not only does it do a great job at cleaning my face, but it also leaves my skin feeling fresh. Though charcoal usually dries my skin out, this does wonders for my face! Surprisingly Universal Cleanser!
