I was sent this product complimentary by Influenster to review. I’ve tried many many eye creams over the last couple years, and this is the only one I could say has made a difference, most noticeablltbin hydration. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I think there has been some improvement in the small amount of fine lines under my eyes. I am very likely to purchase this product once I run out of my sample, which is gonna last me a long time. nan
