Personally, I find that this is a pretty solid cleansing oil. It gets rid of a majority of the makeup (except waterproof),and I find that it hasn’t broken me out at all! I do notice that my vision is a little cloudy after I rinse it off, but it’s nothing too extreme. I prefer to use it as the first step in my double -cleanse routine, and honestly, for the price, you can’t go wrong! Pretty decent cleansing oil!
