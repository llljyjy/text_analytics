I was excited to receive this to try! I have always been a fan of Clinique product  especially the all about eyes cream. This one is supposed to help with the wrinkles. Although I didn’t see major difference…maybe it’s because I’ve been using it for less than a month but I do like how it feel when put and light enough  I can apply my concealer on top of it right away Great eyecream
