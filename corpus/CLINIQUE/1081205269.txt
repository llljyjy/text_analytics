This is ok. I have very fair skin, and I didn’t realize the tint would be so dark and yellow. It does blend out ok, but even blended it’s a bit too dark for my skin tone. Wearing a light powder or foundation over it helps though. The texture is thick and drier, but applies surprisingly well on my dry skin. I do have to use a lot though, which is a bummer because you’ll just go through it faster. I prefer sunscreens that are more liquidy and light, but can’t wear chemical sunscreens, so am limited on my options. I bought this because it was marketed as a primer, and I think it does an ok job. Since it’s thicker though, if I wear foundation over it I feel like I’m wearing a mask on my face. It looks ok, but feels heavy. I also have clog-prone skin and I think this may make it worse. The jury is still out, but my pores do seem to be more clogged when I wear this daily. I don’t hate it enough to return it or toss it, but I don’t love it either. If you have medium or dark skin tone and skin that isn’t clog-prone, you may have better luck. nan
