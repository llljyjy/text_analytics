I received a sample of this product from topbox #freeproduct. I used this in my morning routine. The serum absorbs instantly, no greasy residue and left my face with a very nice, smooth mat finish, which was perfect base for application of a moisturizer..I didn’t have enough sample to try it long enough to see if it has any effect on fine lines but Clinique usually lives up to it’s claims and regardless this is a lovely serum. Great serum to try
