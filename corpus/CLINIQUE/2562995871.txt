I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion.  And to be honest, I love serums so I was really excited to try this.  I wish the sample size was bigger because it’s so hard to get a good sense of a product after two or three tries.  This wasn’t bad and I loved the way my skin feels after using it.  It’s not sticky or greasy and my skin is left hydrated and soft.  I would definitely recommend.  I don’t know that I could afford it unless it’s on sale but Clinique is usually pretty good so maybe.  I did really like the product though so it’s one I would use again if given the chance. nan
