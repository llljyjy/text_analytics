I received this product in exchange for my honest review from influenster. I usually use facial moisturizer on my eye area, but this product really surprised me with its emollience and creaminess. I truly enjoy using it, and a little goes a long way. I find myself reaching for it daily and I believe it improves the look of my undereye area. Surprisingly great!
