I received this #freeproduct to try at home in a exchange for my honest review. I really loved this serum although I can’t attest to its effectiveness on wrinkles as I couldn’t try it for long enough. I used it in the morning before applying my makeup. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. No scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin. Would definetly buy the full size in order to use it for a longer period of time. Would recommend.
