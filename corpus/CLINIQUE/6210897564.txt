I was skeptical at first because it’s labeled for oily to normal skin. I have normal to dry skin with eczema on my face. When I first used it my first thoughts were that it’s a silky texture. After my first use I was pleasantly surprised to see that my skin didn’t feel dryer or tight. It removed my makeup very very well. I will say that you don’t use this by itself as a cleanser. This is a first step cleanse followed by cleansing. Think of it as your makeup wipe. I personally don’t use makeup wipes for about 3 years. I would just double cleanse when I wore makeup. Something that I also really enjoy, is that it’s fragrance free. nan
