I received a deluxe sample size of this to review. It’s not enough to get a long term effect of the product overall, however I can speak to other factors. What is nice is that it is very light and dries down very nicely. It isn’t overly scented if scented at all which is also very nice. The few times I’ve worn it hasn’t caused breakouts or clogged pores, but again I can’t speak to the long term effects of the product. nan
