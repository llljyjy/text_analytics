Works like a charm! My acne cleared up fairly quickly although it does burn in areas that are more sensitive ( my chin and nose ) and if you place it too close to your eyes it does make them water up so I wouldn’t recommend this if you have sensitive skin as it’s pretty strong. Apart from that, it works wonders! nan
