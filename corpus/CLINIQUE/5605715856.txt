I have combination skin with very dry areas and also oily areas that get hormonal breakouts. I received a free sample of this moisturizer to try, and really liked it. A little bit of product goes a long way when applying. The gel consistency is great for daytime since itâ€™s so light and absorbs quickly. I found this looked good under makeup, especially my concealer which tends to get a little creased on the dry spots of my nose. I would recommend this to others as a nice basic gel moisturizer. Good basic gel moisturizer
