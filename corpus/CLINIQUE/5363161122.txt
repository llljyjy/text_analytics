I received this sample from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review.  I used this for 3 nights in a row and I am extremely impressed.  The cream is more gel like and makes my skin feel amazing the next morning. It feels lightweight but definitely hydrates the skin.  I have not used it long enough to say if it has helped with fine lines or wrinkles. I donâ€™t find there is a scent to this cream either. Really nice cream
