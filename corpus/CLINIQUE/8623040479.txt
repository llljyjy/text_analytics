I’m giving 4 stars because I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to see results quite yet! I’ll come back when it’s been a bit longer! It’s very creamy and blendable and soaks into the skin nicely! A little goes a long way! Nice product thus far and I’m hoping to upgrade to 5 stars after longer use! Still testing
