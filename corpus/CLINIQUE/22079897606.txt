I received this for free from Influencer in exchange for my honest review. I use this at night after washing my face and it works well. It’s nice and hydrating, fragrance free and it doesn’t feel oily. It makes my skin so soft I love it. My skin is always dry and this has helped hydrate my skin so much. I haven’t noticed my wrinkles going away but I haven’t used it that long. Great
