A majority of the ingredients used in his cleanser is pretty beneficial for the skin. I personally liked that the liquid was a clear odorless gel which is perfect for anyone sensitive to fragrances. The beads inside the formula and the packaging is environmentally friendly. The only con I have is that I thought that the beads were still a little hard on my skin which I am worried it may cause microtears, definitely isnâ€™t a cleanser to be used daily though. Good Cleanser
