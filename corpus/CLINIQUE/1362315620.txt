I received a small sample for review purposes.    I loved that there was little to no scent and the product was quite hydrating without leaving an oily residue.   I used this prior to applying foundation and it gave my skin a dewy look.   I removed a star as itâ€™s not possible for me to provide a fulsome review as I only had enough product for 4 applications. nan
