Really works.  I wasn’t sure what to expect as the reviews are all over the place. I think the trick is to use it a few nights in a row right as your blackheads are just starting to come in.  If I wait until they’re an issue, this is less effective.  But if I nail the timing, theblackheads truly go away more quickly- AND it keeps me from removing them myself- so bad for our skin.  I also always love using Clinique because it’s great for my sensitive skin and I don’t have to think twice about it. surprisingly effective
