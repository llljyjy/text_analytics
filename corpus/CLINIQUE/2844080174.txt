It is such an amazing products and works for so many different skin types. Both my boyfriend and I are huge fans of it. I have normal combo skin so I get very well in it heâ€™s only in the summers and he has very dry skin. It works well for both of us. It has a very gel-like consistency but really does pack a punch when it comes to hydration! Highly recommended! one of best moisturizers in the market!
