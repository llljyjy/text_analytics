I received this product for a trial from #topboxcircle. The trial size wasn’t sufficient to see any results. Although I can say it goes on smooth and moisturizes. I was not left with a sticky residue. It should be suited for most woman looking to smooth out wrinkles and brighten their complexion. Overall decent product, but can’t state on the results for what it claims. Wrinkle correction
