Got a free sample of this wrinkle correcting serum from Topbox. It wasn’t enough to give a thorough review but this is what I thought of what I had used: I used this serum at night before bed with the wrinkle correcting cream and wrinkle correcting eye cream. It was pretty thick but still absorbed fairly quickly and I loved that it had a soft, gentle, and floral scent; it was light scented enough that it didn’t bother my sleep. Overall, I would say this serum is good. #gotitfree #freeproduct #trywithtopbox #notsponsored Was Nice
