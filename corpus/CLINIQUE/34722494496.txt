After just 10 days I feel like I can see a difference! I’ve developed some serious “laugh lines” but this seems to be lessening their appearance and I love that it is fragrance free! It also absorbs really nicely, is very hydrating, and though I don’t have a lot of puffiness it has reduced some of the morning swelling!Disclaimer: I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review - but I honestly do love it! A little goes a long way! A little goes a long way!
