This was great for my combination skin!! My skin felt nice and supple long after I had applied the product & looked/felt very hydrated - this product really does last as long as it claims. The moisturizer has a gel-like texture, which I quite enjoyed, especially now that the weather is warming up, its great to have a lightweight moisturizer. Would recommend to anyone with combination/dry skin + will definitely be restocking this product. great!!
