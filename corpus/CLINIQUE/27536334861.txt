Just because this eye cream isn’t for me, doesn’t mean it isn’t for you. I started using this eye cream every morning and after about a week, the skin under my eyes was dry. So I stopped using it. Maybe I should have tried every other day to begin. But instead I went back to mh old eye cream. Might be for you!
