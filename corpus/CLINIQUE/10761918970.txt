I received a free sample size of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum courtesy of Topbox Circle. I was super impressed with the results from other users and from clinical trials and I couldn’t wait to see if the fine lines around my eyes would be minimized after using the serum. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to use it long enough because the sample only lasted me about a week, but I’d love to try it for longer to see results. I’m looking forward to trying more of Clinique’s products. Amazing Results from Other Users
