I liked how this felt,  it has a nice pillowy consistency and seemed to moisturize well. I did notice a dry  patch under my eye after using this for about a week. It could definitely be from the weather since there is no other irritation. Iâ€™ve seen no other results but will continue using it since I like how it feels. nan
