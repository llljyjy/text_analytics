I really like the new Clinique Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correcting cream. It has a very light frangrance which is not overpowering. When you apply the cream, it feels moiturizing and light. I have been using it for about two weeks and I am starting to see improvement in the small wrinkles near my eyes. This is a great cream if you prefer a light moisturizer to a more heavy cream. nan
