I got this sample thru #trywithtopbox. I really enjoy the texture. It is not liquidly runny and not thick. Just the right amount of thickness. I feel super nourished after applying this on my face. There is no scent to this. But it is not advertised as scent free. This serum does make some lines go away. Which is really beautiful. I really love this and I would definitely buy the full size. I wear this night and day. Perfect for all weather or season. A Yes for me!
