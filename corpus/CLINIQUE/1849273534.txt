I am a 30 year old female with skin on the dry side but also acne prone.  My skin concerns are fine lines, dry/ flaky skin,  and breakouts.  I used this moisturizer for about 1 week both morning and night. The moisturizer is a lightweight gel texture and I didn’t notice a fragrance which I liked. I found if left my skin very soft without being greasy. I was worried it would leave my skin feeling dry as it doesn’t feel as thick as my usual day and night cream, but it didn’t. It left my skin moisturized all day and I didn’t get a greasy forehead at the end of the day as I sometimes do. I used this in spring so I’m  not sure how it would do as a winter moisturizer in a dry cold climate.  However, I would use this again. Moisturizing gel cream
