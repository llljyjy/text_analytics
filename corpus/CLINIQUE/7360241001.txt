I don’t know received this #freesample from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my review. Firstly, I really love that this serum is fragrance free; this is so important to my sensitive, dermatitis/acne prone skin. The consistency was runny so a full size bottle would be easier to get the proper amount. It soaked into my skin instantly and left my skin looking plump and extremely soft/silky. I’m sore with continued use I would see softening if any wrinkles. Overall a nice serum which felt luxe. Silky skin
