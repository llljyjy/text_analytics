I did receive a sample of this in exchange for my honest opinion. Honestly, I did not like this product. I do want to start by saying I love almost everything from Clinique, especially their moisturizers. This one I did not enjoy, however. First application it went on similar to a water gel but more creamy. My skin felt silky smooth and I thought it was going to be great. As the wrinkle cream started to dry, it become very tacky and goopy. I even applied another moisturizer from a different brand to try to get rid of the stickiness. Did not work, as soon as it dried the tackiness was back. The next day it was the same thing no matter how long I let it dry. One thing I did like was you only have to use a small amount. A little goes a long way so I don’t think I applied too much. For those that don’t like fragrance there was no scent. I did not experience any irritation either. I also did not see any affect on fine lines or wrinkles but the sample only lasted a week so I can not fairly judge that. I have very dry skin and it did moisturize but the tackiness was too much. I will not be purchasing this product nor will I be recommending it. Rare miss from Clinique
