I love this product! As someone who has tried many different types of cleansing balms, I can honestly say this is the best one. Not only is the application so seamless, but it instantly removes my makeup and residue built up on my skin after a long day. The only downside of this product is the fact that it doesnâ€™t come with a spatula to remove the product so you have to do it with your fingers. This product has been amazing for my skin and is already an integral part of my nighttime routine Obsessed.
