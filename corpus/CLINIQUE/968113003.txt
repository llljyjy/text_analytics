This cream is gentle on my face especially using it by my eyes. Itâ€™s fragrance free and did not irritate my skin around my eyes. I gave it a 3 star rating because I did not see that big of difference after using it. I gave it a few weeks and it was just like putting cream on my face with not a lot of changes seen. nan
