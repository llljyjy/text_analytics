The tint is why I bought it because I liked the idea of an easy blend. After trying it multiple times and switching up my face care routine to try and make it work, I have to say it’s not what I thought it was.  It leaves a almost shimmer type of look on my skin and it felt super greasy. My face broke out pretty bad after each time. It doesn’t take much product to work in but I didn’t feel like it was hydrating my skin. It feels like a slimy layer sitting on top of my face. I only give this two stars because it is a SPF and I’m sure it does that job. I really wanted to like this because I like Clinique and have several other products that are amazing but it is not up to their standers with this product. Greasy and weird finish after applied.
