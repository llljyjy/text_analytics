I liked how this product applied and absorbed into my skin. It was non-greasy. I liked how it smelled and I think it hydrated my skin well. I used it morning and night and it worked well applying makeup over it. I only had a small sample so Iâ€™m not sure if it helped with wrinkles but I definitely would be willing to try a full sized one. I tried this #freeproduct in exchange for a review. nan
