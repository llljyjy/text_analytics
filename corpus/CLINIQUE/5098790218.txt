I received a small sample of this #freeproduct to try via #tryitwithtopbox. It was a small sample so hard to be able to accurately review the claims the company makes regarding wrinkle repair. The serum is lightly scented and lovely texture. It absorbs quickly and works well under my other skin care products and makeup. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it. If I knew it would be great at wrinkle repair, I would highly recommend this product, but with only a couple days of trials, I have no idea. It however doesn’t feel sticky or slick, and doesn’t appear greasy. Worth a try if that’s what you are looking for but I can make no claims towards their promises. Smooth, silky and non greasy
