I got the opportunity to test this very small #freeproduct sample in exchange of my sincere review. I have been using it for a week + few days as part of my night skin care routine before applying face and eye cream; the serum is very light and quickly absorbing, so you donâ€™t have to wait a long time to continue applying the rest of the products. I liked the sensation of my face after completing my routine before going to bed! Recommended. Absorbs very fast!
