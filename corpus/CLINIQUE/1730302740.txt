Clinique says that results from this product are visible in 4 weeks, but I ran out of my sample after 2 weeks so I canâ€™t really speak to its true effectiveness at fighting wrinkles. But it claims to combat fine lines and dryness, and I can definitely attest to the latter at least. A little goes a long way and it left my dry skin feeling hydrated the rest of the day. There is a bit of a plumping effect that minimizes fine lines as well. This product is fragrance free and free of parabens and phthalates, so it should be good for sensitive skin. nan
