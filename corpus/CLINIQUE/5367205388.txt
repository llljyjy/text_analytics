I received this product for free (sample size 17oz/5ml) from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I knew after checking the ingredient list that it would likely cause issues for my skin (I have been diagnosed by a dermatologist with seborrheic dermatitis/massezia issues in addition to hormonal/cystic and regular acne), but still chose to patch test it on the same 2 spots/areas (on jawline, one near chin, one near ear) to see how it worked out. It does not have a strong scent/fragrance, thankfully, and has a decent, lightweight texture. I personally wouldn’t consider it very moisturizing or hydrating.  Unfortunately it caused burning/tingling upon first application so I used a very small amount. My skin was mildly red/irritated in the 2 areas I put it on by the end of each day that I applied it, and also felt a bit more dry and tight than the rest of my face. I only used/patch tested it for 3 days. I discontinued the trial so as not to cause long-lasting irritation. I’m sure this would work well for the right person, but unfortunately it is not a good match for me. Aside from the diagnoses I listed previously, I have sensitive/reactive, mostly combo skin that leans more dry, sometimes scaly/flaky and red, around my nose/mouth and chin, and oily on forehead and cheeks.    I’m sorry if this review isn’t very helpful. I feel bad leaving a bad review since I knew it wouldn’t compatible with my skin, but hopefully it helps someone else with fungal issues avoid trying it just for the heck of it. Finding the right moisturizer is quite frustrating with seb derm/rosacea/etc. Not for my skin type/diagnosed issues
