I used a sample size of this product for 5 days. I love the texture of this cream. It is satiny and goes on so smooth. It was super hydrating and made my skin feel soft and thoroughly moisturized. the only reason I gave it a 5 star rating is because I donâ€™t know the long time effect of this product. But I definitely need to buy more!! Love this cream! Looooove it
