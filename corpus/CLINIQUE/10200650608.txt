I received a sample of this product to test, and overall I would say itâ€™s a decent moisturizer. I have dry skin and this was definitely not my favourite product out there for my skin personally. It applied easily, was a slightly thicker texture and absorbed into the skin rather quickly. Decent for dry skin
