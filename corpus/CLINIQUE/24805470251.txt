I received a small sample of this product through Influenster for my honest review. The product itself is a nice thick cream that in time may have yielded great results. Unfortunately due to the small size of this sample, it’s almost impossible for me to thoroughly review the efficacy of an anti aging skincare product. Please stop sending samples and expecting people to provide honest and thorough reviews when you know it’s not sufficient enough for proper testing. Far too small of a sample to leave honest review
