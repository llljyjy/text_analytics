I received a sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum to try and review #freeproduct.  There was no scent which I appreciated and this (along with the Correcting Cream) left my skin feeling nice and soft with no adverse reactions.  I cannot speak to the long term effectiveness of the product but would be willing to purchase and try. nan
