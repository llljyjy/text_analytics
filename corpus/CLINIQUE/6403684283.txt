The only eye product I’ve tried that actually visibly does what it claims. I’ve had puffy under eyes for a long time, mostly genetic. This zaps them unlike anything I’ve tried (biossance, caudalie, the works). Plus, the texture is really luxurious and the formula is gentle enough that it doesn’t sting my eyes. nan
