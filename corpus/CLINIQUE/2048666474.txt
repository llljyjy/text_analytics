I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free (#freeproduct) as part of the Topbox Circle Review program. I really loved the texture of this product (it almost reminded me of aloe vera) and how it made my skin feel refreshed. When you first put it on, it feels very cooling and wet, but the product does quickly absorb into the skin. This product does have a scent to it so if you have any sensitivities to scents, this might not be the product for you. I personally really liked the scent. I did not notice it correcting any wrinkles, perhaps because I only got to sample a tiny amount. A refreshing serum
