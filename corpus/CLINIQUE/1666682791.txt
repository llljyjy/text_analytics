I had the chance to try Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct to review. I used the serum in the morning as part of my daily routine. I enjoyed that the serum is light, with a bit of a silky feeling. With regular use, I think I would see positive results with my fine lines. Light and silky!
