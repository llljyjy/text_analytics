I was over the moon to receive the New Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for free with a review from Influenster. The texture is perfection. The skin around my eyes is quite sensitive and this has not caused any sensitivity. It feels wonderful to apply. I have only been using this product for two weeks but Iâ€™ve notices a reduction in the fine lines and the crepey areas under my eyes. This is a fantastic eye cream that works very well for my skin type Truly Smart Clinical Repair
