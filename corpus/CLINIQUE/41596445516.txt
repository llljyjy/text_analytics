As I’m going through my 40’s ,  I’ve started noticing lines where there weren’t any before. On my forehead and eyes (I think they are called crows feet, I think they look more like baby chick feet) and on the corners of my mouth (probably from arguing with my husband, j/k) I received some of the Clinique smart clinical repair complimentary from #influenster to try. I noticed a difference almost immediately. After a couple days I noticed a smoother forehead and less lines around my eyes and mouth. I’m even arguing less because I’m so happy with the way I look. The product goes on nicely and absorbs completely. Not an abundant aroma and bottom line, it works. I use it every morning after my shower and will continue to do so. I love this stuff. You need to buy it and try it for yourself. Two thumbs way way up! Omg, this stuff is awesome.
