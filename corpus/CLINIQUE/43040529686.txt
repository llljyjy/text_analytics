I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  This serum went on nicely and absorbed very well.  It didnt seem to leave my skin greasy feeling like some other products do.  The scent is super light and not overpowering.  It did seem to leave my skin feeling and looking softer and smoother.  Unfortunately it was a very small sample (enough for a few days use), so Im unsure of the long term outcome. Nice and light
