The consistency is gel like and applies smoothly onto the skin. I also didn’t smell any strong fragrance.  However, I don’t feel like it seeped into my skin well enough and kind of reminded me of a drugstore gel cream (ex. Neutrogena). I feel like you can find other creams that provide a deeper hydration. It might work for some, but it isn’t my cup of tea! Not My Favourite!
