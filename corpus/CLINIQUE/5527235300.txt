I wash this face cleanser in shower, made my skin super CLEAR, I noticed my blackheads on my nose were gone! My magnify mirror don’t lie. No perfume, no dye, no crazy stuff but very clean. The exfoliate beads was very subtle because it doesn’t scratch at all like st ives apricot scrub. Its more like gently exfoliating. I only use twice or 3 times a week because its only for dirty face from busy day or wore makeup all day. I have sensitive and oily skin, so I found this perfect cleanser. After clean, make sure you put toner, serum and moisture or face spray. Definitely, will repurchase again! It removes blackheads and dirty oily face!
