This is a great new product from Clinique. it had a very subtle fragrance. I did see a few small results after using it. I had a small sample size so I have no doubt that I would see even more results with longer use.  I saw reduced fine lines after using this nightly for a short amount of time. i liked the consistency of the cream, it was light, not oily, and absorbed into my skin quickly. I would buy this product again. Received a free sample from Influenster for my honest review. Fine lines goodbye
