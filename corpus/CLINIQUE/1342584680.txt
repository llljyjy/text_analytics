My favourite thing about this moisturizer is the texture. It feels sooooo nice on my skin - it just glides on in the most pleasant way. I’m a bit confused about the reviews that say the scent is too strong - I don’t think this product has a scent at all, or if it does, it’s very subtle. Perhaps they reformulated? I also liked that I could apply sunscreen and foundation on top without any pilling.I have mildly dry to normal skin, not super dry or oily. I found this to be a perfect hydrating moisturizer to go under my sunscreen during the day. However, it’s not as heavy or moisturizing as I’d like for bedtime. Love the texture!
