I received a small sample of this product and can only comment on my first impressions. I really liked how moisturizing it was and how quickly it absorbed into my skin. It was not sticky feeling and didnâ€™t have any chemical smell to it. I used it day and night in combination with the wrinkle correcting cream and liked the products together. nan
