I like this cleanser, but I use it as a treatment product. I cleanse with a normal foaming cleanser most of the week and use this every 3 days to keep acne at bay. My skin feels really smooth afterwards. It is watery but they created the bottle so only a small amount is dispersed. It’s actually pretty difficult to find salicylic cleansers with no fragrance so I’ll get this again once it’s through. Personally I wouldn’t ever use this kind of cleanser every day…it’s not necessary IMO.  That would be a bit too harsh for most people’s skin. Twice a Week, Keeps Skin Fresh!
