I enjoyed this product and it was easy to use for the most part. My only complaint is that I had to wipe it away after. The ease of use isnâ€™t as simple as a makeup wipe (I.e. use and toss away). It involves other things for example a makeup eraser sponge or a tissue or a towel to clean off the product once it has broken up the makeup. It did however work extremely well and fast even on my waterproof products! :)I received the product for free from Influenster in exchange for a fair and honest review. Good not Great
