Lightweight, hydrating, gel like consistency - but mediocre. Don’t think it’s worth the price point even with the sale. I received a free product so I have been using it consistency, but i don’t really feel like it does much, except hydrates - but even then I would not say it’s up to 96 hours worth of hydration. I certainly would not say it works for dark circles and fine lines/elasticity. I’ve had the product over about a month now and just now did I come to see what the claims are. I was surprised to see it targets dark circles when my under eyes are pretty dark but I did not notice a difference after using it day and night. The only positive thing I would say is that I have been on tret recently, and sometimes I get the ointment on my eye lids & under eyes which cause them to be very dry and tight, and this product has been helping it a lot, but along side of using this product, I also use another moisturizing eye cream & slug my eyes as well. So I’m not sure if this alone would do anything. I wouldn’t recommend nor would I purchase. Meh
