I received this product as part of a secret campaign. I actually really liked this product. I found that itâ€™s one of those few eye creams that actually works. I liked that it was not heavy and was not greasy. It has done wonders for my tired mom eyes. I however do not plan to purchase this product in the future only because clinique is not a cruelty free certified brand. nan
