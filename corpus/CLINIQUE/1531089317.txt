I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.I have been using this product for several weeks, now, morning and evening.The cream is a thick, but not heavy consistency, that spreads evenly on my skin.I found it to absorb quickly, without leaving any residue on the surface. My skin did not feel greasy after application.I did not see any immediate results from the use of this product.After several days of use, my skin feels soft and smooth, but did not show any major changes.After several weeks of use, it is my opinion that this cream doesnâ€™t have any benefits that would cause me to recommend or purchase, myself.I find this product has far too many unnecessary ingedients for my taste. No visible results
