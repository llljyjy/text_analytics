So I have hormonal acne and really started having bad breakouts the last 7 months and this is one of the only things that have helped me keep it under control. I’ve been using this product for a month now. It can dry you out if used more than once a day at first so definitely get a good hydrating moisturizer! I was using it twice a day then started to only use it once and the dry spots stopped. It really just depends on what you’re pairing it with, how often you use it, OR your skin type if this becomes drying. nan
