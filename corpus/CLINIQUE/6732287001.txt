I’m in my mid thirties and have been trying different creams and serums for wrinkles and aging skin, but this one is my favorite so far.  It’s thick but not heavy.  It goes on nice and feels good not heavy. I am going to try this for a few months and see if I can tell a difference in my wrinkles, if not it still is one of the best I’ve tried! nan
