I received a sample of this from Topbox as a #freeproduct. I love that this has retinoid in it and hyaluronic acid. It was really gentle on my skin (I regularly use retinol) and very hydrating. I added this into my PM skincare routine for a few days (as long as the sample lasted) and I am eager to buy the full size to see the long term effects! Loved it
