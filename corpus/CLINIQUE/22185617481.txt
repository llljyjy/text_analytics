The first week I used the Clineique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting cream i noticed that my wrinkles around my eyes lookd smoother. I love the lightweight texture and that the cream is not sticky on my skin. I have pale normal to oily skin, you do not need to put a lot, it really works. I received a free sample for my honest feedback. It works!
