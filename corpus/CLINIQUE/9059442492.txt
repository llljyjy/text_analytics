I only had a travel sized amount to try on my face. I have enjoyed the texture of this product. It’s pretty thick and goes on smoothly. I can tell that it is hydrating my skin. There is no fragrance as all Clinique products, so I truly appreciate the low chance of side effects from this product. I can’t tell if there is any significant difference in how this product has smoothed out my wrinkles. If it was in hydrating product or a calming product, I would give it five stars. I think I need a few more months to see if my wrinkles go away from this smart clinical repair. Smooth and hydrating
