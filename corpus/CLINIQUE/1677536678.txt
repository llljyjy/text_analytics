If you’re looking for something super light weight for summer time this is perfect. I have dry, dehydrated skin and was sceptical of the “100 hours” but I did still feel super hydrated the morning after my first application. I’d probably want something thicker for the winter months but for all other seasons this is great. I like the consistency. It’s a gel like moisturizer. Just in time for summer!
