LISTEN I’ve tried DOZENS of moisturizers for my greasy, oily skin and this one is one of the only ones that doesn’t leave my skin looking like my face was just soaked in oil yet still hydrates and smoothens out my pores and texture. Not sticky at all and it just feels comfortable. Other moisturizers end up feeling greasy after 1-2 hours. This one just feels so clean and absorbs soooo well into the skin. I probably have the most oily skin in the world so trust me when I say this stuff actually controls oil it’s crazy. My skin is olive/tan with hyperpigmentation, acne scars from years ago, large pores, and horomonal acne…the most difficult skin to deal with especially around my period because I get a lot of hormonal breakouts (white heads and cysts). Trust me this stuff is amazing. Just for reference other moisturizers that have also worked for me are the neutrogena hydroboost gel and the drunk elephant peptide something. I still like this one better. Only gel moisturizers will work for me and this one helps tremendously. It also works flawlessly with all of my makeup. nan
