I love this eye cream. It’s super thick and goes on my skin very smoothly. I’ve been using this for a couple of years now. I noticed my under eye lines smoothed quite a bit, and new ones don’t appear as quickly. Nothing super dramatic though, just what you can expect from a good moisturizer. Didn’t do much for my dark circles, but they’re pretty much anatomical, so I wasn’t really expecting any improvements there. nan
