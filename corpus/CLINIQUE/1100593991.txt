This eye cream works as a “repair wrinkle corrector” but even if you don’t have much eye wrinkles, i feel like it works well for preventative care. It’s whipped creamy texture glides around the eyes smoothly and gives the skin a subtle glow. It’s thick enough to last around the eyes all night. After using it for awhile, I noticed I rarely get puffy eyes and dark circles.  I also like that it doesn’t have any fragrance smell to it. The only thing i struggled with was the jar itself. In order for you to not get it in your nails when putting your finger in it, you will need an applicator to get the product. nan
