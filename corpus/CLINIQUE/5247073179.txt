i got this as a sample when i ordered some other clinique cleansing products and I must say it’s great! It’s thicker than vaseline, but reminds me of that when i use it. I rub this all over my face & makeup then wipe off with a washcloth. I usually then just use the clinique clarifying lotion after and my face is clean. I would purchase this for sure! nan
