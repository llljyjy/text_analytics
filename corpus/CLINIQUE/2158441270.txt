This is a nice moisturizer. It’s similar to a water-cream in texture but with a slight silicone-type feel to it. That might sound weird, but it’s actually a good thing because it glides right over your skin and makes it feel nice and smooth. I’m really impressed at how well this moisturizer absorbes into my skin. No greasy or oily feeling at all! And of course, on top of these factors, it does do a good job of moisturizing my skin. Oh, and it’s totally scent-free! nan
