I love this under eye cream! It is hydrating and works wonders as long as you use it twice a day everyday. I had seen a difference within a month. It wasn’t a huge difference, but I am sure there will be more difference the longer I use it. It is in cream form, hypoallergenic and has no scent. A little bit goes a long way, so you will get your money’s worth. I did receive this product free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. This is my honest review. Great!
