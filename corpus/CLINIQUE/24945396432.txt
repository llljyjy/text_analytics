Of the three #freesamples I got from #trywithtopbox this is true one I wish was bigger. I absolutely love this serum. I usually like a serum that doesn’t dry completely out. And this serum feels like it has staying power under your moisturizer, and even though I cannot attest for its long term abilities a can however tell you that it has instant smoothing action and because it doesn’t dry out completely, once you use your moisturizer or makeup- whatever; it’s fills in the wrinkle lines giving the skin a smooth wrinkle-free appearance. Great stuff! I’m 48, check my eye pic! The serum that stays!
