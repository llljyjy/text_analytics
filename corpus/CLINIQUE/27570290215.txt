I have been using this product for a week and am loving how it feels on my face. It is a light, silky formula that soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It is light enough that I have been using it with the wrinkle correcting cream and the rest of my regular beauty routine. I will continue using it to hopefully get the benefits it claims. #freeproduct Silky, soft serum. A daily must have.
