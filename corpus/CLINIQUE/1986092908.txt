I received a sample of this product to test in exchange for my honest review, courtesy of Topbox Circle. #freesample I was only able to get one use out of the sample packet I received for this serum, and so I cannot comment on the wrinkle correcting aspects of the product. However, I really did enjoy how it made my skin feel. Even after just one use, my skin felt more plump and hydrated. I like the light texture of the serum - it is not sticky at all and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling tacky. It has zero scent to it, which makes it perfect for anyone with scent sensitivities. Skin feels plump after just one use
