Was so excited to try this, glad I didnâ€™t buy the large bottle. It smells like cologne that has expired. I love and prefer unisex scents- but the smell is really noxious, not something I can wear. Also bothered someone in my vicinity when I put it on. Whether or not it relaxed me, hard to say. Will be returning this. Disappointing!
