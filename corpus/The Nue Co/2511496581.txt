Expensive and I broke out in acne so badly on my face in places I never get it. I threw the product away in the garbage after 22 days in. I tried to see it thru! My skin is getting better slowly but I learned my lesson and wonâ€™t be investing into these types of marketing heavy products moving forward. Was uncertain when I purchased this item if it was for only caucasian people or ethnic (melanin skin) as well. nan
