The smell is like a men’s cologne without the headache side effect. Size is too small for the price. Scent is very strong (one spray is plenty in a well ventilated room), and lasts too long. I prefer products that are made with pure essential oils, not synthetic “parfume“. Overall, I will use it carefully because it does smell good. a little goes a long way
