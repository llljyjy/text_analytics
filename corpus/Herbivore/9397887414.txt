I’m usually very hesitant to try new serums since my skin is so sensitive and finicky, but this one was a dream. After applying Nova on my face and back daily for a week, I was amazed to see that my dark acne scars had actually brightened and become less noticeable. Super eager to see the benefits after even more consistent use <3 The serum itself is lightweight, refreshing, gentle, and absorbs easily into the skin. It’s such a no-brainer to add to your routine - I applied after cleanser and toner, and before moisturizing. People have been commenting that I’ve been glowing since I’ve started using this serum - soo happy to have found a brightening product that feels so clean and works for my sensitive skin! <3 nan
