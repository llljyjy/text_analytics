My favourite face oil that Iâ€™ve tried so far. Always makes my skin look and feel absolutely fabulous! I live in Canada and we have very cold winters, and I find this oil helps with my dry skin. You only need 3 or 4 drops at most each use, the tiny bottle has lasted me a long time. This is one skin care item I think I would be okay splurging on, worth the money. favourite facial oil
