Omg! Moon Fruit Serum is a plant-based, retinol-alternative serum that’s clinically proven to treat signs of aging with 1% bakuchiol isolate + plant peptides. It gives me powerful results with zero irritation—even on the most sensitive skin. It has 1% Bakuchiol Isolate, Plant Peptides, Schisandra Berry Extract, Superfruits: Mulberry, Fig, Pomegranate, Ginkgo, Kangaroo Paw Flower Extract. Highly recommend this serum! nan
