WOW! Got this as a rewards points sample and I couldn’t wait to favorite it to buy the full size eventually. The smell is absolutely incredible. I love that’s it’s all natural ingredients and my skin was glowing within a few days of use. I also have acne prone skin + sensitive and this gave me no trouble at all. smells amazing
