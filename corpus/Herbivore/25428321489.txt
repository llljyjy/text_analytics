Great product. My favourite vitamin C serum is Beauty Counter - All Bright C serum….and this one compares. I would still say the beauty counter serum is a bit better at what it does….but this one is super close. My only complaint is the shape of the bottle. When you get to the point where the pump no longer picks up the product…..you’re left with shaking the bottle to try and get the remainder out and so much gets trapped on the top ridge. nan
