This is my favorite cleanser so far. I use it as my second cleanse. IDK about make-up remover because it can’t even remove physical sunscreens. But as a second cleanse, I love it. No overpowering smell, safe ingredients ...Only issue with this is the pump. It often gets stuck. Pretty annoying.4 stars. Once again this is my favorite 2nd cleanse, BUT it’s a bit pricey and pump is sometimes wonky. nan
