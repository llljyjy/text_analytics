My friend bought this for me and I was super excited to use it , but nope. There is mold/green stuff in the applicator and the smell is horribly strong. Not for someone with a sensitive nose. I don’t notice any improvement so I will be tossing. I have only had it for 1 month and it’s already green on the applicator. Horrible packaging
