I loved how this vitamin c serum made my face shine and pop with brightness. It made my skin feel plump and not dull at all. The serum was nice and thick and absorbed well into my skin. It does have turmeric in it so donâ€™t be surprised when you get a slight curry smell on your face. It does dissipate quickly. Glowy skin!
