The jar I received is a dark green, and while a strong smell, it smells exactly like the blue tansy oil, so I know it’s not rancid. Personally, I like it. I like the goopy texture, I just use a spatula that I got with one of my cleansing balms. I don’t know if it’s really helping my acne too much, but my skin does feel so much smoother after using it. I think I saw a couple reviews saying that it burned them, but if it leaves your skin red, you clearly have more sensitive skin than you think. Leave it on for 5 minutes to start and see how your skin reacts. I only have a couple small issues with it. First, it’s kind of hard to wash off. I now only use it before I shower because I hate washing it off in the sink. Second, I saw all the reviews saying it grew mold after they had it a while, so I’m trying to use it quickly and am storing it in a skincare fridge. I wish herbivore wouldn’t use just ‘natural’ preservatives and would actually use safe/effective ones, but that kind of goes for all of their products. good, but some issues
