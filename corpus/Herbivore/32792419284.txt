So far I’m really liking Herbivore’s new Vitamin C serum! Unlike other Vitamin C serums I love that this includes anti-inflammatory Turmeric. I’ve been using it morning and night on dry, sensitive skin and I have not had any issues with clogged pores or breakouts from this lightweight formula. The texture feels great — it’s just right. The formula has a faint aroma of Turmeric (which I am used to because I cook with this frequently), but for those who don’t care for it, it’s not super strong and doesn’t linger. After two weeks of use, my skin feels healthier and a noticeably hydrated glow! Worked well for my dry, sensitive skin!
