The packaging is gorgeous but the product is horrendous. I felt like I was rubbing hamburger grease into my face. It absolutely would not absorb, either! I considered that my combination skin might be too oily for the product, but I tried some on my much-drier legs, and it acted just the same. Yuck! If youâ€™re extra and just like the aesthetics of the jar on your vanity, I recommend scooping out the product and replacing it with something else you can actually use (such as my beloved, but tragically unglam body cream of choice, Eucerin Advanced Repair Lotion!)
