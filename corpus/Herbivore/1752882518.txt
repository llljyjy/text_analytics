As far as vitamin C serums go- I’ve tried better. It’s got an odd consistently and is slightly drying on the skin so be sure to layer with hyaluronic acid and a great moisturizer. Overall it’s fine. But for $64 you want more than fine, you want it to work and I can’t say I’ve seen any difference since implementing this into my routine. nan
