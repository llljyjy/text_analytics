Loved this product. It lasted a long time because you donâ€™t use much of it. I started with 3 mins and worked my way up. Gives an amazing healthy glow to skin. I recommend using a light skin oil after. I have light skin with rosacea so there was some redness after the first time using it. Redness was gone the next morning. nan
