Love this product! I live in a very cold & dry climate in the winter, and I have very sensitive skin. I love taking baths to stay warm, but I hate how it can leave my skin so dry & itchy. THIS PRODUCT, however, leaves my skin soft & comfortable after every bath. It’s hard to explain but I feel like it leaves a silky feeling in the water, and you don’t need much. It has a very very subtle fragrance, but I find it calming and soothing. I don’t take baths for bubbles/fragrance, I take them to relax & be cozy, and this is the perfect product for that! Gentle & moisturizing for dry & sensitive skin
