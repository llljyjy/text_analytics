first of all let’s talk about the struggled with vitamin c in the past , they are far too sticky, they often irritate my skin or simply just don’t work , but let me tell you after using  this serum I saw my skin deeply hydrated and prepared for the day. I really love it , I have been using this product for a few days now and I have never seen the results in a very short time before , until today with this wonderful product , I really like how it absorbs very nicely and the texture feels very smooth and looks very luminous , It does smell like ginger-turmeric to me but fades quickly. I use this every morning and night time. Gifted by Herbivore Byeeee Dark spots !
