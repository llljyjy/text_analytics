I love the glass bottle with pump top and the gorgeous lavender color of the product! Moon Fruit has a barely detectable, natural and slightly fruity scent. The consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too thin, and the serum absorbs completely into the skin after a short wait. The serum is very gentle and I have also not experienced any irritation or dryness like I do with some other products containing retinol. nan
