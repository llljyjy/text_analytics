Though the price is steep…I have to say it’s worth every penny! I have been someone who struggles with scars, acne and anything you can think of since I was 12.  I started using this as a trial back in December just before Christmas, within two weeks my acne was gone! The scarring has subsided. The marks have slowly began to fade. Even leading up to my period and while on it, it’s kept my face and breakouts clear! I’ve had one of two show up from stress but using this product, they’re gone within a few days after. This product has allowed me to feel so comfortable in my own skin again for the first time in a very long time. This product is magic and I can’t speak anything I’ll about it. If you’re like me, it’ll help I can promise that! Magic & Gold
