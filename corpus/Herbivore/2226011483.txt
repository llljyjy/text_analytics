My first impression was that it’s light but still very hydrating on the skin. I like the scent and think it’s very refreshing and bright. I haven’t noticed a gigantic difference but it does definitely make the area I apply the product more plump and hydrated. Bakuchiol is a more gentle form of retinol so this formula doesn’t make my skin overreact or freak out. I’m excited to continue using it to see the longer term effects!
