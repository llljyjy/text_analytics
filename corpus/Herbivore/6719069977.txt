I bought the sample size with my points. Strong smell of tumeric (witch I dont care and doesn’t last). Non irritating for my sensitive skin. As vitamin c doesn’t show result fast I can’t speak for that..because it’s braking me out!! And I am not prône to that!! I know it’s that because I only use one New product at the time since my skin is sensitive.. breaks me out!
