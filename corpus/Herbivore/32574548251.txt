This product is vegan and cruelty-free. I’ve been using this serum for a couple of weeks now, and I have mixed feelings about it. It’s lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. Also, it’s gentle on my skin, and I haven’t experienced any irritation so far. However, I don’t like that it contains alcohol. Also, I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin yet. I’ll continue to use this product and I hope to see improvements of my fine lines soon.
