I got this as a sample on a promo that was running and I’ve been pleasantly surprised! I’ve been using this morning and night for a week and have noticed a different in my skins texture and tone. I didn’t have many wrinkles to begin with, but I have larger pores on my cheeks and nose, and redness, both of which have improved. My skin looks smoother, dewy, and less redness. Very surprised, very pleased! Will be buying a full size once I run out of this one. pleasantly surprised!
