Not sure why others seem to be getting ones from a bad batch or old product maybe, but to me it smells like fresh jasmine just like the actual jasmine vines I was smelling the other day at the nursery. Light and clean feeling, doesnâ€™t feel drying. Only been using it for a few days but so far my skin is liking it. Like blooming jasmine vines
