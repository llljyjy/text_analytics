I love love love the pink cloud cleanser so when I got a sample I was excited to try it. It was very disappointing. It is so heavily scented it was overwhelming opening it. It is very thick, which if that is your preference then it would be great for you! I prefer a lighter moisturizer. It is moisturizing but could be more. I also find it sits on your skin and doesnâ€™t really sink in, and pills later in the day. There are much much much better moisturizers for the same price or cheaper Avoid
