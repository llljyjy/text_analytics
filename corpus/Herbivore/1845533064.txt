I love Herbivore products and they work nicely on the skin! I have been using this for a bit on and off, especially in the winter. It doesn’t have much of a scent I can smell. A little goes a long way but I have found this does pill when layering skincare. I do not layer much but every time I’ve used it, it pills. Not a big deal for some, but just putting it out there if that’s a deal breaker for you. Gentle but effective and works well! Great but pills
