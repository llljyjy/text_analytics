I’ve been using Nova for a few days now. I like that is has a thick creamy consistency, but I wouldn’t recommend it as a straight up replacement for vitamin C serum. You can smell a subtle hint of turmeric, some days I enjoy that but others days it’s a bit strong. I don’t think the smell lingers on your skin though. I’m going to continue using the product for a few more weeks to see how well it evens out my skin tone. nan
