Amazing moisturizer! I got a deluxe sample and could see the difference after a few uses. It’s thicker than most day time moisturizers but soaks right into my skin and makes me look and feel hydrated - not glossy or oily, just really healthy. I’ve been through so many moisturizers in my hunt for the one and this is it! I have sensitive hormonal acne prone skin. love it!
