wanted to love it so much since I don’t find anything that doesn’t break me out ... weather it’s products containing oil or silicone or anything that could clog my pores. At first it mattifies and aroung 12 my t zone is oilier than before. The real problem is all the little bumps on my face that appeared after a few weeks of using it ... my face was all bumpy and clogged ... it took a lot of time to bring it back ! clogging
