I was so excited to see this back on the shelf after they recalled it for various issues. But the reformulated version is no good. It is still hydrating but feels much heavier, it smells horrible now and overall is nothing like the amazing moisturizer it once was. Ugh. Donâ€™t waste your money on this. Not as good as the original formula
