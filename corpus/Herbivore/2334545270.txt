My dermatologist recommended I start using a vitamin C serum in my morning skincare routine now that I use prescription retinol at night. Iâ€™ve tried a couple different kinds over the last 8 months and Nova is by far my favorite. I am very happy with the brightening results and it absorbs great. Two pumps per application is enough. I personally like the turmeric smell but I can understand why someone may not like it. My only gripe with this product is that there should be more for the price. $64 for 1oz is really disappointing. Love it! But not enough for the price
