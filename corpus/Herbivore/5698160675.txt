i bought this product after a long search looking for a hydrating serum. i have very sensitive, acne prone skin and was struggling with dry/flaky patches around my mouth and nose. no matter what i used, i couldn’t get my dryness under control until i used this serum each morning & night between cleansing and moisturizing. after a few months of using this product, my skin is super hydrated and supple looking. it also doesn’t break me out, instead it actually soothes irritated skin. i’ve been getting compliments on how glowy my skin is & i always recommend this product. if you’re going for the “glass skin” look, this serum will definitely deliver!! holy grail for sensitive, acne-prone skin
