Love this product! It calms my skin and lessens the redness. My skin is sensitive and is easily irritated by many products. I had Accutane treatment about 12 years ago for my cystic acne. After years of no issues, the acne started coming back - not nearly as bad but still bothersome. I spent a year testing a variety of products and found that Herbivore worked best for my skin. I use the Emerald Oil after washing my face with the Herbivore Charcoal Bar every day and it keeps my skin clear and without irritation. I love that the Emerald Oil provides moisture without feeling greasy. I highly recommend! Permanently a part of my routine
