I don’t have much (if any) hyperpigmentation so I can’t comment on the effectiveness of that specifically. I do find that it gives me some subtle brightening. I enjoy the texture as well, I find it sinks into my skin without being greasy (I was surprised at the other reviews saying they found it greasy since I didn’t experience that at all). Lots of people have commented on the smell… I actually love it but can see how it’s not for everyone. It definitely smells like turmeric and (to me) wood? Like tinder or something. I really like it but if you’re expecting something like most other skincare products (floral, fruity, sweet, spicy)… it’s definitely not that. Quite a savoury scent. I don’t really notice that the smell lingers very long though.Bottom line: I like it and find it works nicely for me but, it’s expensive for ‘nice’ and, if you’re looking for drastic results I’d look elsewhere. Good but not life changing
