Oh my goodness!! Just discovered this and started using it in addition to Clinique’s blackhead solution cleanser, Herbivore vitamin C + turmeric brightening serum, and (currently) Clinique moisture surge moisturizer, and my skin has NEVER looked better than it does now! A bit on the pricey side, but I only mix 2-3 drops into my moisturizer so it lasts longer and isn’t too oily feeling. SO worth it! (And the scent is a bonus!) I love it!
