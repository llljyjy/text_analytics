Amazing. I’d just finished my first bottle of the Backuchiol serum and really liked the results.. I was a little worried this would be too harsh but it’s not. I’m naturally a skeptic, but somehow Herbivore really does achieve their claims with this being highly effective yet non-irritating. I am acne-prone and this did not break me out at all, which of course is always a plus. My skin feels smoother, looks more even, and maybe even a little more plump. Will continue to buy. Lives up to the claims
