Let’s just say that I hate vitamin c serums- they break me out and cause little red dots all over my cheeks and in turn I give up using them long enough to see any brightening results.  This serum is DIFFERENT because its PURE 15% THD- not a ’blend’ of vitamin c derivatives or worse l’ascorbic acid which burns my face.  This one is super gentle, doesn’t sting and has an amazing creamy texture that absorbs quickly.  Best part is I literally saw acne scars from my teenage years start to fade after about a week!  I am forever hooked on this product and am shocked that all this comes at $64!  It does smell like ginger/turmeric but fades quickly! PURE THD vitamin C is just BETTER
