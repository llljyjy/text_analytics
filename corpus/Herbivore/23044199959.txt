I tried a sample of it that was good for 2 applications.I’ve heard a lot of comments about horrible smell but it was not there; my sealed product smelled herbal minty, perhaps rather strong but it’s not bad.It’s gentle and did not dry my skin - yay - but at the same time it did not have an effect of a stronger peel (think Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum ) that really leaves your skin refreshed and pores smaller.it’s a nice to have for me - I’ll be happy if I got it as a gift but I might not go out of my way to purchase it. Refreshing and shrinks pores
