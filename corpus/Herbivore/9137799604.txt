Love this! Bought it on a whim after eyeing it for a while. I actually have dry skin, especially in the winter, but suffer with milia and dark spots that made me interested in this oil. The first thing I noticed was the smell - the only way I can describe it is that it smells rich. It smells like luxury. Like, “Oh, she’s got MONEY money,“ rich. Putting this oil on, I felt like I was a millionaire influencer doing my nighttime skincare routine for Harper’s Bazaar. It’s faaaancy, y’all. I love the feel and finish of this oil, too. It’s less thick/viscous than I expected it to be, but it doesn’t skimp on hydration, so you feel deeply moisturized and plump upon applying it. It sinks into the skin quickly, but does leave that faint layer of surface moisture, so it’s probably best for a pre-bed routine rather than before makeup. That’s my preference, so it’s perfect for me, but YMMV! I noticed an almost immediate reduction in the look of my pores and my surface redness. This feels like a true self care moment in the sense that it is luxurious and feels a little indulgent, but it also does what it promises. Can’t wait to upgrade to the bigger size! Want to feel like $1M? This is your face oil.
