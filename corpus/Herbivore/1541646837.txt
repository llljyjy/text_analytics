I love this eye cream! This has replaced my holy grail biossance eye cream. The texture is light which I appreciate because it makes the cream easy to spread so no skin tugging but the effect in the short and long term is strong. My under eyes and wrinkles were brighter and softer and within a week I saw a lot more bounce to the skin around my eyes and my wrinkles significantly less noticeable. Highly recommend! nan
