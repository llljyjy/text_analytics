I was looking for a serum which is not l-ascorbic acid (it breaks me out in clusters of closed comedones) to brighten my dark spots. Well, after trying a lot I decided to buy this without a hope it would help. Boy I was wrong! I used it every morning for 2 weeks and literally some of my dark spots vanished into oblivion. I donâ€™t know how, the the Vit C derivative here works amazingly!!! P.s.: I purchased it with my own money :) Really works!!!
