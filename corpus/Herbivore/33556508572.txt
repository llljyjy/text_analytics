I received this complimentary from Herbivore in exchange for my honest review. As I have gotten older eye creams have become a daily necessity for me but i have just started. The texture is unique and hard to explain. It kind of feels like a firm gel which at first makes it a little hard to pick up or scoop out the product. Once you have gotten some out though next times we’re easier. It blends right into the skin and feels moisturizing. I wanted to make a 1st time pic of no products just a cleaned face and then with the eye cream ten minutes later. I have small sunken and puffy eyes so i have a bit of wrinkles starting to form. After my 1st use I did see a bit of a plumping effect and moisturize but nothing too crazy. Mind you it was just my first time and I feel like the smaller lines had an effect but not the bigger ones. If you are looking for instant results I don’t think you’ll see it but I have good hopes for long term use. nan
