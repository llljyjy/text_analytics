The mask wearing has brought back my jaw acne ( so sad). I tried everything and nothing was helping my skin. I went into Sephora and a sales lady told me about this and oh my god…my acne is gone. I love this cream. It legit saved my face. I still get little breakouts here than there but it’s because of the mask. I’m sure I would have clear skin if I didn’t keep wearing a damn mask. I’m extremely happy with this I also got the oil. So good. Save my jaws mask-acne.
