I love the option of a retinol alternative serum. The scent is nice light and airy. The texture is smooth and goes on light and absorbs fast. Iâ€™ve only been using this for a few day , but I can already feel and see a slight difference. I would honestly recommend trying this product if you are looking for a retinol alternative.
