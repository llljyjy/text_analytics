I have received NEW LAUNCH Retinol Alternative Serum Mar from Herbivore Botanicals. Personally, test use by myself and family members Would like to give my zeal and honest opinions of this product, leave my authentic thoughts and feelings about the product we have tried and this is exchange the product. I received it as a gift, complimentary from Herbivore Botanicals. This is a nice Moon Fruit Serum. Notice lightening of the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I put about a dime-sized amount on my face and it gets instantly absorbed. Amazing serum with zero irritation and without negative results.  I like the ingredient with the five flavors of traditional Chinese medicine herbs. It promotes collagen production for firmer-looking skin. The serum makes my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized at the same time, itâ€™s very nice. I love Moon Fruit Serum so far so good. Excellent product to try!
