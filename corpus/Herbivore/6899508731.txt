If I could marry a skincare product, this would be the one. My vows would read “I can’t believe I ever existed without you, and I’m so happy I never have to again.”But, really..I’ve had combo skin since puberty and nothing has ever helped. Anything that controlled oil and breakouts made my skin bone dry. Anything that moisturized made me break out. I had to use so many different products based on the state of my skin for that day. I got this as a sample from Sephora almost a year ago and decided to buy it, and since then I’ve been using it daily. My skin tone has evened out. I don’t remember my last break out. And I’m never too shiny. It’s truly been life changing. I feel so much more confident because of this product. nan
