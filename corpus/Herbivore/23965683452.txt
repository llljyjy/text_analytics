This works really really well! It really does instantly brighten your face. My issue is the packaging. The squirting was inconsistent, especially when the bottle was becoming less full but there was still product. (Which I had to waste and throw out) bc the hole is so narrow and you can’t get a good amount when it’s done ish. Ugh I’ll still rebuy it though for now but I’m hoping to find something that feels so nice and plump with a better bottle. good product poor bottle
