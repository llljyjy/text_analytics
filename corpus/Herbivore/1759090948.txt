I was really impressed with this when I first starting using it, but after a few weeks my face has started breaking out. Even though a lot of reviewers say it takes makeup off easily, I don’t find that to be true. At least not with one pump. It takes multiple pumps to remove all makeup, and it’s not a large bottle. The Kiehls calendula face wash is much better at removing makeup with no residue left behind. A little disappointing after the rave reviews. Not great, not terrible
