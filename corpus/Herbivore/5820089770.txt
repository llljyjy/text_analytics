The Herbivore Moon Dew eye cream has a really interesting consistency, it’s a little difficult to initially get out but once on your finger is glides on smoothly and efficiently. It has a very light feel when on and soaks quickly into skin.  I love retinol but I also love trying new products so I’m curious to see how this works on my skin over time and if it will take months to see results like many retinol products. I received this product complimentary from Herbivore in exchange for my honest review. Glides on eye area very smoothly
