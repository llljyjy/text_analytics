This is my favorite product to use when I’m breaking out. I put 3-4 drops on at night after cleansing and toning. When I wake up, my skin looks a lot calmer with much of the redness and puffiness gone. Since it’s an oil it treats and moisturizes at the same time. It’s expensive but lasts a long time. nan
