Tbh, I was super nervous trying this out because of the bakuchiol and retinol , I thought it wouldâ€™ve been too harsh for my sensitive skin. But WOW! This is by far my favorite serum that I find myself reaching for the most. Has a nice & smooth texture when applying. Woke up the next morning and my face felt great! Definitely recommend those who are on the fence with this one! nan
