I got a sample of this with my last Sephora purchase and had noticeably brighter skin overnight. Now that it’s been over a week of daily use, my skin has never looked better. Acne scars and hyperpigmentation I’ve been trying to get rid of for years are nearly a distant memory... Plus I have super sensitive skin and this product hasn’t made me break out in the least.So now I’m hooked, and I’m going to have to eat nothing but beans and rice for a month to be able to afford the full size. This must be what “beauty is pain“ really means. I'm so mad...
