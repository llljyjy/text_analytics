Even though this is recommended for dry/normal skin, it works perfectly for my combo/oily skin. I have struggled for years trying to find skincare that actually works FOR ME, and this does it every time. I feel hydrated and smooth, and my face is barely oily at the end of the day with this product. Additionally, their Pink Cloud Face Wash has also worked wonders for my skin, I HIGHLY suggest you try this product out, and others from this amazing brand. This is the love of my combo/oily life
