To be honest Iâ€™ve only used this product for 3 nights now. I previously used the herbivore bakuchiol however I would choose moon fruit over that. My face felt hydrated, no stinging or redness, skin felt smoother and more plump. I look forward to testing it out more as its been a very enjoyable addition to my skincare regimen. nan
