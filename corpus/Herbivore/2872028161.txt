Purchased this product maybe 3 months ago. It’s moldy and smells like literal dumpster juice. Went to go exchange it at TWO different stores. Their whole stock for both stores were moldy too. Don’t bother with this product. Wouldn’t let me exchange as it was outside the 60 days but THEIR stock was moldy in store so clearly this wasn’t a me problem. Terrible service . 1 star is well deserved YOUR PRODUCT HAS MOLD IN IT!!!
