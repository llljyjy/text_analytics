I’m new to bakuchiol and interested in this retinol alternative. When I got the chance to try this I was excited. So far I’m impressed! It’s rich and blends in beautifully. I’ve experienced no irritation, unlike other eye creams that contain retinol. I haven’t seen drastic changes yet but the immediate hydration is enough to keep me happy. As a bonus the fragrance is also very nice! nan
