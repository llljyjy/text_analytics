This product is the first to even out all of my redness and makes my skin look and feel balanced and moisturized. It does such a great job that my friend asked if I was wearing foundation because my skin was so even.I apply 4-6 drops at night after my aha serum. I can use more or less depending on how my skin feels and top it with a moisturizer to lock it in. In the winter Iâ€™ll add 2-3 drops to my moisturizer in the morning for an added boost of hydration and the skin calming effects. I have repurchased this 4 times now and will continue to do so.
