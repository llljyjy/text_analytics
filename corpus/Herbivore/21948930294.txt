I chose this product because I needed a moisturizer and the packaging is super cute. But after using it for a few weeks I noticed my breakouts are worse than usual and by reading the other reviews I feel like it may be this product. It is thick enough to keep my face hydrated during the winter months, but it has a greasy and warm feeling formula and doesnt feel the best on my skin. Skip this product unless your face is really really dry. Avoid if you have acne prone skin
