Personally, this didn’t work for me. I don’t find it matifying at all and it actually made my pores more visible. Thankfully, it hasn’t made me break out. Since, I’ve had no break outs while using and I’m way past the point to return this product, I will continue to use it strictly as a nighttime moisturizer until I run out. It’s really thick and a little goes a long way. It has an interesting waxy texture by itself and on the skin. nan
