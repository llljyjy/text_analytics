I got a trial size of the sample with my insider points and LOVED it! I noticed brightening in my skin within a week. I was using every day in the AM and I have sensitive skin but had no issues. It did not pill, and I don’t know people think it smells bad, I thought it smells really nice and fresh. I would have loved to purchase a full size after I finished the trial but as a student on a budget it’s out of price range! Nearly $100 after taxes, is quite ridiculous and is the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. I know skin care has one of the biggest production cost to sale inflations, so I’m sure it doesn’t need to sell for this much. However, if you have the budget, you won’t regret it! Effective, but too expensive
