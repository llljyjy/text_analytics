Firstly I love the packaging and color of this product. The cream itself is super hydrating and rich while also blends very easily. I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a reduction in crows feet around my eye. All around the area is firm and glowing. Will definitely purchase again! An eye cream that works!
