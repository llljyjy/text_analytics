I’ve been using this product for over a week and love how hydrating it is. It makes my skin glow and works great with my sensitive skin. It also smells amazing - the only way I can describe it is that it’s sort of reminiscent of a summer forest. So nice! I’ll definitely continue using this as a part of my skincare routine. nan
