I loved this serum, it absorbs easily into skin with no sticky residue as compared to many vitamin C serums. However the container is terrible, I had 3 weeks of product left in the jar that the pump can’t remove, and the neck is so small you can get your finger in to scoop it out either. I ended up using tweezers to scrape it out for 3 weeks, then it occurred to me that oxygen would be filing the space in the bottle so this definitely needs better packaging. Especially for the price, that’s $20 of product left when the pump stops dispensing the product because it doesn’t reach. I won’t be buying again due to that. Great product, terrible packaging
