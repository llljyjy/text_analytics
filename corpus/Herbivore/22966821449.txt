I originally purchased this product in winter, when my skin is drier and sucks in moisture like a sponge. I used it for two weeks and didn’t really notice a difference so I stopped using it for several months. Last month I ran out of a different hydrating serum and decided to use up the Cloud Jelly before I spent more money - turns out I LOVE IT in the summer! My skin has different hydration needs in the warmer months so this is a really great solution during that timeframe. I also use Nova in the morning and Moon Fruit at night, and I don’t have any layering issues so I think Cloud Jelly is here to stay in my summer routine. better in summer than winter for dry skin
