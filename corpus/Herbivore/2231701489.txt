I was kindly gifted herbivore’s moon fruit 1% bakuchiol + peptides retinol alternative serum mean exchange rate honest product review. I love peptide in my skin care and I’m currently pregnant so retinal alternatives are my current go to. This serum claims to diminish the look of fine lines in your face using this ingredient, bakuchiol oil that is sourced from an herb. This is my first experience with this ingredient but I am so far so very pleased. The serum comes in simple purple glass packaging in a pump dispenser. I appreciate that the serum is safe enough to use both day and night. I look forward to seeing results with further use. Retinol alternative
