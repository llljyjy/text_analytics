I was skeptical about trying an oil on my face but Herbivore’s Emerald Green has hit a home run! I took a sample with me on a recent trip to Florida. I’m not sure what caused the skin around my eyes including the 11’s on my forehead to become so flaky dry and red. I tried the Emerald Deep Moisture Glow Oil not only on those tender areas around my eyes but on my entire face. Day and night till it was gone. Results were so impressive!!  I could not wait to get the full size bottle. Your moisturizer and foundation just glide on over the facial oil. You will not be disappointed. nan
