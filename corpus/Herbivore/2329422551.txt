This oil has saved my T ZONE. I tried many things. Most of oil control is targeting acne too and I didn’t have that problem. Just sebum over production. THIS HELPED SO MUCH. Shout out to the Sephora rep who taught me that this oil should be applied on damp skin and rubbed into hands and pressed into the skin. Game changer. I give it a 4 bc of the price and that I don’t think it truly helps with acne. A real review!
