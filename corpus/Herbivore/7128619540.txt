It’s was okay. It didn’t lighten up any dark spots for me as quickly as it did for majority consensus. It didn’t break me out or irritate my skin so I gave it 2 stars for that. I like the smell. Another star. But didn’t see any difference and for the price and what it is I wasn’t impressed. I did return bc I have a VIT C serum that I really like and I’ve been using(YYTP caffeine vit c serum) . Just was hoping to have something help w my stubborn dark spots. This would be good for someone new to skincare just starting to use vitamin c. it’s ok for me….
