Literally a miracle product. I have had a long battle with acne and was having a horrible breakout on my chin and finally bit the bullet and bought this for its good reviews. CRAZY the difference I had after one single use. My jaw actually dropped when I looked in the mirror the morning after. My acne was calmed and less red, and the actual pimples were smaller. The whole texture of my face was smoother (I have some annoying bumps on my forehead--they were gone). AFTER ONE USE. The scent is wonderfully herby/earthy and the feel of it is very cooling and soothing thanks to the menthol. I just stick my finger to the bottom of the jar, and pull straight out, and that’s plenty of product for my face. Absolutely follow the recommendations: use for 4-5 days straight, then 2-3 times a week to maintain. Nothing has made my skin look or feel better. The hormonal breakout I had was pretty much gone in 1.5 weeks when it would’ve probably taken a month otherwise. HIGHLY recommend for the acne-fighting girlies. thee best thing to happen to my face
