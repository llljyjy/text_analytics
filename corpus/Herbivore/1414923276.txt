Huge herbivore fan, so excited they finally came out with a vitamin c cream. I’ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I love the consistency and how easy and smooth it applies. Gives my skin a nice glow. I’ve never heard of THD but it works great compared to my l-absorbic acid vitamin c. I love how they explain their ingredients so it’s easy to trust them. I found it works best during the day with a SPF. Brightens skin
