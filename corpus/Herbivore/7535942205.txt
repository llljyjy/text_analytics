This is a very creamy moisturizer but the effect doesn’t last. When I wake up in the morning my cheeks are dry (I have dry/dehydrated skin). It smells horrendous, like alcohol and mold and I can’t tolerate something that smellsSo strong on my face. I’m glad I used a sample And didn’t actually spend money on this moisturizer. decent moisturizer
