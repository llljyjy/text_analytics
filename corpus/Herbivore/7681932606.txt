This vitamin C serum was gifted to me. I am always looking for a great vitamin C serum this product glides smoothly to the skin. One thing I noticed is that my moisturizer stays on longer even after my 12 hr shifts at work. The only thing I don’t like about this product is the scent. It is quite strong although I don’t smell it once applied to the skin nan
