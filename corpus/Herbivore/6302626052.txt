I have sensitive & dry/acne prone skin. This is an amazing cleanser. It lasts me for at least 3-4 months & keeps my skin from not drying out. The cleanser does not break me out or makes my redness on my cheeks worse. My skin does need more hydration so I pair this with their cloud jelly serum. FYI: Iâ€™m on my third bottle :) Works on Sensitive + Dry/Acne prone skin
