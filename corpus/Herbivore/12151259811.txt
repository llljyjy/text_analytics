I wish I had before & after pictures! I love this product and use it almost every night. I used retinol 2x/week for a few months before I stopped & decided to try this mask. I used it every night for a month and a fine line I have above my lip from side sleeping COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. The retinol had done nothing to make it go away.  I also love that it doesnâ€™t have the side effects retinol comes with which is important because I have somewhat sensitive skin. FINE LINE FROM SIDE SLEEPING GONE!
