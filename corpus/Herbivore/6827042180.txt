I have oily but fairly sensitive skin, and this stings the second I apply it to my skin. I’ve been breaking out more often since starting this product and I have a feeling it is from the irritation. Side note, the smell reminds me of a strong plastic and isn’t the most pleasing. not for sensitive skin
