Best mask I have ever used! I have acne prone skin with an oily T zone and this mask every week or two helps kill any new pimples from fully forming or encourages the ones that are too far along to come to fruition and die.  Either way it helps keep my skin clearer!  It helps make my skin bright, smooth, clear, clean and refreshed.  I go through 2 jars a year so every time it’s on sale I get one. Ot does have a slight smell for the first 2-3 minutes but goes away and I like the fact that there are darker bits and that no two jars are exactly the same.  It’s natural and unique and works! Perfect for acne prone skin!
