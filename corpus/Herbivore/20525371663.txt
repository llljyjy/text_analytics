Good product but do not use it in replacement of a moisturizer. I use the blue tansy face mask as well with this and it has helped my skin alot, i swear by the mask just as much as the oil, definitely helps with breakouts and redness however I dont think it should be 72 dollars but I still splurged. I have very oily skin, active acne and scarring for reference. nan
