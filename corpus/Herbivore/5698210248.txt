I have only used this for a few weeks and so far don’t have any issues with it.  Even if this product works though, it’s sooo over-priced for the amount they give you.  When I first bought this I thought it was a mistake that it was only 3/4 full of product, so I asked for another one to be shipped.  When they shipped the 2nd one, it was the same thing! Only 3/4 of the bottle is filled, the rest is a huge air pocket.  I can probably get the same results from a product elsewhere for a much better value unfortunately. Nice moisturizer, not filled all the way though
