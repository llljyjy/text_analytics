i got this as a free sample, and it seems okay. the texture when putting it on felt almost greasy, but it dried fine and didn’t irritate my skin which is usually pretty sensitive. it has a slight matte finish which is nice if you have oily skin. still, i don’t think it’s not worth spending $44 on. works fine, but wouldn’t spend that much
