*received as a single use sample in a recent purchaseI was very hesitant about trying out this product due to mixed reviews. When I opened the small packet the color was a greenish blue color which is normal. The smell was kinda funny and I personally didn’t like it. I only left the mask on for 10 minutes, I did experience a slight tingle. After washing off the mask I didn’t notice any difference and wasn’t amazed. I don’t think I will be purchasing the full size. nan
