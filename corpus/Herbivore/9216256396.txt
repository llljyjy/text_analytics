I was very skeptical about using oil on my face since I have acne prone, combo/oily skin but no regrets here. I use a couple of drops in the AM and PM and have used it for a week now and can see a difference in my skin, it looks more hydrated and all the redness is drastically reduced. I canâ€™t wait to continue using it and see long-term results. Great product!
