Herbivore just launched this new Vitamin C serum and it was given complimentary to me but I would definitely have paid serious money for it. It works folks! I have been using this nightly for about 10 days and I noticed that it helped to lessen my hyperpigmentation and dullness especially around my forehead. It also seemed to reduce some of the dark spots on my cheeks. and to gently reduce the appearance of dark spots on the skin. It had a clean fresh scent and felt really smooth going on my face without a greasy or heavy feel to it Add some sunshine to your face:)
