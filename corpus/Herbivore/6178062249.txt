I’ve used this oil on my sensitive , oily combination skin. I have a lot of redness in the cheek area. I apply this as a last step in my night time skin routine and I will never go back to not using it . VERY light weight , absorbs BEAUTIFUL INTO THE SKIN. And when I wake up my akin feels so nice and smooth and hydrated. I’m ACNE PRONE. And this never broke me out . I have dry areas around the moth , between the brows and the high points of my cheeks and this helped with the dry patches . HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! If your looking for a good oil PLEASE TRY THIS ONE ! sensitive, oily combination, redness, acne prone .
