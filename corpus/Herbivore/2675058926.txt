I was so excited to try this because I’ve been curious about bakuchiol as an alternative to retinol! I love that it’s gentle enough to use twice a day everyday, compared to retinol products I stick to every other evenings. I have dry skin so I always want products that are rich and creamy, so I’m loving this eye cream so far! It’s very hydrating and my eyes look more awake. Can’t wait to keep using it to see the progress!Bonus: I love all the pastel-colored creams that Herbivore is coming out with - it makes me happy to use it each time <3 nan
