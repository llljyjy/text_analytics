I received this Retinol Alternative Serum from Herbivore Botanicals complimentary for my honest opinion. I’m absolutely obsessed with this Herbivore Botanicals facial serum. First, I want to mention the packaging, it’s amazing!! I love the purple color, and that it’s a pump. I can control how much I want dispensed. When dispensing this comes out in a purple color, but dries down clear. I have very dry skin and this hydrates my skin so well! It leaves my skin hydrated and dewy all day! I have been using this for about a week now, and haven’t had any issues with it irritating my skin or breakouts. If you’re looking for a good face serum, I highly recommend this one! It’s terrific for dry skin, and has become a staple in my skin care routine. Excellent serum!!
