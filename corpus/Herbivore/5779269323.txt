Have been using this product for about two weeks and absolutely love it. It does smell like turmeric so if you’re not a fan, I would stay away. I will say though I don’t think the smell lingers. The product has really helped me with keeping my skin hydrated as well as giving it a nice healthy glow and juSt smoothing out my skin. The vitamin C is a cream based which I really love. Great vitamin C!
