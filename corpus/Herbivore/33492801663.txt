When I first saw this product ingredients, I was Wow! This has such great ingredients to brighten skin/dark spots. 15% ultra-stable vitamin C, turmeric….anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, Arbutin….natural skin lighting agent. I was so excited to use this product.     It makes my skin smooth and moisturized and no irritation at all. After applying the serum on my skin, I felt cooling sensation. I think it’s because of turmeric. The serum scent is literally turmeric which is not my favorite. But I’m sure it’s a good ingredient to brighten skin along with vitamin C and other ingredients. I was little skeptical about other’s review saying dark spots are gone etc. I haven’t used much of this yet to see my dark spots disappear. However I could see a difference in appearance of my skin in the first few days surprisingly. So I believe that using this product for long time will show more better results. nan
