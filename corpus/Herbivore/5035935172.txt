I have pretty dry skin and the first time I tried this mask I didn’t really feel any tingling/burning, so I left it on for about 15 minutes and when I washed it off, my skin felt a lot smoother. I made sure to layer on a bunch of moisturizers and overall I was pretty happy with it.For some reason the times I tried to use this product after that, I’ve felt a lot of tingling almost as soon as I apply it to my face. For that reason, I only leave it on for 8-10 minutes as I am worried it might be too harsh for me. I think if you happen to have dry skin it would be a great idea to try a sample of this mask first (a few times) before buying the full sized product just to test whether this mask also tingles or burns on your skin. These days I only use this mask once every 3 weeks ish when I remember to and when my skin is in a relatively good state. I think my skin is just to sensitive for the high percentages of AHA in this mask so I probably will not be repurchasing Works for sure but be careful
