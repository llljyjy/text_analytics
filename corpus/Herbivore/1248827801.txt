Been using for a few months now and I love! I have combination / oily t-zone skin and this helped a lot. I only apply during my nighttime routine around my nose and chin areas that are acne prone. It left a tingly feeling, but went away after 1 weeks use. I would not recommend if you have dry skin nan
