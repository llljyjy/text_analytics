This mask is AMAZING! I have aging, sensitive, combination skin and this stuff works incredibly well for me. I notice an immediate improvement with the way my skin looks after use. I have mild melasma on my jawline and this is one of the only products I’ve found to temporarily lighten it. My face literally glows after use! I’m hooked will continue to repurchase. Also, the amount you receive for the money is totally worth it. Incredible Product
