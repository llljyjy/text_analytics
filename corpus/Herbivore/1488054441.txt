This serum has a slightly creamy consistency that sinks into the skin, giving it an instantly smoother and more plump appearance. It feels very lightweight, nourishing, and layers well under my moisturizer. Be aware this has a natural, but strong turmeric scent, which I personally donâ€™t like. Other than that, I love a good Vitamin C Serum during the daytime and this one checks all the boxes.Gifted by Herbivore, but opinions are my own. Love a good Vitamin C Serum!
