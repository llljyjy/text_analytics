The Moon Dew 1% Bakuchiol + Peptides Retinol Alternative Eye Cream is my introduction to Herbivore and I am absolutely floored. I have tried a few different eye cream and 1-2 retinol products and never really seen a noticeable difference till using this. I’ve actually experienced some poor reactions to harsh retinols so this is my holy grail! The claims of tightening skin and reducing fine lines in 10 minutes is totally accurate.  This product is magic in a jar. I’ve been struggling with make up and concealer settling in my fine lines and wrinkles and in ten minutes that problem was resolved. I was so unsure about this product being new to the brand and it being purple and having a unique texture but I am now a believer. I have been using this religiously every day and night. It layers wonderfully under make up and keeps make up from creasing. This is now a staple in my routine and it’ll be almost impossible to replace it. I’m going to actively try more herbivore products and look for products with bakuchoil. Wow just wow! Buy this!! You won’t regret it! I received this product complimentary for my honest review Magic in a jar! 100% buy it now!
