i have only used this once so grain of salt, but my initial reactions were very strong. i have combo skin that’s been tight, itchy and extra uncomfortable for a while. it’s both agonizingly oily and peeling dry. i’m running low on my last moisturizer purchase, so i snagged this one on sale. i both love and dislike it a little even after only one use. it’s surprisingly thick. it really soothed my skin and has kept it feeling much more comfortable. the scent is so light that i didn’t have issues (i am so sensitive to fragrance in cosmetics). however, i felt like an oil tankard leaked on my face very quickly after using. i was so shiny i looked wet half an hour later. i’m going to keep using it because it feels great, but i disagree with the reviews that say it’s mattifying. nan
