originally got this item as a sample and I loved it so I bought a jar. This item definitely had a shelf life that needs to be listed in the box. the tub I got was black and separated, didnâ€™t smell anything like the sample I got. the product is awesome but this product needs a listed expiration date. if I could order it and get it not expired, I would but the price is not worth the risk to get a dud product expired
