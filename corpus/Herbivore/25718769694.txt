I’ve been using Herbivore Retinol Alternative Serum and it’s amazing! I received it complimentary in exchange for my honest feedback. It’s a naturally derived retinol-alternative serum to help smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while providing lots of hydration. My concerns are fine lines and dryness and I’ve noticed a difference after using it. The light purple color is derived from a blend of natural botanicals and I love knowing I’m putting clean ingredients on my face. My skin feels silky soft and I can’t wait to keep using it. A must-have skin serum!
