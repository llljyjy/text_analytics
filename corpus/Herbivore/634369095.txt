This serum is perfect for my combination skin that has dark spots.  I have had this happen due to times in my life when I haven’t been as careful to wear daily sunscreen.  The consistency is like a thick gel.  It tingles some when first applied.  I do notice some stickiness but that goes away after applying my regular moisturizer.  I find the scent to be slightly unappealing.  I’d rather it have either no scent or a fresher fragrance.  The serum is very effective at helping my skin look healthier and feel energized. I love that this brand is leaping bunny certified cruelty free.  I’m impressed with the serum providing such quick results. nan
