I believe this product does exactly what it claims and that is to reduce redness. I had some mild rosacea and redness on my cheeks and chin. I’ve always had this, I’ve rarely had any products work well for me and I’ve tried them all. Im always on the hunt for one. This one reduced my redness by about 70% I’d say which is quite impressive. Maybe more but I’m trying not to over exaggerate. It’s also reduced the red bumps I used to have. I use it morning and night under my moisturizer which I think is key so it’s touching your bare skin. So I use it as a serum almost. I’m comfortable enough to not wear tinted moisturizer or sunscreen. My face looks even, I love it! Hopefully it keeps its efficacy. I’m interested to try more from the brand now. I’ve used this for about a week and a half now. Reduces redness - as advertised
