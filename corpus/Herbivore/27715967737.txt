Gifted by Herbivore in exchange for my honest review. This creamy brightening serum contains 15% THD Vitamin C, turmeric and arbutin formulated to help visibly improve skin tone and texture. It feels incredibly lightweight and has a subtle turmeric fragrance which dissipates quickly after application. It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels moisturizing and nourishing without feeling heavy or greasy on the skin. I use vitamin C serums on the regular and let me just say that this one seems to be a cut above the rest based on only the short time I’ve been using it so far.  The packaging is sleek and modern and definitely something that looks and feels luxurious. I’m loving the healthy glow it’s giving me and I’m incredibly excited to see what kind of results I might see from long-term usage of this must have brightening serum.
