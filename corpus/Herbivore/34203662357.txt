This is really not worth the price. It has a pretty horrible smell, which you could get use to if you really wanted to and were seeing the results you were hoping for, but personally this product really irritated my skin and after using for about a week my skin was so dry and irritated I ended up returning it. And it also pilled when used with my other products. Not Worth It
