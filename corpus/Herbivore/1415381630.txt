This serum has helped improve the texture and appearance of my skin.  My skin looks smoother and my fine lines seem to have improved thanks to the bakuchiol oil. I like how it’s a retinol alternative, so it’s still effective yet it’s gentler on my skin and doesn’t cause any irritation for me.  This was gifted by Herbivore Botanicals. Great retinol alternative
