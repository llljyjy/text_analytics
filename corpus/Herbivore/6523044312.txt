I received this as a sample and wow, am I glad I didn’t buy the full size version. The smell.....I’ve never smelled anything like this. It’s liked medicine mixed with eucalyptus mixed with bubblegum or something. It’s very very nauseating. I did not see any results either, which I usually do after a BHA/AHA mask The smell!
