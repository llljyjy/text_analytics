I have a lot of discolouration on my face and neck due to past blemishes and hyperpigmentation. Along with having sensitive skin I have combo dehydrated skin, so I was looking for a Vitamin C that was both hydrating and potent. And this is definitely what I was looking for and more. I recommend this for anyone with a similar skin type, it’s a game changer! It’s a bit pricey but I’m serious about my skin so I’ll definitely be purchasing when I run out. nan
