I bought this on sale and Used it over the summer. It’s a light moisturizer that didn’t make my skin oily and worked well under makeup. I did notice my pores looked smaller and my redness was reduced. I don’t think it will be moisturizing enough for Canadian winters, but I plan to start using this again next summer. My one grip was that there really was not that much cream in the container, so it’s pretty expensive given the small amount of cream. This lasted me 2.5 months using sparingly once a day. Liked it - clear skin & reduced pores
