The alternate retinol serum gifted by herbivore botanicals came in our beautiful purple bottle with a no mess pump. The texture was soft and silky and it blended well on my skin. I love the idea of plant-based ingredients and the serum did not irritate my skin. The serum is vegan and cruelty free. My face felt moisturized as I have dry skin. I used it at night and followed up with the simple face cream. I like the packaging, the color of the bottle, and the whole feel of the product. Super cute bottle
