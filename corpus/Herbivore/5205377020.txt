This serum is really moisturizing and I can already see a brightness in my skin when only using it for the first 2 weeks. It is ultra comfortable on my dry 40 year old skin and gives my skin a gorgeous glow. It is lightweight and hydrating but I’m surprised I am beginning to see the effects so soon. It is gentle on my skin but really a great addition to my skincare routine. My skin appears brighter and more even. I’m digging it. Moisturizing and Brightening
