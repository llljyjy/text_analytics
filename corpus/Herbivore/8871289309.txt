This is my first eye cream i’ve ever tried since I’m just starting to get into skincare. First, let’s start with the texture, it is the perfect airy texture and isn’t too heavy on the skin which I really love. Second, the packaging. While some may not like that it’s not the traditional eye cream packaging I love jars! While I don’t have wrinkles on my skin, I do love the way it makes my skin look. Gifted By Herbivore nan
