Got a free sample of this, and I often try new moisturizers, so put this on tonight after cleansing, etc. My skin immediately began to burn, and I knew there was no use waiting to see if it improved. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this if you have sensitivity problems. Back to my regular products. Washed it off within two minutes of application
