I started with a small version of it and loved it. I know how to take care of it now, I donâ€™t have it in my bathroom since temp change can alter the Hemp and color, also put it on my hands. I get chemotherapy and it helps with some of the skin side effects. Love this product, worth every dollar! Wonders for the skin!
