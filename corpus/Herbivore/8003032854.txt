don’t waste your money on this. This serum is the exact opposite it claims to be. It dried my skin SO bad and pilled regardless of what other products I put on my face. Literally any other hydration/hylauronic acid serum will work for you if you’re looking to hydrate your face, ones that are like 75% cheaper than this too. Don’t let the cute packaging fool you this sucks Harrrdddd NO
