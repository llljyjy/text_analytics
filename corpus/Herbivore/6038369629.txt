I recently started using this Vitamin C serum after a looong break from Vitamin C because of a negative reaction to a different brand’s product. I decided to give this one a try after a friend recommended it and have had 0 issues! I’ve been using it for the last 3 weeks. My skin looks and feels brighter and I love the texture/color of it too :) Happy product, happy skin!
