OBSESSED! I have quite ruddy cheeks and adult acne (hormonal) & was skeptical to try this product notwithstanding the rave reviews, but I gave it a shot and I am so in love. My skin cleared right up and my redness has neutralized! This little jar is nothing short of magic. I was very worried about the scene, but I love it. It’s quite strong, but it’s very clean and eucalyptusy. All the stars! I definitely recommend this product. You only need a thin layer, so you will get a lot of bang for you buck despite the price tag. And with a product that works this well I’m happy to pay for quality. Treat yourself!
