This Retinol Alternative Serum is hydrating and did not cause my combination skin to break out. This did not stay tacky or left a weird residue on my skin. The packaging is glass and the product has a lovely lavender color. There is a smell to the product, almost herbal like. The amount that comes out of the pump is just perfect for my whole face and neck. I have not noticed a significant change after a week of use other than my face looking moisturized. I am happy with this product being a retinol alternative since I am not ready to dive into retinols yet. nan
