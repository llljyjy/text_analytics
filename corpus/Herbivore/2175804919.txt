I’m loving this eye cream! I’ve been using this day and night for a week and already see a reduction in fine lines. The skin under and around my eyes looks and feels more hydrated, also. The texture is great - it feels moisturizing without being too thick. Added bonus: it looks and feels great under makeup. I also love that I can use this day and night, and it smells great! New favorite eye cream!
