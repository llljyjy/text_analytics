Received complimentary from Herbivore for reviewing purposes only.Nova 15% Vitamin C + Turmeric Brightening Serum Iâ€™ve been using for a little over a week.  Other than it drying my skin out which an light exfoliating does the trick. I like this vitamin c serum alot. My skin is less red and my pores are smaller. I will continue to use. Alittle goes along way. I recommend Herbivore
