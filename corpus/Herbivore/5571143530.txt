Personally I love this - my skin has been glowing/healthy and a friend i hadn’t seen in 6 months asked for skincare advice - which I think the main difference was adding this serum. I also think the turmeric smell is great lol - it doesn’t even stick around long imo. Apparently turmeric’s been used traditionally as well for skincare. I did see the review that said there was green mold on the inside of the pump - I actually emailed Herbivore and asked them to confirm and they said that it’s a green ring in all pumps and it’s just part of it - FYI in case anyone else saw that, went to check their own and saw it, and then got worried. :)I think it could run out quite quickly - for the price it is, I’m trying to conserve it a bit so it goes longer. Other than that I’m about halfway through my first bottle and I plan on repurchasing nan
