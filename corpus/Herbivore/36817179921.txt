I’ve been using Moon Dew for about a week and am very happy with the smoothness I’m seeing on the side of my eyes. I was a little worried that the product wouldn’t sink in well, since it’s light and “bouncy” in the jar, but it quickly soaked in and it was great that I didn’t have to wait long to apply SPF afterwards. I still have some fine lines, but it seems that the depth has reduced. Excited to see how the next couple weeks go! So far, so good!
