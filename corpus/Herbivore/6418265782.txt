I received Nova Herbivore Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review. First off, love this Vitamin C Serum. I’ve recently had breakouts and I have newer blemishes from the breakouts healing. Well I started using this and within a week started to see significant change in the appearance of my blemishes. My skin looks brighter and more youthful. As a 38 year old female, my skin isn’t what it used to be so I appreciate that I found this serum so much! Bye bye blemishes!
