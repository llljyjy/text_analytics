The product itself is actually wonderful! I think it works well, the texture is more lotion like and not sticky. However the turmeric smell is incredibly strong and quite unpleasant for me. I received a mini of this product and wouldn’t buy the full size because of the scent. However if scent isn’t an issue for you then it really is a great product. Good product but dislike the smell
