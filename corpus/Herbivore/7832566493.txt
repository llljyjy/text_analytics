Oh my god. This is the worst smelling mask I’ve ever tried. I got this as a sample and I put this on my face and the smell was so horrible. I genuinely felt nauseated and thought I was going to throw up; I washed it off after a few minutes. It’s honestly an okay mask, I didn’t really notice a huge difference. However the smell is so bad that I literally could not recommend this mask because it’s just too overpowering. smells sooooo bad
