I received complimentary from Herbivore! I like there packing! It’s my favorite color purple! Purple color eye cream in a jar! So beautiful! It is like a balm cream texture at my first impressions! It has 1% Bakichiol can smooths fine line and wrinkls! Peptides help restore the look of firmness, fine lines and wrinkles. I started to use it in my night time routine, and then use it in the morning routine and night time routines! I can feel my eye area is more firmness, decrease puffiness! Tightening! Lifting! Moisturizing! I usually use some eye creams that will irritate the eyes to tears! But this eye cream won’t be like that at all! Won’t irritating eyes!  Very soft touching, firming, hydrating and smoothing! I believe that it will be better if I continue to use it for a long term! Great eye cream
