LOVE LOVE LOVE! I will be buying those full size! The cleanser is gentle yet you feel very clean and fresh. The smell is amazing too and quite subtle so it would suit the non-perfume lover! My skin is very sensitive and I never felt irritated by this product! The serum and the cream are just as good and both feels light and fresh on the skin while not having the weird feeling that you get with gel moisturizer nan
