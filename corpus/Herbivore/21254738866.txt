Bought my 4th bottle and was totally disappointed. Iâ€™m not sure if the ingredients changed or if I just got a bad one. The product had a much darker color, bad and different smell, and broke my whole face and under eyes out the next day. I completely stopped using it and it took a whole month for my skin to calm down, it was HORRIBLE. formula change/ bad bottle broke my skin out
