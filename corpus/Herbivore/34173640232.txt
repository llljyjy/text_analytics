This is serum has a gorgeous color and smells good. Felt nice on my skin. I haven’t seen noticeable differences in my skin quality after over a week of use, but my routine is pretty optimized, and in terms of strength this definitely didn’t cause any issues. Likely worth trying if you’re looking for something very mild and gentle. nan
