I’ve officially replaced my love for Lapis Oil It’s a lighter yet just as nourishing. Lapis is a bit better for before bed, especially if you’re like me and the smell soothes you (though I know some ppl hate the smell!)Phoenix has the tiniest orange tinge that gives the most gorgeous glow -  which makes it perfect for daytime / before makeup. I’ve had this bottle for over 6 months, using it frequently and it’s lasting longer than expected easily my favorite oil
