Gifted by Herbivore. This serum has a nice texture and feels good on my skin. The color is really fun and vibrant. However the smell is quite strong and I do find it lingers. The bottle is nice and I like the pump packaging however Iâ€™m a bit worried the glass is not dark enough to keep the serum from oxidizing. nan
