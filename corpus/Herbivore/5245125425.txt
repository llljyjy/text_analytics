This eye cream is sooo thick and rich. I really love to use it about every other day because it can be a bit heavy. Otherwise, the formula is gentle enough for every day. It feels so gentle and hydrating around the sensitive eye area. It feels like there’s a slight brightening effect upon application as well. I haven’t used it long enough to see results from the bakuchiol, but I know the peptides are great for well aging. I’m really excited to continue using this! nan
