I was gifted this product complimentary from the brand. I like the cute lavender packaging it comes in, also appreciate the pump. It has a thin creamy texture, has a light purple hue to it, and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin. My issue with it is that it has quite a bit of fragrant components, which is something my sensitive skin does not appreciate. The smell is not too strong, it’s slightly sweet and fruity, but it’s there. nan
