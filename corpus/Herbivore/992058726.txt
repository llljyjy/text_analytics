Getting straight to the point about results from the Nova serum: After exactly two weeks of evening application, my overall skin tone is noticeably bright, lit-from-within glowing. The serum did not lighten my moderate hyperpigmented areas.Other thoughts: The day-glo yellow color of the bottle worried me initially. Fortunately, the serum itself is not nearly as bright. Rather, it’s a pale yellow. The serum does not stain my skin, bedding or clothes.The fragrance is faint turmeric mint. It doesn’t linger.I think the Nova serum is best suited for someone with a dull, unblemished complexion. The serum will definitely provide radiant results. I received it complimentary from the brand but am required to provide my honest opinion. Best for dull complexion
