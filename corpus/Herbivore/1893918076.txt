Iâ€™m genuinely very sad to be giving this oil 2 stars. When I first got it, it did exactly what it says it does. My skin was glowing and was sooo smooth. Putting this on before my foundation made my makeup FLAWLESS. However a few weeks later I started developing random zits. I took out my serum to see if that was the culprit, however I continued getting them. I looked online to see if anyone had the same issue and found out some people had mold growing at the bottom of their bottle. I checked mine and lo and behold, there was little growth of mold starting to develop. Sadly, had to return. I will purchase again if they fix this issue. Good oil with big issue
