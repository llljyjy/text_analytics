I have oily skin so the ingredients in this cream are perfect for my needs. The cream is on the thicker side, so I like to use it at night. It doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and moisturizes well, but my only complaint is that the blue color leaves a blue/white cast on my skin that takes a while to work in. I’m Asian with golden/tan skin so it’s a small but annoying detail. I wish it was translucent and blended into skin without having to work it in too much. Works good but leaves a cast on skin
