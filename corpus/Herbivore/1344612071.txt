The Herbivore Coconut Milk bath soak has a faint but lovely scent when dry and in the original packaging. Once in your bath, as other reviewers have shared, it’s just a milky-bath without scent. I would save your money and not purchase this soak.If you’re open to trying a CBD soak and like lavender and eucalyptus, the Prima bath gems have a beautiful scent, leave your skin silky and soft and are oh so relaxing! Also available on Sephora.com and worth every dollar. Loses Scent, Do Not Recommend
