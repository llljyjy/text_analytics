So I was super excited to try the new Nova serum from Herbivore. It has 15% vitamin C and turmeric root. I really like how powerful yet gentle it is, especially since I have sensitive skin. It is creamy almost like a lotion but light and absorbs nicely. I have been using it for alittle over a week now and I can see my dark spots starting to fade and my skin looks brighter. I will say it does have a stronger scent than I usually like/ of ginger and turmeric. But itâ€™s not to bad especially since it works. Definitely plan on continuing to use! nan
