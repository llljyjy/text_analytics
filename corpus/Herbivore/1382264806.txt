Not for me. I have really sensitive skin and tend to get red spots from harsh vitamin C so using this product everyday does not work for me at all. I’ve used other Vitamin C’s every day with no issues, but this is very harsh. That being said, it feels nice on the skin and if you aren’t sensitive this may work for you. Not for sensitive skin.
