Herbivore Botanicals the Moon Fruit 1% Bakuchiol + Peptides Retinol Alternative Serum is lightweight and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling behind. It left my skin feeling soft and touchable. I prefer to use it at night even though the package says “Use AM/PM”. The Herbivore Botanicals the Moon Fruit 1% Bakuchiol + Peptides Retinol Alternative Serum is mostly unscented but there is a slight underlying scent that lasts for a bit after applying. I’ve noticed a reduction in the fine at the corners of my eyes and mouth. Works well
