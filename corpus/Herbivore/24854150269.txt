I really wanted to like this, but I didn’t. The smell was an extremely overwhelming medicinal fragrance, and I’m not one to usually complain about scent.  I also don’t know if it was expired or not, because the color looked really off. It was a deep green/almost black gel. I don’t know if they’re having quality control issues or what, but it seems like a common issue. nan
