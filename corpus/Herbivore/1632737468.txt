Absolutely love this product! I have very dry skin and many of the products I purchase that claim they are directed for my skin type, fall short. This goes on thick but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling so hydrated. I also just turned 40 and I really appreciate the antioxidant benefits as well. If I had to pick one thing to tweak, I would recommend removing the rose smell. I will definitely re-purchase this product and highly recommend. Perfect for my very dry skin
