So I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and while I enjoy it, I also find that it’s nothing special in the Fresh lineup. The packaging is gorgeous in typical Fresh fashion and the texture of this overnight mask is smooth and creamy. This is a great pick me up for dry skin, but it also feels like plenty of other creams I’ve used from the brand. It even carries that faint rose scent. It’s nice, but not a must have if you have other moisturizers from the brand. Good But Nothing New
