I’m always over exfoliating my skin, so I’m always trying out barrier building serums to fix that. My skin is also on the drier side, so I always look for ingredients like ceramide and hyaluronic acid! I started using this on my peeling nose and it healed really quickly, like flake-free within a week! Super happy with the results! Just make sure to spray some mist on your face prior to applying this product to maximize hydration :) Healed my peeling nose!
