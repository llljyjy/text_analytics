This is a 10/10. I got a deluxe sample of this and I am IN LOVE. I cannot get over the noticeable difference in my skin in a week. My skin is so soft, even texture, plump and hydrated. By far one of the best serums I have used. The texture is perfect. It’s not greasy and sinks into skin beautifully. Sits very well under makeup. Faint scent of black tea (it’s lovely) not overwhelming at all. Will 100% be purchasing a full size Incredible
