These lip balms give you a nice sheer tint of color and does hydrate your lips but unfortunately for a short amount of time and then I have to keep reapplying but I just love the buildable shades and selection. The ingredients are good too. Just to note: they do melt really easily so be aware and donâ€™t leave them in the car. Gifted by Fresh. nan
