For a ton of reasons, I did not care for my lips for like 2 decades, so suddenly when I started caring 3 months ago, my situation was not quickly fixed. My first step was switching from chapstick and lip balms to oil... but I was disappointed with how bad lipstick looked. I had some patches you can see in my photo that would just never get soft. I tried exfoliating them with a physical scrub (like a gritty sugar stick) and although that initially seemed to work, it could not remove the “deep chap“ and ultimately it only lifted the edges and made everything worse. Plus the scrub hurt. Somehow one day it occurred to me to try exfoliating with 1 drop of my Lactic Acid serum (made by The Ordinary, so it’s not the crazy strength that some YouTubers are literally causing chemical burns with). I applied this low potency Lactic Acid for about 3 minutes once per week for 3 weeks and FINALLY oh my gosh THIS was how my lips finally stopped having awful patches of stuck-on, chapped skin. For the first time in years, they looked “clean“ if that makes sense.But the Lactic Acid made them feel so DRY. I was applying oil every 5 minutes for hours and it still didn’t feel like “enough“ so that was when I shelled out for one of these lip mask products. Yes Fresh’s lip mask is a few dollars more than Laneige’s... but a teeny smidge goes so far. It is crazy how little I need. It could definitely last 9-12 months, depending on usage frequency. The smell is lovely. My lips feel SO conditioned in the morning. If you have super old chapped skin stuck on like I did, this WILL NOT exfoliate that... but once you get them exofoliated, this helps a ton to keep everything as plump and happy as possible.
