The first month of using this serum is ROUGH. My skin purged like crazy, and the pores on my face got huge. I’m so glad I stuck it out because after 2 months of consistent use my skin is texture free, glowing, and poreless. It’s worth the higher price point, I have never seen my skin look this good. Changed my skin!
