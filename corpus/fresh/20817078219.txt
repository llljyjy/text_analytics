Gifted by Fresh - I love this format of lip balm. I was yanking the cover like an idiot before I realized its a screw top haha even better! I love a secure packaging. The formula is SMOOOTH and silky. The color is really buildable and can get very pigmented. I do wish they had spf versions though. Thatâ€™d be amazing! Super buildable cover (btw, its a screw top)
