One swipe of color across the lips for me and I have a nice tint, 2 swipes and I have full color.  This is a great shade to keep in my purse on a night out because it’s an all-in-one touch up for me, rather than needing lipstick and some kind of gloss to keep my lips from feeling dry.  I like the new formula and I’m glad that they updated it to adhere to international safety standards!  I received SLT complimentary from Fresh. Great for Layering!
