I love this product so much . I got overwhelming results in reducing redness . Skin felt supple and soft . Has mild fragrance which is refreshing to me . Product absorbs so well .skin is more even toned now .Topped with vitamin C and deeply hydrating squalane, the mask supports revitalised so I am left with radiant skin . Must for radiant skin
