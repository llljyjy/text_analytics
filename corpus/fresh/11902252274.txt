This is a nice lip balm overall, but not the most hydrating. After continual use my lips felt a little chapped. Going on it felt nice and there was slight but beautiful Color. This gave me a kind of weird feeling in my throat.  Overall it’s ok but I wouldn’t repurchase.  Gifted by Fresh. Beautiful Flush of Color
