One at my favorite lip balm-like products, and the most perfect pale pink ever, is ruined. The new pink product has NO color at all once on the lips, does not last, and feels slimy. I have purchased at least 10 tubes over the years but returned the latest (note the new tube color and beware). So sad to lose another favorite. Beware new formula!
