I have been using the Sugar Lip Balm gifted by Fresh in the Rose shade. I love that this balm contains many beneficial ingredients such as various fruit oils, Vitamin C, and E. It goes on lips buttery smooth and provides a nice amount of hydration. Itâ€™s very comfortable to wear and has buildable color. Check out my photos showing before and after swiping a couple of times across the lips. It is a flattering shade with a slight gloss. Even once it eventually fades, it is a flattering lip stain appearance. nan
