So I think lip balm is just a very personal thing for me, I have dry skin and dry lips and I have tried a million lip balms. This one just unfortunately tastes so bad when it inevitably gets in your mouth and I really dislike that. :( The consistency is closer to a lip gloss, like a little bit sticky when you touch it. I am reluctantly using the rest of this to not lose money but I would suggest trying Fresh rose deep hydration lip balm over this one, which I will be re-purchasing after Iâ€™m through with this.
