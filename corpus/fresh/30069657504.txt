I have tried this serum for about four weeks now.   I like that this serum doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue. It has a light fresh scent and the texture is lightweight and milky. after cleansing and toning, I put a few drops in my hands, rub it a bit to warm it up, and then press it onto my skin. I like that it absorbs pretty quickly. my skin appears to be plump and more hydrated. nan
