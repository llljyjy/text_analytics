I love spraying my face with stuff. I have numerous setting sprays, hydrating sprays, primer sprays, so I of course had to pick this one up. I love everything from Fresh so I figured I would love this. Did I need it?  No, not at all, but I love it so much that I’m almost done with the bottle. My favorite way to use it is to spray if before I put on my hyaluronic acid serum, and again later in the day if I’m feeling dry. Is this a miracle?  No, but it’s a pleasant splurge that I’m happy to purchase and will probably purchase again. nan
