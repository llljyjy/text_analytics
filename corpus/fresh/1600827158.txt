I’ve been using this for about 2+ years now and I love it! I have combo skin and it’s just the right formulation for me where it’s lightweight yet powerful so I’m never oily or feel like it’s heavy/too much on my skin. A little bit goes a long way. Down side is that the 50ml size is on the pricy end but honestly, it’s worth it knowing that it’s a good quality product. nan
