My dry lips get chapped, the combination of both is uncomfortable and painful and for sure it does not look good specially if I want to use lipstick.  This sugar lip balm is helping my lips to heal, the first days I exclusively used it along the day and that made a noticeable difference, the skin of my lips is soft, with a smooth texture because they stay moisturized, I also like it has some color, I got a pretty shade. nan
