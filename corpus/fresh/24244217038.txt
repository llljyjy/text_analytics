I’ve been testing out the new Fresh Tea Elixir Skin Acitivating serum and have been very impressed. It has a very pleasant smell.  Medium consistency that is easy to spread on the skin. Instantly the skin feels more hydrated and supple. Ive also noticed my skin is glowing after using this. I haven’t been using it long enough to see reduced lines, but I am really hopeful. Highly recommend. Wow! Great serum
