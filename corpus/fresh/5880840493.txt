I was excited to try this as I have extremely dry skin and Kiehl’s discontinued my previous go to but this face cream was terrible. it pilled on my skin even if I just put it on by itself with no retinol /serum and no matter how long I waited before doing my makeup. I thought it might just be a night cream for me but it wasn’t even that moisturizing. pills under makeup
