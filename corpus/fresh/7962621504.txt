I have been trying this serum for 2 weeks now and so far I’m really liking it. I noticed a small change so far in the size of my pores and my skin looks healthier, I do believe that if I continue to use it the difference will be much greater. One think I love about this serum is that it doesn’t feel tacky or sticky my skin soaks it right up and in the morning my skin looks so glowy. I would definitely recommend this serum to my friends.
