I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that gets soooo dry in the winter. I was excited to try this calming mask, but hesitant because a lot of masks that claim to be calming can actually end up being irritating on my skin. Not this one!! The texture and consistency are perfect, the fragrance is light and disappears quickly after application, and my skin stayed hydrated all day after using it without feeling greasy. Plus the packaging is very aesthetic and high quality. Will be repurchasing!! nan
