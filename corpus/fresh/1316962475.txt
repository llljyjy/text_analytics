Things I like- The scent is nice and fresh, not too strong. Pleasant texture. Does not strip skin, or leave it feeling tight and dry. Things I donâ€™t like - Does not fully remove my make up.This works well for me as a second cleanse, if I remove my makeup first. If I am using just this cleanser I need to wash twice. I now use it for my morning wash, when I have no make up on. I will for sure finish, but will not be repurchasing. Not for me
