Fresh Black Tea Advanced Age Renewal Cream gifted by fresh has been a treat for my oily/combination skin. The cream is extremely moisturizing and can be used morning and evening. My skin has been looking very glowing and plumped through this winter cold. I have noticed an improvement in my dark spots, and smoothing of wrinkles around my forehead and smile lines. This cream is gentle enough for sensitive skin. Make sure to wear sunscreen in the daytime (this product does not contain retinol but wear your spf). I apply this cream as the last step in my skincare routine (before spf) and at night. It leaves my skin smooth, supple, and hydrated the next day! Great moisturizer for am/pm!
