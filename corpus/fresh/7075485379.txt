I was actually surprised how much I loved the color for this. Another huge pro is that the top twists on. My tops always manage to fall out in my purse so I love that. I don’t think it’s doing anything miraculous for the health of my lips, but definitely not hurting them either. Over all, I like it! But not sure if I would repurchase since it was gifted by Fresh A very nice no-make up lip
