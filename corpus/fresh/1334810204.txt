I was gifted by Fresh, their Sugar Tinted Lip Balm in color Icon in exchange for my honest review.  It is a 24 hour hydrating lip balm containing beetroot and sugar cane that provides sheer, buildable coverage with a smooth buttery texture.  It is infused with sugar to hydrate, condition, nourish and soften, and plant-based fruit oils (including cranberry seed oil) which help lips look and feel healthy by smoothing and protecting, also including grapeseed oil which smooths and softens, and additionally vitamin C and E to protect the skin.  I do wish it contained SPF.It feels wonderful on my lips.  It is not too thick and yet it is moisturizing.   As described it has a light buttery texture. It is not greasy feeling.  I love the color and that you can use it lightly or apply more layers for a deeper richer color.  My lips feel great immediately after using this product. It has the slightest faint sweet scent. I like that the packaging is like a metal tin and that the cap screws on so it wonâ€™t fall off in my bag. Buildable Color, Buttery Feel
