I have been using this for several months now and I do like it.  I have mature combination skin which leans towards being more dry on sides of cheeks and chin & mouth area.  Most scrubs tend to leave my skin feeling stripped.  This face wash is very gentle, sugar dissolves quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized, not stripped at all. That is the biggest difference I found between this and other physical exfoliators.I don’t use every day so mine has been lasting a long time.  I do feel that it is overpriced for what it is though....and don’t expect it to smell like strawberries, it does not.  To me, the smell reminds me of lime candies Gentle
