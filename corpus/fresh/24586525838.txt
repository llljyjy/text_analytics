Lovely moisturizer that has the scent of roses in it. If you don’t care for roses you may want to use another line as the smell is very prevalent in the line. However the roses are very helpful in getting moisture to the skin and I’m finding that my skin feels better over all after using this for four weeks. It’s certainly more comfortable. I also use the rest of the line including toner, masks and face wash. I do feel this is the most gentle line overall I have ever used, certainly not the cheapest but one of the best. I like it better than a Lancôme line I recently tried as it feels more natural. Beautiful rose moisteriser helps hydrate my skin
