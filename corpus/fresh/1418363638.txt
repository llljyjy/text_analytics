I’ve been a big fan of Fresh products for awhile so was really excited when Freshly gifted me this new lip bam. I love the packaging, the ingredients and the price point. I love that the color isn’t overbearing but has great pigment and is super hydrating. I do wish the applicator was a little smaller because I tend to get color outside of my lips, but this might be a me thing! Overall, really love it. Super hydrating and really nice color
