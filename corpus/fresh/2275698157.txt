I received a sample of this product a while back and decided to give it a shot after reading some reviews that claimed it helps soothe breakouts & generally “angry“ skin; I didn’t have very high expectations after one use, but lo and behold, the stress zits that had recently popped up on my forehead were much less noticeable, and my skin’s overall texture looked much more even. I picked up the full size as soon as I could and have been using it pretty much every night for three weeks at the time of writing this, and lemme tell ya, the results are astonishing! My skin has never looked better and I don’t know what more to say than: BUY THIS MASK. BUY IT.
