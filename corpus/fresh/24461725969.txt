If you have allergic reactions and hate the tight feeling from other face washes then this product is a blessing from the gods! This gets rid of pimples and also makes your skin feel supple even after washing. Its great for combination skin, doesn’t sting the eyes, smells like cucumbers, and also reduces the look of pores. If you had to get one facial product, this is all you’ll need and it’s well worth the investment if nothing else works. My Holy Grail face wash :)
