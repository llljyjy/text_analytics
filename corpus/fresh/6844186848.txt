Great find for sensitive, prone to redness skin. During winter months my skin is acting up: it gets dehydrated, easily irritated, and sometimes red. This mask tackles all of the above.

It makes my skin feel well-nourished and in the morning despite the heater blasting in my bedroom my skin feels well-hydrated and healthy. Perfect for colder months if you have sensitives s
