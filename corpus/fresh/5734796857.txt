Fresh TEA ELIXIR SKIN RESILIENCE ACTIVATING SERUM has a mild great white tea scent that I love.The bottle has a weight to it and the color catches my eyes from skipping SERUM from the skincare routine.The consistency is perfect, not sticky or too light.I am looking forward to see the result as they are tested.
