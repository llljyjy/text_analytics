I loveeee this mask!!! My favorite part about it is that you don’t have to wash it off/you can use it as an overnight mask too. I love how light the scent is as I have pretty sensitive skin. Also a little goes a long way so the price isn’t as bad as I first thought! It will definitely last me a long time! My friend had some dry patches and irritation and used this and it completely lessened the appearance and irritation after just one use! Seriously good amazing!
