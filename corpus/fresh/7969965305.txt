I actually use this product when I was sick because I started to see how the stress of being sick and what I was eating affected my skin so reading the label I thought this product would be perfect to give my skin the reset it needs and it actually dramatically reduced my redness which was awesome and help me gain a little bit of confidence back I’m glad that I was gifted by fresh this item but honestly I’ll be purchasing this as soon as I run out. The Skin Reset We All Need
