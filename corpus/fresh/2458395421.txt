I have not been using this long enough to see the full results so this is a little of a first impression. The serum itself is very scented so if you are sensitive to fragrances I would definitely take extra care in patch testing. It has a lovely milky consistency, it absorbs really well and layers well with my other products. What I notice is immediately when I use it my skin has a beautiful lit from within glow. The combination of hyaluronic acid and niacinamide it really helps plump your skin keeping it hydrated while still giving you that glow. I have easily sensitized skin I experienced no sensitivity issues from the fragrance or any of the ingredients in the serum. This will be staying in my routine Get that glow!
