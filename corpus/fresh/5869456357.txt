I’m a consistent lover of fresh products and this does not disappoint! The cherry color is perfect for the summer. I’ve even dotted it on my cheeks before as a blush! The color stays a pretty good amount for not being a stain and just being a balm. My lips also feel so nourished afterwards. Would definitely get again since this one was gifted by Fresh, I’ll buy the next one! Great product!
