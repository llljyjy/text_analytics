I love this balm! I received this product complimentary from Fresh. The scent is light and fresh, not too overpowering, and the slightly rosy and buildable color is perfect for a minimal makeup day. The texture is smooth and doesnâ€™t leave my lips feeling oily or heavy while leaving my lips feeling hydrated and nourished. Great balm!
