I was gifted the floral recovery calming mask by fresh. Iâ€™ve been using it for couple of weeks and I love how it leaves my skin feeling in the morning. My skin feels more evenly toned and my redness around my cheeks is reduced. I use it in the night and then I rinse it off in the morning. I love how smooth and calm my skin feels in the morning. I would highly recommend if you have sensitive skin and are looking for some thing that would help calm your skin as well as help you get even skin tone. Great for sensitive skin
