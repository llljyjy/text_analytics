i love this cleanser so much! the light cucumber/rose scent is super refreshing & for being a gel cleanser it foams up very lightly & doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight afterwards. i wish fresh would keep the limited 200ml packaging bc it’s so pleasing to look at but sadly they seem to be phasing that out :( overall though10s across the board for the soy face cleanser! i will definitely be repurchasing for a long time AH-mazing!!!!
