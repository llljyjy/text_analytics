I decided to give this a try after using the Fresh Lotus which is amazing. As I’m getting older (late 30’s) this seems a better fit for my skin. Absolutely love it! It really works well for the lines/wrinkles without the sensitivity of the retinol. A little bit of cream goes a long way and does not makes my skin oily or cause breakouts.  Plus, my skin feels plumped and awake next day. I was gifted by Fresh but this does not affect my experience with the product. Amazing cream without retinol!
