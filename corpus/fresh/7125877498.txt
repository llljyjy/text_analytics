This shade is very subtle but quite moisturizing. It is very much a tinted lip balm and its perfect for a no makeup or minimal makeup look. I wear it with mascara, concealer, and little bit of blush & it is the perfect for a dash out the door type look.  This product was gifted by Fresh. Super moisturizing with a light tint
