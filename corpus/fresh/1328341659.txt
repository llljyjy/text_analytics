I was sent this product complimentary for my honest review. I was able to use it several times the past few weeks and really enjoyed it! My skin has been so dry living in a dry climate during winter, and this mask has been amazing with helping me keep my face hydrated and comfortable. Soft scent, very good formula, highly recommend for anyone looking for a hydrating mask. Super hydrating
