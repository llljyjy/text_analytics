So I live in MD where it gets super humid my skin can act up and feel so dry even though my skin is more on the oily side but ever since I started using this serum my skin feels so hydrated and it looks so healthy and glowy. Also I love how it helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles perfect since I’m entering my 30’s also did I mention it’s great for all skin types. My new fav serum
