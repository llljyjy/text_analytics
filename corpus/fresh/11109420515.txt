Fresh gifted me their Black Tea Age Renewal Cream. This is medium thick in the jar but feels lightweight on skin. It absorbs well and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling or looking greasy. It has been great using this in the winter. I like the anti-aging benefits and firming abilities without the use of retinol, though I do feel I need to use this longer to see the full effects as it has only been about a week since I started using this. I like the ingredient callouts and think this has great potential. antiaging benefits without retinol
