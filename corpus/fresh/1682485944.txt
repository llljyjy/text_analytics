I don’t usually use toner, but the worker at Sephora suggested I use one to help prep my skin so that my facial products can work better. I do feel as though the product cleans my skin even after I’ve previously washed it, but doesn’t leave it dried out, and I do feel that my other products absorbs into my skin better. Will be purchasing another bottle when I run out, but it will probably be awhile since I purchased the biggest bottle (13.5 oz). Love this!
