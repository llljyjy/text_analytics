I received this mask free from Fresh Beauty for my review. This mask is a winner if you’re looking for something to soothe and calm dry stressed skin! Perfect wintertime mask! I’ve never really used a mask quite like this one; it’s like a moisturizer, but really thick. I use a brush to apply, and after about 10 minutes, about 75% of it gets absorbed and then you can massage in the rest. I’ve tried it both as an overnight mask and a wash off mask in the daytime, and I think I prefer to use it for shorter periods. When I used it as an overnight mask, I woke up with a small breakout on my cheek, so if you are acne prone, keep that in mind. If you have dry, stressed skin, give this a try! Soothing, moisturizing
