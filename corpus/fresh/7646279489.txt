To preface: I have acne prone skin, I have combo skin that will be an oil slick one day and the Sahara the next. My skin is relatively sensitive meaning that some products break me out or give me little white bumps....this product did none of that and actually evened out my oil/dyness fiasco I used this face cream for at least two years/three refills. I loved it. BUT I wanted to try something new, see what the hype was all about for the Drunk Elephant Protini yada yada, and even though I liked it, the protini was not nearly as hydrating as this Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream. This cream is the love of my life and I am so excited to get back into using it, I literally have to finish the protini but I have a jar of this face cream waiting for me from Christmas....Baby, Iâ€™m coming home!! So hydrating, I honestly dont care what people say about the fragrance...its so relaxing and just UHGG....I love. My OG...I've Missed You
