I’ve been through a lot of lip balms, but this is my favorite. It makes my lips look super full. It’s a little shiny, but not overly glossy. It also doesn’t do that thing where my lips get really tight and dry feeling after it wears off. You know what I mean. I’ve been through a couple of these and I always come back, really outstanding quality. The original is sweet and kind of tastes like skittles, in a nice way though. The watermelon is my favorite so far. It has a bit of a pink tint, leaves a really pretty natural flush on your lips. It’s fruity and sweet, but not in a sickening way. It last a while on the lips as well, super moisturizing. My absolute favorite
