This new Fresh serum is quite lovely. The texture is light and milky, and it sinks quickly into the skin without any sticky or greasy residue. It has a nice, light scent that fades quickly after application. Niacinamide, Hyaluronic acid, and ceramides are all solid ingredient additions. The Tea Elixir serum makes my skin feel hydrated and plump, which I love. A great addition to any skincare routine! nan
