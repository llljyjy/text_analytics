This USED to be my absolute fave lip balm. It was the most moisturizing, had spf, and imparted a perfect pop of color. I bought it in bulk because I couldn’t stand to run out.Sadly, the new formula is awful!!! Instead of being moisturizing, it is DRYING. And, it no longer has spf. This is such an expensive chapstick. It used to be worth it, because it was literally the best thing ever. Now it is actually terrible. I am beyond disappointed :(I really hope they bring back the old formula. I won’t be buying this formulation again. AWFUL new formula. Bring back the old version!!!
