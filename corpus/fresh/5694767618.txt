I have been testing out this product for the last week. I use it every morning and every evening before my moisturizer. It has kelp in it, which you can definitely smell, it’s a very green, aquatic scent to this serum. I think my skin is more glowy, for sure, and it seems to hold moisture in better.  I really enjoy this serum as a part of my routine. I’s not sticky or too thin, and it fits into my routine perfectly. It doesn’t change the way my makeup looks, either. gorgeous serum - made my skin glowy
