My skin has been extremely dry with the cold weather, and I’ve been looking for a moisturizer that adds a lot of hydration without feeling heavy or looking greasy. This moisturizer is exactly what I’ve been looking for! I love to use it at night and I wake up with moisturized, smooth, silky skin. Even though it’s a thicker cream, it doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and it sinks in quickly. My skin looks brighter and plumper and radiant! This was gifted by Fresh but my opinion is my own. A must have for dry skin!
