This was my first time using any fresh product. I love the consistency of this serum and even the smell. I think with more time I definitely could be to see how the results are after a month. It works really well with my other products, no pilling, no irritation and I love that! I do feel like I have to use more product than I initially expected to but itâ€™s worth the try for anyone thinking about it! nan
