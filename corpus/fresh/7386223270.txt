This lip balm is… fine, just not necessarily what I look for in one. The color is nice but I think not the most flattering for my neutral medium skin (I’m a somewhat tan Asian). It’s kind of a bright pink, which just isn’t a shade I usually go for. It’s also a bit waxy for my taste - I’ve come to prefer more oily/slippery formulas that your lips really absorb. This one kind of feels like it’s just sitting on top of my lips for the most part. Overall just depends what you like in a lip balm - this one will do the trick but I’ve used better for my personal taste. Gifted by Fresh nan
