This mask is a very refreshing and a sensorial item to use. What I can tell you it holds moisture and feels great on the skin + the aroma-therapeutic feel to it is a plus, as for the other benefits I can’t really say.The downside is I feel like it’s competing against its own brand, I prefer the black tea overnight mask over this one.Hence, this mask is an OK addition, you’re better off with a brightening serum + the black tea overnight mask. Good, but not good enough
