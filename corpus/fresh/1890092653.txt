This product defied my expectations! It smooths on like a normal cream—kind of heavy if I use too much but not stifling like a body lotion. Nothing special. But after a penny sized amount and I wake up with plump, radiant, even toned skin. I had oily, acne prone skin for years but by the time I started using this my skin was clear with light scarring. I absolutely notice a difference in how bright it looks and feels. It makes my face feel healthier, and in turn any imperfections are overshadowed by how healthy every thing else looks. It has never irritated any active blemishes. It has a light herbal scent but I’d have to intentionally sniff the jar to notice. The price is wild but the smaller jar easily stretches between sales. When I occasionally use a different night cream, the radiance and plump feeling isn’t there when I wake up. I took away a star because my last jar started to flake brown bits toward the end of its life. The best night cream I’ve used
