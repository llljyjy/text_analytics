Absolutely obsessed with fresh lip products, and and the stick lip treatments are my favorite. They are buttery soft and the tinted ones like this give a nice sheen on top of being super moisturizing. The color is buildable similiar to color in a gloss (no where near a lipstick but a nice subtle color for the summer). I own a bunch of these and this one ties my favorite with the rose color. Iâ€™ve bought all of mine except for this one was gifted by Fresh Beautiful color & super nourishing lip balm!
