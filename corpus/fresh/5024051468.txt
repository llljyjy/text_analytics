I think my skin tends to look a bit dull so I tried this to see if I could get some life back lol (I look semi-dead most days). It was okay and it did make my skin look and feel nourished but after a few months of using it, my skin started to break out. My issue is that I cannot do creams- I know they tend to be too rich for me but tried this one anyway. I only dropped a star because of what it did to my skin but It Did work for a little while. Itâ€™s okay-just not for Me
