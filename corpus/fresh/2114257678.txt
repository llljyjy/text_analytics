This is my new favorite lip treatment! This was gifted by Fresh to me but all opinions are valid and my own. I’ve always struggled with dry lips, especially during the summer when I’m outside often and enjoy the sunshine. I love how hydrating this is and how smooth my lips feel afterwards. I had always loved the original fresh and now I’m loving this Peony shade because of the buildable color. Pretty pretty! Definitely buying again Soft lips and pretty color
