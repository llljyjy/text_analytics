Really like this lip balm. Has a sweet lemony scent and is nicely hydrating. The packaging is heavy and luxe which makes it a great gift. I prefer the cooling minty scent and the fresh sugar potted lip balms those. These are just a little too pricey and would be worth it if they were half the price. This was gifted by fresh Nice but pricey
