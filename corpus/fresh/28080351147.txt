Ok this is pricy but I really like it! I’ve been using this am and pm for about a week and I actually see a difference which I feel like that never happens. This gives my skin a radiant glow and my skin texture has improved in the center of my face. Here’s the con, it smells like a rose tea bag. Take that as you will. Natural glow!
