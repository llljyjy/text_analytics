I’m usually a big fan of Fresh, so I was excited to try this product! And as expected, it did not disappoint! I live in Northern MN and my dry skin can get pretty angry in the dead of winter, which happens to be right about now! Sure enough, I had some dry patches pop up a few days ago, and most products I put on them sting. This overnight mask does not make my dry patches sting nearly as much as even my CeraVe cream. This mask feels nice and rich without being too thick. It’s just the right amount of moisturizing and calming and has helped my face with its dry patches significantly in just a few days. Seriously helps with my winter dry patches
