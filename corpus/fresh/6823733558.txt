I got the deluxe mini (2.2g / .07oz) from the Sephora Favorites Plump and Hydrate Lip Kit. I’m not sure if that size is thinner but because of the formulation, it broke :(Other than that, it’s very smooth and buttery on the lips - no tugging. The packaging is pretty cool too. It’s not cheap plastic but almost metal(?) like and the first thing I noticed was how cooling it felt. I still recommend it tho! Too soft
