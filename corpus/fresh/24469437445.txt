This product was gifted by fresh. I have pretty big lips that get chapped easily so I love lip masks and treatments but I usually don’t love putting color on my lips but I’m obsessed with how subtle and natural and pretty this color looked, and how buttery the product feels! Some lip balms I’ve tried feel nice when you apply but feel dry within minutes, this one has a very velvety feel and leaves my lips feeling hydrated longer! Buttery texture and subtle tint!
