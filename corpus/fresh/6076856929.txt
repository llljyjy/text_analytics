Tbh I am SO GLAD they changed the formula of this lip balm. I hated the old formula as it melted so badly and it was way too pigmented for a lip balm imo. It smeared all over the place as long as the weather got a little warm and I couldn’t even use it. The new formula doesn’t smear, it’s sheer, and it feels amazing! Best of all, it finally has clean ingredients, which is most important to me for a lip product because that’s what we tend to ingest over time. I know a lot of people are disappointed that the new formula doesn’t contain spf, but to me that’s a good thing because I really don’t like the taste of spf in lip products anyway. New formula is way better!!
