First impression - the glass bottle feels luxe, the smell is fresh and light, and the consistency is watery and sinks into the skin easily without feeling sticky. It plays well with both my day and night moisturizer and wears well under makeup. After application, I feel like my skin is hydrated and plump. Overall, I really like this! Smells fresh, applies well!
