Overnight masks are such a life saver! They do all the work while you’re sleeping. This one has nice, slightly thinker than a moisturizer consistency. It has a nice subtle scent, does not feel heavy on the skin, and my skin is responding well to it. I can’t wait to see long term results! So far I have noticed a slight decrease in redness! My skin looks a little more lively and healthy nan
