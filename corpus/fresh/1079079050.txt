I was very kindly gifted by Fresh to try their SLT Plum lip treatment and I’m absolutely loving everything about it. The shade is gorgeous and is very flattering on my medium skin tone and the consistency is so smooth and buttery. It smells yummy and heals my perpetually chapped lips. I’m loving it so far!
