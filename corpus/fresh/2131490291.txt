Love this serum!!!! It reminds me of a lightweight version of the fresh black tea mask, which has been one of my favorite products for years! It’s lightweight and has a light floral scent to it, went on really nice under my tinted moisturizer and didn’t make it run throughout the day! Overall I love this product and I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out! Super lightweight and effective!
