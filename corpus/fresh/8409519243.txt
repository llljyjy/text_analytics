This is one of my favourite cleansers. It smells really lovely but has a subtle fragrance. It doesn’t irritate my eyes like other makeup-removing cleansers. I find it does remove complexion makeup well, but doesn’t remove mascara fully. This face wash is not foaming, so I find it’s more gentle on the skin and less drying. I definitely recommend. nan
