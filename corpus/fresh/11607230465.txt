This Fresh Tea Elixir serum is very nice. I love Fresh products , so I was super excited to try it. So far I’ve been using it every day and night for over a week. I haven’t seen any drastic changes, but I do see my skin is much smoother and clearer. It’s helps keep my skin moisturized and feels amazing on my skin. The texture is thick and milky, but absorbs quickly into my skin and feels lightweight. It does have a fragrance,  it smells herbal and has a light green tea scent which I really enjoy. Overall I like it and will continue to use it to see what other results I get. Nice serum !!!
