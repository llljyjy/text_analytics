A beautiful serum that feels really nice on the skin. Not sticky, sinks in wonderfully, but I’m not sure what it does beyond that? At least on my skin. I didn’t really notice a substantial change in texture, hydration, brightness or clarity. Like I said if feels good, but If your results oriented this may not be for you. At least the bottle is pretty!
