I received this as part of a 500 point gift. I like the smell and it does make my skin feel soft. I find it annoying to dispense and apply. I’m also confused about a serum with oil—a serum goes on the skin before moisturizer, but oil is occlusive. I feel like I’m blocking my other products. It hasn’t changed my skin, but it’s generally pleasant. nan
