I fell in love with this product after the first use, but it has continued to be just as good if not better with each use! My skin has never felt more hydrated and supple, and it is smoother than it has been in years. This products does wonders on its own, and also goes well with any of the other skincare products I’ve tried it with. This one is staying in my skincare routine for good! Okay, I’m obsessed!
