Fresh’s Sugar Lip Balm in Peony is one of my new favorite everyday balms! The texture is super smooth and hydrating. I love the fresh smell as well. The color is the perfect mauve pink and builds very easily. I love that the cap has a bit of a twist so it won’t get lost, fall off, or break! Gifted by Fresh. nan
