I received this product complimentary from Fresh in exchange for my honest review.The Fresh Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum boosts skin resilience, while also smoothing texture, giving a radiant glow, restoring balance, and reducing the look of fine lines/wrinkles.The key ingredients are Ocean Kelp to refine skin texture, 5Kda Hyaluronic Acid to deeply hydrate and minimize the look of fine lines, Niacinamide to refine the look of pores, and Ceramide III to help strengthen the skin barrier! It was designed to empower your skin to resist everyday skin stressors and smooth skin with a bouncy, healthy glow.To use, apply a few drops to your hand and press to activate the serum. Then, apply to the face and the neck generously. Ideal for AM and PM use!The texture is watery and hydrating. It quickly absorbs into the skin and doesnâ€™t leave behind any residue or stickiness. Perfect for anytime use!
