#Gifted This is an overnight mask that is clinically proven to calm signs of sensitivity - redness, uneven tone, and rough texture for an even toned complexion. This dermatologist-tested overnight mask is powered by floral extracts, passionflower, cornflower, cherry blossom, & peony to calm and reduce the look of redness on sensitive skin. Formulated with vit. C and squalene to brighten and smooth, this face mask envelops skin with a cocooning experience.I love a good overnight mask and this one has a beautiful, rich creamy texture. It calms down any redness I might be having and brightens my skin. I was surprised just by the ingredients and the name that I didn’t smell any scent at all. The texture is amazing & so luxurious! This leaves my skin feeling very smooth & hydrated in the a.m. I definitely recommend this mask. It’s actually amazing for the winter months when you need that little extra extra! Sooo good!!
