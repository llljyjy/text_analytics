I love Fresh products and this new face mask did not disappoint! This mask has a rich texture, but does not feel heavy at all. I use it as a sleeping mask and leave it on overnight and I wake up with nourished, hydrated, and more even complexion. I feel like it also helped with a bit of texture I had around my nose as well. I’m not sure if I’ve seen a significant improvement in terms of helping sensitivity in my skin, but overall I’m really enjoying this! A Wonderful Sleeping Mask
