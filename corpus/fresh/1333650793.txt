As someone with mature, dry skin that can get red and uneven I was so excited to try this overnight mask.  It has the classic Fresh “cucumber spa water” scent and a rich texture.  I would say it is sort of mid-weight, not too light but not super heavy and occlusive.  Really, it just feels so nice in my skin layered over my usual evening skincare.  In the morning my skin is smooth and soft! Super smooth and soft skin!
