Besides this product being beautiful to look at..it also makes my skin look beautiful. My skin always looks so plump and radiant after using this and I’ve been loving adding this in to other products in my routine as well. I can’t comment on the look of wrinkles yet since I’ve been using this about a week but I could definitely see it being beneficial for that just looking at the ingredient list! Smells Ike tea which I don’t mind but just something to keep in mind! Would definitely recommend!! Radiant and healthy skin !
