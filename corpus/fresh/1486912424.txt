*gifted by Fresh* Black Tea line from Fresh is one of my favorites. This cream feels light, even though it’s pretty rich. The cream is silky, and applies like a dream. It’s stinks and does the skin quickly and doesn’t feel greasy, but it leaves a long lasting hydration to the skin. It is perfect for my normal skin during winter months. nan
