I absolutely love Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment!! I’ve used the original and rosé before and have always been a big fan. The plum is just as amazing! The color is a fun, berry that can give you a light pinkish purplish color and is buildable! I like doing a few coats for a bolder color. Great texture and lasting moisture! Gifted by Fresh. Obsessed!!
