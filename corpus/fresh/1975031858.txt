This serum is worth it. I have been using it for a week now and I noticed my skin feels softer and more hydrated. It smells amazing and has a very light fresh scent. I have sensitive skin and it didnâ€™t irritate my skin. I seen an improvement in my skins texture but have yet to see any improvements in my fine lines. So far my skin feels more firm and glowy. nan
