I don’t understand why everyone likes this, I feel like a crazy person for hating it…!? The texture is not smooth at all, it’s like straight grainy sugar. It does not moisturize my lips and I wake up having to reapply in the night. The smell/taste is very artificial and perfumed. Not repurchasing this. Really Dislike This
