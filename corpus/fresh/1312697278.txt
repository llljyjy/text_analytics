#freshbeautygiftedmeI firmly believe that hydration is key for antiaging. I love thick creams, especially for the nighttime, and feeling like there is a thick layer that stays on overnight. I love the rich consistency of this cream but how it feels light and fresh on the skin. My skin feels velvety soft and plump till morning. It has a nice scent that is signature to Fresh, but with a slightly earthy note. It is a great antiaging cream! Great antiaging cream!
