before it was a hard pass, I purchased it like 15 years ago, and it only smelled nice, 0 staying power, weak color, and the worst part it’s always a mushy mess!!!! NOW I recently saw it onsale so I decided to give it another go, it’s been reformulated to my surprise, and for the best!!! still super moisturizing, great color, it’s not greasy and oily anymore, it’s better!!! I’d buy more now, before no, it was terrible Reformulated for the Better!!
