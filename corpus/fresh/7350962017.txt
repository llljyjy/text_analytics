I’m 45 in Colorado with very dry skin. I am a skincare junkie but prefer cleaner products. I have tried so many products it’s absurd and this is hands down the best. My skin is noticeably more hydrated and bouncy in the morning. I could theoretically go without daytime moisturizer that’s how good it is. And the light Cucumber rose natural scent and good ingredients makes me feel even better. Yes it’s expensive, but it’s worth every single penny. Will repurchase. The best face mask ever
