HIGHLIGHTS:-My normal skin type is dry and sensitive (typical ginger complexion issues)-First day using it, my friend who is a licensed esthetician looked at me and said “You’re skin is GLOWING, did you use something new?!“ -One week using it so far, and I love how it’s making my skin look. Evening out and glowing!-Does NOT PILL if you don’t apply too much and actually let it soak in (15 min).Details:This was recommended by a Sephora expert in the chat. I was hesitant since I saw lots of reviews that it pills when you put something on top of it (makeup, sunscreen, etc.). I have not found this to be the case at all, AS LONG AS you let it soak in and don’t apply too much! Just apply less than you think, and give it like 15 min to sink in. I have put sunscreen over it every day and had zero pilling issues.I’m seriously amazed that it made me glow on the first use. So much so that an esthetician took one look at my face and asked if I started something new because my skin looked so lovely. I bought the sample size but will absolutely purchase the full size once it’s out. LOVE! Instant glow! Let it soak in and it won't pill.
