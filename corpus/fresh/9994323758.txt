I have dry skin and wear concealer under my eyes on a daily basis. I’ve been using this product for over a month, and I’ve noticed that this eye cream does not work well with under eye makeup products. When I apply my favorite concealer on top of this cream, it pills and looks cracked/veiny. I’ve used other eye creams with the same, or better, hydration benefits that do not mess up my makeup. I would highly recommend the Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide eye cream by Summer Fridays instead! nan
