Overall I really like this serum. I’ve noticed my face is less red & irritated. I’ve also seen a decrease in breakouts. It also feels great to run into the skin & doesn’t have much of a scent. I included photos of before/after use, and you can tell my pimples have calmed down. I’d definitely recommend this to others. nan
