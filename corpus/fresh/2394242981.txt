This is a nice and light hydration and barrier boosting serum. I was worried that it would clog my congestion prone skin, but luckily I did not have that issue using this serum twice a day! It helps reduce redness and calm my skin when itâ€™s irritated. A good one to pair with my retinol at night. Nice for barrier support
