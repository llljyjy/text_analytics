I was gifted by Fresh the new peony flavor in exchange for a honest review. I’ve always wanted to try fresh’s sugar lip balms because I have enjoyed a range of other products from fresh. I enjoyed the scent, always been a huge fan of peony and floral scents. Color payoff is also decent, I don’t like too much pigment for lip balms so I didn’t need to build up the color. Makes my lips moisturized like any lip balm does. Decent color payoff
