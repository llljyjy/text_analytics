I saw someone rave about how much they loved this for their textured skin and how much it helped soften their skin. I used my points to get a sample collection with this in it. I should have just originally bought the full size because the difference this has made in my skin is just amazing. It’s hard to describe, you feel hydrated and moisturizer right away then when it soaks in it really softens tue skin. It’s great for am or pm routine but it’s my favorite for the am. I know it’s not cheap but a little goes a long way. I highly recommend. Amazing for Textured Skin
