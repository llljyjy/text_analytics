The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment in Rose is a very hydrating lip product that has a subtle tint to it. This lip treatment comes in the traditional Fresh lip product metal tube packaging. I love that the cap is a twist off because I have more confidence in just throwing it into my purse without worrying about it opening inside my bag! The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment in Rose is a very easy to apply balm-like lip product that moisturizes the lips immediately after application. The shade Rose is a very versatile neutral shade that goes well with or without other face makeup. I find myself reaching for it quite frequently.I would definitely recommend the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment in Rose. It is a nice product that seems to hold up pretty well against the hot and humid summer heat. Nice lip product
