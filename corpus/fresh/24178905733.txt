The original Fresh sugar lip treatment is my absolute favorite. But the plum shade works on the days I want a wash if color without feeling like I’m wearing lipstick. I don’t think it feels as creamy as the colorless one but the shade is pretty. I also feel like more than 1 coat doesn’t look much different in my opinion. I know it’s supposed to be buildable but 2 coats looks about the same as one on me. It never gets opaque which I personally like so it always looks natural. But I do genuinely reach for this quite often and as you can see in the after photo it gives my lips a youthful, healthy appearance. It looks beautiful with my lipliners for a put together yet  minimal look. Gifted by fresh Love the plum color!
