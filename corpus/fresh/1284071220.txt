I have super oily skin, but also aging concerns so in the winter I like a thicker but well absorbing night cream. This stuff still feels tacky on my face an hour after applying. A little does go along way, and it has not caused me any issues, but I just donâ€™t like the way it leaves a film on my face. Many have commented on the smell; It is probably a little stronger than you want for a face cream, but I am obsessed and I wish it came in the hand cream I would buy a gallon. A little citrusy and sweet. If it came in a candle I would be super stoked. Not for oily skin, smells delicious!
