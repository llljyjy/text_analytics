I naturally have paler and thinner skin on my face; and I deal with higher levels on inflammation than your average person. So I often get a “redness stache“ that surrounds my nose, upper lip and chin area. And it can get very distinct and there are weird cut-off areas where my skin will be spared from the redness. It’s definitely due to how my capillaries are formed; my skin type & my inflammation. Even THAT calms down noticeably after using this; and I didn’t have to sit in a mirror and think hard about it to deduce that. It also will help calm the anger in any active breakouts & reduce the redness in healing inflamed acne scars. I have been using this along with some other great skin products so I can’t contribute my lack of active surface acne to just this- but it’s definitely played a huge part in adding a penetrating bounce to my skin and giving it even & ethereal “milky“ complexion. As someone who’s oil production naturally alternates from being on slight overdrive to super overdrive; I feel like this alone encourages my oil glands to back down a little bit as well. I LOVE how you don’t have to rinse it off and I love how the impact of the anti-inflammatory effects don’t just last an hour or 2 like some other products with a similar aim. If you give it enough time between waking up & makeup application; it won’t pill under your makeup- at least it hasn’t for me and I like to play with multiple different formulations of primers etc. It’s just thick enough to give dry skin instant relief yet it’s very emollient so a little goes a long way; even on skin I’ve just toned with a generous application of a powerful Glycolic & Lactic Citrus toner. To add perspective; I’ll include a photo where I’ve gone 2 nights with poor sleep right after using it. Honest Effectiveness and Long-Term Value.
