Don’t like the rose scent and I’m not even sensitive to fragrances. I’m surprised that a great brand like this has a product with such a high scent. Smelled it for some time after I applied it to my face. I was worried because my skin doesn’t do well with fragrances, I was able to use the sample for about a week and noticed no breakouts and no bad changes in face. Overall I’m kind of torn; I’d like to say I’d purchase and try to overlook the fragrance but I just really didn’t like the scent. Only con is the scent.
