The Papaya shade, complimentary from Fresh, has an initial sheer coral color, but impressive in its ability to build up color with each additional application. I’ve used Fresh lip balms since I was in high school MANY years ago and I’m always impressed with the texture and hydration it provides. I don’t unfortunately care too much about the color as its not my preferred shade I like for myself, but thought why not try something new! Next time, ill stick to my usual colors but definitely within the Fresh line! nan
