Fresh and their “Rose“ named line of products, I have yet to be disappointed in the ones I have tried.  This Oil-Infused Serum is super hydrating and soothing, it smells amazing and you don’t need a whole lot of product to get that just right feel.  Though use too much and you will have a slightly oily residue left behind.  I use 2-3 shakes into my hand, rub together my palms and apply to my face and neck and kinda just smooth it in.  My skin feels so much nicer since using it, it feels smooth and perfectly hydrated. Top it with my usual moisturizer and I’m good and my skins is super happy.  Honestly, I will definitely be repurchasing when I’m in out!  Glass bottle is really cute also Soothing and smells AHHMAZING
