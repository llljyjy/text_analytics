This is my every day mask. It gives my skin a smooth and hydrating skin. Apply and leave it on for 10-15 mins, not more than 15 mins. Then wash it off with luke warm or cold water. If you do this every day, your pores will be minimized and your skin will not get dry. I adore it so much and highly recommend you to give it a try. My every day mask
