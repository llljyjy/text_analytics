I tried a sample of this moisturizer and loved it. I ended up ordering the full size version and I started to dislike it the more I used it. It feels like it sits on my skin instead of absorbing and it pills/rubs off my skin. Itâ€™s impossible to wear under makeup because everything just comes off. I had really high hopes for this product but I will not be repurchasing. nan
