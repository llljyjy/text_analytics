I have persistently dry lips due to several factors. My dry lips often affect my sleep. This lip mask is perfect for me. The scent/flavor is incredibly light, almost nonexistant, and pleasant. The treatment itself is thick enough to last until I can actually fall asleep, while being comfortable and light enough not to be gross or bothersome. I know nothing will ever cure my lips, but this mask helps me to be able to sleep comfortably and keep my lips well moisturized far into the next day. I have had no cracking, bleeding, snake shedding, or any otherwise horrible dry lip issues since I started using this mask every 1.5 nights. No bad side effects either! Just soft happy lips.
