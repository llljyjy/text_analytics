I’ve used the fresh lip balms before but this is the first time I’ve tried a shade that wasn’t red or clear. I received the peony shade complimentary from fresh and I really like it. The color is buildable and I really pretty while being natural, and it gives my lips nourishment and helps to keep them from chapping. nan
