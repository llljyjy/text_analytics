This whole line is amazing! I have combo/dry skin and right now it’s winter so my skin is experiencing some fry patches. Using this has cleared it up immediately! I love that it isn’t heavy, nor greasy but it’s sooo hydrating. I have huge pores on my nose and tzone area so sometimes using heavy moisturizers can clog them easily, but this cream is the perfect balance of hydration for my skin. Highly recommend! I was gifted by fresh to share my honest review. Perfect facecream!!
