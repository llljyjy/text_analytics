I really enjoyed using this skin resilience activating serum. There is a scent to it, so I would not recommend if you are sensitive to perfumes. It is a refreshing smell, but could be too strong depending on how much you use. I was nervous to incorporate this into my skincare routine, but it actually blended my facial lotion a lot better. Added moisture!
