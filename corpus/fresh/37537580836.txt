I owned my first sugar lip balm several years ago, and I’d been a loyal customer ever since. I’ve always enjoyed how it moisturized my lips and gave it a warm pop of color so that I can skip the lipstick when in a rush. With the new formula, I believe it is better in terms of color delivery: it’s more sheer, which may be a negative for some, but I like that because it sort of enhances its quality as a lip balm and not full-on lipstick, which feels lightweight on my lips and appears more natural, especially for the darker colors I purchase. However, it doesn’t have that same emollient effect as before. When I apply it, immediately, it’s great—moisturizing and smooth—but it makes my lips dry after 20 minutes or so, which requires constant re-application. That’s a bummer, especially as in previous years, one lip balm was able to last me a very long time. Compared to one year or two that I savored one lip balm with the previous formula, the most recent one I bought in “plum“ lasted me six to seven months. That’s still very long, but not like how it used to be. Overall, it’s great now for adding a sheer, natural flush of color to the lips, and for the lip balm feature itself, there are better ones. But, I’d exploit Sephora’s return policy and still try it out. Beautiful color but dries out quick
