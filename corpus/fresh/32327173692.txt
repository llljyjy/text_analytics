Absolutely love this night cream. Creamy thick texture that glides on skin and melts in overnight. I haven’t seen any notable improvement in lines/wrinkles but I’ve got other potions for that. As a high impact night cream for older dry skin, it’s perfect. And the scent?? Like cool cucumbers. Love, love this cream. Such a treat. Dreamy night cream
