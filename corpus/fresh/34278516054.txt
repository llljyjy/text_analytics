I LOVE this moisturizer!! I usually use it right after my shower and after I wash my face before bed. When I wake up in the morning now my face feels so hydrated.  It has a very subtle calming scent nothing too strong. It feels so smooth and removes the redness in my skin. I have oily skin, and I think the consistency is very rich and buttery without being too heavy. I also have sensitive skin however the ingredients didnâ€™t irritate my skin at all but actually left it feeling very nourished! So glad I added this product to my skincare routine!! Very hydrating, my new favorite moisturizer!!
