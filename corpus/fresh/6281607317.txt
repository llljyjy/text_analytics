I absolutely LIVE for this serum! It’s very liquidy… In fact i didn’t even realize it was a serum, i had thought it was more like an essence. But it is very moisturizing and leaves a soft healthy glow and skin just feeling good! I have combo skin but this winter i’ve been dryyyy and pores went crazy and this always has my skin looking Fresh (pun intended lol). This is one of those products where you might forget that you put it in or you’re not really thinking about your skin until you glance at a mirror and go DANG i’m having a good skin day! & then remember you added this bad boy to your regiment. I don’t care for baby Fresh products like that, I’m not a fan of the smell often times, and none of their creams or cleavers have really blown me away except for this one. The price is a little steep but it will last for a long time. I purchased mine about 3 months ago, I use it pretty much daily in the mornings and i still have a little over half the bottle left. I will definitely be repurchasing. RUN don’t walk to get this!
