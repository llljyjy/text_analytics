Okay hear me out.. you might think a “luxury” lip balm sounds silly or unnecessary but there is a difference and you WILL feel it! As someone who suffers from the worst chapped lips- and I mean will literally bleed from dryness this was an essential. The color pay off is what you expect from a balm- light but consistent. This was complimentary from Fresh. nan
