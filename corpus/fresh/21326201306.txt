I have always been a sucker for any skincare product that included roses, so naturally when I came upon this moisturizer I had to get it. It almost instantly became a staple in my skincare routine. The cream is soft and light on the skin and won’t have your hair sticking to your face, as well as having a delicate and relaxing rose scent that is far from overpowering. Plus, you only need a little to properly moisturize your entire face! I often only used this product once a day at night, 1.6 oz lasting me somewhere between 3-4 months! Not too bad I don’t think. I have always had very dry skin and using this cream has assuredly gotten me through the cold, dry winter, keeping my skin hydrated and soft when in the past it was always unbearably dry. Cannot recommend enough, especially for those with dry skin like mine! Smooth and fragrant, I adore it
