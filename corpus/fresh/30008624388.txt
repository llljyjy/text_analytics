I received this lip balm complimentary from Fresh to test and review. I received the new Papaya shade, which is a bright, juicy peach/coral color. At first, I was worried it would be too bright, but the formula is actually super flexible. It’s easy to get a thin, sheer layer, but it’s also easy to build up to a bolder color. It also smells really lovely and feels really nourishing and protecting on the lips. Definitely a good staple product. I want all the shades! I want every shade!
