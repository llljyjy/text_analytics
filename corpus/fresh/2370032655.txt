I love this entire product line at Fresh. If you like the scent of rose petals in water you will probably like this line. I first got this product as part of a promotional offer in the summer. I loved the scent - but it made me break out so I stopped using it. I have extremely sensitive skin and rosacea with light acne. Now that it’s winter I’ve tried it again and I’m finding now that it doesn’t break me out at all. The texture is like a gel cream that is very moisturizing and it has such a lovely and fresh scent. If you’re on the fence about it I would try the trial size or one of the Fresh gift sets, which are amazing. I would have given this product five stars if I had only tried this in the winter Amazing product; but best if used in the winter
