I recently moved to the mid-westwhich is drier than dry in these harsh winter months. My skin and especiallymy lips were taking a huge hit! Crackedand painful, I was searching for a solution. With all the great reviews for this lip balm, I decided to order the translucentSugar Advanced Therapy Treatment Lip Balm. So far, so good. The balm is very hydrating. I put it on before bed and when I woke up eight hours later, I could still feel the balm on my lips. Iâ€™m hoping with continued use, I will see a huge difference in my poor cracked lips! Perfect for Dry Winters
