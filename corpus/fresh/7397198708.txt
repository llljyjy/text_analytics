This is a really nice lipstick. I tried the icon color and when I first put it on it had a light tint, but was easily buildable into a beautiful red color. The lipstick left my lips super soft and moisturized. I love the color. It comes on like a chapstick, but stays on like a nice lipstick. I love it! I was gifted by fresh in exchange for my honest review. nan
