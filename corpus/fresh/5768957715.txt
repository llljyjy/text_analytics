Gifted by Fresh. I am a huge Fresh Beauty lover and the lip treatments have always been some of my favorite lip products. The Rosè has always been good to me; hydrating and lovely smelling but for some reason this one smelled very floral. It was weird to me. Usually a great product, don’t know what happened.
