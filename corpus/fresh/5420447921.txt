I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I love the Fresh rose line and this smells just like the other products in the line like the toner and cream. I really appreciate the fine mist that comes out and that I can apply it before and after makeup application. You can even put it in the fridge in the Summer time so you have a nice cool mist to refresh your skin with. If you are sensitive to scent then I would steer clear. smells and feels so refreshing
