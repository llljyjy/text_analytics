I have never used a serum quite like this before - it’s so different than anything in my extensive collection! It’s not sticky at all, but more creamy. However, it’s not greasy, & sinks in fully. It’s very humid here in summer & this serum feels absolutely weightless. It smells SO good - just like strong tea. But the real goodness is: it healed my dry skin! I have terrible dry patches around my mouth because of wearing a mask. This healed them in less than a week of using it AM & PM before my normal moisturizer! I’ve never been much of a serum person (I’ve tried many looking for some kind of “holy grail” treatment but they’ve mostly disappointed me) but I really love this one! The cost is high, but I would trade $80 worth of worthless serums for one that works any day! Just…wow!
