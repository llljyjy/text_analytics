This cream has done wonders for my dark spots and i’ve only used it for 1 week! I slather it on as the last step of my PM skincare routine, sleep, wake up and wash my face, and it leaves my skin so smooth, hydrated, and even. I am surprisingly pleased! The only think I don’t love is the smell it has, it’s fragrance reminds me of my grandma’s perfume. Other than that, love it! Evens skin tone like it says
