The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment is a must have. I was gifted by Fresh and at first glance, the packaging is amazing! Im glad that the cap covers the entire Lip treatment so I don’t get any crumbs on it! I love the scent of the Lip Treatment, it smelled so sweet and delicious! It made me want to keep applying to my lips. It immediately made my lips soft and moisturized and left the cutest color over my lips. I’m glad the color is buildable and gives a sheer tint to my lips. 24 hour hydration is also a plus! I love the size to carry everywhere with me! You definitely need this in your lip collection.
