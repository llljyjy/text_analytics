I really like this product! It is a mix between a lip balm and a lip tint almost. It is not super pigmented like a lipstick but it gives your lips a nice moisturized color and sheen. It’s one of those products you can apply without a mirror. It made it to my purse right away. I can’t wait to keep using it. Definitely a purse essential!
