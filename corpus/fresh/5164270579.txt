I still have my tube of og plum before they discontinued the color with a little bit of product left so I could compare it to new releases to find a dupe because it’s my favorite color and I’m so happy it’s back. The color is (still) fantastic, but the reformulation is a lil disappointing. It’s no longer SPF and it doesn’t apply quite as easily as my other pre-reformulation tubes, and it doesn’t last as long. But still one of my favorite lip products and definitely my favorite color nan
