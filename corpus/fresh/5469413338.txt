My skin does not get along with the summer whatsoever and this has been a new found love. My skin LOVES this product. It is so lightweight and hydrating! It has hyaluronic acid and niacinamide (both ingredients my skin loves) so that isa huge bonus instead of using 2 different serums to get both ingredients. My skin feels so nice, hydrated and smooth. My makeup applies so nicely on my skin now compared to how it normally applies in the summer months Miracle Product
