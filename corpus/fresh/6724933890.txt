Received this as a trial from my local sephora and so far I am enjoying this moisturizer. I find my skin is very picky as I have acne prone, oily yet needing moisture skin with my skin barrier normally chronically dead, especially in the -30 winter months. I have used this moisturizer sparingly and it absorbs well into my skin and does well under makeup; I do let my skin rest for 10min before continuing on. I love the sent and do not find it over powering at all. I would give this a try if you have a chance, so far is seeming to be a winner in my books. So far so good
