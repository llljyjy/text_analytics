I like the texture of the granules in the wash, they don’t feel very rough. On the other hand I hate the strawberry smell, it smells off, that’s the best way I can put it. It also leaves behind a weird filmy feel. Ended up finishing the bottle with using it on my body instead. Would not repurchase. Product is ehhhh.
