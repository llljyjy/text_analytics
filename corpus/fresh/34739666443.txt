I really like this Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum by Fresh. I have notice improvement. It has made my face brighter, smoother. It has reduced the appearance of fine lines, and pores. It goes on really smoothly. The only little thing I have to say is that the tea smell is a bit strong. I donâ€™t mind it, but if you are sensitive to strong smells, or you are looking for something that is fragrance-free, you know what to expect. I will continue to use it, and I do recommend it! nan
