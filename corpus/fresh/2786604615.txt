Lovely serum that feels very hydrating with a subtle but gorgeous scent. Feels a lot more hydrating than most serums I’ve tried . I know that because usually I feel the need to apply moisturizer right after I use a serum but in this case I’ve actually totally forgotten to use any moisturizer after and yet my skin feels super hydrated! Great product! nan
