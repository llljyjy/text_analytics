I have owned one of these before (in the shade Tulip) and the formula of this was much stiffer, and seems less prone to melting. Itâ€™s less buttery but more durable which is good. The shade is lovely - a mix between coral and poppy red. I am really loving it so far! Gifted by Fresh. Beautiful for everyday
