I have dry skin and bought this cream last year when fresh products were on sale and it’s become my holy grail!! It is very moisturizing but doesn’t feel greasy at all. I’ve used protini from DE religiously before this but I like this way more. I recently was using retinol and had dry patches all over my face. This was the only moisturizer that totally calmed my skin and got rid of my dry areas. I love it so much I’ve bought 3 backups! Lol. The scent is really not a big deal for me, it’s very light and kind of soothing actually. It smells just like the soy face cleanser, kinda cucumber-y. I normally use this even during the day under makeup but I recently bought the day version of this so we will see how that goes! found my holy grail
