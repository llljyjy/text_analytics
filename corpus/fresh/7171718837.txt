Almost a 5 star, I’m docking one star off because every tube I had (I’ve had many because it is a great, very hydrating product - specifically advanced therapy ones) they all got melty and warped and eventually broke. It’s like they soften overtime, and I noticed it happening over a span of a couple weeks. Not left in a hot or humid place either. I don’t know what it is about these but they look gnarly after a while. If these were jn little jars they would make more sense for the texture. That being said they last very long and are very pretty and hydrating. I would still recommend. Good but a little messy
