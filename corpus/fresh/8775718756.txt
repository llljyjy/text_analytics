i was sent this product for free , complimentary from fresh , and was unsure if i’d like the shade peony but i absolutely love it. It does not appear on the lip as dark as it looks in the package. it’s the perfect shade for a blushed lip look and is long wearing. it resembles a tinted chapstick to me. it smells really good but it’s a faint smell which i really like. i got shade peony but it is not on here. appears lighter on lip
