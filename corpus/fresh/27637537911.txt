Works pretty well! Has a slight color to the lip treatment. The packaging is also a twist of packaging. It has a plum sand but also with a slightly citrus scent as well. Overall, I wouldn’t say it’s worse the lip tree math I think there’s better ones on the market but it’s a pretty good higher end lip balm. gifted by fresh Works well
