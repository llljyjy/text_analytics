This lip balm is so different than what I’m used to, I put it on and it actually lasts for a very long time. I’m obsessed with how it feels on, and the scent. It’s so sweet and sugary, and the pink color is so natural and gorgeous. The texture is buttery smooth and has the perfect amount of shine. My lips feel so hydrated long after applying and the color lasts just as long. The pink heavy weight packaging is so luxe, I absolutely love it too! The color is so buildable also, I have one layer on in the photo and it can build multiple shades darker with more layers. Obsessed!! Gifted by Fresh, but I just ordered 2 other colors and the clear because I love it that much. Perfect Pink Balm!
