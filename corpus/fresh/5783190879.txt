I have oily skin, but this winter I’ve been getting the worst dryness & adult acne of my life. This moisturizer has helped soooo much. It’s very hydrating but absorbs really nicely into my skin and has helped so much in getting my skin back on track. I don’t think I can use it over the summer months but it’s perfect to combat the extremely dry environment in my apartment over the winter. nan
