The Fresh Floral Recovery Mask is a must have if you have unwanted redness or are experiencing some irritation.  It has a very light floral scent and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It dries on lightweight and still breathable while the ingredients get to work. There are a few brightening ingredients such as Ascorbyl Glucoside (a stable form of Vitamin C) and there are also anti-aging ingredients such as Vitamin E. Not to mention the Passionflower Oil and Cornflower Oil to reduce that redness, Peony and Cherry Blossom Extracts to even skin tone, and Squalene to smooth and balance the skin. I always wake with much smoother, hydrated, and overall brighter skin. It has been a nice addition to my evening routine. Gentle and Hydrating
