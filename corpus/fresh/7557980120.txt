This product was recommended to me by an employee. I do regret buying this. The eye cream is one of the most expensive I ever bought. For this price I thought I would see a huge difference within 2 weeks. I see no difference in the eye area at all. The product is not thick so that’s a good thing when you are wearing it under makeup. I would not buy this again it’s too overpriced with no benefit to the eye area. Not worth the money
