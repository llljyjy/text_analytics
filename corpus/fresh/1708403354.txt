I like this lip balm.  I tried it many years ago and think that the color is very pretty. I will say that I wish they brought the old formula back with SPF 15. It’s was more hydrating and pigmented than the reformed version but if you want something lightweight with buildable coverage this is great and I’ll continue to use it.*Gifted by fresh beauty Meh
