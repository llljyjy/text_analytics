This moisturizer is a little thicker in consistency, but thins out a lot upon application - it’s reminiscent of a water-based moisturizer. The scent is a little strong; it smells sweet, earthy, and a little like pine. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave the skin looking or feeling greasy.  (Gifted by Fresh.) nan
