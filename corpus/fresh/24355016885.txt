I have been using this product for several weeks now and it has made a huge change in my skin tone and condition. I have extremely sensitive skin and also during the winter months it is extremely dry. I have been using this mask as a moisturizer, I know that you are supposed to leave it overnight, but since the cold in Illinois is no joke and the skin of my face was practically screaming every time I left the house, I decided to use it as a daily moisturizer and night cream and OH MY GOD, it has been the best decision I have ever made. This evened out my skin tone, the fine lines from my forehead feel less deep and the redness is almost gone. My husband even started complementing the look of my skin. Best product for dry sensitive skin.
