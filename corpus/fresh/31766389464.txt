Gifted by Fresh in exchanged for my honest review. This lip balm is very hydrating and made my lips feel soft after applying. It did not feel sticky or heavy on my lips but still allowed my lips to receive a nice, soft tint. It smells very pleasing and the pink shade is buildable, you can apply more and the pigment will show more on your lips. Nice size that is great for on-the-go application. The ingredients list is great! Love you this balm
