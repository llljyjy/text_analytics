Like all fresh products this smells great, feels lovely. However, it doesn’t remove foundation. Interestingly I don’t think the bottle says make up remover, but the description in the title on the website does…. I bought the large bottle on sale cause it was a great deal but now it’s a bit of a waste.  After using, I still need to use micellear water to remove foundation.  I’d return,But bought it online and store is never very nice when I return an online purchase so it will probably just sit on my vanity smells and feels nice, but not a make up remover
