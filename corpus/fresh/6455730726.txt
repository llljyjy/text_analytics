Really like the feel of this Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum on my face, doesn’t feel oily. Does an excellent job of keeping my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout the day.The smell is great and it’s easy to apply. I’ve used several products from this brand and like them all. I highly recommend this. nan
