I was gifted by Fresh and it is perfect for chapstick lovers. Chapstick can be boring and for those who want that extra boost, I would go with this lip treatment. It’s nourishing and moisturizing without being too thick or really sticky. It rolls on easily and doesn’t stain your lips too much. You can wipe it off after a long day and be fine. I loved the color it turned my lips, it looked really natural and really elevated my ‘clean girl’ look! nan
