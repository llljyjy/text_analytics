This calming floral mask is perfect for the drier winter months! I have combination but mostly oily skin, so it’s a fine line on what thicker creams I can use that soak into my skin and don’t cause additional breakouts. This left me feeling hydrated and smooth in the morning, and didn’t cause any pimples or clogged pores. A win win in my book!! Overnight calming mask!
