This cream has a whipped, rich, creamy consistency.  If you turn the tub upside down, the cream will not slide out and thatâ€™s how thick it is! Ive been using  this as a heavier winter moisturizer when my skin is dry. I think it would be too much for the summer. The fragrance is very low on the ingredient list but is VERY STRONG in the product, they need to take it out entirely or cute it down by like 90% because it hits you when you open the jar. complimentary from Fresh a LOT of fragrance
