Iâ€™ve always been impressed with fresh lip treatments and have quite s few different variations. Papaya is a bright coral color in the tube but goes on with a sheer wash that hydrates and nourishes my lips. It also has a subtle fruity scent that I find to be nice and not overpowering in any way. *gifted by Fresh in exchange for my opinion* Sheer pop of color
