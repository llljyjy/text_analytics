I bought the new formulation because I loved the old one, but it is nowhere near as good as the old formula. It feels like any basic lip balm you can buy at the drugstore. There is no soft, velvety feel that the old one used to have that was my favorite part of the lip balm. The smell is also very reduced. I am very disappointed. nan
