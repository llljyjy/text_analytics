I have been applying a few drops on my skin two times a day (morning and night) and have seen such a glow up in my skin!! My skin looks so much more healthier and plump, especially in my dehydrated areas near my mouth, nose, and between my brows. The texture is lightweight and feels good on the skin, coming from someone who has oily skin. I attached before and after photos after using this serum for 4 weeks. Powerhouse serum!
