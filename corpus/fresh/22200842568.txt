i love this serum.  it gave my skin a natural glowy look right after using.  it smells pretty good but it does seem to have a significant amount of fragrance, so if your skin is sensitive to fragrance in skincare then this may not be for you.  otherwise i really like this serum and how it immediately made my skin glow. gives a nice dewy glow
