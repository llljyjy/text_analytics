It comes in a beautiful green glass dropper bottle, love the packaging. Has a milky texture that quickly absorbs into the skin. Doesn’t feels heavy, greasy, or oily. The formula is gentle on the skin and doesn’t give me breakouts or redness. After using this skin looks fresh, soft, smooth, and nourished. It’s been a few days of using this and I can see that it improving my skin texture. So far I am enjoying this and will keep using it for long-term results!! Lovely Serum
