The color is beautiful on me, feels moisturizing and smooth on my lips and it’s easy to forget this isn’t a lipstick The color can be light/ sheer or you can build it up to be more vibrant which makes it look like a vibrant lipstick while you are actually wearing a lip treatment to soften your lips. Has vitamins to protect lips and oils to smooth and hydrate! I would definitely pick up more of these colors for myself beautiful and multi functional as it can go with my makeup looks as my lippie for the day while also being a treatment for my lips! I received this complimentary from Fresh and I recommend checking this product out in the color you like the most so you can wear it everyday. Beautiful/Hydrating/Comfortable
