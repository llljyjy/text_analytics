This serum is so hydrating and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and nourished. After continued use, it absolutely made my skin feel smoother and reduced my pores. I donâ€™t have an astronomical amount of large pores, but I did notice a difference with the minimal amount I have. Also leaves skin beautifully radiant and not greasy. nan
