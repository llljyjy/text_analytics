I love using this overnight mask when my skin feels like it is dry and needs a “reset”. The mask is an overnight mask is the texture is thicker. I love how moisturizing it is! My skin is dry and acne prone so this has done wonders for me. I do have sensitive skin and I have not seen an irritation.  I love how light the scent is! nan
