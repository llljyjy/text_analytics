I was so pleased with the packaging of the serum comes. It’s such a gorgeous dark teal bottle! The formula looks like a gel like milk.  It smells like tea and pine to me. I think it’s a very soothing aroma. It applies very effortlessly and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. I have applying it at night and in the morning after showering. It makes my skin feel radiant and healthy. It's so soothing and pampering on the skin.
