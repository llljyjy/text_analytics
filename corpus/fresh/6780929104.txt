This Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment gifted to me by Fresh in the shade Peony, was the first product from this company I have tried and I am hooked! This shade is so perfect and the amount of color is buildable so it can be subtle or more dramatic if you want. Plus it is so light and feels just like my favorite lip balm- so hydrating! buildable and hydrating!
