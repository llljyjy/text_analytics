Obsessed with the texture of this mask! My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone, therefore I don’t leave it overnight. I usually apply it before bed, leave it on for 10-15 minutes, and then I rinse it off. The next day my skin feels so soft and smooth, and it looks so radiant, the mask rehydrates the skin really well, it’s the best feeling ever. I’ll be repurchasing this mask for sure. This product was received for free my skin feels so soft!
