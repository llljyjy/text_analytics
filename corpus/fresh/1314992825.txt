I am a huge fan of Fresh and was so excited when I got to try the new gifted by Fresh Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum and it’s amazing! This serum has a very lightweight formula that I applied morning and night that absorbs quickly into my skin. I have slight fine lines and am also trying to prevent further aging so this serum is just perfect, working to diminish my fine lines and fight the aging process, even plumping skin. My skin feels smoother and has more bounce to it too. It not only does this but my pores are more refined too. It’s also really hydrating and I feel my skin just soaks this serum in and loves it! Perfect for fine lines
