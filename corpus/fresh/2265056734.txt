The product has a pretty strong scent which is concerning for me since harsh scents break me out, so far this has not happened and I will continue to use it to see if it will. I like how the product is thin and feels light on the skin. I like to use this at night even though it is fine to use during the day too. I have used this for a week so far and I can say that it has definitely made my skin look more supple and hydrated. I am excited to continue using this product It is nice
