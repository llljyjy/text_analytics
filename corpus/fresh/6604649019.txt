Upon return from a 12 days vacation at hot and humid location, my skin doesn’t look too happy.  It looks dull, lack hydration and bounciness.  The new Fresh serum has a light refreshing tea scent.  After toner application, warming the milky texturize serum on my palm to activate the ingredients, I press the serum on my face and neck.  My full dehydrated skin absorb it immediately.  I can feel the immediate relief.  I can see improvements in my skin texture in only a few days.  The subtle glow makes my skin look rejuvenated.  I’m so happy I can feel more bounciness on my skin.  Great product! nan
