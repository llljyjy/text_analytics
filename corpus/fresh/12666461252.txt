This overnight mask is luscious and thick! I used it as a normal sleeping mask; instead of layering it on thick for 5-10 minutes and then rubbing in the excess, I just used a liberal amount and rubbed it in. The next morning, my skin was soft, supple, and well hydrated. I am a big fan of this, and you can definitely use it on top of a normal moisturizer. In terms of scent, it smells like your average “lotion“ or “cream“ without putting any essential oils or anything. I would recommend it! Excellent Moisturization Overnight
