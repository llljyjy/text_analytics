I use this as a quick mask instead of my moisturizer on days that Iâ€™m feeling a extra red and dry. The formula is a little thick but I like it. I normally put on a generous amount, wait for 10-15min, then massage in the excess. I love this mask because it immediately makes my skin brighter, smoother, and less dry. Would recommend to everyone! :) Would recommend!
