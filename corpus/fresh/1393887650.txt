Let’s start by acknowledging how beautiful the packaging looks. Packaging is a turquoise dropper bottle, and true to the Fresh brand, it looks luxurious. The texture is sort of milky, and my skin seems to absorb it immediately, leaving a hydrated finish that is velvety and not sticky. Since I just started this, I can’t comment on the wrinkle, texture or resilience improvement, but since it contains ingredients like ceramides and niacinamide, I’m hopeful that it will do what it calms in time. What would make this product better is if they used a air tight bottle with a pump instead of a dropper… nan
