Ive been using this serum for about two weeks now and iâ€™ve seen a difference in the dullness of my face, wrinkles, and plumpness. It smells amazing it has the best subtle tea scent. I use it mainly at night and make sure to layer a moisturizing toner with a nice moisturizer and I wake up with the best skin. My before and after are here too! nan
