Fresh lip balms are my all time favorite lip hydrating products. I have both regular and the spf ones in my bag and all over the house so that I can use them whenever my lip feels dry. It’s so hydrating that I don’t need to reapply often. I also love the tint color that it gives, so that I don’t have pale lips when I go out without makeups on. One thing is the packaging, if I wasn’t careful and turned it up too much, sometimes it breaks easily. Other than that, an awesome tinted lip balm to have all year round. Lip balm that lives in my bag
