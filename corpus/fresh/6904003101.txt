I love using this eye cream. It feels and smells amazing (I don’t mind fragrance in skincare). It’s lightweight so it doesn’t make the area around my eyes feel oily but it’s still hydrating. I find it helps somewhat with darkness around the eyes but mine are due to tiredness and puffiness rather than hereditary dark circles so I don’t know how it would work on somebody who has bigger issues with darkness.Using this eye cream is a very luxurious feeling which is mainly why I like it. I feel like if you had more specific concerns then there are probably better options out there that are more targeted. If you just need a nice feeling eye cream that works well under makeup and all around has a nice experience, then I would recommend. nan
