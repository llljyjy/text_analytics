I’m in my mid-40s, live in Wisconsin in harsh weather, have combination, often very dry, sensitive skin, and have had rosacea for ten years. Several years ago I used the mini size of this product and couldn’t believe the change in my skin, but didn’t buy the full size because of the price. Fast forward to now and trying another mini to see if it was as good as I remembered. I’m sold. My skin had been so red, dry, bumpy, and irritated recently, and what a difference this has made. I’ve been reminded again why I loved this moisturizer so much the first time around. So much so that I’ve now purchased the full size. A tiny amount goes a long way, no need to slather it on. My face has never felt softer or more soothed and hydrated than when I use this product. My rosacea has even improved. I put it on every night before bed. The formula is lightweight, nourishing, and not greasy. No other moisturizer I’ve used has come close to helping my skin as much as this has. If you’re on the fence, at least give the mini a try. Hands down the best I’ve used
