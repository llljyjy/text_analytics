I knew I loved this serum after two applications. I applied it at night before bed and again in the morning. My skin was so plump and glowy, I couldn’t believe it! Every time I use this serum it makes my skin look happy and healthy. The serum isn’t drying or irritating in any way. I’m so excited to reap the long term benefits of this one!  I love that this serum is designed to improve the resilience of the skin- that’s so cool.The texture is a milky, thick serum. It applies nicely and sinks in really quickly. It does have a somewhat strong herbal scent, but I enjoy it. The packaging is sturdy glass and the dropper controls how much product is dispensed so you don’t need to worry about getting too much. Everything is very thoughtfully designed.I took one star off because the price is pretty significant- as much as I love what this does, I’m not convinced it’s worth the price tag. Incredible formula!
