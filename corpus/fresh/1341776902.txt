I really like this lip balm, and prefer it to the Laneige lip sleeping mask.  The Laneige one won’t wash off my drinking glasses, and I find that after consistent use the outside of my lips gets dry and irritated.  This lip balm is easy to clean off glassware but also stays on my lips all night while I sleep. I don’t have lip peeling anymore. nan
