I know it takes a while to see results from many skin products, but I feel like I genuinely did see results from this serum. I used it every night and day for 9 days. Yes, this is a shorter period of time so I don’t have an in depth full analysis, but from just these 9 days, I’ve noticed more hydrated, bouncier, and clear skin. It applies very nicely and easily. I would probably compare it to a face milk in terms of texture. It also has a scent which is probably a bit added fragrance but also normal of the ingredients, so that is something to be aware of. All in all, Im excited to see results a month from now since what I’ve seen in such a short period is so promising! nan
