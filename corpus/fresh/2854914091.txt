Gifted by Fresh. I recently started using fresh tea tree serum for my textured skin and I must say that I am impressed so far.  I have been using as directed every morning and evening and while I havenâ€™t yet seen a tremendous change, I love the way it smells and feels.  I am not sure if it layers well under makeup but as a standalone product I enjoy it. It also has tea tree which I know does wonders for the skin.  I will report back in a few weeks if I notice significant changes to my texture but so far so good! Textured skin
