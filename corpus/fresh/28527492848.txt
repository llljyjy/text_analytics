I have been really enjoying fresh tea elixir! I really like how it has been helping me combat the texture on my skin. It does help my skin look less oily and I really enjoy that it is help improve the appearance of my dark spots as well!!! The consistency can be a little milky and frothy and it helps to really hydrate my skin! Itâ€™s definitely worth a try Worth it!
