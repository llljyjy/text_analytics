I have been a fan of Fresh lip balms for years (back to highschool over ten years ago) and have have tried many colors/flavors. The rose is a classic one! The color is not as intimidating as it may look in the tube. It goes on pretty sheer, but leaves a pretty pink tint to give your lips some color. They are hydrating and also smell so good! I received this product complimentary from Fresh Beauty in exchange for my honest review. Tried and true!
