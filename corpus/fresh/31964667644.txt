I rarely write reviews and I must say, I thought I’d regret it when I ordered this serum on a whim when I saw it on sale. But my gosh, it’s SO GOOD. I have really dry skin and it really SLURPS up any product I might put on it but this leaves my skin so wonderfully moisturized that I would say it might even be moisturizing enough without a lotion/cream on top and that has NEVER happened for my skin. I am definitely going to be getting this after my bottle is over and I anticipate this bottle to last for a long while. AMAZING.
