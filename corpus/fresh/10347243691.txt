This serum is amazing but then again, I never tried any fresh products that I never liked. The serum is creamy but lightweight and gentle on my skin. I can feel the cooling sensation as I apply it on my skin. After a few days of using it I can tell my skin got softer and plumper and my pores got smaller.Another thing I like about this is the color of the bottle. It’s so beautiful and I like displaying it on my vanity. Cons : The packaging box arrived broken. I’m glad the bottle is not just beautiful, but also sturdy. That’s why It is still full when I received it. Other than that, this product is amazing. Awesome product
