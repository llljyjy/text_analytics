So far I’m really enjoying this. First, the packing is super nice and comes in a glass container. The smell wasn’t the best but given the name it makes sense. It does smell like tea but once applied it’s not overwhelming. It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized. I can’t wait to see the results after using longer Good
