I’ve been using this product for maybe a year and a half now. And it does pill which I hate but the way around it is to allow the products to dry if your using serums and then apply it. I am upset that they’re making the size smaller than the 100 ml that it use to be for that price. I now need another summer moisturizer that is within size for the amount of money nan
