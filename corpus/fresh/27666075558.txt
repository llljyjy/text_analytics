I been a fan of fresh products for years.  This Black Tea Age Renewal Cream Review is amazing. The texture, the smell, the ingredients of this cream are truly great. I’m super picky what I put on my skin but after researching the ingredients of this product I feel very confident about it. I use this daily and it blends nicely into my skin, it does not irritate my face some some products out there, it keeps my face super hydrated and soft. My skin gets super dry in the colder months so this is the perfect cream for me right now. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who’s looking for an amazing face cream.
