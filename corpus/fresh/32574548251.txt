It has a nice milky texture that is lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. Also, it hasn’t caused any irritation so far. However, I don’t like that it contains fragrance, and I haven’t seen any difference in my skin yet. I also think that it’s overpriced. Gifted by Fresh. nan
