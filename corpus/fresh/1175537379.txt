Was recommended to me from a salesperson at Sephora.  I tried it and wow! Besides the beautiful smell it leaves, I love how my skin feels afterwards.  I use it in the am and pm after I wash my face and before my moisturizer.  I also didnâ€™t want anything too harsh like retinol as my skin is sensitive Great serum for sensitive skin
