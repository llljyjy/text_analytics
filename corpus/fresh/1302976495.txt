I have recommended this moisturizer and have repurchased this cleanser several times and it really is a great addition to my skincare routine. In the morning, it cleanses very gently removing any residue from night creams. At night, I use a cleaning oil before this cleanser. It does remove makeup, even mascara, but I like to use another step to remove all the makeup efficiently. Skin never feels tight after this cleanser, just balanced and clean. nan
