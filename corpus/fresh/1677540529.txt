I had hopes with the Cream, my skin is combination ( normal and dry ) first couple of days it felt great, i normally use it twice a day ( morning and night ) but i noticed my skin extra dry, flaky to the point it hurts . i donâ€™t think this deep cream provides as much Hydration as i was expecting, in the contraire its making it worse nan
