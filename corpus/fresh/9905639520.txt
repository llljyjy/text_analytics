This product is amazing! I have been trying to find a clean moisturizer that will help with my severe dry skin and won’t irritate my sensitive skin. I got a sample with my last Sephora order and from just using it twice it has already cleared up my dryness. Plus, my face has never felt so soft. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive for 50ml but if your willing to splurge this is the product for hydration. Unbelievably hydrating!!!
