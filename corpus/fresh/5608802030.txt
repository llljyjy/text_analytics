I received this Floral Recovery Calming Mask recently I am so happy I gave it a try! This mask soothed my irritated skin and left my face feeling calm.  It also left my skin feeling hydrated and visibly brighter.  The mask smells very relaxing and make me feel like I was at a spa. The packaging is also quite pretty and I love having it on my vanity. I would totally recommend this product! Calming and soothing
