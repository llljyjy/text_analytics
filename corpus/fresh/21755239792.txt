Bought this recently and am nearly finished with it. It smells nice and goes on smooth, but kind of just sits on top of my lips for a bit and then dries out, leaving my lips just as dry as they were before. I’ve had to apply it so many times each day that I used it up very quickly. I want to try their other lip balms, so I hope they’re better than this. Leaves lips dry, smells nice but not worth it
