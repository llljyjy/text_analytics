Fresh does it again! Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of the products in their Rose line and this moisturizer is no exception. The texture is creamy yet lightweight and provides for serious hydration (72 hours worth!) Love that it makes my skin plump and dewy constantly, with the time release technology. Definitely worth giving this one a try. nan
