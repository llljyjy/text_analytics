Fresh gifted me their Sugar Lip Balm in Rose shade.. Lip balm is not only part of my skincare routine but part of my everyday life.. I have a dry lips, living in dry and hot state here in Arizona.. Im using lip balm 6-10 times a day to moisturized my lips.. But using this sugar lip balm by fresh I can use it in just few times a day coz my lips stays hydrated long enough than my old brand..  I also like that it comes in buildable shade so that I can hide the pale color of my lips.. My lips are not only hydrated but also softer, looks healthy and kissable.. Love this lip balm
