I absolutely love how nourishing yet lightweight this moisturizer feels. My combo skin absorbs it immediately and doesn’t feel greasy or sticky. It makes my skin silky soft and radiant! I also love beautiful fresh cut rose scent - it’s pretty intense but not overpowering. I’m in love! Transformed my skin!
