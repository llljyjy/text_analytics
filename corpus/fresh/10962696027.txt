Gifted by Fresh. I usually hate using lip color because it ends up becoming flaky on my lips and I hate the consistency. I really liked this product because it was hydrating (like a lip balm) and had a nice natural looking lip color. Definitely recommend for my low maintenance gals. Hydrating and buildable color
