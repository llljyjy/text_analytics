I’ve been testing this Floral Recover Masks for a few weeks now and I love how it makes my skin look in the morning! My skin definitely looks more radiant, it’s effective. I’m not overly a huge fan of the texture it’s kind of hard to blend it but I’m thinking it because it’s a overnight mask, my skin felt slightly tingling after application also but just minor preferences. Overall I like it! Can definitely see the glow in the morning
