This is my second time buying this lip mask, I bought it after I used Laneige and needed something new. First tub was amazing and literally life changing. When I repurchased, it seems like this formula is totally different…It’s not as smooth and it’s really gritty? Not sure, maybe just a bad batch. Overall, decent, but I find myself reaching for Ilia lip mask and Laneige over this one. Good but new formula?
