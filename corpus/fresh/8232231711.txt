I’ve been loving the serum so far, I don’t mind the smell although it may come off too strong for some people. It doesn’t leave my skin oily as it absorbs right into my skin and it is very hydrating. In the last 2 weeks of using it, I noticed that my overall skin complexion has improved, and looking a little more plump than normal. However, the only downfall I find is that the dropper doesn’t pick up a lot of the product so I found myself having to go in a few times to get enough product to use on my face. The price point is a little steep for most people but it is packed with a lot of great ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. I would suggest really looking to see if these are the ingredients best suited for your skin concerns before purchasing! *Gifted by Fresh for my honest feedback Great serum packed with amazing ingredients!
