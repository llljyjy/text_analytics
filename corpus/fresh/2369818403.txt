This is one of the first Fresh products I have tried, and I am impressed. I have been using it for a handful of days now and I do feel like it has helped my skin. The texture of my skin appears to have gotten better. The only thing I donâ€™t love about this product is it does have Kelp Extract which can be known to clog pores so that does worry me slightly. I will continue to use it and monitor how my skin reacts. So far though, I have really liked it and I do feel that it is doing what it says it does! nan
