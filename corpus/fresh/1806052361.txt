Very disappointed. I had also purchased a mini version of this product (as you may see with a lot of the negative reviews) and absolutely fell head over heels in love with it. The smell, texture, and smoothness were amazing. The full-size version was a completely different story. This stuff pills like crazy and isn’t as moisturizing or luxurious feeling as the sample. I’ve tried everything to prevent this, but it consistently happens. I love all the other Fresh products and really loved the mini version of this cream...but something is off about the large one. I would not recommend. It's a "no" for me- Pills like crazy
