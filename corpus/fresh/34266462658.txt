This moisturizer caused a massive amount of pilling. I don’t understand all the positive reviews. I eliminated my other products because I thought the pilling could be caused by them not mixing well with my other products. That wasn’t it; I still had pilling. I already exfoliate twice a week, so it wasn’t a lack of exfoliation problem. I quit using it and the pilling stopped. Prepare for Lots of Pilling!
