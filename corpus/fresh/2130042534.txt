This is my new favorite serum, hands down. I absolutely love this formula from Fresh, which feels light yet deeply hydrating at the same time. It smells so clean and lovely; it has made a welcome addition to my evening skincare routine. The elixir contains niacinamide and hyaluronic acid: two of my fav skincare ingredients. The results speak for themselves; my skin looks refreshed, dewy, smooth and glowing. Obsessed!!! New favorite serum!
