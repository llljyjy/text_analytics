So far I’m really enjoying this serum. I love the color and feel of the glass bottle and the dropper is nice as well. The serum is milky and doesn’t leave my face sticky. There is a green tea scent but it doesn’t bother me. Been using morning and night and my skin feels hydrated and glowy! Love that longer term use should help with fine lines & wrinkles. Worth it!
