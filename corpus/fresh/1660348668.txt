Meh. Definitely not a Dior dupe, it does smell similar. It does not give a dewy, smooth look like Dior. It’s pink tinted but goes on clear. It’s kind of hard/ too solid in the jar. It goes on sticky and gets stickier- personally that’s not my favorite. It’s fine, it’s not great. I like the smell but it does fade pretty quickly. it’s ok.
