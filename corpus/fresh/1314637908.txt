After using this cream for just a few days, my rosacea flared up for the first time in a long time.  I also found that this cream is not that well absorbed into my skin and pills under make-up.  This is the first time I’ve experienced this kind of problem.  Also, the scent was more like cucumber than rose.  I will not be buying this again.  I’m going back to Skin Fix. A disappointing experience
