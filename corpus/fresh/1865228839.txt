This has quickly become my go-to lip mask. I find it far more hydrating and less sticky than Laneige, and love that the ingredients are clean. The mask has a slight but pleasant vanilla smell, and the formula perfectly sinks into your lips overnight, leaving you with zero residue or chapping! For a few more dollars, this is totally worth it. Better than Laneige!
