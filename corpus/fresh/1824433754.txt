Love this moisturizer for my skin type, which is normal and mid 30s. I love all of fresh products actually! Ok let me just say as a medical aesthetician, if you have ance prone skin or problematic skin in general go get a proper cosmeceutical product for your skin issues. Don’t buy anti aging products from Sephora and then write bad reviews because it broke you out. The product didn’t do it, your skin has issues period and you need to seek professional help getting it in check. nan
