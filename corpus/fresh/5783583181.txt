I am a big fan of Fresh Beauty and I was so excited when I found out that they are launching a new product. The Tea Elixir comes in a beautiful turquoise sturdy glass bottle with a pipette dropper. The texture is lightweight and my skin absorbs it right away. There is definitely a noticeable tea smell which I don’t mind as I don’t get irritated. I like that my skin feels smoother and hydrated and it fits well into my skincare routine. I am really looking forward to use this product for a longer period of times so I can see it at full potential. Excited for this Serum
