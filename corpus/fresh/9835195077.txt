I love lip products so when I was gifted their sugar lip balm in rose complimentary from Fresh I was thrilled! I love how smooth this appleis to my lips and it keeps them healthy and hydrated no matter the time of year. I also adore the buildable color, one swipe gives a nice rosy tint or you can build for a more vava voom pout! Great lip balm
