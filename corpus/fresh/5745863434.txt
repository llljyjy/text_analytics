This serum is soooo good! I love how fresh it smells and how lightweight it feels on my skin. It rubs in nicely and absorbs fast so it’s a good layering serum. I’ve found that my skin is much smoother since incorporating this product into my routine. My only complaint is that the dropper doesn’t work very well and I have to dip/squeeze it a few times in the bottle to get the right amount of product out. I’m not sure if it’s just a defect of my bottle or all of them. I have sensitive/acne-prone skin and I think this is an amazing addition to my skincare routine! I want to bathe in this serum
