10 years ago when I bought this, I hated it. It was super mushy, and I hated the feeling. I love this new version! It is firmer and easier to apply. The color payoff is great, and it is moisturizing. I love the Honey color. This is my new go-to…so much so that I’m now using it in place of my Lisa Eldridge lipsticks. I love those but wanted something more natural-looking and hydrating, and this reformulated Fresh balm fits the bill perfectly. Please don’t go back to the old version! Love this reformulation!
