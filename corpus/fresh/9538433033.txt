This is a beautiful milky serum that leaves my skin feeling super soft right after application. I like the texture a lot, and I feel like it definitely hydrates skin nicely. It also has worked really well along with my retinol routine where it helps with any irritation Im having. It makes sense since the hyaluronic acid and ceramides help strengthen the skin barrier. Love it! Beautiful milky serum
