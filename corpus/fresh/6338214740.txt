This is a luxurious lip balm that does it all.Soothes parched lips, hydrates your lips for several hours, lasts through a few sips of a beverage, add a slight natural glow, and only takes a small amount of balm per application. The scent is mild which is great for those of us who get a migraine as a result of a powerful scent. Large amount for a very fair price. It healed my moderate flaky and parched lips after 2 applications. Luxurious lip balm that does it all.
