i have extremely sensitive skin and recently i’ve been dealing with closed comedones and breakouts due to using harsh exfoliants to try to get rid of said breakouts. after looking for a cleanser that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, i tried this one and i was truly amazed. literally after the first time using, half of my breakouts were visibly smaller and my skin felt smoothed and didn’t feel stripped at all like previous cleansers. 100% worth the money fixed my skin
