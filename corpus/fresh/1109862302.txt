The scent of this mask is divine. A wonderful sweet lemony black tea, I loved having this on my face, but sadly this broke me out and irritated my skin. I am not sure if it was some sort of allergic reaction.If you like masks and tea try this out, but maybe patch test first. smells divine, but broke me out :(
