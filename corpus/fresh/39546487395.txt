I have been using the Fresh tea elixir serum for a week now morning and night. I love the way it glides onto my skin and the silky, not greasy feeling it leaves behind. The smell makes me crave a cup of tea every time, it is such a light natural scent. I noticed almost immediately how my skin had a glow to it. I like how my skin looks smoother and my wrinkles donâ€™t look as bad either! I wore this with and without makeup and felt my makeup went on better. love the glow it gave me!
