Yes, yes, yes! As soon as I saw this product I was excited to try it. First of all, I absolutely love the product name. It also contains several of my favorite skincare ingredients, niacinamide, ceramide, and hyaluronic acid, which I have all different serums for, but this is the perfect serum that includes all of them! I would need to use this longer to speak to its long-term effects, but I have great first impressions already. It feels so great to apply, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. I canâ€™t wait to continue using this! nan
