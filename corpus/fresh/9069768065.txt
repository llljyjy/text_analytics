(Gifted by Fresh)Firstly this lip treatment comes in a beautiful sturdy packaging that won’t accidentally open up inside your bag. The closure is very secure. Second, the scent of the product is nice although i prefer more sweet scents in a lip balm while this one has a hint of fruity flavor but also slightly floral. The actual formula is very comfortable and smooth. It gives a sheer bit buildable color to the lips and looks very flattering. My lips feel hydrated and juicy while wearing it. I really enjoy the shade Peony which is like a berry toned mauve. I’ve always wanted to try these lip treatments and I’m glad I finally got to do so! I’m very impressed with this product! Just as great as I expected!
