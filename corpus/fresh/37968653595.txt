I received this product complimentary from Fresh Beauty in exchange for my honest review. I have tried the other products in the Black Tea line before and this Age Renewal Cream doesn’t disappoint. It is very creamy and provides my skin instant hydration. I use this as the last step of my skincare routine, and it absorbs nicely into my skin. Doesn’t leave any stickiness. My skin feels soft and smooth.  The key ingredients include BT Matrix TM, which is a retinol like blend; Ceramide NP and Squalane. All of these ingredients nourish the skin, hydrates and strengthen the skin barrier. The weather is very dry now, and this is a perfect moisturizer for winter time. hydrating
