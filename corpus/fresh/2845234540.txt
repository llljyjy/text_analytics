I got this as a rewards trial size and loved it so much, I’m now the owner of a full size. It’s extremely light weight yet hydrating. I took it on vacation where I got pretty sunburnt on my face and it literally saved my skin barrier. I use it every night now and even sometimes during the day if I’m feeling like I need more moisture. I don’t break out and I have sensitive skin. The scent is really nice too! nan
