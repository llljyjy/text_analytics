I’ve used this serum at night for the last week and I’m loving the results so far! My skin immediately feels plump and hydrated and looks super glowy and dewy. After a few days of use I noticed my skin felt softer than usual. I also love the clean scent of the product - it feels like something you’d experience while getting a facial. Can’t wait to keep an eye on the longer term results! nan
