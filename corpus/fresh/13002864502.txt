i received a sample size of this moisturizer over two years ago and it works great as a nighttime moisturizer or without any other product layering. however, when using it with my other products (charlotte tilbury flawless filter or glossier skincare or other pretty mainstream brands) there’s such intense pilling that i have to reserve this for solely nighttime moisturizing. super unfortunate because it’s a thick moisturizing cream on its own. ): beware of pilling!
