I got the lip balm ICON, which is a red one. I have a warm neutral undertone and find it a little bit hard to wear the lip balm without makeup just because I have a yellow undertone wearing a red lip balm. Besides the color, I think the packing is ready to close and open, especially for the one who has disabitilies and finds it hard to open a lipstick, which is my friendâ€™s case. The moisture that it gives to the lips is unreal because I had bad dry lips before getting it and now my lips are fully recovered and not dry anymore.* gifted by Fresh it really moisturize the lips
