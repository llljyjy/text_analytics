I own a few lip balms by Fresh but I must say this shade has become my favorite. I love that the color is buildable and of course, the nourishing benefits. My lips feel very hydrated! I love to keep it in my purse to reapply throughout the day. This plum shade is like a light blackberry and in my opinion it suits everyone. This was kindly gifted by Fresh. Purse Essential
