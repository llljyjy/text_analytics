I really like the texture and anti aging properties but it is not suitable for day use because the cream doesn’t fully absorb and can pill if you rub your eyes. Otherwise it has a nice cooling effect and gentle smell. Definitely still try it if the rubbing off doesn’t bother you. great cream but pills
