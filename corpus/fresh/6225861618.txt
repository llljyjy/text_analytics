So this is the first time I’m trying this fresh mask from them , and it’s  a very thick moisturizer I did notice it pilled on me when it said after 10-15 rub it in. Last night was my first time using it, I expected my skin to feel very moisturized the following morning but it didn’t. Will continue to use it but so far I am not wow’d It’s ok.
