As soon as I saw this I wanted it. The ingredients sounded perfect and I love overnight masks. I’m always looking for anything that can help keep my skin hydrated, moisturized and calm. This mask does just that! You can also use this for a 10 minute rescue type mask but I just prefer to use it overnight as my moisturizer. When I use this I wake up with happy skin. Don’t be afraid of the “floral” ( I saw someone say they wouldn’t go near this because it says floral) this just refers to the floral extracts in the cream that help with redness and soothing. Also…this huge! 3.3 ounces! Beautiful <3
