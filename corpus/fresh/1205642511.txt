Tried as a single-use sample and was so impressed I bought the bigger size.  This mask smells more like fresh cucumber than rose, which I enjoy.  I can definitely feel a difference in my skin from this mask compared to other sleeping masks (laneige is my other favorite).  In the morning my skin feels dewy and plump as heck.  Luxe 2-step ritual, great effects. *chefâ€™s kiss* Favorite sleeping mask - super dewy
