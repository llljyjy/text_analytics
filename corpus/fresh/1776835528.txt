This is one of Fresh’s best serums ever. It has a super creamy texture that is very soothing on skin. It absorbs well and ever since using it I have noticed that my skin barrier is stronger and I haven’t had any sensitivity — which is great since I’m using retinol right now. Bonus points that it’s hydrating, layers well with other products, smells good, and is great under makeup. 10/10 So soothing!
