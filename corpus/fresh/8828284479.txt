I had purchased a set of the small one’s last fall and loved them. This regular size I just bought in July 2022 is different. I have a problem with lip products making my lips hurt after a few days of use and sadly this new one did that. I’m so bummed. It is a really nice natural shade and I’m sure many people will love it. New formula?
