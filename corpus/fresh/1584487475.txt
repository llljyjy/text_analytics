I tried this lip balm in the shade Peony, which is a light wash of “your lips bur better“ shade. It might lean slightly berry. It is definitely not something I would buy for the color, it is more like a nice addition to this product.The balm itself is more on the solid side, it is definitely not super balmy, but can still be applied to your lips just fine. I will say I personally need more hydration that this lip balm provides, but I consider this more of a sheer lip tint. Either way a beautiful summer product! I received this lip balm complimentary from Fresh. Beautiful sheer tint
