I recived this product as complimentary from Fresh in exchange of my honest opinion. I love products that do not cause me any breakout and this Fresh serum is one of those. It is of thick milky white consistency . It gets absorbed into the skin super well giving it a nice glow. Its packaging is cute and the dropper dispenser is the best part of it. It has a mild fragrance which dissipates soon,hence does not bother at all. Have been using it for 10+ days now and I can definitely see a lot of difference in my skin texture. Its more smooth and even toned.. I am super impressed with it and will continue to use it. Love this .
