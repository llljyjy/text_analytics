Gifted by Fresh. I’m 39 and starting to show some fine lines so I’m always on the lookout for wrinkle prevention. I appreciate this anti aging cream does NOT contain retinol as I use RX retinol and don’t want to double up. I’m also super happy this cream contains ceramides, my skin is dry so the ceramides are fantastic. It is scented but my sensitive skin has alway tolerated Fresh scents. Good for dry skin
