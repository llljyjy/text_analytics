This is a milky gel serum that does a good job of keeping my skin feeling hydrated. It feels like it prevents TEWL, which I struggle with being in a dry climate. The scent is a little off-putting for me though. It’s not strong, it’s actually quite light, but it reminds me of the chemically smell you can detect in perfumes that have expired... hard to describe, but it lingers for about 10-15 minutes after application. nan
