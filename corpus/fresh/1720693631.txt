It has a great texture and light scent. It hydrates nicely and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed overnight. It helps reduce redness, and while I don’t have a lot of redness, I did notice a reduction. I don’t necessarily have sensitive skin but this was really gentle on my skin! Love this mask. nan
