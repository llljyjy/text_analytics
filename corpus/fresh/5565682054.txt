To be honest, I was really looking forward to using this because it smelled so good in the store, even though I couldn’t sample it. For the price, I was expecting something extraordinary. Instead, it sits on top of the lips and disappears so quickly that I would reapply so many times a day. I guess I’m the unpopular opinion, but I’m a huge lip balm freak so I know what works for me. I would suggest spending your coin on something more moisturizing and long-lasting. I don't get the hype
