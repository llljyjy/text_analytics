WOW--this works, and you get a LOT of product in the container, which is beautiful. I can tell a difference the morning after I use this, with noticably more even skin tone, less redness (I even used after having a reaction to another unrelated product), and smoother texture. I do wish the scent was more floral, but it smells lovely and light. A lot for the money
