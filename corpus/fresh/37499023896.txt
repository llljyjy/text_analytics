This beautiful luxurious glass serum leaves my skin so soft, smooth, glowy and nourished. I have enjoyed using it and have seen some skin texture improvement since adding it to my routine.  I have dry skin and I can notice this serum gives me a good amount of hydration and plump right after application which I love. The consistency is milky/thick looking but it feels lightweight on the skin. The only thing I don’t like much is the smell of the serum. It’s a bit strong for my liking. Leaves skin glowy and hydrated
