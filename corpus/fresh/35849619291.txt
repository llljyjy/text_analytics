I love this lip balm! It is super hydrating and the color it leaves on my lip is super natural and brightening. I can wear this lip balm everyday or use it as a step before I apply my lip gloss for more glam/makeup looks. I have a medium skin tone and more pigmented lips, so this lip balm adds a nice touch of color without being too vibrant or a full lipstick look! This lip balm was gifted by Fresh, but I will be making a trip to Sephora to check out additional colors! nan
