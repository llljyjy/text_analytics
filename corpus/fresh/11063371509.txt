I love fresh brand and their products so when I saw this floral mask released and the good reviews on it I wanted to give it a try especially since it claimed to even out skin tone and aid in hyperpigmentation. The first time I tried this I just knew that my skin did not like it. It’s a very heavy cream and with my oily skin type my skin usually likes lighter/water based creams. The products feels like it’s just sitting on my face and not absorbing into my skin and feels very heavy on my face, besides that I have no other concern which is why I still gave it 3 stars. I will continue to use this product because it was pricey but I won’t repurchase. Not sure about this one.
