This item was gifted by Fresh in exchange for an honest review. The Fresh Beauty Sugar Lip Treatment in Papaya is good for when you want to moisturize your lips, keep them moisturized, and add a pop of color. The variation “Papaya” definitely does not refer to a scent or taste, as I detect no fragrance or flavor when I wear this. Which is not a bad thing since that keeps me from constantly licking my lips or eating the product off. The shade to me looks more like an almost cherry red as opposed to an orange, which is the color I think of when I think of papaya. It applies with a medium sheen (not too glossy). If I do not reapply the lip treatment throughout the day, the sheen dries down to a pigmented stain. Another thing I enjoy about the sugar lip treatment is the overall presentation of the packaging. It is housed in a metal case that twists on instead of a case that you pop on and off. You can securely carry this in your pocket or handbag. No need to worry about the top coming off, and the product making a mess in your pocket or your purse. nan
