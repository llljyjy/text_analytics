Starting from the formulation, look of the toner and smell to the packaging and aesthetics, this one is a winner in my books! I bought the small size to try it out and I am planning on getting the full size since I am almost out of the present bottle. I don’t use toner regularly but this product made me look forward to including toner in my skincare routine more. I have combination skin and it’s hydrating so a little goes a long-ish way. My Current Favorite Toner!
