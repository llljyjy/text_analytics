Love this lip balm! It’s pigmented and the color is buildable so you can add as much as you want. I added about three layers to see how rich I can get the color. I used the Papaya one - which is a nice coral color. I really love the formula of the balm, too. It’s instantly moisturizing while still feeling very light on my lips. I don’t even feel it and would honestly forget I put anything on! Overall, it’s an amazing lip balm and I highly recommend! Gifted by Fresh nan
