Only toner I use. I use it at night after washing my face and before all my serums and moisturizer. Then in the morning I use this instead of washing or splashing my face with water as to not to over wash face and strip the skin from its natural barrier and mess up the ph of the skin for the rest of the day. So this is the perfect toner to use in the morning. I love the smell and that it’s natural. Also I like the bottle very much. All in all I’ve been using this for years and I love it. hydration!
