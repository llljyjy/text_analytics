I really like this product.  I have very dry skin and I live in a dry climate.  There are times when a good coat of this serum relieves my skin of tightness.  It smells nice, it feels nice and it gives my skin a beautiful glow upon application.  Now, has it changed my skin or life? No, but itâ€™s a good, consistent product and provides some moisture and a good glow. Gives My Dry Skin A Nice Glow
