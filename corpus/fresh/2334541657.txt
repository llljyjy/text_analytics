This product was gifted by Fresh. Honestly, the product is not anything to be too excited about. I have used a few tinted lip balms before and this is probably my favorite so far. However, it is nothing special in my opinion. It has a nice soft tint, nothing too noticeable. It does not keep your lips moisturized like it says though. And it does have this tingling feeling when you first apply it. nan
