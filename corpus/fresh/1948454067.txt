I love the formula. It is the best lip balm I’ve ever used. My only pretty significant complaint is that the balm slides off the post soooo easily. I’ve had 3 of these and 2 of them have so far detached at about 1/2 way through even though I keep them away from heat. So now it’s a total mess in the tube. It’s super annoying. A+ formula, frustrating tube issue
