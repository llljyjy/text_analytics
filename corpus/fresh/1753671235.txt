I received the Rose Sugar Lip Balm Treatment, complimentary from Fresh. First off, the key ingredients are lovely…sugar, cranberry seed oil and grapeseed oil! Feels so moisturizing on my lips and adds such a lovely hint of color - this shade in particular looks like it enhances my natural lip color which I love for everyday wear! I just wish it wasn’t as pricey…$24 seems a bit much for a lip balm to me. Luxe lip balm
