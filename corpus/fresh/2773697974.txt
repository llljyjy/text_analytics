This serum feels really fresh and lightweight on the skin. It has a really subtle green tea scent, and a great ingredient list. Overall, I feel like the price point is really high for what this actually does for the skin. For me, itâ€™s a nice hydrating serum with a mild brightening effect (although I would have to use it longer than a week to see full results). I think at this price point, you could find something less expensive to deliver similar results, although this one is nice if you want to splurge. Nice but EXPENSIVE
