This was a nice lip mask, however it didn’t blow me away. There are some exfoliating bits in this as well but personally I would prefer something totally smooth. The consistency was kind of juicy and creamy at the same time which was very nice. I also loved the scent - like a light vanilla lemony smell. My lips felt soft and decently hydrated after using. In the morning, my lips were still soft and felt lightly hydrated even after the product was gone. It is nice to use this during the day too. If you’ve been wanting to try this, go for it, as long as you don’t mind the exfoliation. Long lasting hydration
