I’ve bought it a few times previously in an old formula and weirdly, the new one works so much better on my lips! Usually when they reformulate, they do it for worse but this doesn’t seem to be the case. I agree that the new formula is less “silky“ but now it’s finally hydrating - and the stick maintains its shape even when carried in a pocket close to body heat. I’m a picky balm lover. My lips are very dry and sensitive in winter time, and I speak a lot. Love it
