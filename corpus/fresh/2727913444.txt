Love this cleanser. Have used many times when received in sample packs and Sephora play boxes (rip). It smells like a dill pickle, no lie. If you don’t mind more “natural” or herbal scents, it won’t bother you. It is smooth, light, but effective. No tight skin after and gets the job done. Love it. A cult classic for a reason
