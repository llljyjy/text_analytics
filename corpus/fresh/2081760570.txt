If you have dry, dull skin and concerns about aging, look no further. I love how this product smells and feels. It sits so nicely on the skin and doesn’t have a greasy after texture. After using it, my skin felt plump, hydrated, and more firm. I have sensitive skin and this cream didn’t cause any issues. Plus, the product’s packaging also felt luxe— heavy and beautiful. I have been looking for an alternative to retinol, so I’m grateful to have stumbled upon this product. Gifted by Fresh Beauty, but opinions remain my own. Love the results!
