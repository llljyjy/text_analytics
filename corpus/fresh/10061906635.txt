Get it together Sephora!!! If a new product has been completely reformulated, it’s called LYING to release it under the same set of customer reviews!!! Brand has been completely reformulated, but still has tons of reviews for the hydrating SPF formula.How shady, it makes it seem like all the big brands Sephora QUIETLY allows to flip out expensive product for crappy-quality, shilling out for them over customers. I’ve seen this crap pulled too many times for it to be cute any more. Feels like I have to read reviews on ALL the products, and just as I find an HG, they’ve “redeveloped” the product without even notating the MAJOR changes from your HG.I’m DONE with this, GOODBYE FRESH. Shadyyyyy SHADYYYY
