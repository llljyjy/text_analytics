I am all about a lip balm but add in a tint and I’m even more excited. This brand always delivers in a great formulation, and I really enjoy how hydrating this balm is. It has a super nice natural tint, a mix of pink/orange. It’s perfect to have in your bag for summer & I’ll be using all summer long. Perfect for summer!
