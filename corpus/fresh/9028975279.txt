My new favorite nightly routine!! This overnight mask does have a slight scent if you’re sensitive to that, but it’s not overpowering. I always see a lot of redness in my t zone / forehead area. After about a week of over night treatments I’ve seen a more even color complexion! Highly recommend! Nightly routine!
