I love the brand but this is super overpriced lol. It’s pretty basic and you get more moisturizing with classic chapstick etc. Also not keen on the pot idea. I love the coconut scent so that’s the best part for me. Wouldn’t buy again, wanted to love but it’s only worth like $5-$10 in my opinion Pricey and basic
