I really like this serum. The smell is incredible, the texture is what I would describe as “slippery “ but the tiniest drop is enough for the entire face. It absorbs quickly, doesn’t make my skin oily. I’ve noticed a difference in my skin tone, skin texture ( more smooth) and the breakouts that I get occasionally take about 2 days to heal so I’m very happy with it. Awesome product
