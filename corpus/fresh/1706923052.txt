This lip balm is great! It’s very hydrating and really nourishes my lips for hours after application. I love the color (shade) and am impressed with how buildable it is! It’s pretty sheer when only applying 2-4 swipes but has a beautiful dusty mauve shade after building it up. It has a very light lemon scent but it doesn’t linger or taste flavored at all. So pretty!
