I love this toner! I have tried IT cosmetics and kiehls toner and I found myself breaking out. I have somewhat oily skin so I have always wanted one that would absorb it. Yet, this very hydrating toner has worked best! It smells good but isn’t over powering and it definitely helps remove leftover dirt and makeup without removing too moisture from your skin. It has also made my face feel toned and less red. I use this morning and night. I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t made me break out. nan
