Gifted by Fresh. While I love the formula of the fresh sugar lip balm I have to say I personally was not a fan on the color. I like to lather on my balms during the day and it was much dark for my personal taste since I was hoping for a natural looks for everyday. However it would be a nice replacement for lipstick. nan
