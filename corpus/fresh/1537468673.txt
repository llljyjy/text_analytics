First of all, I love Fresh products!  But this one is just okay.  This toner did not increase the hydration or texture of my skin after 2 weeks of regular use.  It smells lovely and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, so I am keeping it in the medicine cabinet for those occasional times where I may need a toner to remove residue after cleansing.  But this won’t become a regular part of my routine and I doubt I will purchase it again. Gentle but nothing special
