I was very excited to try this serum because I love Fresh products!  It has a great scent which is always appealing with skincare and it felt so smooth going on my skin. I love that is has Hyaluronic Acid to help prevent dryness and hydrates my skin. It also has a “Clean at Sephora“ badge which I always try to look for when I shop. I recommend this one! nan
