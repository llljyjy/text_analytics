I am a huge fan of Fresh products and always looking to try something new from them. I am again very impressed with everything. The packaging is beautiful and with a great quality. The mask has a mild and very pleasant floral scent, just enough to make you happy without any overpowering heavy smell.  It feels wonderful on the skin. It applies like a tick cream and after 15 min you can massage it in for an over night wear. For full benefit definitely works better over night, but Iâ€™ve tried it for 15-20 min and my skin still feels very soft and calm.  It has  two of the most important ingredients in skincare - Squalane and Vitamin C plus fruit oils for a really good formula.  Overall an amazing product with great skin benefits. ANOTHER AMAZING PRODUCT FROM FRESH
