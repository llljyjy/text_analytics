I’m not sure what kind of magic is in product but it’s real. I really wish I would have taken photos. So my body has been under stress (spinal surgery/inflammation/crap) and every time this happens my face takes a major hit with acne. All kinds. I know you’re not supposed to pop/pick/whatever, I LITERALLY KNOW, but the deep ones with so much pressure rising it might actually hit someone in the eye really need dealt with. This one on my cheek grew so fast two days ago that by that night I simply touched around it and it popped and hit the mirror. Gross. So I had to clean it and make sure the rest of the gunk was outta there. Usually after this point, the thing turns into a significant cut and it takes weeks to go away. I was sick of this and that’s why I bought this mask in the first place--to maybe speed up the time after these pimple sagas. Back to the current situation, I put the mask on before bed, let it soak in for a little while and went to sleep. I woke up and THERE WASN’T EVEN A BUMP where the pimple was. Some dryness formed the day after (yesterday) and now that’s about gone. So two days. I can’t believe it. My other pimple wounds are healing quickly too and my forehead scars seems to be lightening. All that so fast!I know it’s pricey--I wavered back and forth for a few days on it myself--but just get it. I don’t even use any other Fresh products; the reviews were just so good on this. a zillion stars
