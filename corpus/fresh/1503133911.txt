Let’s start at the beginning, the packaging is super cute. The bottle is a beautiful blue green with simple white lettering. Love it! The dropper is ok, it only fills half full which is annoying but not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things. The serum itself is great. A little goes a long way and it rubs in nicely. Once completely dry there is no sticky finish. She smell is nice and subtle. It feels really nice in the skin and leaves a lovely glow. I’m looking forward to the long term effects of using this product! Great Serum by a Great Company!
