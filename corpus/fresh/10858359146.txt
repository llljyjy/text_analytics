I love this serum so so much as it has ceramide and niacinamide in it. Being someone with acne prone skin; scars and using lots of actives, Ceramide is a must must and niacinamide helps lightens my scars. Love that this serum is not oily and sips into my skin super fast. I love the mild marine fragrance to it. Overall I can see the improvement on my skin and I am super happy that my texture has reduced drastically, leaving me glowy skin. Absolutely the best Serum
