FIRST IMPRESSION: First time I applied this serum on my skin It made it so soft, smooth, and feeling fresh. The smell of this serum is so citrusy that it makes me want to bathe in it. I love that the texture of this serum is not too thick and sticky. The serum has  a liquid formulation. I love that it absorbs so quickly in my skin. Most importantly that I love about this serum is how it did not irritate my skin at all as I have combo-sensitive skin. I will keep using this and give my full one month update.
