Love, love, love how lightweight this serum is! I have oily skin so I have to be careful of anything too heavy, especially in a serum because there are still several products to come after it in my routine. I’ve been using it for about 2 and a half weeks and I have noticed slight resurfacing results - skin looks smoother and pore appear less obvious, so I’m excited to see how things improve over time. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a lightweight, yet hydrating serum. nan
