I must say, Fresh has done wonderful things for my skin! So when I saw they released an overnight face mask that helps with redness, uneven skin tone and rough texture, I was like SIGN ME UP. I love how thick and creamy this overnight mask is. I love how itâ€™s also gentle enough to use on the daily. It makes my skin feel so fresh and supple the next day when I wake up. Hydrated, Supple Skin for the Win!
