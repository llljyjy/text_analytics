I received this product complimentary from Fresh in exchange for my honest review. The scent rosé is … divine … it smells like a pink starburst! the lip treatment itself is nice to apply but i don’t find it super moisturizing. i much prefer a thicker lip balm like the summer fridays lip butter balm; however, this lip treatment is still super nice! Also, this leaves a really pretty pink tint on the lips! the scent is amazing!
