I received this lip complimentary from Fresh. Iâ€™ve been using it daily and my lips have been so smooth! I love the very light wash of color it leaves on my lips. The rose shade is perfect for my pink lips and fake skin. This balm is not sticky at all and actually lasts on my lips but also leaving them soft and hydrated for hours after applying. Highly recommend!! Great lip balm!!
