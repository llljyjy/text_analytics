It was love at first use! This serum has the perfect milky texture and sinks in right away, and it works well under makeup without flaking. I noticed the difference after about a week of use - my skin just looked smoother and more radiant, and bounces back better after stress or a night of poor quality sleep. My skin looks like it has more energy, if that makes sense. Definitely a keeper in my routine! nan
