This is my holy grail moisturizer. I have tried several- a long and expensive process and this is the only thing I have come back to. When my skin starts feeling or looking textured, dull, and underwhelming I repurchase this. Itâ€™s fast absorbing, smells fine, and gives me the moisture to feel quenched all day with zero sign of oiliness. I also have dry skin and this is the only thing that I feel like makes me feel like my skin is back on track after one use. nan
