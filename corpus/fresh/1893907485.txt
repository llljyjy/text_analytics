My skin loved this Fresh serum. The milky formula absorbed quickly into my skin leaving it hydrated but not sticky.  I love the dropper application so I can feel the cool serum hit my cheeks. My skin was left brighter and the pores were definitely minimized. I’m 40 and still deal with oily skin and large pores…so I appreciate the results!!! Refreshed skin
