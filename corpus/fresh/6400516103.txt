Excellent absorption! I love fresh skincare and prior to this I’d been using the 2step rose Hyaluronic acid night mask but I wanted a single step replacement and boy did I find it in this recovery mask. A little goes a long way! I’ve had this for a few months now and I’ve barely scratched the surface . And I do the 4 pt moisturizing (cheeks,chin,forehead). Works great with the ActiveWarmth and pulsating settings on my PMD clean pro! Highly recommend! Perfection
