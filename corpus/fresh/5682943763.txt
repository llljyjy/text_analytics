What an overall amazing product. I feel like it would do wonders and be effective on any skin type due to the gentleness and nature/ingredients in the product. It kept my skin clean but also hydrated and helped with brightening it. I love the smell and the rose pieces in it as well. Definitely a staple toner. nan
