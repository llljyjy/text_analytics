This serum is so milky and feels so good when applying into the skin. It definitely helps improve the skin pores minimizing them and smoothing the texture. I have been using it for two weeks and I can see the difference. It also helps with the dark spots. Overall is a pricey serum but it does the work. Smooth skin!
