This lipbalm is definitely buildable. With one application, you can barely tell there was any color. With 2-3 swipes,  I would say it’s like a soft lipstick! It felt very hydrating and not waxy at all!!I think it’s a great alternative if you don’t like lipstick but want some color. As for the price point, we are in a recession hunty, so I’m not sure I would spend $24 plus tax (so it’s more like $26) on a lip balm/lip stick. Gifted by fresh in exchange for a review. However if money isn’t an issue for you, this is a very quality product that is well worth it. I think my biggest thing is that it’s hydrating and is not “waxy” like chapstick.Just fyi, this is shade PEONY nan
