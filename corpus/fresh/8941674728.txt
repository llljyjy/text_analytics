I received this product complimentary from Fresh but this is my honest opinion.This is a really nice tinted lip balm. I use lip balms daily and this one is the perfect for every day since it is also slightly tinted but still very natural looking and comfortable. The berry shade is really pretty and matches any makeup look, as well as a no-makeup makeup look. I love the nourishing ingredients like grape seed oil, castor oil and jojoba oil. Highly recommend! Nice subtle color and hydrating
