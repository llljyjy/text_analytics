At first, this product made me break out, but for the sake of reviewing it, I did use it a few times after and after to give it the benefit of the doubt, and Iâ€™m so glad I did! Unsure if it was unintentionally clearing out my skin at first but the serum works perfectly as of now & I adore it! Pretty great after a few uses!
