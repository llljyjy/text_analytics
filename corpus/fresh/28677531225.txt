From the second I opened the box, I was so impressed! First of all, the packaging is beautiful and very inviting. I don’t usually care for packaging so much but this truly made me excited to see what the Tea Elixir is all about. The milky serum is very light and nourishing, and gives my skin is a beautiful supple glow. The scent is also very natural and earth which i love- really smells like tea! I’m very excited to continue using this! Makes my skin so bouncy and hydrated!
