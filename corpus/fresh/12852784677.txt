This product makes my skin feel incredibly soft and hydrated. The first time I used it, I was shocked at the difference. For me, it did cause some breakouts, but that could be just switching to a new product and my face adjusting. Overall, I do love the moisture and texture of my skin after use. The scent is amazing. It also reduces redness! Soft, more even, less red, hydrated
