Fresh makes some of my holy grail products and they are in my routine a lot. For the new Tea Elixir is amazing. Not only it comes in a beautiful vibrant green packaging it makes my skin feel and look good. Especially now with my life being in a chaotic phase, with lack of sleep and just being on the run all the time. My skin suffers..by using this serum daily i can see the difference. My skin is more awake and more glowy. It works amazing under the makeup. It has great ingredients that feature Adaptive Phytocompound Tea (APT) Technology™: to increase skin’s bioenergetic systems & antioxidant protection- Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Refines the look of pores and improves visible radiance.- 5kDA Hyaluronic Acid: Intensely hydrates and minimizes the look of lines and wrinkles.My over all experience with this elixir is pleasant. Plus did i mention it smells amazing! Definitely give it a try Beautiful well rested skin
