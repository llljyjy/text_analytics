This is one product that I’ve probably performed multiple reviews on. This is the only product at Sephora that I’ve tend to re-purchased multiple times. Yes, I am not a huge fan of fragrance but the fragrance in this wash is light like a spa. It does not linger once you rinse it off. love the fact that I can wash my eyes lids in the morning time and experience zero stinging/irritation. I’ve went through multiple bottles of this product. I am so glad after all these years that fresh has not changed the formula or any of their ingredients. Although I’ve ventured out to other face washes but nothing has tends to provide me the same satisfaction as the fresh soy cleanser. I’ve tried fresh milk cleanser once which is okay as well. Maybe I will try there milk cleanser again come the winter but however I can use this gel cleanser all year round without any issues. I personally do not like spending a lot of money for a wash off product but it is something about this product that I really enjoy. I do not wear heavy make up so I can not speak upon the effectiveness for removing make up. Honestly you just can not go wrong. *I’ve purchase this product with my own funds.
