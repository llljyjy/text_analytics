Gifted by Fresh in exchange for my review. This is an easy serum to apply, rubs in easily and soaks in quickly. Formulated with Ocean Kelp to refine skin texture, 5kDA Hyaluronic Acid to deeply hydrate and minimize the look of lines, Niacinamide to refine the look of pores and Ceramide III to help strengthen the skin barrier. I do feel like all of these ingredients truly help my skin. I have noticed major improvement in how hydrated my skin is, my dry patches have went away completely. I had an area of clogged pores on my chin thatâ€™s completely gone as well. I am overall very impressed! I highly recommend! nan
