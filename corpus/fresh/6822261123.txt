I loved this product and have repurchased many times but I’m upset that they removed the SPF and are not advertising that fact.  The reviews from the previous version containing SPF seem to have been applied to this new product, which I find to be dishonest. As much as I loved this product, for this price without the SPF I think I’ll just find a sheer lipstick instead. No More SPF
