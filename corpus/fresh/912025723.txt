Soothing, cooling, refreshing, and luxurious. This is one of the most beautiful masks! Definitely calming. I have used it all over, just on irritation, overnight, or for a short while. All of these instances worked very well for me. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards. Such a treat! Calming and Luxurious Cream Mask
