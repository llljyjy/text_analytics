Roses really smell like….jk so I got this in a .5 ounce size gift and I thought it looked weird, almost like dirty product if you will, but it smells great and really comforts my allergy ridden sensitive aging in the 40s ultra fair skin. I put a fan near my face and that’s cooling. I swell and get irritated with all this central Texas crazy hybrid pollen count so it’s nice to put on. Putting it in the fridge is good too, in my opinion. That is because my face is always warm for no reason that I know of. While this looks like dark brown crushed petal dirt it goes on clear ish to the skin. I slather it on when I take the time for some good old self care. It’s pricey but I love Fresh products and have never had a poor reaction to anything Fresh. I deduct a star because we are post pandemic ish but in high inflationary times so I know this is not something we can all just pop in the virtual cart. I recommend starting small size and moving on up if you can. Fresh Coming up Roses
