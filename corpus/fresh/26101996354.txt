I was really hoping this «moisturizer» would deliver as far as «deep hydration» goes but to my disappointment it barely did anything to my skin. In fact, it would always feel as if it remains at the surface of my face, my skin unable to absorb it. Also, the scent is too strong, almost feels artificial. disappointing
