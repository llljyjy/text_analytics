I was already in love with the  Sugar Advanced Lip Therapy in a tube, and the untinted with SPF in a tube. This did not disappointment. Your lips will be SO soft when you wake up the next day. I paid for this product and the others I mentioned. REAL review. These are the only lip products that work for me, especially in this cold winter, so they are worth it to me. You get what you pay for. Love it
