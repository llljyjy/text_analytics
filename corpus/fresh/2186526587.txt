Ive been on the market for a new morning/ night cream and haven’t found one I loved until this. Wow wow wow!! First of all the texture is perfect. It’s thick and creamy but once it is on it feels lightweight. It isn’t greasy or tacky either. I have been using it in the morning before my makeup and at night before bed. It feels soo hydrating and doesn’t loose that feeling like other moisturizers I’ve used. The other bonus perk is the smell of this, sooo good! It honestly smells like something that a spa would use. I will be a repeat customer for sure! This product was gifted by fresh to try. It’s perfect! Hydrating, creamy, lightweight
