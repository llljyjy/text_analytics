This product is very soothing to the skin. It has a earthy/ minty fragrance that may be irritating to sensitive skin, but i did not experience this issue. I have combination skin and I did not experience any excess oiliness or anything. I feel that it was a nice addition to my skincare routine and that I was able to easily layer other products on top. I also love the glass packaging very classy and I believe it helps to maintain the product fairly cool. Very soothing and easy to layer products on top!
