this serum is beautiful. firstly the smell is well, fresh. once i cleanse, i apply a small amount on and instantly my face feels nourished and the product feels sunken in. it’s like my face was a sponge for it - it’s amazing. It leaves my skin well prepped for the day and for makeup. ive been trying to repair my skin barrier and i feel this has changed my skin drastically in the weeks I’ve tried it. Only need a small drop or a couple - the price is quite high but if you want to put money into something - put it on skincare :) nan
