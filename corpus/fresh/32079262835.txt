Iâ€™m not really a toner person but I had to try this bc it was hydrating toner. And hydrate it does. The rose fruit extract softens my skin while the hyaluronic acid seals in the moisture. I use it every morning under my moisturizer and my skin is bright and glowing. It will continue to be a part of my daily regimen. Wonderful hydrating toner
