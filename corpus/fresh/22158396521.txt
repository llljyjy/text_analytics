Had a feeling that I damaged my skinâ€™s moisture barrier so I needed a gentle cleanser that would properly cleanse my skin without further irritating it. I received a sample of this product a few years back and remember having a good experience with it. I have very sensitive skin so I was very satisfied with how clean my skin felt after using such a gentle cleanser. My skin feels clean, not stripped, after using this and I even though it was definitely a splurge, I think it was worth it to help restore my skin. Great gentle cleanser for sensitive skin!
