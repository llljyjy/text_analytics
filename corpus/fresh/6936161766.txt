Cant say enough good things about this. “Caramel“ is what got me through the dry and freezing New England winter months. I’ve been using “Watermelon“ for the summer. They both have a very very slight tint and an incredible scent (“Caramel“ especially makes my mouth water), but they best part is the formula itself. This is so nourishing and moisturizing for my lips, better than any actual lip mask I’ve used in the past. And the effects don’t immediately disappear after the product wears off, like with a lot of lip balms. My lips actually feel soft and comfortable even if I don’t reapply for hours after. Will definitely be sticking with this. Best lip nourishing product I've tried
