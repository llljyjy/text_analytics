I have pretty dry skin and it’s hard to find a night cream in general. This one definitely works well. I do think there might be better out there, but I am yet to find it. It keeps your skin feeling fairly good, but I don’t have a great glow or feel of hydration by the morning. Overall an above-average night cream. Gets the job done
