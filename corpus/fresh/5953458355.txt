I want to start out by saying that this is easily the most hydrating lip treatment I’ve tried in a long time. It has that Fresh lippie signature scent. It instantly plumped the wrinkles and lines in my lips with just one application. You can see in my before and after photos that the color is buildable and it made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my lips. I love the packaging, the matte component with the twist top. Very sleek and pretty. Don’t be intimidated by the color, it’s very sheer and actually gives you that my lips but better color. Love it so much! This lip treatment was gifted by Fresh, however the opinions that I shared are entirely my own. So so good. Worth the price.
