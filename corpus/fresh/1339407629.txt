I will start off by saying I received this product complimentary from Fresh, but this is an honest review. The texture is thick and creamy- it feels moisturizing tbt minute you put it on. It says to use morning and night, but if you use it in the morning- I’d wait a couple minutes before putting anything on top of it so it can fully absorb in. The scent is black tea florals but it smells so natural and calming. I’m excited to see how this works on my skin, but from first impression, this is a really quality product. Quality Fresh Product - feels great on skin
