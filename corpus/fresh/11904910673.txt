Gifted by Fresh. The Fresh sugar lip treatment is perfect for giving your lips a light tint! I tried the shade “peony” which is a rose-burgundy color (there doesn’t appear to be an option for that shade yet), but translates sheer on the lips. It has buildable pigment, and applies smoothly. Though it’s a bit expensive for a tinted lip balm, I really do like it! Great tinted lip balm
