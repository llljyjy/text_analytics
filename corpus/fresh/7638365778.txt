I have used this religiously for four years. When I put only this on my skin, it does what’s it’s supposed to (the bare minimum). Now that I’ve started incorporating serums, essences, and toners into my routine, this peels. The other things don’t, but when I put this on there, my face peels. I hadn’t thought anything of it until a beauty blogger pointed this out. I didn’t know products weren’t supposed to do this because I’ve really inly ever used this. As much as I love Fresh, I don’t think I’ll be returning to this product. I don’t know if it’s always been this way or if this has been a thing after the reformulation, but I can’t. Sorry Fresh Rose lotion, it’s over. Goodbye, Lover.
