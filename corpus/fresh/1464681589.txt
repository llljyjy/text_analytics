I really enjoy this serum as I find it very hydrating and smooth feeling on the skin! I do feel like it lacks a specific purpose, but maybe it’s a one and done, do it all skincare serum. Although I enjoy the scent, to me it is too strong and a bit unnecessary. For $80, I’d like to see more action than just hydrating my skin. nan
