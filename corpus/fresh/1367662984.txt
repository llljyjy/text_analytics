Fresh makes some of my favorite products and this serum is no exception. It’s lightweight and wears well both at night and during the day under makeup. After using it for the last few weeks, I’ve noticed a visible difference in the way my skin looks and feels. It’s hydrated, glowy and my fine lines seem to have softened a bit. Overall texture and tone also improved. It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny - liquid gold! Plus, it has the loveliest scent that’s light and subtle. Fresh for the win, again. Gorgeous serum!
