I like it I would say it’s more water-based and creamy it’s really like watery kind of but it’s really good it makes your face glow I can’t say anything about wrinkles are fine lines  I haven’t been using it long enough but I like it it’s soft on the skin if you’re not into watery serums and more into sticky serums I wouldn’t recommend this besides that it’s really good it has a light smell it smells kind of like grass to me but I like it 7/10 I like it
