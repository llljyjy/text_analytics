It’s not the most expensive mask on the market, but it’s not the cheapest, BUT it’s so worth the money! It is so hydrating and replenishing and left me with such healthy looking skin. It didn’t cause me any irritation. While this is recommended as a mask, I use it most often as a moisturizer especially overnight. nan
