If you’re sensitive to fragrance, this may not be the best for you. I think it smells great, but it could be too strong for some (floral, green tea).Overall, texture is more liquid/runny. It sinks into skin incredibly well and doesn’t leave a tacky finish. It did cause a few breakouts the first few days, but that seemed to resolve on its own. I didn’t notice a difference in texture or brightness tbh, but it was a nice, lightweight moisturizing layer for the summer months. nan
