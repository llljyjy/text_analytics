My skin was acting up couple days before starting to use this serum. Given my skin condition at the time, I wasn’t sure how my skin would react to a new serum, but I couldn’t resist. Tea Elixir comes in a gorgeous green bottle and milky lightweight serum easily spread on my skin. The serum felt soothing and gentle as I pressed the serum lightly into my skin. It is so hydrating. It really was a relief to my dry irritated skin. As I grew older, I make hydration as a priority and although I still need good moisturizer to lock in hydration, I felt this serum was great for given me the hydrated glow. I haven’t used long enough to notice big difference to my fine lines or wrinkles yet, but it’s very promising. Great hydration
