This serum is light but very hydrating. The texture is like a lightweight, creamy liquid that spreads easily and quickly melts into the skin. I like to pat it in. I also like to use this after my toner for an extra hydrating fix. I notice my skin has a slight glow after and feels supple after using. nan
