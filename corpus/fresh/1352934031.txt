Fresh black tea corset firming moisturizer. This cream has a medium creamy texture. You only need 1-2 small pea size for your entire face. The face has a similar scent to the soy cleanser. What I find works best is to use a lighter texture underneath the cream. Wonderful texture and will work great for this colder months. I like that it contains black tea so it gives it a nice brightening effect and goji fruit extract. Perfect cream for the winter or dry skin
