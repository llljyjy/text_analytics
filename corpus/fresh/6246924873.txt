I’ve had my eye on this for a long time and finally gave in and purchased. I feel personally that it is way overpriced for little results. I was expecting this to feel rich and balmy because you know.. it’s a lip balm. I was wrong. This feels very heavy on the lips and never seemed to sink in and moisturize my lips. It felt more like a super slick lip oil instead of a nourishing balm. Not for me.
