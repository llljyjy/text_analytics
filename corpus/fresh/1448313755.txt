I have young kids and seasonal allergies so my eyes are puffy and dehydrated most of the year. The caffeine makes the puffiness less noticeable and the hydration is noticeable. My concealer smooths on well with no pilling; I do let it set a few minutes before adding makeup. It is a huge splurge for me, but after trying 4 other “dupes“ , I finally decided it was worth every penny. NO REGRETS! It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause more milia either, huge plus!
