Fresh lip balms are my FAVE!!! The formula feels so silky and moisturizing on my lips. I love how the color rose looks like my lips but better. This product adds a lively tint to my dull and pale lips. I often reach for this product in place of lipstick because it offers a lot more hydration than typical lipsticks. The buildable color allows for a bit customization as well. Even though this product was gifted by Fresh, I have been using their lip balms for years and will continue to do so because I love the way they feel on my lips! Buildable Color
