I LOVE fresh products and this moisturizer is no different! It is incredibly hydrating without being too heavy. I have combo skin and this sits beautifully under makeup as well as alone on bare skin. After two weeks I actually felt a huge difference in my skin’s moisture retention! It smells more like cucumber than rose to me; which I actually like! It’s very light and fresh smelling. I will absolutely be repurchasing! Light and Fresh! (See what I did there?)
