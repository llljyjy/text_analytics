I started using this product yesterday and it created an allergic reaction around my eyes. Now there are two huge red circles around my eyes. I had extremely high hopes for this products because everyone around me said it was amazing so I went ahead and bought the mini size to try it out. It cleanses some impurities from your skin but it immediately dried out my forehead and caused a breakout when I was about to apply toner. I have oily skin but my skin isn’t sensitive at all and I’ve never had this sort of reaction to any product I’ve used until I tried this. Allergic Reaction
