I got a sample of this product and knew I had to get the full size. First it makes my skin feel and look amazing. My skin is soft and plump with this beautiful formulation. The smell is also lovely. I was shocked by the size of the bottle too. It’s so big compared with most serums, so I don’t mind the price. I just overall love it and I love the rose deep hydration line. beautiful
