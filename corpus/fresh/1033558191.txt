I have yet to find a Fresh mask I did not like but finding a serum that can become a staple is definitely more tricky. When the brand sent over a complimentary bottle, I was ecstatic to give it a try. I am partial to the Tea Extract infused collection because I believe its antioxidant powers are both impressive and effective. This latest launch is pretty fantastic when it comes to hydrating the skin instantly -- it also contains Niacinamide which I gravitate towards every time to help with the appearance of enlarged pores. The addition of ceramides is much appreciated as I’m over 40 and always look for something to help with the glow and bounce. So far, it’s only been two weeks but it’s been a seamless addition to my routine (AM mostly) and I am looking forward to finishing my bottle. Great hydrating serum (with benefits)
