Let me start off by saying that this cream smells amazing of black tea! The scent is so refreshing yet calming, it’s seriously a treat applying it to my skin at night! It has a nice, thicker texture that you can just feel absorb into the skin. My skin has been dry lately thanks to this MidWest weather and this cream has been a lifesaver at hydrating it and giving it back its moisture and plumpness. I use Fresh’s tea serum along with it and I can’t tell you how amazing my skin looks and feels thanks to this duo! *gifted by Fresh nan
