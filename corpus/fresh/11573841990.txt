I have cystic acne from pcos. So, I have to use a lot of high strength face washes, prescription retinol and epiduo forte.. it’s a lot and it really dries my face out, my face is constantly peeling. This toner feels great and it’s a nice buffer between all my other products! So far it hasn’t caused any acne, but then again, I haven’t been using it for more than a week. Anyways, my face is peeling a lot less and feels much more hydrated. Ladies: spend the money! Great for dry, peeling skin!
