For starters this packaging is STUNNING!! It’s weighted nicely as well & feels very lux! The product Consistency is like a creamy/milk. It appears to be a cloudy white. There is a light sent it kind of reminds me of tea tree. It’s not overpowering though in my opinion and feeds quickly after applying on the skin. Overall I am really loving this product, I’ve noticed that my skin does Fillmore hydrated and softer. I can definitely see this becoming a permanent part of my skin care routine! Love!
