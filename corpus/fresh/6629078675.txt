I like this lip balm! it is gentle and nourishing and my lips stay hydrated for a few hours after application. the color is very pretty as well and very buildable. the packaging is sleek and beautiful. the only negative is the price. at $24, i would like some added benefits like spf or humectants. gifted by Fresh nan
