This serum was absolutely amazing! I live in the desert, and my skin has been in much need of some TLC. I enjoy anything with hyaluronic as it immediately plumps my skin, but coupled with the ocean kelp and ceramides helped reestablish my skins moisture barrier. It wore well under makeup, and helped make it last all day! best serum!
