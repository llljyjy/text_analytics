Ingredients: niacinamide, ceramide, hyaluronic acid, green tea, natural carrier oils, marine plant extractAnticipated benefits: deep hydration, plumping of fine lines via hydration, barrier enhancement, even skin tone/glowTexture: milky, fast-absorbingScent: light herbal, reminiscent of same brand’s Kombucha productsPotential allergens: fragrance containing natural essential oilsThe combination of ingredients offers a humectant-rich formula that I find visually plumps skin rapidly (perhaps due to the low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which will penetrate into the deeper layers of skin). It’s very enjoyable to use as it doesn’t feel sticky nor linger on the skin, and the packaging feels lux and heavy. The cost is higher than some other options, but I feel it is squarely in line with fresh’s aesthetic. Overall, I like this addition to fresh’s lineup. nan
