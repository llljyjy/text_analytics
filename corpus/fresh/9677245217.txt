I’ve been using it almost every morning and night and my skin feels AMAZING. Usually I wake up with my face feeling so nasty and oily but since I’ve been using this I wake up with my skin feeling hydrated and not at all oily like I’m used toz It smells so amazing! And it’s not thick at all on the skin. I love how it has 5kDA hyaluronic acid to hydrate, niacinamide to help with my pores, & ceramide III to help with the skin barrier. Very impressed & will definitely buy again. Your skin will thank you! Amazing!
