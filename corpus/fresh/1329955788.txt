I’m about to order my 3rd jar right now. I love the consistency of this product. It’s almost like a hybrid of cream and gel. The smell is absolutely DIVINE. I know it’s better to use products without any fragrance, but I will literally open the jar just to smell it when I’m in the bathroom. I have pretty dry sensitive skin and it has never caused a breakout. I will say that sometimes I need something a little thicker during the winter months or when my skin is extra dry, but I still really dig this moisturizer. love love love
