Started using this product for a few days and I noticed it kind of broke me out, I had a lot of texture on my chin. I’m pretty sensitive to new products so that’s probably why. This serum also has a light fresh sent which isn’t bad but if you’re someone who is sensitive to fragrance then this might not be for you. I haven’t tried it long enough to notice results but it did break me out a little which is why I’m giving it a low rating. nan
