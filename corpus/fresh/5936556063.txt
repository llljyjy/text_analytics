I’m excited to try this serum! My skin needs a little something extra to smooth and firm so I will be leaving a follow-up review of how it worked! I will be posting  another review in 1-2 weeks. I have been using it for 2 weeks so far and love it! At first sight. The packaging is beautiful and high quality! Love the dropper quality! The serum don’t haven’t a strong smell and it’s a nice consistency! So far GREAT
