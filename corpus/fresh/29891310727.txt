This was gifted by Milk Makeup. This primer has such a unique texture. It feels really hydrating and gel-like at first but once it settles, you can feel that tackiness. I am not a huge makeup wearer but I do feel like using this on my skin helps to minimize the appearance of pores. Definitely a really good primer under makeup and just on a daily basis.
