It’s a pretty decent serum. It’s lightweight and not sticky. I like that the mouth of the bottle has a stopper that helps to scrape off the extra product off the exterior of the dropper. Hydrating, and adds a bit of glow. It works, but it’s nothing super special that justifies the $80 price tag. It’s a serum.
