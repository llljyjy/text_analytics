I think this product might be actual gold. I am currently taking accutane so have quite dry & sensitive skin right now. Somehow this serum brought the life back into my skin after about 4 days of day and night use. It’s very hydrating, plumping, it reduces redness and it gives me a pretty glow. My skin looked almost reflective and felt the softest it has in a long time when I paired this with the Kombucha Essence layered underneath. I think this is worth the try since it can do so many things in 1 step (hydrating, brightening, strengthening, redness reducing and super softening). I try many products and I don’t get this impressed much! (I received a PR sample from the brand) Multi-Tasking Beauty
