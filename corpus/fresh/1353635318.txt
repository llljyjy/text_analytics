This serum is great for dry skin. The hyaluronic acid definitely helps with hydration and there’s an instant subtle glow that comes with using this product which I love. I haven’t used it long enough to be able to speak to reduction of fine lines, but it definitely seems smoothing overall. The packaging is nice and the scent is minimal which I appreciate! Overall, seems to be a great product and I’m excited to keep using it and hopefully see more long term benefits. nan
