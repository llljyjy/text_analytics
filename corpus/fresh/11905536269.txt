Got the shade Rose and it’s great because it also smells like it as well. This balm is super hydrating and smooth on my lips! I really love buttery it feels, but it’s not like a greasy feel. The color is buildable and takes a lot if you want a super pigmented look, but the sheer effect is great! Gifted by Fresh. Buttery Smooth
