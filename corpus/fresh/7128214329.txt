One of the best moisturizers I’ve used! I’m fairly picky with hydration level because most of the time it’s never enough. I tried the ever so popular lotus moisturizer before and it had such little effect on me I could never understand the hype, but this one really surprised me in a good way. The cream isn’t heavy and doesn’t leave a coated feeling afterwards (which, thank god for that), and it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day without having to reapply it like some of the other products I’ve used in the past. Overall an excellent product both value and quality wise. My go-to moisturizer
