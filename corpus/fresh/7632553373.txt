Beautiful lightweight serum for my no makeup days. Truly my only qualm is that it is a tad too fragranced for my liking. Otherwise I am loving the added moisturizer and glow that comes with just a few drops. Glad I was able to try this and that the fragrance doesnâ€™t linger long enough to trigger any headaches. Would recommend trying in store if you are sensitive to fragrance as well. nan
