Got the travel size as an impulse buy while waiting in line to check out because I needed a toner for a trip. I was expecting something thicker and oil-based, but was pleasantly surprised with how light and watery the actual toner is! Within the first week of use I noticed my face was well hydrated and CRAZY SOFT without me needing any sort of exfoliant. i definitely have my eyes on the full size when I finish the travel size. SOFT
