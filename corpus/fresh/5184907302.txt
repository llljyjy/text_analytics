Fresh Beauty products have never steered me wrong. I love the smell of this serum and it didn’t break me out. I have sensitive and combination skin so I’m always afraid to try new products. I also applied the products to my hands every night and I feel like it’s been helping since my hands go through a lot of harsh hand washing and I’ve noticed my hands look smoother. nan
