Usually I don’t love the way lip color looks on my lips but I gave this one a try and WHOA. It’s such a beautiful color! It’s subtle but definitely a good pigmented color. Also, it’s really hydrating which I like. Overall, I’m really impressed! This product was gifted by Fresh but my own review. Pretty color!
