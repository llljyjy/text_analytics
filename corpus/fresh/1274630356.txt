I’m really enjoying this serum. It’s lightweight, has a milky texture, and a pleasant green tea scent. It feels slick on the skin and absorbs pretty quickly. My skin feels instantly hydrated and moisturized. Also, it leaves a bright, glowy, and healthy skin finish. And my skin is looking a bit smoother. nan
