It’s okay. I got a sampler pack as a gift in the past. Now that I needed a new one, I decided to go to the store to see what color would be best for me. I like the slight tint in color, but it’s not as hydrating as it was before. It’s more like a lipstick formula now instead of the tinted balm I liked (same brand, different formula). More like lipstick than tinted lip balm
