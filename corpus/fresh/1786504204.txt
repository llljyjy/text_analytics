If I could have given this product 10 stars, I would have. I have rosacea. It’s severe enough that I have to use each night an ivermectin cream (have been using it for 2 years now), which has been prescribed by my dermatologist. I have also tried laser for a year. Both the cream and laser have been somewhat effective in reducing some of the symptoms of rosacea but have left me with some residual redness. This mask has cleared that residual redness. I don’t know how, but I have gone from blotchy red skin that seemed somewhat impervious to every treatment to nice, calm skin that matches my neck’s skintone. I very rarely write reviews but this is truly HG. A-mazing!
