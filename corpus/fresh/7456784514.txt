I’m on my third or fourth jar. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer and I see a difference in my skin when I use it. I was without it for a few months and nothing else was the same! I also use the night cream and the soy cleanser. It’s all really gentle on my sensitive skin and feels amazing. It also last a really long time and you don’t need a lot of product. A little goes a long way. This jar will last me over 6 months. obsessed
