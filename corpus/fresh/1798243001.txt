Tea Elixir has a pleasant natural herbal tea scent and a creamy consistency. It is thicker than your average serum but still feels extremely lightweight on the skin. It is formulated with powerhouse ingredients including Hyaluronic Acid which are a must have for my dry and dull skin. I really enjoy the cooling sensation while the serum absorbs into my skin.The serum is housed in a surprisingly heavy glass bottle with dropper applicator. The packing is unique & modern looking and I love displaying it on my bathroom vanity. I havenâ€™t used the serum long enough to see any improvement in the appearance of my fine lines but love how soft & smooth my skin feels when using this serum. nan
