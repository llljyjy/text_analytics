This serum has a light weight, milky consistency when applied onto the skin. My skin drinks it up and looks glowy afterwards. I do have sensitive skin so my skin broke out when I first started using this serum since the scent is strong. It smells great but almost has a perfume-like smell to it. Iâ€™ve seen others saying that they initially broke out while using this serum but as their skin got used to it, it worked wonders. I will continue to use this serum in hopes that it will do the same for me. Good serum but has strong scent
