$94 USD is a lot of money for a relatively simple product in terms of ingredients. There really isn’t much in here, but whatever is in here - works! And it’s mainly the Rice Ferment Filtrate (similar to what’s in SK2’s Facial Treatment Essence) and Black Tea Ferment that’s doing all the hard work. I apply this somewhat heavy gel-texture mask on my cleansed, dry skin for up to 20 minutes, tissue off and then rinse until it’s all removed. It does have a cooling effect but not in a mentholated way (I quickly scanned the ingredients list again in case I missed menthol the first time and it’s absent). Once I’ve removed it I definitely see a difference in texture and radiance. My pores look more refined (though sadly not gone) and if there was any flakiness before...well it’s not there anymore! I get exactly the same results every time I use this - which is a few times per week, they don’t accumulate over time. Do I notice any improvement in hydration? I do, but not as much as I do with this very same brands’ ’Floral Recovery Calming Mask’, but then that one did nothing for flakiness/texture, so it seems I’ll have to alternate between them, unless the Black Tea Overnight mask (next on my list) can step in for both. I hope it does, because frankly speaking I’m not sure if I can afford to use two of their masks on a long-term basis.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
