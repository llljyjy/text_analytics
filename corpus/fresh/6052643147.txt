I was gifted this complimentary from Fresh, however that does not hinder my thoughts on the product itself. One of the best lip treatments that I can wear all day long. Although it may seem a little pricey, I consider it worth it since it does make such a difference in the moisture for my lips. I love that I can wear it day and night without having to use two different lip balms! Game changer. Game changer to add to your purse!
