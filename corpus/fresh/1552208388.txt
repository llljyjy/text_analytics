Beautiful color. I have always used the sugar lip spfs and I think this is the best color so far. Very natural looking and very flattering with my cool skin tone. I always wear spf on my lips but I want color too. Perfect product for me. Very moisturizing too. Pretty container. Some of the other colors get too pigmented and too creamy. Not this one. I wear it with benetint and Charlotte Tilbury medium pillow talk liner. Great shade
