This scrub is perfect for summertime skin. During sunnier days, I wear higher SPF sunscreen and products. I have sensitive skin and worried the product would be too abrasive, but it wasn’t. So long as I have enough water on my face to help break down some of the sugar, the end result is amazing. I don’t use this product all the time, rather summer days spent by the river or beach where dust tends to settle onto skin. On lighter days, I reach for fresh strawberry scrub - not as harsh, but it gets the job done. All in all, once you figure out the right amount and how to use the product, it’s worth it. Great for summer skin
