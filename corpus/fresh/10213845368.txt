Absolutely LOVE this lip mask. I was actually shocked when I used this for the first time. In the winter I get extremely dry lips, especially with the acne medication I use, where my lips are painfully cracked and chapped. I used this before bed one night and I woke up and my lips were literally perfectly normal. I was so shook. Like how did it do that lol. Definently a must have. Recommended it to all my friends and family. Works wonders... you need it
