I got this as a gift from someone as I would normally bulk at the idea of paying almost $25 for lip balm. However, it has some to be one of my favorites. I keep it in my bag and I really feel like my lips get very hydrated from it. Especially in the winter when they chap easily, this has been really great. I love the packaging and that it goes on smooth and isn’t sticky like Vaseline. Not sure if I will purchase myself given the price but I’m really enjoying it while it lasts. Awesome but a bit pricey
