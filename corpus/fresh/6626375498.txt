Complimentary from Fresh! I’ve loved this lip balm since the first time I bought it around 7 years ago! I’ve tried so many different flavors/shades. I have perpetually dry lips so I love putting this on right after I’ve washed my face. It traps the moisture from the water right in! And I love the tint it offers for day time. I have a darker tone so it offers just the slightest whisper of color. I have four stars because the shade I have only shows up slightly, but I would buy this with my own money and would recommend it to others! Good for on the go!
