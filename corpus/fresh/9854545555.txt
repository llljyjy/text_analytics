I was SO excited to try this serum and let me say it quickly become my new favorite! This serum has a light milky texture and an herbal tea scent that is absolutely refreshing! I love how quickly it absorbs without leaving a sticky or oily feeling behind. I’ve used it once a day for about a week now and have already noticed a huge difference in my skin. My dry patches have all disappeared and my skin overall looks and feels more hydrated, smoother and more radiant! I do have to say the serum is on the pricer side, but a little goes a long way with this one! I only use a small drop and it covers my whole face. I definitely would repurchase once I’m finished with my bottle and highly recommend this! I'm OBSESSED!
