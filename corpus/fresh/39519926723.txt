The new Fresh Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum is a great addition to my skincare routine, it is an hydrating and moisturizing serum, that makes my skin so soft. I canâ€™t wait to see the results after a longer time of using it. Love the beautiful green packaging, such a pretty bottle, the milky consistency is beautiful too. nan
