I will say, this is probably the slowest working serum i have encountered. However. The results are pretty fantastic. The claims on it check out except the hydration part of it, I did find myself Using extra moisturizer. Although I always lather moisturizer so maybe thatâ€™s not a fair assessment. I do recommend the skin for people who want to target signs of aging and overall firmness of the skin. Slow and steady wins the race.
