This is one of the most beautiful serums I’ve ever tried. It’s incredible, love its lightweight,  silky, milky texture. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. My dry skin drinks it up .It works as 3 in 1 product for me ( serum + moisturizer + makeup primer) This serum is truly a treat , spa-like experience with its calming, uplifting tea scent to it. Beauty gem Current favorite serum in my routine
