I have been testing this product for about two weeks, I have dry and sensitive skin.When I first removed this jar from the package, I was really impressed! The jar is huge compared to most of the masks I have tried and the packaging is heavy and feels luxurious. Even the cardboard of the carton felt special.  With the word “floral“ in the name, I was initially hesitant to try this product. I worried that it would be heavily fragranced, but I knew that I loved Fresh lip balms and I wanted to try more from the brand. Thankfully, this mask has no strong odor at all. It’s a thick and rich cream that didn’t give me any irritation. Following the directions on the bottle, I applied a thick layer of this product to my skin at night. I rubbed the product into my skin ten minutes later and left it overnight. I woke up with a hydrating layer of the product remaining on my skin. It was no longer white or visible, but I could feel the oils. It was amazing to get me out of the winter dry skin I’ve been experiencing! After using this product for a couple of weeks, my experience has been largely positive. I have adapted my routine to include this product every 2-3 days. I do find that I will get some pimples if I use the product every night. It is very rich with oils and I need to give my skin a few nights to “breathe.“ With the adjusted frequency, I don’t get the pimples! On the nights when I use this product, I have begun to apply my retinol serum first, as well as my eye cream. The mask is very heavy, so these products would not penetrate it if placed over top! I have not experienced any irritation from mixing this product with the others.I am loving this mask so far! Whenever I have extra, I apply it to the backs of my hands. It does wonders. Another impressive product from Fresh!
