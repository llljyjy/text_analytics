Iâ€™ve used fresh lip products for over 10 years and love! I usually use the No color but tried the rose this time and I love the subtle color! It just looks like your natural lips and subtle color, while also nourishing and making your lips feel hydrated! Love this to put on all day instead did worrying about lipstick fading / smearing. Love the subtle color!
