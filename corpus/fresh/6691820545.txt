I have always been a fan of ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide, so I already knew this product will work well on my skin. I’ve only been using this serum for 1 week so haven’t seen any DRAMATIC differences, but if you have dry skin - you might wanna check this product out! Moisturizing!
