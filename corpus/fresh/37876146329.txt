I absolutely LOVE all the other Fresh products I have tried so far, so I was very excited to try the sugar lip treatment lip balm that I was gifted by Fresh. I chose the color Rose and I love how subtle it is, but it is also very buildable so you are able to use other lip color over it while still getting all the hydrating benefits. I also love that itâ€™s made with natural ingredients like beet root, sugar cane, and up-cycled cranberry seed oil. It left my lips so soft and hydrated feeling after just one use. Thank you, Fresh for never disappointing!! Love this lip treatment balm!
