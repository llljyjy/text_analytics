My favourite lip balm from the Fresh collection. I like the caramel scent as it’s subtle and soothing at night time and doesn’t alter the taste of beverages, such as coffee, if you use it throughout the day. Even though I do need to reapply it, it provides great hydration and keeps my lips feeling soft and has a nice finish. Overall I would say you can get good wear from it. nan
