I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and I could notice positive changes in my skin already. My skin tone has improved overall and my combination skin loves it - i often get dry patches on my skin when exposed to prolonged sun exposure or even general lack of hydration & this seemed to have been able to even them out! The price point is a little steep in my opinion but would recommend it! Great serum for combo skin!
