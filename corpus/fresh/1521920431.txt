I’m a huge fan of Fresh products but have mostly been using Fresh face wash and cream. This is the first time trying their serum and was so excited to receive it!  The packaging for this product is beautiful and I love the bottle that it comes in.  Just reading the ingredient list and what this product claims to do… i couldn’t wait to try it. I haven’t been using it that long yet but I have noticed my skin more plump and hydrated. There is a subtle scent of tea tree so those are scent sensitive should be mindful when using this product. I am noticing a small change in my skin so looking forward to the benefits after continued use! nan
