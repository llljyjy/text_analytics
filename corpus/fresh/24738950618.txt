I got this mist because i love a rose scent. This does smell nice like roses. But when i buy a mist i also like it to provide some sort of hydration-this mist does not do that. Its more like a setting spray that tightens so i can see where it would minimize pores. I had used the other fresh face spray for years & it was very hydrtaing & had a better sprayer. This packaging is prettier then there older one. But i wish the actual product inside couldbe more useful to my skin. Smells nice
