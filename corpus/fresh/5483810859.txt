I used to use this alot but the second time around, this product doesnt seem the same. Its very sticky, it doesnt apply well either. I find that it just clumps up on my fingers when trying to apply it. It gets annoying trying to constantly reapply when its suppose to go on perfectly fine. It smells good but its almost unusable. Not worth it
