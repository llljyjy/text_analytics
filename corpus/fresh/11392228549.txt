Overall a pretty standard creamy moisturizer. At present I havenâ€™t been using it long enough to swear on anti-aging results. But it is a nice smooth rich moisturizer which I have incorporated into my nighttime skincare routine. It smells very lightly of tea. This product was gifted to me by Fresh, but as always my reviews are honest. Pretty straightforward moisturizer
