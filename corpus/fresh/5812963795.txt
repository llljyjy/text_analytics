I have been using this night cream for YEARS! Mainly because it hydrates my skin so well that when I wake up in the morning my skin looks plump and fresh. That being said… did they change the formula? My new container of this cream doesn’t feel as thick and hydrating as the previous creams. And when I wake up my skin doesn’t look as reFRESHed as it use to. Slightly disappointed as I may need to find a new night cream after many years of use :( Did they change the formula?! :(
