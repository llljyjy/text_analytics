This product was proposed to me by a Sephora Employee as a cruelty-free alternative to my usual Farmacy product.I asked her if it was cruelty-free, she told me yes. I tried a small sample on my hand, the smell seemed light, and the texture not too oily.Well once home I tried it for it and it felt way too oily, the fragrance takes a while to go away and is quite strong and....well it is NOT cruelty-free. (They say it is on their website, but they sell in China, even on the Sephora website they dont have the cruelty-free mention...so the employee lied to me)I am quite disappointed. nan
