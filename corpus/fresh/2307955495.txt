Calming mask was a good rescue to my sensitive skin that got dry due to winter season. I like a thicker coating texture it has and a subtle floral scent is beautiful. I even used some under my eyes. Skin soaked this mask in, it absorbed a lot in 10 minutes. It requires little extra time to wash it off completely. But overall an excellent treat for dry skin. It did softened and calmed the skin, my dull patchy looking skin got lighter and more solid looking. Skin felt comfortable afterwards. Winter Skin Rescuer
