I have tried all types of serums, all types of brands, for the past 15 years! From drugstore to high end stores and everything in-between. This tea elixir is my go to now morning and night. I use it in the morning before I put my makeup on & evening before bed. Does what it says & I am pleased with the results! Also comes in a cute bottle! Love, love & love!
