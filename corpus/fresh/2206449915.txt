I received this complimentary from Fresh in exchange for a review; these are my honest opinions.PROS:- great texture -- it has some body but absorbs easily w/o leaving any tacky residue behind- hydrating & soothing formula- my sensitive nose appreciates how subtle the scent is- stunning packaging!CONS:- the price is definitely very steep; if this is within your budget, I think youâ€™ll enjoy the formula, but the price prevents me from recommending this more widely nice hydrating serum, but very pricey
