This has been my holy grail lip product for at least 7 years but the new formula is awful. Super drying with disappointing colour, it is half as vibrant as the old formula. One swipe used to give me enough colour and moisture to wear comfortably, but now I find myself reapplying layers constantly. If youâ€™re searching for a good tinted balm, look elsewhere. New formula not worth it
