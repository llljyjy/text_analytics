Mixed emotionsI received this with my order as a Beauty Offer full sample size.I used as directed, seemed to smooth my dry skin immediately, however, after a week of use I had blotches and breakouts. BTW my age is >60, I eat organic and take care of myself.But dry skin is part of life for most.So this should be considered a verified purchase. Worked At First, then had redness and breakouts
