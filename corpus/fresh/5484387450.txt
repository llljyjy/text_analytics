Upon receiving this balm complimentary from Fresh, I have Been trying out the Rosè shade for a week, and first, I found it a little drying, but I think you have to get past the first layer and then it becomes more hydrating. It builds into a light rosey color and last a few hours before it needs to be reapplied. The packaging is actually my favorite part. It’s stunning! nan
