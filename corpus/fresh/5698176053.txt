I’ve tried so so many lip products but I always go back to Fresh Beauty’s Sugar Lip line. Their lip products always keep my lips moisturized and I love that there’s so many different shades to choose from. This new papaya shade is a nice pink coral color but goes on sheer and is buildable in color. The hydration is long lasting but there’s one caveat to the product - it’s so soft that it has a tendency to melt easily. nan
