I love this lip tint. I really think they reformulated, based on the other fresh lip tints I own from a few years ago. Those all have the same problem: they’re way too soft, and they melt and deform in any sort of heat. It actually makes them messy to bring anywhere and irritating to apply.This new lip tint in plum has none of those problems - the consistency is way firmer, and for that reason it’s way easier to get a consistent layer of pigment. The shade is also soo beautiful — it’s a sheer blackberry, and I could see it working for a whole range of skin tones. Same delicious fruity scent and same hydrating qualities as the old formula. Just a way better and more sophisticated consistency. This was gifted to me by Fresh. nan
