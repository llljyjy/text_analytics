This is a staple item in our family.  The clear is smooth and keeps your lips moist.  I introduced this to my 83 year old mother and my sister and they love it as much as I do.  My son even uses it as he does long runs and bike rides outside year round.  It’s not as thick as something like Chap*****.  We wouldn’t want to use anything else! A "Must Have" In Our Family
