This was gifted by Fresh in exchange for my review. I am such a huge fan of Fresh Skincare and I was so excited to test out their plum Sugar Lip Treatment! I don’t wear a lot of lip products so when I do I tend to go for more tinted formulas as opposed to opaque ones. This gives the most beautiful wash of color without being overpowering! The color also fades nice and evenly so I don’t worry about having to constantly reapply it. If you’re not a regular lip product wearer but want a little bit of a tint, these are going to be your new go to! A tinted lip lovers dream!
