To be honest I was really hoping to not like this product as much as I did but I was really impressed with the glow this gave to my skin! Again I use this most mornings and on hydration nights but it has a nice light tea scent giving it a spa like feel and it soaks into my skin so so well. This is actually my 2nd bottle and I will continue to repurchase it since a little goes a long way and the results are almost instant! holy grail splurge
