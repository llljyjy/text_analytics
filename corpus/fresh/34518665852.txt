This mask addresses so many problem areas for me - uneven skin tone, calms redness, and smooths out rough texture by enhancing the complexion. Itâ€™s become a pleasant addition to my skincare routine. It has a soft buttery rich texture with a very subtle calming smell. The mask applies on your face smoothly leaving the skin feeling nourished and hydrated. It has few of my favorite ingredients including squalane, peony, cherry blossom and vitamin C. I have been using this mask for the past two weeks mainly during my night time routine (due to a sudden shift in brutally cold weather recently in New York, this recovery mask has turned out to be my savior for my sensitive combo skin). It provided me with an extra layer of hydration and suppleness. I have noticed that the texture of my skin is more refined and my pores have diminished. so good!!!
