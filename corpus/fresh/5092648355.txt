I’ve always been a fan of Fresh Beuaty so when I first saw that new Elixir serum is coming out I truly got so excited! Low and behold this didn’t fail to amaze me! Such a great product first of all it dries down fast after application, it’s So lightweight and really flawless for under the makeup. Love this except the price it’s a little on the  pricey side. But I would recommend yes! Fresh Elixir serum
