This is what I use every single day. I bought the bigger bottle because I absolutely love it. It has a light cucumber scent, water like base, so it’s great for summer because it doesn’t feel heavy. The first time I used it, I grabbed too much product and left my skin feeling sticky - a little goes a long way. Change on my skin is noticeable, it’s brighter, tighter and I often get asked about my skin care routine. I also noticed my eyes look younger/tighter since I started using it, I don’t use eye cream.
