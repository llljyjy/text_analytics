This stuff is just a sticky gross mess. Smells weird and tastes weird because it is bound to get in your mouth when rinsing off (promise I wasn’t trying to eat it lol). Their soy face wash is wayyyyyy better. If you’re looking for an exfoliating face wash with some kind of light scrubbing this isn’t it - the little sugars melts away too fast before you can even scrub. I would use this on my feet, not my face. Hard pass. Sticky and Gross, Unpleasant Smell
