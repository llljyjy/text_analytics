I receive this lip treatment complimentary from Fresh Beauty in exchange for my honest opinion.I like that this lip balm contains natural ingredients that come from beet root and sugar cane as well as cranberry seed oil and grape seed oil. It helps hydrate my lip and the hydrating seems long lasting. It also contains vitamin C and E that help nourish my lip to make them look more plump and smooth. I like that the color is buildable. For daily use, I prefer lighter color (as opposed to bold colors), so I use 1 layer of this lip treatment and it looks great and natural. nan
