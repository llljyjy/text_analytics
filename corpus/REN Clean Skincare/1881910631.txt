I love a vitamin C serum and this one has some nice ingredients.  I loved the texture of this serum and my skin really felt better after a week of using this product every morning.  It doesn’t smell amazing but didn’t bother me. I totally recommend this product. I was gifted by Ren Skincare this serum Super glow skin
