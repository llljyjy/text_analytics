This is the perfect day time serum! This contains kadadu plum which they claim has 100x more vitamin c than oranges which makes this an extremely powerful antioxidant that will work to protect the skin as well as even the skin tone and brighten. My skin loves vitamin c so I’m not surprised that I am loving this! My skin is hydrated, firm, glowy, and incredibly smooth after using this consistently for a little over a week. I’m excited to continue using it and hopefully notice some of my sun spots fading! This was gifted by Ren. Best day time serum
