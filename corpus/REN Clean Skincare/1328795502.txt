This is my first time trying REN Skincare products and I’m really impressed! I received this complimentary from REN skincare. The consistency of the serum is really thin as you can see in the picture so it blends out easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. Its very gentle on the skin and doesn’t cause any irritation, since it is infused with different superfruits such as Kakadu Plum, dragon fruit, and pomegranate seed oil. Upon using this, you can see a subtle glow immediately. Finally, I love the zero waste packaing! It comes in a recyclable glass bottle, and a pump that is made with 50% post consumer recycled plastic. Such a Gentle Vitamin C Serum
