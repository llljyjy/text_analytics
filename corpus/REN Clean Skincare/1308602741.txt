My Go to winter day time moisturizer. It’s thick without being heavy, and applies / soaks in beautifully. It has a number of calming ingredients that help with my irritated, dry areas, but also doesn’t make me oily (i have combination skin). Excellent, hygenic packaging and I love that it’s transparent so you can keep an eye on how much you have left. Good price and bonus that it’s clean. Highly recommend. Go To Winter Daytime Moisturizer
