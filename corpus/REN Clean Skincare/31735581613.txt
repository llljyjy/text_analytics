I’ve used this for a couple days and I really like it! The nourishing oils in here make my skin feel so supple and It does a phenomenal job at giving amazing hydration, so much so that I only use it alone without moisturizer. Only potential down side is that it takes a couple hours to fully absorb, which I’m not mad about at all considering it’s an oil! Overall, love it! :)) really like it!
