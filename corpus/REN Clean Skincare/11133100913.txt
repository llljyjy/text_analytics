This serum has a lovely texture. It is light and absorbs nicely into the skin. My face looks glowy and soft after it absorbs. The scent is citrusy. It reminds me of the sweet heart Valentine’s Day candies. I’d recommend this for any one that likes a light moisturizer under their makeup or alone for a daily glow. It is not over the top and does not look greasy. Complimentary from REN Skincare. nan
