Bought a trial size, as it was part of the sunscreen kits Sephora sells. I’m glad I only got 10ml because I would not qualify the experience of wearing his as good. My skin is light, and it still left a white cast. The smell, while not bad, it’s somewhat overbearing, and if it runs down your eyes, it stings. It also felt too thick when applying. If you’re seeking for mattifying products, there must be a better one out there. Crazy white cast and noticeable smell
