Gifted by REN skincare in exchange of my honest opinion. I liked this serum a lot. My skin is slightly glowier after short time of use but I will continue using for sure. I love that it has all these superfruit ingredients in it! It is a little sticky after application so I mostly use it during the day. A nice serum!
