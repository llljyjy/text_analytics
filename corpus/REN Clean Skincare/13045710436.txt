I really like this overnight recovery balm! It’s different from other nighttime products that I’ve used as it’s definitely a balm and not a cream. You have to rub it in your fingers or hands before applying to loosen it up. It leaves a pretty shine that’s a little thick which I love for nighttime. I try to apply this early in the evening so I can let it soak in my skin before applying the rest of my nighttime routine. I love the thickness of this product in the winter especially. Highly recommend. Haven’t used REN before but will definitely try other products. Recommend - nice for winter
