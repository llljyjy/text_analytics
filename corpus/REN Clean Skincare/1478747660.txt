Gifted by REN. Vitamin c is one of my favorite ingredients because I had a lot of uneven skin tone. I used this serum as more as a spot treatment to treat blemish spots. I have seen those spots fade but it’s also dried out my skin a little. I was using every night but I’m going to cut down to a few times a week. nan
