I usually don’t like the smell of vitamin c serums but this one doesn’t bother me at all.It has a light creamy texture that feels really moisturizing. It gives me an instant glow.Even though it has 3 types of vitamin c, it’s  gentle enough to use on sensitive skin.I’ve been using it for only ten days so I can’t talk about an improvement in fine lines but I’m really enjoying its texture and the way that my skin feels after applying it.I especially like that it doesn’t feel sticky at all like many others vitamin c serums that I’ve used before. nan
