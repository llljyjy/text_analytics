This was gifted by REN Skincare - and Ren can do no wrong in my eyes! I love the smell of this product, and especially like that it’s marketed to glow and protect. To me, that means its a product I can use long term to achieve the best results! I love using it so far, and know I’ll love it even more once I see a difference in my skin texture and glow! REN for the WIN!
