I love that this is a cruelty free product from a sustainable company! I heard glowing reviews about this product and now I get the hype - I’ve been using this for a week and already am obsessed and look forward to putting this on twice a day. I love the SCENT - it’s almost like a watered down, more adult version of Fruit Loops - a bit of the superfruit ingredients come through in the scent - and then it turns into a soothing almost oat milk type scent. I’m very fussy with fragrance in skincare but I absolutely love this one and it doesn’t bother my somewhat sensitive, oily to combination skin. This adds some moisture to my skin after washing and before moisturizer, and makes my skin glow and look so perfected! This is an awesome product. I love the packaging too, the pump is very convenient and works well. I use 2 pumps and it is enough to cover my face but doesn’t make me feel greasy at all.This product was gifted from REN Skincare for review purposes, but this is still my 100% honest review. Smells amazing and makes my skin glow!
