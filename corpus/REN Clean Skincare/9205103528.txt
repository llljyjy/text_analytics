Really love that Ren promotes healthy barriers these days! This product isn’t sticky or tacky + a little goes a long way (which is good for nearly $60). It’s definitely nourishing and I like using it at night and in the day, especially under makeup to help keep my foundation even. I’ve noticed a decrease in dry spots and an increase in hydration overall. good if you can splurge!
