I’m very thankful for this overnight recovery balm! It’s perfect for these colder/winter months since my face tends to get very dry during this time. It’s a balm that you can warm up between your fingers and goes on very smooth! It’s a thicker consistency, but once it’s on your face it sinks in and moisturizes surprisingly well. I was pretty impressed with how soft and hydrated my face felt in the morning after overnight use. I haven’t tried this brand before, but I’m very happy with the packaging, quality, and ingredients. Will definitely try other products from REN! Highly recommend! Love this overnight recovery balm!
