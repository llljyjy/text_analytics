I love this moisturizer and so does my skin. I have oily skin and get bumps (not pimples) on my chin and cheeks always and easily get clogged pores but my skin js so dry. Iâ€™m always trying moisturizers to see what works best (I buy and use a whole bottle to see how my skin reacts) and so far my skin js loving this. When you first apply it it looks and feels heavy but my skin quickly absorbs it and lasts all day and my skin 100% looks better and have had no bad reaction to it. Using for a month so far and just in the morning. love this moisturizer. oily but dry skin
