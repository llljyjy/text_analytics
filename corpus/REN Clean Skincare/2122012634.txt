I honestly believe you can never have too many vitamin C serums! :-)The REN radiance vitamin c is complimentary from REN Skincare, has been a new favorite in my daytime skincare routine. I have been using this serum in the morning and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin, it leaves a healthy glow, and I have noticed a fade in dark spots around my chin from a prior breakout. I also notice how smooth my skin is after use. Allow the product to absorb in your skin, before applying the next skincare item in your routine. Follow-up with sunscreen for all the hard work the vitamin c serum is putting in! The product is also made with sustainable packaging which I also love. Great vitamin c serum!
