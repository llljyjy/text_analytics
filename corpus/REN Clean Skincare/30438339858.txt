Wow! I’m from Chicago and the air has been dry lately. I currently use other products in my routine to combat this with my Evercalm Barrier Support Facial Oil as a last step. This acts as a moisture seal for the whole day and I’m in love. Oils can typically be heavy on the skin, but this is pretty lightweight for one. I personally find it great as a primer as well as foundation goes over it effortless without creasing. I will continue to use it to protect my skin from harsh winds and combat the dry weather.
