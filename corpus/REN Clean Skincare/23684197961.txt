I have combination skin and struggle with cystic acne on my chin and a new chapter of skin sensitivity. Over the summer, my skin barrier was destroyed for some unknown reason. Because I’ve been using Tatcha for three years now. suddenly, my skin cannot handle anything with a fragrance and that caused immediate breakouts, I had no idea what was going on. I’ve tried all the face oils sold at Sephora, every hydrating mask, whatever, you name it; But nothing was providing the hydration that I needed until I came across this. It feels like a breathable Vaseline “slugging“ mask. I usually apply nothing prior to this mask. I use it twice a week, sometimes more, depending on how my skin reacts after using exfoliating serums and toners. I LOVE this. My skin feels silky, smooth, and hydrated the next morning and it feels plump the next day. I used to struggle with dry under eyes (still kinda do, but it’s much, much better), and I had a dry tip nose, AND my nose is also oily-I used to get a lot of blackheads (combo skin) also the area around my lips would be dry as well. This product honestly and truly helped with hydration. I cannot recommend this enough. Buy it, try it and return it if you don’t like it. I swear by this. Hidden Gem
