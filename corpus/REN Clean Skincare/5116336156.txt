Most vitamin C serums are gel-like but this one has a slightly milky creamy consistency that feels more hydrating that others I’ve tried. It still sinks into the skin quickly with no tackiness, and doesn’t leave a weird residue on skin. I’ve had no issues layering it with other skincare or makeup and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Overall very happy with this product! Great for sensitive skin
