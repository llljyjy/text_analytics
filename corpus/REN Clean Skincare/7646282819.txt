I was lucky enough to receive back when I got Ipsy bags YEARS ago and never looked back. Ive bought it regularly since then. I have sensitive skin (acne break out or light rash easily) and I could still use this 2x a week. Skin changer. I recommend this to everyone whether they’ve been in the skincare game for a while or a just getting into it. It gives you a glow and sometimes I struggle with large blackheads on my forehead and I can use this mask and they shrink the same day if not disappear in a day or two. Definitely improves texture from hydration to unevenness to acne. You don’t use THAT much each time so this thing lasts me a while and has great shelf life. I see more results from one use of this sole product than using a very expensive skincare cocktail named after tipsy rhinos for over a week. forever purchase- skin changer
