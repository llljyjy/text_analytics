I love the products viscosity! It’s very thick and gives me a nice glow. My skin feels and looks good and moisturized. I would recommend for normal, combination, and dry skin. I like the ingredients in this clean product. I’ve been using this for over a week and so far so good! I wouldn’t recommend this to people that don’t like thick moisturizers. This feels like Vaseline but that’s why I like it, my skin is thirsty. Nice and thick!
