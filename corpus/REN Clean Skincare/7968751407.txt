Disclaimer that this serum was gifted by REN Skincare in exchange for an honest review. I think this serum feels really nice on the skin (my skin type is dry). There’s no irritation and it’s hydrating without being greasy. I think it absorbs well and makes my skin feel supple if that makes sense. The pump is a nice touch and you can twist to lock it. I believe it’s also made from recycled material.However I do want to point out that there’s a very strong citrus fragrance. It doesn’t irritate me my skin but I feel a bit overwhelmed by it. I’m also sensitive to scents though. And I haven’t been able to use it that frequently because the scent is too much for me but in the week I did use it, there was slight brightening (nothing life changing). nice but strongly scented
