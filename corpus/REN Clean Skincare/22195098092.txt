this is nice. i do find that it pills with certain products so be careful what you apply it over. i do not understand why it is considered a wash off mask. i just use it as a night time cream when i feel my barrier needs a little extra boost. definitely helps with redness & barrier repair. i did get this through boxycharm, i donâ€™t think i would ever pay $50 for it. ever calm mask
