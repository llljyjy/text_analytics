I have been using this nourishing oil from REN for a few days now and it’s really hard to tell if skincare is working for you in just a few days. However, this oil has been really good on my skin. From what I can see so far, it’s leaving my skin super nice and plump. I also love that it’s a lightweight oil so I can wear it in the mornings before makeup and it won’t make my face look greasy at all. I’m looking forward to trying this out more.
