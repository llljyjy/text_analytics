I received this product complimentary from the brand in exchange for my honest review and feedback. This is my first time trying this brand, and I really like it! I really liked this gentle, nourishing facial oil. I have very sensitive skin, and the Evercalm Barrier Support Facial Oil has helped to calm redness and soothe my skin from winter dryness, helping it be softer and more even as we head into spring. I also liked the zero-waste packaging it came in and that the bottle can be repurposed or recycled when Iâ€™m done. Soothes, Smooths, and Supports
