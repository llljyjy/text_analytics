This oil has been such a great addition to my nighttime (sometimes even daytime) skincare routine! I have combination skin, being much more dry lately with an oily t zone. This oil is very thin, so it doesn’t feel super thick and heavy on the skin. I can wear this during the day if I’m not wearing makeup and it doesn’t feel like anything on my skin! I’ve really enjoyed how moisturizing this oil is and how soothing it is on my irritated skin. The recyclable bottle isn’t really a pro for me as I don’t have a place to recycle this glass in my area. I would prefer a refill option of some kind. Reuse > recycle nan
