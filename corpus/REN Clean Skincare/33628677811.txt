Hello everyone!!  I want to leave you my review as honest as possible about REN Clean SkinCare !!!  Due to things in life, on December 18 my Dermatologist gave me a Chemical peel… Since I used a product and I left some dark colored marks… my skin is super delicate and very sensitive….  After the process, my skin was still a bit irritated ... and that was when this wonder arrived in my email ... because it is wonderful ....  I have used moisturizing creams before, countless brands for my sensitivity problem and none how is it, I have been using it since December 25, until today and it has left me incredible results ... my skin is smooth, super moisturized with a natural glow and shine, without having to be greasy ... of course this will be my new daily moisturizer for me !!!  I am honest in recommending that you buy it and I attest that the truth is that it works amazing in people with sensitive skin problems just like I am !!  buy it, you will not regret it….  I thank BZZAGENT for sending me and introducing me to this wonder… the best token of gratitude since someone has given me in life, because my skin did need to know this product….  thank you Mega wooow
