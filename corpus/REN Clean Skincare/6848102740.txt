I purchased this in April during the spring sale and loved it. It was very calming, reduced redness, and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It feels very greasy going on but never broke me out and when I woke up the next day my skin and soaked it all in and was soft and hydrated. I didn’t use this product during the summer as it was too heavy for my combo skin in the heat/ humidity. I pulled it out again in November and noticed my skin was red and splotchy but I assumed that was because it was irritated from my retinol. I used the balm a few more times this month and each time it made my face red and splotchy. It didn’t burn or feel irritated and still left my skin soft but made me red and dried out my skin by the next morning. I am not sure if this is 100% why this occurred but I believe it was because I had it opened for too long and it should be used quicker than that as the ingredients are very natural. If you don’t plan on using this regularly I recommend getting the mini version (available on REN’s website). If you do plan on using it regularly I highly recommend the full size! It is so calming and hydrating. Good product but I recommend it be used up quickly
