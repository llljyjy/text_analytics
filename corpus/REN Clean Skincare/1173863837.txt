As someone who has been in skin care for over 15 years I love that this product is clean and recyclable. This exfoliating tonic has a light citrus scent and is gentle enough to use nightly. I used a reusable cotton round on my face, neck and back of hands and found it to be refreshing and hydrating. My serums absorb better when followed by the REN steady glow tonic! I would even recommend this exfoliation even if you are sensitive. Im sure it may take A few weeks to see an actual brightening of any dark spots so be patient and consistent to see results. Love how it also incorporates Willow bark which will keep breakouts at bay and act as an antiseptic to kill any bacteria. Overall I think this is a great product to incorporate into your nightly routine and use as an anti-aging tool! REN ready steady glow tonic
