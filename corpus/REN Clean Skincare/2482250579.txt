So Iâ€™m not a large fan of facial oils so I passed this along to a friend! However, this is still super lightweight! Honestly, if I had this during the winter, I think I would actually use this. My skin concerns are more towards hydration but during the winter, I could definitely benefit from some moisturizing. My friend told me that she likes this as a morning oil and I totally understand! There is also no scent. nan
