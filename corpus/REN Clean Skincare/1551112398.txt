The REN Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm feels very much like the consistency of coconut oil. The instructions are not very clear on WHERE you should use this product, but I did not feel comfortable using something so greasy and oily on my face. Instead, I applied the overnight balm to my hands and arms.  When I woke up, they were extremely moisturized and plump.  This product locks in moisture like it promises, but again, not something I would feel comfortable putting on my face. I think this would be ideal for my dry ankles and elbows. Would not use this on my face!
