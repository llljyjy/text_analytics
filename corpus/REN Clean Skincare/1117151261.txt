I use this night + day during the few days after my weekly retin-a application to keep my skin from getting flaky + red. I still peel, but somehow my skin keeps glowing through the whole process! Once the peeling has stopped, I switch back to a lighter serum/moisturizer for the rest of the week. No idea what I’d do without it — nothing else has made it possible to use retinol — I almost have up. Onto my second jar! great for retinol/tretinoin users
