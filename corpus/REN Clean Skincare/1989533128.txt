I was gifted by REN Skincare for my review. The pale jade green color of label on the bottle is calming to look at, like the name of the product suggests. The facial oil itself does a good job at calming and soothing my dry combo skin. Love that it’s made of seven nourishing, natural oil, and it was fast-absorbing. The dropper is made of recycled plastic, and it’s easy and hygienic to use. nan
