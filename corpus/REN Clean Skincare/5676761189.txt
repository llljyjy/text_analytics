the Ren Evercalm day cream is really good for all types of skin. It provides a lot of hydration without leaving the skin feeling greasy. What i like the most is that this moisturizer claims it provides protection against pollutants.  Its consistency is a bit thicker yet its lightweight which I really liked. It works great to use under makeup or all by itself.  All around a good moisturizer to have. nan
