I received this product complimentary from REN. I was so excited to try this product because vitamin C serums are essential to my skincare, and it’s hard to find a good vitamin C. This serum absorbs so easily into the skin and feels really good on. It doesn’t pill (which is something I find vitamin C serums sometimes do), and it sits so nicely between my other products and under sunscreen and makeup. I also love that it prevents against free radicals and has superfruit ingredients! Feels so nice on the skin, love a good Vitamin C!
