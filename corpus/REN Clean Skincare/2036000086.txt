This arrived just on time for the harsh winter weather. It made my skin feel velvety and hydrated. Did not make my face feel oily as so many other products soon my combination skin. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who feels the harsh abrasive weather taking a toll on your face. This is a great overnight balm that allows you to refresh for the morning. Face the Dew!!
