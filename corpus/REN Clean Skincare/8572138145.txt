This was kind of disappointing honestly :( I didn’t see really any change in my skin after 2 weeks of use.. maybe after longer I will, but I haven’t noticed any brightness or smoothing after using it both night and day. I have some acne scars and unevenness that I haven’t seen a change in. For the price, it seems like a stretch since I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin. I’m sure others might love this, but it didn’t work for me. Also, the smell is quite gross to me. It kind of smells like crayons and turmeric mixed together. It fades after a bit, but if you’re easily grossed out you might not love it haha. But anyway, it is very lightweight! Not watery, just light Didn’t love
