This was gifted by REN Skincare. I love a good vitamin c serum for daytime and found that this one checked off multiple boxes for me. I didn’t get any irritation from this. It was a gentle enough formula for my rosacea. It is scented, so beware if you’re wary of scented products. I found that it gave me a nice glow afterwards. I also love that the glass packaging is sustainable. Give this one a try if you’re into gentle vitamin c serums. Gentle vitamin c serum
