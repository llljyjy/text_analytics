So this was gifted by REN skincare and have only been using this for almost a week, but I am liking this product so far! It’s different from many other vitamin c products i’ve tried because it is lightweight and creamy. It feels very nice on the skin without any irritation. I definitely see a little glow the next day. Can’r wait to use this more to see how this product changes my skin. very nice and lightweight!
