This is probably one of the best facial oils I’ve ever used. It’s not sticky and it moisturizes my skin well. It’s incredibly calming, so I like using this when I have flare-ups or when my skin needs a little extra TLC. A little goes a long way; you just need 2-3 drops or so. This is one of my favorite ways to end my nighttime skincare routine! nan
