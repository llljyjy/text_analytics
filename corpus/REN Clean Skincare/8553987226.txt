I have using this for a while and I really like it. It applies great and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. The “matteifying” isn’t drying at all. There is a white cast for me personally if I don’t spend extra time rubbing it in, but I can get over that because this applies SO GREAT under makeup. It literally doesn’t affect my makeup routine at ALL. THE SUNSCREEN to use under your makeup
