The balm comes is a very cute container and convenient the smell is strong and because it applied to your lips you taste it and is no a pleasant taste I donâ€™t like to taste or consistency of the product it feels to light when you applied, my lips looks more moisture the next day but the taste and smell is too strong I would recommend the product it does what it supposed to do. The reason for the 3 star is the smell and taste nan
