This serum really makes a difference and it checks all my requirements which is no fragrance and airless packaging. It adds an instant glow and hydration to the skin without being greasy at all. I have attached before and after photos after applying it to my hands and it is the same effect in my face. I also like the sustainability  side of the brand trying to minimize plastic usage as possible. I do recommend it.  It was was gifted by REN Skincare but all opinions are my own. It is worth it
