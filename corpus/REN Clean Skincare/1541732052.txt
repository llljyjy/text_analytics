Gifted by REN skincare. I love this vitamin c serum! It’s a really nice consistency and hasn’t made me breakout or anything. Right after applying I can tell that my skin looks brighter and dark spots are starting to fade a bit! The only con is the smell is a bit citrusy for my preference. Really good
