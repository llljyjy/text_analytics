Gifted by REN skincare. Have heard so many great things about the Ren vitamin c serum so glad I finally got to give it a try myself and I was not disappointed! Price point is decent for a vit c serum and has a really nice consistency. Also has a pleasant scent which isnâ€™t true for a lot of vitamin c serums. nan
