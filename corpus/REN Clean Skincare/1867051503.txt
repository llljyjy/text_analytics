This oil is pretty amazing. Sometimes I use it by itself on days where I want to be minimal with my skincare, however, it’s perfect for me as the last step in my nightly routine to help prevent epidermis water-loss throughout the night, it’s lightweight and doesn’t feel too heavy on my skin. Great oil
