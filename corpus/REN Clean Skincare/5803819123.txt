I received this product to review, and I really like it. I would use it when my skin is sensitive, after getting a peel or other treatment that needs something that is gentile to the skin. It is a little greasy and melts into your skin. The next day your skin feels very soft. I would not use this as a every day balm, but when I do something to my skin like a peel, microneedling to calm my skin down. Ren Clean Skincare.
