This product was gifted by REN Skincare to me and I was really excited for this product, as I have been on the hunt for a good vitamin c serum to replace my Drunk Elephant one. This one seems both not potent enough to really fade my dark spots and acne marks, yet I noticed it clogging my pores and giving me some texture. The scent may have something to do with it as I have extremely sensitive skin, but the scent is so faint that it may have to be some other ingredient irritating my skin. Disappointed this didn’t work out for me, but if you don’t have the same sensitive skin type as me, perhaps it’d be better for you! Meh
