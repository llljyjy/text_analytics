I have super sensitive skin so I was excited to see this would help with sensitive, red, dry, etc. skin! It definitely felt good on my skin and I didnâ€™t have any bad reactions. My allergies have been super bad lately and I felt this helped calm down all of my itchiness going on. It was soothing! nan
