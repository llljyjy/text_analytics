This has the best smell of fresh garden omg! I love how plump my skin feels after use. It feels hydrated and smooth, plus it serves as a great spritz after makeup if you store it in a makeup sprinkler bottle. I have a travel size sprinkler so I transferred a bit into there and use it refresh my makeup or skin once during the day. Love it! A must have toner
