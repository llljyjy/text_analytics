This is my first REN Skincare product and definitely will not be my last! My skin drinks this face oil right up. It’s the perfect oil texture, and it is not too heavy at all.  I just take a few drops into the palm of my hands, rub them together and press the oil onto my skin. Within minutes my skin is less red, super soothed, and very dewy and smooth. I love applying this at night on top of my other skincare products to seal in moisture and hydration. I also love that it’s clean, so I can feel good about putting this on my skin. REN’s packaging is also recyclable, which is a huge plus to me! So Soothing
