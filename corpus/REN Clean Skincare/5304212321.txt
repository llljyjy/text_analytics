This stuff is great for sensitized skin from treatments or waxing. It calms redness, stops stinging and itching, and even prevents bumps from forming post wax. I also apply it every morning before my moisturizer and makeup and it cuts any redness that might show up from irritation, the result is even toned skin soothed, hydrated, and healthy. If you are dealing with redness or sensitivity, this is a great solution, it is a little pricey however I notice that when I donâ€™t use it I get more redness around my mouth and nose. If I had to cut it out of my skin regimen I could but because it HAS noticeably helped my skin tone and helps with my post wax care, I do keep it on hand. soothing, even tone every time
