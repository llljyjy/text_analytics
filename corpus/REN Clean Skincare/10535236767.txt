I was really excited to try this serum on my dry acne prone skin that gets a bit dull during the winter months. I loved how this felt on my skin, it left me feeling dewy and glowy. I’m not sure about the long term effects just yet but I’m hopeful and I’m glad it didn’t irritate my skin. Gifted by REN skincare but opinions are my own. nan
