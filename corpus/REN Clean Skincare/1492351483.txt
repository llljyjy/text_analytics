I have loved this cleanser and I love REN (I use a lot of their products). I use this as part of a double cleanse with the balm and my sensitive skin is happy. No drying out and no sensitivity. Both hard for me to find in a cleanser. However recently I purchased the squeeze bottle (directly through REN). I am beyond bummed as I had previously used the pump. The bottle has too big of a hole and each time I squeeze a glob worth at least five face washes comes out. I’m wasting so much product. Quite honestly I can’t see myself continuing with this cleanser when I am paying this price and wasting this much. I have thought about moving it to another bottle but that is a lot of work for something I’m already putting a lot of money into. I hope enough people complain and REN rectifies the hole to make it smaller (or returns to the pump). Tons of Wasted Product Now / Miss the Pump Bottle
