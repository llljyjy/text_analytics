Iâ€™m on my 3rd stick of this eye cream and I still like it very much. I noticed that my dark eye circles lightened up after a few weeks of using this. It keeps my eyes hydrated throughout the seasons while still feeling lightweight. I also like the easy dispensable packaging where I can control how much comes out. Love!
