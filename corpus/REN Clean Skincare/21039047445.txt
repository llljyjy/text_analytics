I love how this oil feels on my face face, it is very soothing, it makes my face to feel refreshed, the combination of ingredients are so nourishing that makes me  have a glow afterwards.  It is an oil, but it does not feel greasy and uncomfortable, I only use a few drops for my whole face, so the bottle should last me for a while because a little goes a long way.I first apply the oil, then my moisturizer and my skin looks flawless, ready for my makeup, definitely great for dry skin. nan
