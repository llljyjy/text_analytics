This was gifted by Ren skincare.  I have acne prone skin which means I have lots of hyperpigmentation left over from my acne. I love using vitamin C serums to brighten up those spots. I’ve been using this serum for a few days now and I do see a significant amount of glow but I haven’t seen too much  of a brightening effect yet. I hope that with consistent use my most stubborn spots fade away. Very Promising
