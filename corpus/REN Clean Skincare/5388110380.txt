This was gifted by Ren skincare in exchange for a review. I have acne prone areas of skin (chin and forehead) and always looking for products to help with hyperpigmentation from acne. This one had a great lightweight gentle texture. It absorbs into the the skin nicely and I am able to layer it underneath my moisturizer and spf. However I did not notice much improvement to my hyperpigmentation and stubborn old acne marks. Glowy skin but nothing for Hyperpigmentation
