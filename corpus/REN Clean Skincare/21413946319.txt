I got this product from using some reward points. I was specifically looking for a product to treat dark spots. I’ve been using for exactly 8 days so far and have noticed a difference in the dark spots, BUT it caused acne. Each morning I’ve woken up with a few small white heads from using the serum over night. Would not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin, like myself. Four stars bc it did what it was suppose to do, but had acne side effects that will leave more dark spots on me, so this product was pretty useless for me. Works, but causes acne
