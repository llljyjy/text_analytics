I have been using the Ren evercalm overnight balm now for about a week now and I like it. The balm is really easy to use and did not irritate my skin. It did leave my skin feeling greasy until it was fully absorbed which took a little while. It did leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. It does have nice clean lemon type scent to but not to strong. Clean moisturizer
