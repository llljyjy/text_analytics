REN Evercalm Skin Cream is a nice daily moisturizer. It is a very lightweight formula that feels great on my skin. It’s gentle and provides plenty of hydration. It also calms facial redness from agitated skin which is perfect for after using a facial scrub. I like that it’s cruelty free and not tested on animals. It’s also vegan. The pump is nice and easy to use. I don’t love the scent, but I don’t hate it either. It does fade quickly. Good everyday cream
