Gifted by Ren skincare. I am a huge fan of the Evercalm line so I knew I needed this support elixir. It’s a lightweight oil that really helps my skin feel less sensitive and soothed. I like to use it in combination with the Evercalm redness relief serum. Even though it’s an oil it feels non-greasy, I find it absorbs fairly quickly. Great oil for sensitive skin
