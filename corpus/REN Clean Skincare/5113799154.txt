What a disappointment, I will be returning this. It says it “melts off makeup“ but this is honestly not true. I had to use it about three times over before it took off my non-waterproof mascara. So this claim is just false. Also it doesn’t really feel that nice on your skin or have a great smell. Just buy CeraVe instead.
