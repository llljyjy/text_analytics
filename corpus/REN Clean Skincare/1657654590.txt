First and fore most, love that that is a clean ingredient and sustainable product that actually works! It goes on the skin smoothly and does not feel slimly at all. It adsorbs into the skin quickly and helps my skin look brighter. My 1 and only con is that is smells a little weird, honestly isn’t that bad at all and it’s not strong and goes away quickly. It wouldn’t keep me from using the product. I was gifted by REN skincare but the opinions are my own. clean and effective
