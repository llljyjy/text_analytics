I recently started using REN ready steady glow toner.Its amazing.I first of all I am a licensed esthetician and I’ve been in skincare Cosmetics for over 30 years I’ve used Many products .However this brandis amazingv.The ingredients alone are amazing they use willow bark to encourage cell renewal lactic acid to exfoliate and Azalea acid which aids in brightening the skin. I have been using this product at night after I cleanse and I have noticed a real difference in the texture and Clarity of my skin. I would recommend that if you’re going to do an exfoliator do not do this product on the same day.Itwould be to much. For that when you are brightening your skin with products like this you want to make sure that you use an adequate SPF during the day. REN glow daily aha toner
