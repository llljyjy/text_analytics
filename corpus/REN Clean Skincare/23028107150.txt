I’m actually a huge fan of the REN clean skincare products, so I was happy to have received this to try out. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. I will say my skin does look brighter and smoother. The one thing I would say I don’t like about it is the scent. It doesn’t last long which is great. Other thank that I’m pleased with this serum. Would recommend if your looking to brighten, smooth and have a refined texture on your face. Great Serum
