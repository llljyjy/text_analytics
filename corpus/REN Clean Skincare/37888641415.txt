I’ve been in the Beauty Industry over 10 years and probably tried over a thousand different facial toners throughout that time! I would say the obvious is to make sure you have a proper little cotton pad to apply this magical skin tightening freshener onto the skin clean skin. Toners sometimes have a sting or a strong smell. This one is no different but it’s a clean clean feel and smell that’s very faint and very lovely. The immediate change of PH will leave your skin actually tighter then it started. There’s glycolic acids that have immediate benefit to aging skin and sun spots. If you follow with your favorite serumOr moisturizer you can actually feel it glide on in a more efficient way. It’s amazing how fast I could feel the benefit into my 40 year old skin! As you see it is glowing!  I know this 8.5 oz will be treasured!  Cant wait to try their other stuff! Andiespice from beautyTap gives 5 stars!
