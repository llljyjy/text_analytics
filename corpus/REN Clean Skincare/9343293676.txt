This product was gifted to me by REN Skincare and I really like the ingredients of this product, and how eco-friendly it is. The texture of the product is also great and vitamin C is so important to incorporate in our daily routine. I am not sure I love the scent of the product, but that’s normal when products don’t add chemical products heavily. Excited to add this product to my daily routine
