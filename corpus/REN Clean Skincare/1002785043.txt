After reading all of the positive reviews, I finally bought this product and hoped it would help diminish the redness I have on the apples of my cheeks. My redness has been there for awhile, but I always just covered it up with a litter concealer and went about my day. I’m a full-time student who also works full time in healthcare. I’m sure that flushed look was always related to stress and lack of sleep. But I digress… I have very sensitive skin and this serum went on smoothly without any harsh reactions. After only five days of using in the AM and PM (as instructed), I can already see a MAJOR change in the amount of redness on my cheeks! I really wish I had taken before pictures to share. But wow! I wasn’t expecting to see results so quickly but I’m THRILLED! I can’t wait to see how things progress with continued use. Plus this serum is clean and Ren uses environmentally friendly packaging. What’s not to love about all of that?! I wish more skincare companies were as responsible. Highly HIGHLY recommend. This product DELIVERS!
