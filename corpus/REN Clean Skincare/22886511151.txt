My skin can pretty much tolerate upto 15% vit C but the skin on my neck area gets irritated so i go for something gentle. But vit C is really good with brightening and firming the skin texture. After applying this ren vit C serum around my neck area, i noticed less irritation, Formulation is pretty gentle, really recommend for people who are sensitive to vitamin C. It has a lovely sent by the way. Gifted by REN skincareâ€™ Gentle and Effective
