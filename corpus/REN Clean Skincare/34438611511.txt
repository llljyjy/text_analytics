this cleanser is great for sensitive skin, the clay texture is so fine that you can feel your skin getting more even without any harsh scraping effect like scrubs have. I used it as a cleanser with Murad Acne kit when I got a huge acne problem after wearing a mask for 2 years. will buy again! great for sensitive skin
