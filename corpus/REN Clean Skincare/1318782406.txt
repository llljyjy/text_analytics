I never write reviews.  This product is worth it.  I have dry skin which is worse in the winter months. Such a different feel than a normal cream.   A light film of this at night and my skin the next morning still feels moist.  Normally it would feel like Sahara desert.  Definitely worth a try in my opinion. Perfect for dry mature skin
