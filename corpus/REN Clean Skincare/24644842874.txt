I absolutely love this radiance vitamin C glow serum. It contains amazing ingredients like kakadu plump, dragon fruit, and pomegranate. It has light texture and blends so well without feeling sticky. I have been using this serum for a week and I already started noticing brightening effect on my skin. Love this!
