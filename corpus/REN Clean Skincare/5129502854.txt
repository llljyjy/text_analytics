I received this product for free through a BzzAgent campaign! I’m not sure how to feel about it. I have fairly normal skin with a few breakouts here and there along my cheekbones. After the first application it felt very greasy on the skin and started to flake a little the more I rubbed it in (as told by the instructions). Perhaps it may be better to press into the skin instead of rub? Overall not super impressed nor disappointed. Truly a neutral product for hydration.I don’t think i would spend the money on this. Meh..
