I definitely recommend this oil to anyone who is looking for a light weight oil! I don’t typically use oils on my skin because they cause breakouts, but it truly doesn’t feel like that will happen. I recommend using it once a week and not an everyday thing. I can’t wait to see the results as I continue using it! nan
