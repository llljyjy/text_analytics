This quickly became one of my skin care staples. I only use once a day as twice leaves my skin a little lackluster. However, I notice a difference when I go more than two or three days without using this toner. It is a great daily exfoliator, smells nice, and is not drying. It’s worth getting the value size and a mini for traveling — like I said, I can’t be without this for more than a few days at a time. Skim care staple
