This oil doesnâ€™t feel too heavy or greasy on the skin. A little definitely goes a long way though. It feels so nourishing and my skin feels baby smooth afterwards. It has exceeded my expectations because I feel like my skin texture has improved a lot. Places that are usually very dry have healed! nan
