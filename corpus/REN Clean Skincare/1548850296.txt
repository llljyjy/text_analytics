If you have dry skin and are looking for an overnight moisturizer look no further than this. At first this product may seem to thick but if you warm the product up first it will melt into skin. In the morning skin feels super hydrated and moisturized. Also itâ€™s a clean skincare product and cruelty free which is an added bonus. I did receive this free from Bzzagent. nan
