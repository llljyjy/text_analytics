I was gifted this product I’m exchange to give my honest opinion. I wasn’t to sure how this was going to turn out because I’ve never heard of this brand before. But I’m so glad I tried it! I use it after my moisturizer and before makeup. It leaves my skin so dewy and moisturized all day. A perfect lightweight oil for going into summer. I also use it by mixing it with my makeup to create more of a light dewy finish and it looks beautiful! NEW FAV
