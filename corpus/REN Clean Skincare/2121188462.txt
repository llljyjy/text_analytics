Gifted by REN Skincare. Feels really nice in the skin! I like the consistency, it’s liquidy but not too runny. It absorbs beautifully into the skin and leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh, bright, hydrated and glowing! The only negative for me is the scent but it’s not too overpowering. Loving it!
