The product has a nice scent to it, I’m not really sure how to describe it but it’s not bad, but it is fragrant. It’s a bit liquidy when it comes out of the bottle but otherwise no complaints with how the packaging works. I think it’s been helpful with providing some brightening effects to my skin. Nothing too drastic but it has helped to reduce some of the hyperpigmentation that I currently experience. nan
