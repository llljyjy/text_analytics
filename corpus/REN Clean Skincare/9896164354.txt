This is such an amazing gentle but potent vitamin C serum! My skin was noticeably improved in terms of pigmentation and dullness. There is a clear glow. I am using this as part of my morning routine. I love that this has so many great soothing and nourishing ingredients in addition to Vitamin C. I use this as my all-in-one super serum and keep my routine short.  The texture is a lightweight lotion and feels so lovely on the skin. It absorbs instantly with no tacky residue. Highly recommend! *Gifted by REN skincare for review purposes Excellent Vitamin C serum
