Severely irritated my undereyes. The first couple weeks were ok, but then I developed swollen red lids and dry red patches on my lower eyelid. I wasnâ€™t positive that it was from the eye cream but I stopped using it and the patches went away after a couple days. After a few weeks I decided to try it out again and the same exact thing happened. Not good for sensitive skin. Very Irritating
