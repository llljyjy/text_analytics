Gifted by REN Skincare. This Vitamin C serum is really hydrating and gentle. My skin felt revived and was glowing after the first use. It worked great for my combination skin, not oily at all and absorbs really fast. It’s also lightweight which I really enjoyed. Full of amazing ingredients especially the Superfruit infused ingredients: Kakadu Plum, Dragon Fruit and Pomegranate seed oil. It also has a slight scent but thankfully it doesn’t last long. Great serum
