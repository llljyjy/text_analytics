This is an amazing oil! I started adding oils into my routine a little while back and this one has worked so well into my routine. My skin can get a little red and reactive at times, especially when Iâ€™m stressed, and this has really helped sooth and calm my skin during those time. It absorbs well and leave my skin feeling so good! nan
