I’m so happy this was gifted by REN Skincare because this serum is creamy, but still very lightweight. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves a dewy finish! I’m very impressed with how it’s helped with dullness (caused by this cold winter weather) and hyperpigmentation (caused by hormonal acne). I love that the glass bottle is recyclable and that the pump dispenses just the right amount every single time! Fantastic serum!
