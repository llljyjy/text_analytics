The REN Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic has been a well known product and after trying it I understand why! As a professional makeup artist my skincare is always the most important step in my routine. I have dry skin and started using this toner every other night. Over the past few weeks I have noticed my skin has benefited from the ingredients. I wake up with hydrated and glowing skin which is due to the Azelaic Acid and sugar cane. Over all my complexion has visibly evened out and has a new smooth texture (or lack of) to it. This product has so many benefits that would work well on anyone. Another factor that makes this such a wonderful product is the amount you get. Since this product is used multiple times a week this bottle would last long enough to see results and become apart of your nightly routine. Will definitely recommend, purchase, and continue to explore more products from REN. All in one toner
