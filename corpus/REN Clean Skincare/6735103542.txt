I like that this serum absorbs into the skin very fast and does not leave that sticky feeling afterwards. The only thing I didn’t like is a smell. I know it’s clean product and I love that it has zero waste packaging, but I didn’t see any improvement on my skin. Received complimentary from Ren Clean Skincare Absorbs super quick
