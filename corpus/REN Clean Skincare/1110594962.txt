My favorite mineral SPF. So I’m brown and I have a hard time finding mineral SPF that won’t leave a cast. This is it! It doesn’t. I rub in my palms before applying and it works, and I especially love that it’s matte. I recommend if you’ve experience white cast with other mineral products. Good from brwn skin tones
