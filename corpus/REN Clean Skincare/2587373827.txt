Originally I received a free sample of this product through Sephora that I loved so I was looking to purchase the full size. I ski frequently and have to contend with cold and sometimes severe wind exposure. This balm had been a savior. This PARTICULAR product I received had to be defective. The balm was tinted and there was an unusual amount of oil in the bottom and top of the jar. Very similar to when you purchase natural peanut butter except it could not be mixed back into the balm. Just a sent the return back to Sephora and I hope the issue is remedied. Really very disappointing as I love this balm!! Oil Displacement
