I cannot tell you enough how amazing this product it. Its instant glow, you can’t go wrong with this. I don’t know what people are complaining about of it smelling like barf. It smells like something sour and that’s it. Regardless of how it smells, its a BRILLIANT product. The skin glows instantly after the mask. Game changer
