I received this complimentary from Ren Clean Skincare. This is my first Ren product and Iâ€™m really impressed with the formulation. It helps to add a bit more glow to my skin. Be careful with this formula thirty, 2 pumps is plenty! When I added more than that it caused my sunscreen to pill up. Less truly is more here. Which also makes it a great value for money! A really nice one!
