These are gifted by sweet chef. I love these patches! They feel very comfortable when applied and stay on well. They include a ton of different sizes and the decorative ones are super fun. They work well and help my pimples recover faster!This was gifted by Ren Skincare. This serum was very pleasant to use. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It’s packed with vitamin rich fruit extracts. I have yet to see a brightening effect but this does leave a glowy finish.Also love how sustainable the packaging is and it’s completely recyclable! nan
