I received this complimentary from REN skincare. This is a great, gentle vitamin c serum. It absorbs quickly, leaving a natural dewy finish. Doesn’t irritate my skin at all so far and I’ve been using it everyday now. Still waiting to see brightening effects but with any serum, it’s going to take some time. So far I really like it based on initial impressions nan
