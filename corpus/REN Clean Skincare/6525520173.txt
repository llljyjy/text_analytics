This product BLEW me away. I have combo skin and I am prone to breakouts and I’ve recently discovered how sensitive my skin and this oil was everything I’ve been needing in my skincare routine. I’ve used this in the morning before makeup and it quickly absorbs into my skin and made a wonderful base for makeup. Im usually a little standoffish about putting an oil on my skin before makeup, but this did not make me skin oily whatsoever. This has also saved my skin and kept it nourished and calm while I’ve used and tested out different skincare products that are usually harsh. To really test it, I used a BHA spot treatment that always leaves me with dry peeling skin the next day.. but I applied this oil first and low and behold- NO DRYNESS OR PEELING! I absolutely recommend this. My Newest Skincare Staple!
