I have rosacea and really enjoyed these products. I used the moisturizer before and liked it (simple moisturizer, good for sensitive skin), but was especially pleasantly surprised by the serum and the cleansing milk, which I put on wet skin whenIi get in the shower, and rise it off at the end, and itâ€™s doubling as a calming mask this way. good for sensitive skin
