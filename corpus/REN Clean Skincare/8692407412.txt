complimentary from Ren first product from Ren and I’m impressed. I like the clear heavy glass bottle, could see through the Peachy milky serum (Unique for a regular Vitamin C serums) Love that the pump is made of recycled plastic (zero waste). 100% Sustainable.  LOVE those ingredients I’ve tried multiple products with Kakadu Plum this one is by far the best formula, it’s non-oily very light (takes a couple of minutes to settle on the skin) and leaves skin feeling smooth and bright to the fullest. I could see that it has even out my skin. would 100% Recommend My first ever product from Ren.
