I am in love with REN Evercalm!!! My first instinct was that it would be too greasy and I would end up breaking out due to it. But it just absorbs beautifully into the skin and I instantly feel my skin being nourished and moisturized! I wake up with my skin feeling so well nourished and supple and soft to touch! I would like to see how it performs in the muggy NC summers but for this weather this is a perfect skin savior! Thank you bzzagent and REN for giving this product in exchange for my honest review and I honestly love it! Perfect winter skin savior!
