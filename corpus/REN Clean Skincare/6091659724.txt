Gifted by Ren skincare I have sensitive dry leaning skin and this serum has been really amazing because it doesn’t irritate my skin at all which can sometimes happen with vitamin c type formulas . I love the feel because it’s almost like a gel moisturizer vs a typical serum so it doesn’t leave your skin sticky which is so nice . It’s very hydrating and leaves me looking supple and radiant Love the feel
