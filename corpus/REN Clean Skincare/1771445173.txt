The product is good, my bad review will be for sephora online, we don’t have a space where to rate the service for that!…? it is the second time that they don’t send any samples.What is the point of carefully picking them  up and what is the pro of ordering online if they don’t send what we picked?… it is getting very bad your service! Sephora ONLINE BAD service!
