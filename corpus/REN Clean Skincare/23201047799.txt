I used this cream with Ren’s AHA Toner (as recommended) every other night for almost a week before I had to stop as I woke up with RED spots and bumps! NOT normal for my skin. I only try one new skincare/makeup product at a time so I know that any effects, whether positive or negative, are the results of that particular product. In addition, this “moisturizer” made my skin so dry it was flaking. RED spots, bumps and flakes
