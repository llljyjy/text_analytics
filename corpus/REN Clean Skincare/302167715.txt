Toner is just toner, right? Not after I used bought that large sample of Ren.  I mean, I feel like it does everything it says its supposed to do: exfoliate, visibly brighten and tighten, hydrate for a complexion that’s all “glowy.“ It just took me this long to figure that out. My last toner was the L’Oreal Revitalift Derm Intensives 5% Glycolic Acid Peeling Toner and that was $15, so to jump up to Ren you know that sample was a punch to my skin. The L’Oreal toner was “good“ but Ren really does everything. One of my biggest complaints are those little bumps on my forehead and I do not have an immediate clear up, but between this and the Biosssance Lactic Acid at night a few times a week, it’s really clearing up. Toner is just toner, right? Wrong.
