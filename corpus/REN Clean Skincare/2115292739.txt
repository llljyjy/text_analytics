Love the dewy glow this gives after initial application! The texture is lightweight and absorbs to the skin nicely. I have dry skin and this hydrates my skin well. I’ve only been using this for a week so I haven’t noticed any drastic changes yet. In my opinion the smell is a little off but it doesn’t bother me too much. Looking forward to using this longer to see if this will help with hyper pigmentation! This was gifted by Ren skincare in exchange for an honest review. Dewy glow!
