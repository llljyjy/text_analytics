The REN Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm is very hydrating and is great for extra dry skin. I found it to be a bit oily but as long as balm is separated before applying and then pressed into the skin it should have a smooth application and not as thick. A little bit of product goes a long way. Very hydrating!
