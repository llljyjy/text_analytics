I was gifted by REN skincare in exchange to review. While I have not been using this for a full two weeks yet, I can say this Vitamin C serum has had an impact on my skin. I use this serum nearly every morning, and I do believe my skin is more even. It immediately makes my skin look brighter without causing irritation. The texture is a little thicker than other C serums I have used in the last, but it’s not at all sticky and absorbs well. I use two pumps for my face, neck, and top of my chest. I’m definitely impressed with this serum and look forward to seeing the continued impact it has. nan
