I love that this has so many great superfruit ingredients like kakadu plum, and dragon fruit. All of which helps with fine lines, wrinkles, and pigmentation. I do love the scent of the product. It hasn’t broken my skin due to any allergies. It does provide a radiant glow upon first use. I’ve used it over a week and will continue to use to help with minor hyperpigmentation problems I’m having. Gifted by Ren. nan
