Used this after a chemical peel, and I’m sold! Soothed the itchiness and kept my skin hydrated all-night long. Provides great slip for facial massage with my gua sha tool. Will say that it’s likely more suited to drier, sensitive skin types; my skin did produce more oil than it normally would though it did not break out. Not a problem when my skin is sensitized after a peel, but less than ideal under normal conditions. Great for sensitized skin!
