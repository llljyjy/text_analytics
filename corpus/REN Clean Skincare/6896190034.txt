I have been using the Glow and Protect Serum gifted by REN Skincare for the past week. It is an awesome lightweight serum that absorbs easily into the skin. I love how beautifully it pairs with spf and makeup during the day and with my heavier moisturizer at night. My skin looks glowy when I use it. The star ingredients are Kakadu Plum, Dragon Fruit and Pomegranate seed oil.  I love that the product uses clean ingredients and is planet conscious too. It comes with a pump unlike most of the vit c serums I have used in the past. I feel this is way more time saving and efficient. All in all a great product and is now a staple in my skincare routine. Loving the glow
