I’ve tried a few exfoliating toners on the market and continue to come back to this one, it’s exfoliates the dry skin off easily and leaves my skin glowing, plus you get much more product for the price than some of the others (for example- summer Fridays AHA exfoliating solution). Would definitely highly recommend for glowy, healthy, skin. Really like this one!
