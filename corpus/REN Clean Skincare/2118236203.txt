This Vitamin C serum is amazing. It applies smoothly, is lightweight, and doesn’t make skin greasy. I use it in my AM routine, it is hydrating and surprisingly moisturizing. So, I don’t mind skipping moisturizer and applying sunscreen after this serum. My skin has a healthy glow and looks more even.Love REN products. Gifted by REN Skincare. Hello healthy glow
