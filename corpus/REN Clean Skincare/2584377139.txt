When I first got this I started with the mini but I had just started my tretinoin journey so my skin was superrr sensitive and this stung my skin so I stopped using it. But recently I’ve been dealing with bad texture and scaliness on my face and I tried a few things that weren’t helping and I was so frustrated I would try anything. So I pull this bad boy out and I’m not exaggerating, after the first use my skin was so smooth, soft and glowing. I can’t use this everyday because it will start to sting my skin so I use it every other day and my makeup goes on so much smoother and I don’t have anymore peeling dry looking patches under my foundation. Going to buy the full size now. I’m so happy I gave it a second chance
