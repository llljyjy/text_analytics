I tried this vitamin C serum complimentary from REN Skincare. The first thing I noticed and really liked was the texture of this serum. Itâ€™s similar to a lotion, but a lot thinner and it smoothed onto my skin very nicely and absorbed fairly quickly! I did notice some improvements in the texture of my skin and some of my acne dark spots start to diminish after about 30 days of using the product. It left my skin feeling very glowy after application! nan
