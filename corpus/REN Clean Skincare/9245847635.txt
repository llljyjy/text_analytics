Thankfully this fell in the amazing results category. It definitely does all the things as mentioned in the description, without causing any flare ups for my dry, sensitive skintexture | full star | love this texture for a vitamin c serum. Not sticky at all, easily absorbs into the skin tooscent | .5 star | cannot figure out why, but it smells like corn husk tamales, which is not bad… if it were food. Def not the most appealing thing to smell in the morning, sooo glad the smell doesn’t linger packaging | full star | sustainability taken into account, clean straight to the point branding and pumps > droppers ingredients | .9 star | clean ingredients,  does have parfum though. Would love to see some organic ingredients used value | .8 star | $68 is in line with like products. The smell really throws me off though, have a couple others I’d rather purchase before this. It does work thoughTotal 5.2 out of 6 stars She nice
