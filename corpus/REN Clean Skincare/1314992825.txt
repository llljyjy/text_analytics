Im so in love with the results from the gifted by REN Skincare Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum! I’ve been using the serum morning and night and applying it by gently pressing it with my fingertips onto my cleansed face like the directions say to, then gently massaging in circular upward motions until it’s fully absorbed into my skin. The benefits of this serum include that it brightens, firms, evens skin tone, protects, and smooths texture. This is a super fruit powered serum that brightens with vitamin c and protects with antioxidants. I have noticed my skin tone is brighter and more even and another thing I love is that it has helped reduce the visible signs of photoaging diminishing my fine lines and helping with the dullness I had. I love that it has kakadu plum as an ingredient because it has 100 times more vitamin c then oranges! And my brighter complexion is the proof! Brighter complexion!
