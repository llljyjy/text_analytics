I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare. This product is pretty good so far, upon initial application my skin looks very glowy and it feels nice on the skin. The superfruit ingredients are very gentle on the skin (vitamin c can be really strong), for me this product is a happy medium not super strong but not too gentle to where it feels like it’s doing nothing. The only con for me is the packaging, while I love the zero waste packaging and I’m here for the sustainability the pump shoots out the product and it can become a mess. Overall, I enjoy the product and I’m hopeful that when I finish the bottle i’ll. see even more results! Great for a glow!
