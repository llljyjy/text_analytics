Ready Steady Glow Toner is probably one of the best toners my skin has ever felt !!  My skin feels so amazingly fresh and so very ,vey clean . The way it cleans so deeply I don’t think my skin has ever been this clean . I just love the Azelaic  Acid it makes your skin so smooth. It’s just so gentle but it makes such a difference in the way it exfoliates your skin . It contains lactic acid which also is great on my combination skin type. With combination skin types having a nice AHA toner like this helps it balance your skin out and is so refreshing .  I can literally feel the toner eat up all the dead cells and polish it up . With this toner it makes your skin also feel so much brighter and smoother .The Willow Bark in it  encourages the cell to renew which is amazing !! So if your looking for an awesome toner that makes your skin feel beautiful give this a try you will totally love it ! Excellent Toner
