I was gifted by REN Skincare this product. I’m a sucker for vitamin c serum because I love the brightening effect it has on my skin. My fair skin shows post acne marks really easily and this I think is what contributed to the reduced appearance of the scars. For that alone I give it 5 stars but it’s also creamy and smells wonderful. nan
