This is one of the best facial oils I have used! It’s so soothing and hydrating on my skin. I use it at night and it locks in my skincare so nicely and I wake up with soothed supple skin. One of my favorite things about it is that it’s a lightweight oil formula! It doesn’t feel thick and goopy or like a dry oil on the skin. I’ve also tested it with quite a few different products and haven’t experienced any pilling. You’re going to want to not walk but RUN and pick this oil up!! In my top three oils I’ve tried!
