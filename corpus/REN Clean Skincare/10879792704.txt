complimentary from REN skincareThe serum consistency turned out to be very smooth and nourishing. I feel like my skin loves it at the moment while it’s still kind of dry weather. It contains sqaulane which is a great hydrating ingredient for skin. I even would skip other serums or ampule in the morning before spf while using ren serum. The only one and the biggest con of the ren serum is the scent. There is a very slight hint of citrus, but the major scent is soapy and plasticy. However, I loved how it felt on the skin, so I will go on using it in my morning routine to see the brightening effect on my skin.  I appreciate that the serum comes in a glass bottle with a pump (not with a pipette). However, I found its slightly difficult to use the pump. I either might break when I started pressing the pump for the very first time, or it broke while using it for a several times. Anyway, the pump doesn’t go down all the way, like it stucks halfway at some point. It spits the serum and I dont find it convenient. Feels very smooth and nourishing
