I have never used a facial oil before my skin is pretty combinational so this feels really luxe on my skin. Are use it with a Guacha and it feels like you’re at a spa it smells super nice and it’s really light on the skin I don’t use it every day I use it around once a week and I think it definitely makes my skin a lot more hydrated. Love!
