Before trying the REN Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream my skin felt really chapped, dry , and it was really red on my cheek’s. The 1st day using this brilliant moisturizer my skin felt instantly calm , moisturized & some of my redness was reduced just with one use. Now that I’ve  had it for a few weeks my acne on my chin is gone , my redness has improved dramatically & my skin is so soft. My skin looks better overall. I’m 42 and I have combination skin leaning more dry and sensitive. I usually have issues finding a moisturizer that doesn’t irritate my skin and helps with redness & leaves my skin so soft and moisturized, but this moisturizer seriously amazes me. Most of the moisturizer’s I’ve used for dryness are really thick in consistency & personally I don’t like heavy moisturizer’s. Not REN’s Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream! It has a  light weight formula , that honestly smells so good but not overbearing at all. It doesn’t feel heavy on my face like other moisturizers I’ve used for my skin type. You really do feel a calming effect after using this moisturizer & it reduced my chapped red skin. Plus the scent smells natural, I think it smells a little like rosemary, but again not overpowering at all. REN Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream is great for most all skin types, it’s vegan and cruelty free and made with recycling packaging and so many great ingredients. I love the pump on this moisturizer, I hate some of my other moisturizer’s that I have to dip my fingers into which can cause it to get bacteria in it & we definitely don’t want that! I use a pump and a half and I’m good to go and I know it says it’s a day cream but I love it so much I use it at night as well which personally works for me. I’m really loving this moisturizer and I have recommended to family and friends. I definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin! I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out of this one.
