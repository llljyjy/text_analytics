It’s wonderful! I’ve been using it on and off for years. If I use it once in a blue moon, my skin looks better immediately after taking it off. If I use it regularly over the span of a few months, wow! Your skin looks like it has “clean girl glow” with regular use. Worth the price in my opinion. I love the smell of it too. Texture is better and easier to work with when product is kept in a beauty mini fridge My favorite face mask!
