I received Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum complimentary from Ren Skincare. First off, I really love how environmental friendly this product is! I couldn’t wait to try it! I noticed it had a moisturizer consistency and felt really hydrating. It has a really faint natural sweet citrus fruits scent. I applied it as a night mask and I woke up with smooth moisturized skin. So far I would say I’m really enjoying this serum. Very moisturizing!
