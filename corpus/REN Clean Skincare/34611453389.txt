My name is Ashley and I am a licensed esthetician of 10 years. I am also a beauty tap verified Beauty expert and I have a background in both retail and services working with various beauty companies. I love learning and trying new products to be able to recommend to my clients, family and friends. This is the 1st time that I have used any product from ren. And it won’t be my last time. I was really excited to receive this product and try it out. I tend to lake my toners in a spray form necessary form so I wasn’t sure how I was gonna like the product. Besides that being the only issue I love the results that I received. My skin felt very clean, Smooth, and just all around nicer. It became part of my routine And will be something I will stick with doing. If you haven’t tried this part yet I definitely recommend itEspecially for someone who might be Combination/oily skin. Love it
