I received this product complimentary from Ren Skincare to review. It was an enjoyable product to use but I’m not sure it’s worth the price tag for its claims. Pros: Lightweight, very hydrating, nice smell, great ingredients. Cons: No noticeable difference in dullness, hyperpigmentation, or skin texture though I may just need to use it longer. It doesn’t have a cap either which is a bit odd but it does have a twist lock. nan
