I’ve been using REN Skincare products for almost 5 years now and they’re one of my favourites! I accidentally bought this thinking it was the Clarifying Clay Cleanser but I was happily surprised with this! I really it and helps to keep my skin clear and smooth. The only issue is with the packaging, the gel comes out fast and furious. I think a pump would be a better solution! But highly recommended, I will be repurchasing! great product, could be better packaging
