I use a vitamin C serum every morning without fail, and was excited to rotate this Ren product into my daily routine. Kaduku Plum is the highlighted brightening agent in this, and one of my absolute fave ingredients for giving your skin a glow. I love the serum-cream texture, and it sinks into my skin easily. So far, skin looks glowy and hasnâ€™t caused breakouts, so I like it! Gifted by Ren. Glowy Skin
