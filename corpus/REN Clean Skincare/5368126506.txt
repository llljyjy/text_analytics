This serum has a great lightweight texture and absorbs quickly. Iâ€™ve been using it for the past week and my skin has become more glowy and smooth-textured. It also reduces the appearances of fine lines because of how hydrating it is. Overall, my skin is so happy! The zero-waste packaging is also a bonus. This product was gifted by Ren but all opinions are my own. nan
