I have been using this day cream for three weeks before leaving this review. I have sensitive combination skin with some dry patches around lips and cheek.  What I like the most about this day cream is it is hydrating but not leaving my skin greasy. My dry patches disappear with the continuous use of this moisturizer. My skin feels comfortable and healthy with no irritation. I also like that this product came in pump so I donâ€™t have to worry about product gets polluted over time. Price is reasonable as a little products goes a long way. I will continue using this day cream. Soothing day cream
