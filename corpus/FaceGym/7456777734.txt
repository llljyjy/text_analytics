This exceeded my expectations. It’s a buttery, almost watery lotion texture. Very lux experience. The metal tin is dense and solid quality. The product itself is lightweight, enough to be a day time cream and dries down quickly leaving little stickiness. There is a faint masking-scent apparent however it dissipates reasonably quickly. A couple things to note: this has an outer, reusable metal tin container and an inner plastic “refill” portion. The plastic refill portion has a solid plastic cap. You can either keep the cap on inside the metal tin or remove it. That being said the plastic cap tends to stick to the product inside so I found it easier to just keep the plastic tub open without the lid. I do find that even then residue ends up on the lip of the product resulting in the tub sticking to the metal lid which I have to gently pry off every so often. If you are going to travel with this you MUST keep the plastic lid on or it’ll get messy really fast. Additionally, while I really like this formula I would warn you this is not a rich cream. If you have dry skin this will not lay thick (it’s very lightweight remember) and imo will moderately moisturize. It does a great job hydrating your outer dermis layers though. If you have dry or broken barrier this may not be your holy grail but for a day-to-day moisturizer I really enjoy it. Would definitely recommend if you have the money to splurge. Finally, I did notice a very very faint white cast. Not sure why but if you have really dark skin it may be bothersome to you. It’s a 50/50 on my light/borderline medium tone if the white cast is apparent but if you rub it in well it should work itself out. Worst case it’s nothing a light BB cream or tinted sunscreen couldn’t resolve. nan
