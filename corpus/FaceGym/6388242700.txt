I love gel moisturizers and the texture of this one is nice and light, isn’t sticky, just feels good on the skin. The ingredients are great, it definitely brightens my face, and things are looking promising so far. This is my first product from the brand and I’m really enjoying it in my routine!Gifted by FaceGym for review. nan
