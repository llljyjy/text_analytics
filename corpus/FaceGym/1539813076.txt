I didn’t realize that FaceGym had a skincare line. I have seen all the buzz over Instagram about the locations were you hang at your face sculpted and always thought that idea was so unique. Unfortunately I don’t live close to one of the locations by love her with us product you can I’ll bring the FaceGym home. The serum gifted by FaceGym has a very silky velvety feel when applying and I noticed right away that it helped with brightening my skin. They also have tutorials on their website so you can bring the tools and techniques of face gym at your house. I love the packaging I think it’s very smart and how it’s easy to travel and you can also have a standing up on your counter even though it’s in a tube form. Will definitely recommend. A workout for your face
