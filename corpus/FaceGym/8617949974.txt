My skin has been lacking hydration so I decided to give this hydrating active facial roller by Face Gym a try. I love that they included a QR code for a how to video, it made it a lot easier to use.  I think this is a very neat product, I just wish each roll was a little less money since you do use a new one each time. Overall my skin did feel more hydrated and smoother. Definitely works!
