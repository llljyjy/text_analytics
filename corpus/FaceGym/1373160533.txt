Gifted by Face Gym.The packaging design is cool and I like that the tube contains a pump. There is also a QR code on the tube that shows you how to apply the moisturizer for maximum sculpting and lifting effect. The moisturizer itself is a lightweight gel with a light citrus scent. I love that it has Vitamin C and Niacinamide. It absorbs well and is exactly the type of moisturizer I like for my combination skin. Great Multi-Tasking Product!
