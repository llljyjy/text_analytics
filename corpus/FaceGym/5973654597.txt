I really liked the skincare products, especially the oil and moisturizer. The cream is super silky smooth and  the oil is hydrating and lightweight.  Definitely pricey but they work well. Real talk tho I felt kind of ridiculous rubbing this face gym massage ball over my face. I followed the videos as it instructs, and while I do believe in the benefits of face massage/lymphatic drainage techniques -- I just can’t see myself using this everyday. This was gifted by FaceGym and I’ll continue to use the skincare products but probably not the ball. Great products but the ball is weird.
