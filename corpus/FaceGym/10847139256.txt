I actually really enjoyed this mini set with the massage ball. The products are great. The cream is so moisturizing and the oil is also amazing. The massage ball help relieve a lot of facial tension. I also really like the travel bag it came in. There’s a QR code you can scan for directions and to follow your progress. It’s like having a trainer for your skin.  Gifted by FaceGym. nan
