The person who gave this a negative review bought the refill, ignore their complaints. Buy the actual product and then the refill after youâ€™ve used it up. It comes with an aluminum jar the refill pod goes into. Works great. Non-greasy, has a faint hospital smell that fades fast. Has seriously helped with fine lines and blemish marks. amazing cream.
