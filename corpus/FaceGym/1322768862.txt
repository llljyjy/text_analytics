I really enjoyed using this treatment and I saw results from first use. The skin definitely felt firmer and smoothed out the fine lines. My pores also looked better. After you activate the treatment with the serum it does absorb pretty quickly on the face so make sure to spread quickly otherwise you may miss some spots. I liked starting with the eye area and forehead and whatever was left i put on the rest of my face. This is just a tip because it’s so precious you don’t want to miss any spot during the application. Definitely a great treatment! I received this complimentary from FaceGym. Saw results from first use
