I was recently gifted by FaceGym the Brightening Active Roller and I have immediately experienced a more radiant even compexion overall.  So very gentle on my skin and was super easy to use and put together. It does have a bit of a tacky finish but I must say that my dark spots werenâ€™t as noticeable than before. Radiant and Even Skin approved!
