I received these products for free from Influenster and FaceGym in exchange for my honest review.I have started to incorporate face oils into my nightly routine in the winters so I was excited to try this Face Gym oil. It’s lightweight and moisturizing and I like that the brand has exercises to follow to make the most of the product. I haven’t experienced any big changes so far but it does keep my skin hydrated. nan
