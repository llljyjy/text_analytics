I was gifted by FaceGym this brightening cleanser. This is a really nice cleanser. I love that you don’t need a large amount, it’s gentle on the skin, and I didn’t find it drying. I like to use it in the morning, and my skin feels awake, refreshed, and clean. As far as the pores being minimized, not so much. But we all know that at this point I really enjoyed this face wash
