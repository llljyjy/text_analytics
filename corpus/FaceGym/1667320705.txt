This serum is a must. It replaces so many other serums. I love that it contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.  My skin is very red and can get patchy. This soothes my skin and calms the redness. I love that. The color of the bottle is so pretty. The texture is smooth and not sticky. It doesnâ€™t leave a film on your skin. It absorbs well. nan
