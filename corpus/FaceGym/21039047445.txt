I recently started using this brand and I like it more and more with every product I try. This set is unique and so different, it contains everything needed to start a good skincare routine: brightening cleanser, face oil, collagen moisturizer and it includes a ball as a fun factor, definitely a neat concept about exercising the facial muscles, which helps with firmness and elasticity of the skin and it is so relaxing.My favorite of this kit is the oil, I am definitely going to purchase it again, it seems to work well for my skin type.
