This is one of the few products that actually provides instant results! Despite being a microneedling roller, this is safe for sensitive skin. I have sensitive, redness prone skin, eczema prone skin and I did not experience any sensitivity or reaction to this product. I was gifted by FaceGym used the Face Gym Active Brightening Roller as directed during my night time skincare routine and the next morning I was shocked. All the post acne hyperpigmentation spots on my cheeks that Iâ€™ve struggled to get rid of the past 3 years lightened SIGNIFICANTLY overnight. I have provided photos documenting this. 11/10 recommend if you struggle with discoloration or hyperpigmentation! MUST HAVE if you struggle with hyperpigmentation
