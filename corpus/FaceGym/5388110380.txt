This was gifted by Face Gym in exchange for a honest review. I have acne prone areas of skin (chin and forehead) and always looking for products to help with hyperpigmentation from acne. I have tested this product daily for about 2 weeks. Texture wise- itâ€™s lightweight and beautiful to apply. Scent is not heavy which I can tolerate. Results wise- I noticed bright glowy skin but no change to my dark spots. Gives glowy skin
