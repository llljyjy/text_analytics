Love love love this serum! I actually have 5 other comparable serums to throw this formula up against, and this one is my favorite! I do not like heavy products or products that take a long time to absorb. This product goes right into my skin, it’s a lot lighter feeling and thinner feeling than other formulas. I would say you need to use a tad more than my other serums to cover your face, but it’s a great feeling serum and I will be sad when it’s gone because I don’t know if I can justify spending this much on a serum that I know I can get the same ingredients for a lot less. That’s why it’s getting 4 stars and not 5. Also my other serums come with more product than this. lightweight serum
