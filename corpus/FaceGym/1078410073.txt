I received the Skin Changer Essence Toner gifted by SkinGym in exchange for my honest feedback. This toner has powerhouse ingredients- exfoliating acid improves skin texture, quince extract soothes inflammation, and I love that the exfoliating pumpkin extract is upcycled.At first, I felt that this Essence Toner was making my skin feel a bit dry. This could be due to the fact that I usually buy Korean toners and essences and am used to their formulas. I found though that my skin adapted quickly after just a few uses and as long as I use the product on damp skin and immediately follow with a hydrating serum, I am good to go.I recently transitioned on and then off a new medication, which caused breakouts. I think that this 2 in 1 Essence Toner really helped stabalize my skin during this transition, because the spots cleared up really quickly. I havenâ€™t noticed any other changes, but I look forward to seeing long term results. Great for transitions
