I’ve always been afraid of using microneedling devices as I thought it must be painful. I still decided to try this one out and boy I’m so happy I did! This roller is definitely the best thing that has ever happened to my skin! I used it as a part of my pm routine and woke up to a healthier and more even complexion next morning! My post acne spots have almost gone after just one use! And what’s really important is it didn’t hurt at all it was even kind of relaxing. I’m amazed at this thing!
