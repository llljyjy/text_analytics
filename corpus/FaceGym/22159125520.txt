I received the FaceGym Faceshot Electric Microneedling Device and it really did make my skin much more even and glowy. One thing I did not like about the faceshot was that the serum spilled when attaching to the cartridge. It was like 1/3 of the serum wasted when inserting it. I also wish the device came with a few more ampoules to really see a difference. The ampoules and needles are one time use and are quite expensive. If you are okay with spending $80 on 4 serums than I would suggest this product. If you are not okay with the ongoing cost, I would not suggest this product. nan
