FaceGym gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.I am so thankful I got to try FaceGym’s LIFTWEAR Vitamin C + Bioferment Gel-Cream Moisturizer — it is now absolutely one of my favorites because it works! This super lightweight, non-greasy gel moisturizer with a serum like texture/consistency absorbs easily into the skin. I love how my face instantly feels and looks.Even after just the first use, I immediately noticed my face feels more taut, firm, smooth and radiant. I know that’s quite a big claim but I am a believer.Follow the recommended FaceGym V-Lift Method of massaging your face with hands and knuckles, to see even better results. This step is worth the extra time to wake up the face muscles, depuff and lift.My makeup applies well and stays in place over this moisturizer (even without primer!) but I am happy going makeup free (maybe just brow, eyeliner and mascara) because of how wonderful FaceGym LIFTWEAR makes my face look and feel. It’s a winner for me, LIFTWEAR is now in my skincare rotation and I will definitely make an appointment to FaceGym soon! WORTH IT!!!
