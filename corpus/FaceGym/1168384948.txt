FaceGym has an interesting and unique take on the rising trend in Gua Sha use. I’ve never seen anyone offer video lessons specifically designed for their Gua Sha before, but it is what many newbies to the practice would love to have. I love how much was thought about in the design of this product, it’s easy to tell by looking at it that it was designed with purpose. It’s easy to use, and my face feels incredible after using it. I was hoping to get less swelling and tension around my jaw area, and I can say for certain I’ve received both. Gifted by FaceGym. nan
