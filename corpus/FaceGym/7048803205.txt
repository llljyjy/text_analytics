i have been using this product since November 2021, and i love it. this product was not gifted to me, i bought it out of sheer curiosity, and i’m glad i did. it’s very hydrating and leaves my skin glowing in the morning. however, if you have a sensitive nose, this isn’t the product for you! there is a strong pine smell to it, but i absolutely love it !! will be buying this for the rest of my life!! incredible!! with a hint of pine(:
