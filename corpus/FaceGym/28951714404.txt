I’ve enjoyed using the Face Shot so far.  It wasn’t painful like you might imagine it to be. My skin felt pretty nice afterwards. I think this will be extremely beneficial and a very useful addition to my skincare routine after more usage. I definitely will continue to use. Gifted by FaceGym So far so good
