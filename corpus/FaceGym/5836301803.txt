This is an expensive but effective at home microneedling device. I like the sterile needle head replacements, as I feel like you can never get a microneedling tool clean enough at home, and the introduction of bacteria to the skin freaks me out. Once in a while, it really feels like a treat for the face, and I do recommend it. Gifted by FaceGym. Expensive but worth it
