This device works but takes some time to get used to. This is the second kind of microneedling device I have used at home. To charge the device you plug it in, and it takes about an hour to charge. During charging time, I read about the device and watched the video on how to use it. My first time using the device something went wrong. It didnâ€™t work the way it should have. The liquid did not want to come out of the microneedle cartridge and the cartridge seemed lose on the device, but no matter how I tried to get it in, it would not stay put. Each cartridge is one time use. The second time I used the device it worked just as it should. I love that there are different speed settings that help if you are just starting out and helps those with more experience. You can give yourself three treatments with this set and then you need to buy refills after that which can get expensive. This device works, but there are too much waste and extra costs associated to it. nan
