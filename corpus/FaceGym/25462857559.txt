I am actually impressed with this kit. having the ball there to do some messaging was pretty neat. I just wish that the instructions were a little bit easier to understand or at least include some pictures of how to do it, but i guess you can get them online.  the cleanser is fabulous and the oil is fantastic. my skin felt super soft and healthy. the moisturizer is great as well. This kit has been great to use. gifted by FaceGym it's pretty good
