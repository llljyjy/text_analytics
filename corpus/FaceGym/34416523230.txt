Complimentary from FaceGym. This was the first time I had tried a product like it so I was nervous that it would hurt my skin since it is sensitive but it did not. However, I wish it came with more liquid as I find it is used up rather quickly and it is expensive to purchase more. However, it still beats going to a dermatologist! nan
