This is a nice light moisturizer. I like that it’s hydrating and has vitamin C, which I like to incorporate in my routine. I have nothing to complain about, it’s just not a groundbreaking product. My skin is pretty happy, it’s just not the best of my life. I’m happy to have gotten this gifted by FaceGym. nan
