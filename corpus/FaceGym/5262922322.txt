This was gifted by FaceGym, and I wanted to like it. That being said, this is very expensive and I’m not sure that it is worth it. I didn’t notice a significant change in my skin after using it, aside from having more dry patches. My skin does not love hyaluronic acid so that could be why. I have seen success with other collagen products that help plump the skin but this didn’t really do that for me. It could just be that you need to use it for longer than seven days though. Not for me, might work for you
