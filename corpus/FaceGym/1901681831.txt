I went out on a whim and purchased this cleanser before it had any reviews and I’m SO happy I did. While it didn’t have any reviews the ingredients seemed right up my alley, I wanted something to gently unclog my pores daily and the enzymes in this spoke to me. I’ve been using this for a little over a month, my super sensitive skin (I have rosacea) has been calmer, brighter and smoother since using this. It’s now become a staple in my skincare regimen and has replaced my old holy grail cleanser (greek yoghurt foaming cream cleanser). If you’re on the fence, go for it! Holy Grail
