This was received complimentary from FaceGym.  I never heard of the brand before and was a bit hesitant to buy. This is by far the BEST face cleanser I have ever used.  The packaging is beautiful. Like the reviews say, a little goes a long way! I have dry skin especially in the winter however, this had my skin so hydrated.  it is a clear gel with not much of a scent.  My skin was glowing and my pores looked amazing!  This is my new holy grail cleanser! Holy Grail
