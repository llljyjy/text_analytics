This product was gifted by FaceGym and they have just welcomed a new fan. I have sensitive skin (combination) and I wasn’t sure how this would react on my skin. After following the directions (slight learning curve, but easy once you know), I noticed my skin was soft, plump and glowy. I tend to see fine lines on my forehead (I’m 27 years old for reference) and they aren’t as obvious after this week’s usage. If you have pigmentation, this product would definitely help fade those spots. The packaging is sleek and fun to unwrap -  I plan on working this into my existing skincare routine and honestly excited to see how my skin continues to look. Plumper skin!
