I was a little nervous to use this, but Iâ€™m happy with the results. I experienced some slight irritation afterwards, which was to be expected because I have sensitive skin, but that soon went away. My skin was visibly brighter after one application.  I highly recommend viewing the how to video before you use the roller so you get the full benefits. I received the Brightening Active Rollers complimentary from FaceGym. Brightens Skin
