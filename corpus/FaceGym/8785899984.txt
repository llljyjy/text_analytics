So I was gifted by facegym the 7 day active blast  collagen pack! I was really excited to try it because the packaging was super exciting looking and the process of dissolving a pearl into a serum seemed cool! I did all 7 days and my skin does feel soft! Didnâ€™t really help with my hyperpigmentation though :/ nan
