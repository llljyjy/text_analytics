I received this ball complimentary from FaceGym, but I am not crazy about this product. I thought the directions of use on the packaging was vague and was disappointed that I couldnâ€™t easily find a video on the company Website. I found a video on YouTube, which I replicated. It felt silly to rub this ball over my face. I feel like I could do the same movements/massages with my fingers. This Feels Like a Silly and Unnecessary Product
