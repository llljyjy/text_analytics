I received this product complimentary from Face Gym. This serum is so hydrating, I’ve been mixing it with my evening moisturizer and I’ve noticed a visible difference in how hydrated my skin looks in the morning. It’s very gentle on my sensitive skin and the dropper is super easy to use. So hydrating!
