I am new to this brand, but happy to try the Youth Reformer that I was gifted by FaceGym. It is a oil in serum that is suppose to Reduce signs of aging, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin brighter, firmer and more youthful looking… I have only been using it for one week now  in the morning and I have to say that I do enjoy using it and impressed with the results so far… It absorbs nicely and does not leave my skin feeling oily or sticky. Plus I really do feel like my skin is looking brighter and healthier! I look forward to continuing to use this and see what the results are when the bottle is empty! nan
