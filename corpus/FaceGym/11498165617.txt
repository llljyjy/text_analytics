I received this complimentary from FaceGym and was really excited to test it out as it’s my first guasha! My favorite part of this product is definitely the build quality, the metal is heavy and feels good in the hand. It holds onto the air temperature which makes it really cool against the skin, adding to the soothing and depuffing qualities of guasha. I’m excited to keep this as a part of my nightly routine :-) High Quality!
