Love the novelty of this set - the bag is super cute, always a fan of travel-sized skincare and of course, the ball is fun. I LOVE the face oil, I would gladly put that all over my face and body. That being said this is a pricey set, I think if you want to try the brand or get a sampling of all things FaceGym this is great but itâ€™s on the higher end. nan
