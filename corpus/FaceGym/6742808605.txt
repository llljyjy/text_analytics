I love the packaging, the bag it came in & the ball. This is a very time consuming routine, so if you want a quick regimen this probably isnâ€™t for you. I was pretty shocked at the price point, I definitely think $75 is step for this set. There are products out there better for less. I appreciate it coming with a QR code listing steps. I think this would be great for a teenager or someone just being introduced to skincare :) gifted by FaceGym nan
