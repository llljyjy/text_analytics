I was a little nervous to try at home micro-needling, but overall this is such an easy to product to use. I love how this makes my skin feel over time, super soft and hydrated - which is saying a lot because my skin is chronically dry and I struggle with dry spots. This doesn’t hurt at all, although my one gripe is that at home tools like this can’t be professionally sanitized, so I feel like you’re better off using this as single-use. The price point of this is pretty expensive though so I’m not sure I would purchase. Fun treatment but expensive
