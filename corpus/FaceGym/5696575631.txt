I received this Faceshot Electric Microneedling Device + Vitamin Ampoules complimentary from FaceGym and I’m giving my honest feedback. This is my very first micro-needling experience and I’m so excited. It’s gentle and it doesn’t hurt at all. I hope there are more Vitamin Ampoules since they are expensive to purchase.  Also, I hope there’s a more concise video tutorial. nan
