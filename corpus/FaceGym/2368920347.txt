I normally use the jade roller and this is my first time using GUA SHA so I had to watch some tutorial videos. Itâ€™s ama-zingggg, I feel like it improves my overall skin texture and reduce a bit of puffiness as well. I personally love keeping it in the fridge for the cooling effect. I am so excited to see the long term results! - gifted by FaceGym Win-Win for me!!!
