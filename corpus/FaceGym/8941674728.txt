I received this product complimentary from FaceGym.I love this cream. It is a little thicker in consistency so I like to use it at night.It is hydrating but not too heavy, and it absorbs easily in under a minute.It does not irritate my skin or upsets my dry spots.It layers well on top of other products and does not pill.If you scan the QR code in the package it shows their sculpt application method. The technology behind it is pretty cool as it uses movement to help with fine lines. I canâ€™t wait to see results long term.The jar packaging feels very luxurious and well made. It is also refillable which is a huge plus.Overall I really enjoy this. Good high quality product
