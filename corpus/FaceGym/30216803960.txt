I was skeptical about whether or not a rubber ball would be helpful for a facial massage pro like me...that’s why I tried this. It was gifted complimentary from facegym. I was surprised and pleased at how out immediately worked muscles/myofascial tissue that really needed attention. As someone who holds a lot of tension in her face, this is important. I also love that it’s gentle but still works! Gentle and effective tension release
