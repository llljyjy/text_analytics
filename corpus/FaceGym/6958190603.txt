This is a very timely routine that I had to force myself to do and I often would skip using the ball in general. I did enjoy the video tutorials on how to massage the areas of the face and neck with the products while using your hands. I did not notice much difference after the 14 days but enjoyed the feel of the face oil and cream. The containers are also very small but product lasts about a month. Iâ€™m literally stunned on how much the price of this kit is and would probably never purchase this. I received this free to test. nan
