First time using, I absolutely fell in love. My skin feels so soft. Usually I hate the feeling of serums but not this one. It sticks but doesn’t make my skin feel greasy. In fact, my face feels clean. And the massage ball is incredible. To sum up, these products leave you with that “come feel my face” moment. Feel how soft my face is!
