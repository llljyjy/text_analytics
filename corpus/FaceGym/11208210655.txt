I really enjoyed this entire FaceGym set. The line seems to be formulated with high quality ingredients, and each item worked well for my dry skin. The cleanser was probably my favorite item, as I loved the smooth frothy texture it becomes when it mixes with water. I also loved that it did not leave my skin feeling tight or dry. I also really enjoyed the moisturizer and facial oil. The moisturizer is very rich, and feels a little oily (likely due to the high level of squalane), but I did not mind this. The facial oil is very nourishing, and I enjoyed using it at night as the last step in my routine.  I honestly did not try the PVC ball for facial massage, as I donâ€™t see myself incorporating this into my routine on a regular basis... I enjoyed this set, and the products seem very high quality, but the price point is too expensive for me to consider making these staple items in my routine. * I received this product complimentary from FaceGym in exchange for my honest review. * High Quality but Expensive
