This face ball has helped me release a lot of tension in my jaw. I clench my jaw and teeth when I am stressed. I use it after my face routine when my face and muscles are more relaxed, itâ€™s my own little face massage.  It kind of helps sculpt my jaw naturally as well. Gifted to me by Face Gym. No more Jaw Pain
