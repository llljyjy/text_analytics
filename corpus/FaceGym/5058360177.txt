Complimentary from FaceGym. I am always skeptical of the 7 day difference type products but this one lives up to the hype. My skin looks and feels better and I don’t look as tired as I have been.I’ve taken collagen supplements but never a straight collagen like treatment on my skin - so this was different for me.  i just turned 40 and have some fine lines and while I still look younger than my age, the fine lines and such are creeping in.I noticed my skin felt a lot smoother and firmer around day 4. I don’t have any issues with pigmentation - so I can’t speak on that, but by the end of the treatment system - the fine lines appeared much less noticeable as well. I would absolutely repurchase this and already have an order in for another set. Lives Up To The Hype
