This was gifted by Face Gym.  I will definitely be buying more rollers.  I had never tried a kind of micro needling product before, but really saw and felt the benefits.  It was just tiny little prickly feeling, and rolled on easily.  My face felt smooth, looked refreshed and felt great when I finished.  I wouldn’t do it right before you go out on a hot day though, it made my face tingle.  That was my fault though.  Really amazing product, and it came with the reusable roller, two rolls, and a cute carrying bag.  Face Gym is a great brand, nothing but positive results in the products I’ve tried.  I’ve already praised them to others. Amazing
