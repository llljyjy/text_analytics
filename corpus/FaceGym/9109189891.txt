I really like this one. My face is definitely smoother and looks much healthier. My skin is glowing. As far as wrinkles and lines,  I see a bit of improvement. My skin seems plumper which I think is the reason my lines are less noticeable. Either way, my skin looks much better. This is sheer coverage which I really like and the odor is minimal. It goes a long way too. I really do like the way my skin is looking and love the way this feels on my skin. I am using it morning and evening. Love this product
