The serum and collagen were easy to mix and use. I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn’t live any residue on my skin. I do believe that after using it for a week, my skin is more radiant. There has also been a slight reduction in fine lines. I’d be interested to see if I used it for 28 days if I saw a more drastic reduction in lines. Overall, I definitely recommend. This product was gifted to me by Face Gym. nan
