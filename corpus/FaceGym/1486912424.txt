*complimentary from Face Gym*I use a variety of face washes, but gel ones are my favorites and I’m always ready to try a new one. I love the sleek and simple design of Face Gym electro-lite enzyme brightening gel cleanser. The tube has a QR code on the back to scan for face sculpting application methods. I really appreciate that it’s so accessible right there on the tube rather than on the packaging or app (which either I don’t save or which requires extra effort). The cleanser has a nice gel texture that’s not too thin and a little goes a long way. It works well at removing makeup residue as well as a morning cleanser, and it leaves the skin clean, fresh, comfortable and balanced. The scent is mild and barely detectable, but it reminds me of burned plastic, so it bothers me a bit (but not enough to not use the product). Overall I am very happy with this product and I would use it again. Great simple face wash
