I’ve never tried anything from FaceGym so I was excited to try this! As a moisturizer, it has a lightweight consistency and has a tacky finish. I use about two pumps for my drier skin, but I think this would work better for me in the summer, it’s not as hydrating as I like. I also think the packaging is a little bulky. Overall, I think there are better moisturizers out there, especially for the price.  Gifted by FaceGym. There’s good and bad
