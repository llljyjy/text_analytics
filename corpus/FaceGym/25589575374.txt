Great product! I’m new to using face oils and I’m pleasantly surprised. I love how moisturizing, yet lightweight this product is and how great my skin looks and feels when I wake up in the morning (I use this product at night).I’m also a big fan of face massages and this oil is just perfect to use (I was using serums before and it wasn’t as good). All in all, I’m pretty happy with this oil and I’m excited to see the long term results of using this product !Was gifted to me by FaceGym nan
