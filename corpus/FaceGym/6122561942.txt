Ok, I received this product complimentary from FaceGym, but I still have to be honest that I think it’s a huge ripoff. At first I thought it would be a nice addition to a skincare routine but the rollers have to be replaced after every single use, and they are TWENTY dollars a piece and come in a pack of four. If you did this once a week it would be literally $80 a month. To me, nothing is worth that. But if you don’t mind that price tag, I think it’s definitely a way to add a new level and luxury feel to your skincare routine. Nice, but overpriced
