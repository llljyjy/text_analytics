The packaging is super cute!!! It’s literally a little gym bag for your face. I can definitely appreciate the thought in the details. This is a very good way to try out the brand and get a feel for the products. My favorite so far is the oil. It’s lightweight but it’s a nice prep for the moisturizer. My skin looks plump and hydrated. The complete system works very well together and I’m very excited to try more products from this brand. nan
