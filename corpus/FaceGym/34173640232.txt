This Face gym hydrating roller is my first face roller product. After a week I felt that my skin was softer and has a little more glow than usual! Used it in conjunction with products like serums. Only downside is that it’s extremely pricey. But the result seems promising and I’m interested in seeing how this works out long term. nan
