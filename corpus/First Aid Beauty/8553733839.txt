I have extremely dry , sensitive skin that gets red looking very easily if irritated. I have tried MANY hydrating hyaluronic acid serums, and this one is the BEST. I can feel the difference on my skin after I use it when usually that doesn’t happen with any hydrating serum. Absolutely love it. I also have acne prone skin and this stuff doesn’t make me break out. I’ve been using it for months. Finally found a holy grail hyaluronic acid I think SO HYDRATING plus 0 breakouts
