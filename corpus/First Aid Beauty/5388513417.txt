I was given this product in exchange for an honest review. I am pretty impressed with this serum and itâ€™s ingredients. I have been using it every morning for a week and I enjoy it and the glow it gives my skin. With vitamin C I think it can take a while to see the results of fading acne scars and hyperpigmentation, but so far so good! Yes!!
