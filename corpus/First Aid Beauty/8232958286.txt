I do love the packaging style of this the twist up cap- Its so good for travel because of the anti-spil mechanism. Plus I think this bottle is a little bit larger than some of the other serums so you get a lot of product in one. The scent of the product is similar to their exfoliating wipes where it smells a little bitter but nothing too crazy. The serum itself was a little bit runnier than I had expected but definitely light weight on the skin. I applied it right onto my neck and then my forehead since my cheeks can be a little oversensitive to certain products. It is safe for sensitive skin I just chose these areas to target for a trial. Its a tad sticky but it does dries fast so that should wear off after application good serum
