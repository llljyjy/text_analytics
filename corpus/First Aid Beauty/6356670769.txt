it’s not a bad moisturizer and i love most of the ingredients, but i really hate when brands put diamond dust and stuff to make your skin look more luminous ’cause it’s only temporary and washes off. so you don’t actually know if your glowing complexion is because of results from the work your doing or just diamond powder. i wish they would take it out. also, maybe i’m just super dry in the winter, but it’s not that thick and dries down kinda matte. feels like a mask on your face. nan
