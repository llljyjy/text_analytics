I used the sunscreen every two hours as directed. I typically donâ€™t enjoy matte sunscreen, but I think this one is great for when it is super hot because my forehead is super shiny. I will say it does leave a white cast, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but this can be corrected if you rub it in really good. Matte Feel, but does an amazing job!
