I have been using the First Aid Beauty Ultra repair cream intense hydration for about 2 months now. I originally bought the small ounce bottle and fell in love with the product and I immediately bought the 6 ounce. - It hydrates- No grease feeling- Left my skin looking smoothAll I could say if you do have oily skin, the hydration may be a bit too much, but for my combo skin/sensitive I felt like it was fine. I would definitely repurchase this product (: Hydrated skin is happy skin!
