I know, I know sunscreen is so important but my skin is so sensitive it always causes me to break out and have weird reactions so I tend to not wear as much as I should. but this sunscreen is a godsend! It doesn’t make me sticky at all, doesn’t make me have a rash or breakout, washes off so easily, and lasts. I can easily apply makeup over it without worry. got it just in time for summer and will definitely be wearing sunscreen as much as I should now that I have found my perfect match!
