I had high expectations because of the reviews but honestly I didn’t feel like it did anything for me. I have oily skin and at 30 still deal with acne so I’m always trying new things. While it leaves the face refreshed, it doesn’t look or feel like it does anything to my acne compare to the Peter Thomas Roth correction pads where I see it working instantly. While it’s nice it doesn’t sting my face, I don’t think I will purchase this product again. Not for me
