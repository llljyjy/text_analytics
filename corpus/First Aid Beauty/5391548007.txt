Highly recommend adding this serum to your morning routine. With combo, sensitive, and acne-prone skin, I had already experienced a visibly brighter  and even complexion by the end of my first week of use. My acne spots faded and certain darker areas on my face evened out, plus I had no breakouts occur. The overall feel of the product was light and cooling- very comfortable! Fast Acting Gem!
