My skin is dry in the summer, and VERY dry in the winter. It is the perfect amount of thickness and hydration at night for both seasons! Towards the fall and winter, I can get away with using morning and night without looking oily. I break out easily on my face, jaw, neck and this did NOT break me out. I’m even post-partum with hormones going wild... This calmed and nourished my skin. A dermatology influencer that I respect on Youtube had recommended a similar version of this that has collagen. I tried this cream that has nearly the same ingredients instead of the collagen-focused firming cream because I know collagen does not penetrate the skin barrier anyhow. I’m glad I did. Perfect at night for all seasons
