Winter is coming and I often have dry, sensitive skin from hot showers and baths. This cream soaks in perfectly and the colloidal oatmeal really calms down the redness from my keratosis pilaris. I stocked up on the sale, but have been using this for several months and highly recommend it! The cream is a nice consistency that allows you to evenly spread the cream on arms, legs, and some even use it on their face! This is now a part of my post-shower/bath routine. I have very sensitive skin and appreciate the lack of fragrance and irritating ingredients. No corners cut here! Definitely worth a try! My new favorite body cream!
