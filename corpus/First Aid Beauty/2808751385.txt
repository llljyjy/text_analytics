I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed my complexion looking better. I really like this product and will continue to buy it, but it did take a little bit to notice results. The product is very lightweight and just feels good on the skin! Also the container for it brings me so much Serotonin when opening and closing it! But yeah- the product does what it says! vitamin c!
