I had been using the Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum (previous version of this serum?) for about 3 years. Every year during sales event I stock up 2-3 of those for the year. I ran out earlier than I thought this year so I went to the store on the way home to grab one. I’m not gonna lie I panicked when I saw from afar that the familiar packaging got taller. I thought to myself, oh man they better not changed the formulation - and lord and behold they did changed it. I have very dry and sensitive skin. If it is not right my skin either gets so dry it starts peeling, or I break out. I am very cautious about my hydrating serum and cream. I considered alternatives but decided to give the new formulation a try first. The older version of the serum is a clear gel while the new formulation is milky but lighter and runnier. So far here’s how I feel about it:- New formulation absorbs faster. I used to wait ~1 minute before I apply other things with the old formulation. With the new one, it’s pretty much all gone after I finished rubbing it in.- After a week of usage, my skin feels significantly smoother. It did not reduce my redness (the old formulation didn’t either) but definitely feels more hydrating.- Did not produce any negative effect on my skin. No breakout, peeling skin, etc.- Still doesn’t smell like anything like the old one.Overall I am very pleasantly surprised. THANK YOU for not ruining my face’s saviour. The team who created this formulation - I see you and I appreciate you.TLDR - new formulation is somehow better than the old one. Would recommend if you like old formulation. For those who love the old formulation, long story
