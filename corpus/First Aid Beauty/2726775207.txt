I received this product for free for an honest review. I like this product for no makeup days. It doesnâ€™t have a smell and leaves no white cast. It does take a little bit to absorb in the skin. I like that it is spf 30 for my face. My preference for face product is an spf/moisturizer combo. I love first aid beauty products and they make up about 80% of my skincare routine. If this product has a moisturizer in it, I would give it 5 stars. nan
