Iâ€™ve been hearing about the benefits about Vitamin C for my skin so I figured I would give the First Aid Beauty Vitamin C serum a try. I applied it after I cleansed my skin in the morning. It was lightweight and not sticky at all! I was afraid that my skin would break out with another product on my skin but that was not the case at all. I could definitely see a difference in my skins brightness and overall appearance. First Aid Beauty has created another effective and beneficial product that I can add to my daily routine without worrying about breakouts or damage. Thank you for another fab product, FAB! Great product
