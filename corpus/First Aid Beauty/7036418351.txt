I have been using this product for 4 days, and I love it does not have a strong fragrance, you only need to use a little bit. My face feels more moisturized and hydrated. I feel more of a natural glow after using this brightening serum with my make up on. I have sensitive skin and will get rashes and small break outs with some products, but I have not had that experience with any First Aid Beauty products. nan
