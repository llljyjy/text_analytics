Been using this as a night time moisturizer, feels great on the skin, very nice ingredient list/formula, doesn’t smell, and doesn’t sweat out like most heavy moisturizers I have tried… and is significantly less expensive than most other brands of this quality, highly recommend! The only caveat is that it just isn’t very exciting. It does what I want it to do, which is moisturize & occlude, and the colloidal oatmeal seems to soften & heal blemish marks. But otherwise it’s just a plain moisturizer with no frills. No nonsense moisturizer
