I purchased this because it claims to be good for acne prone and sensitive skin. I am SO disappointed in this product, it is incredibly overpriced and does nothing but break my skin out. I havenâ€™t had acne this bad since I hit puberty over 15 years ago. I actually threw my most recent bottle of it straight into the trash. My skin feels dry and tight, and yet it is somehow still breaking out. Do NOT waste your money on this product if you have sensitive skin! SO disappointed!! Causes extremely bad breakouts!
