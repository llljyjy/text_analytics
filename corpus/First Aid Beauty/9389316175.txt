Omg I am loving this sunscreen. I live in Florida and the sun is brutal. Every sunscreen I have doesnâ€™t last and this is one of the first sunscreens that I can really on the most. It protects me for more then 3 hours before reapplying. It leaves skin soft and not sticky which is a must at the beach otherwise the sand will stick. First aid beauty has done it again I am so grateful. The pump is a great way to get just the right amount and I am fair skin and this a must to wear spf. nan
