I have pretty sensitive skin so I usually avoid Vitamin C serums, I just have some trauma from other brands lol This made my skin so smooth and bright! There is totally a reason this is sold out. I think this is a great product for someone wanting to try a vitamin c without breaking the bank or using something cheap. So GOOD
