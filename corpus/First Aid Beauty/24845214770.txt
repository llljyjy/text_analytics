I had been wanting to purchase this item for years, so when I did I was excited to try it. The first time I tried it I realized the cream gave my skin and almost burning sensation and my face would turn blotchy. I did however notice that it did leave my skin soft. This product is not for sensitive skin, but I did moisturize my skin. Irritated my skin :/
