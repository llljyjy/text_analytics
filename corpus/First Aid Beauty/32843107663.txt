I am loving this serum, starting with this really cool twist open pump design.  I’ve been using this as directed and had zero irritation at all, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily either. It’s a fairly lightweight serum that absorbs really easily into my skin, with my odors either. After using it for about a week my skin is already looking better.   I can’t wait to see the longer term results. My skin feels soft and moisturized, and, I guess radiant is the right word, glowing maybe?   It looks healthy!  I am so impressed.  Thank you First Aid Beauty for a great Vit C serum, that those with more sensitive skin can use No irritation but all the benefits.
