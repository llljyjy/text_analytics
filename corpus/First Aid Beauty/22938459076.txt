This is an amazing product! The first time after using it, my skin was a tad bit softer, and my face had a more lit-from-within look. Now, about a week and a half later, this is a holy grail product for me. My skin is so soft and glowy, and even some of my redness from rosacea is reduced! Iâ€™d definitely recommend. These photos are a before and after first using the serum. My skin is so glowy and soft!
