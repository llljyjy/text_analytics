Love love love this moisturizer. It is perfect for my skin in the dry, winter climate where I live because it is VERY thick. I usually only use this at night because if I use it everyday, I think it clogs my pores and I notice an increase in blackheads. Only using it at night has resolved that problem. Perfect thick moisturizer
