First, I love the finish and the way it makes my skin feel. White cast and grey tint is pretty visible on my skin (shade reference fenty 420) but does go away. I had to rub it in a lot and I still felt like there was a slight grey undertone. It is worth noting that I am heavy handed with sunscreen. I noticed that when I only used a nickel sized amount it blended in right way with very minimal white cast. Sooo basically the more product you use the more white cast you’ll probably have. I’ve experienced worst mineral sunscreens though lol. Overall 3.5-4 stars… for a mineral sunscreen. Definitely give it a try and see for yourself. :) nan
