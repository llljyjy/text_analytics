I was skeptic about this product in the beginning and only started to use it because I got 2 of them from Christmas limited edition packages (btw itâ€™s a great deal and I but it every year). After a few months, my face really started glowing. Last week I went for a facial after 3 years and the aesthetician said that My face is really clean and not much to extract during the facial! Now I am a big fan. Great product for dry sensitive skin
