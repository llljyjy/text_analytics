It’s only my second favorite moisturizing cream, but it still gets a strong five stars. I loved the slightly whipped but still creamy texture, and it’s excellent bang for your buck. I love the whole concept behind FAB. Their oatmeal mask is one of my holy grail products that I never travel without. I think it might have been discontinued, but in any case, FAB knows how to deliver when it comes to moisture. A cult classic you should try
