I’ve been using this for years and years. This leaves a subtle glow on the face and it’s perfect as a daytime moisturizer. It’s very simple, gentle and looks good under every foundation I’ve tried. I’d say it’s good for all skin types. Moisturizing for dry skin but not too much for oily skin. I personally have combo skin with an oily T-zone. Simple and fail-proof
