What a boost! I was really skeptical of this product, in part because it’s been a challenge finding a peptide serum that 1) worked with my sensitive skin, and 2) actually provided visible results. I’ve been using this a few weeks every other day in the evening and I can say that this product met both of my needs! I wouldn’t call it a game-changer, but if you’re looking for a peptide serum (texture is more of a whipped moisturizer) and have sensitive skin, give this a try! My skin is definitely more supple and bouncy after using this. I love the way it feels on my skin - a really nice experience applying the product! (I use it right before my moisturizer.) If you’re thinking about buying, I’d definitely give this a try! What a boost!
