I bought as an addition to the value pack I got.  All first aid beauty.  I used every other day for the first week and thought I noticed nothing so I started to use everyday.  (First time retinol user).  This every night use caused around my nostrils to dry out.  So changed back to every other.  Definitely noticed my skin looks brighter after using for three weeks.  Also use with the FAB resurfacing pads and facewash.  Major breakouts have seemed to clear up. Not sure if itâ€™s this product, or me just taking better care of my skin?  Will buy again. nan
