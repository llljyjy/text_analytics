My new must have, holy grail product! This Vitamin C serum is truly amazing! After using this product for just a short period of time, my skin already feels refreshed and softer, and it looks brighter too. The serum is extremely lightweight and it absorbs really well into the skin. I love that it is fragrance-free, completely safe for sensitive skin. The ingredients are notably both for what it does and doesn’t have. This serum is packed with Ascorbic acid, squalene, and Vitamin E; but it doe not have any alocohol, colorants, or artificial fragrances. Overall, I am Loving this serum as an addition to my skincare routine. And a bonus too is that this product has ingenious packaging. The twist pump is so wonderful! I received this product complimentary from First Aid Beauty in exchange for my honest opinion. I absolutely love this product, and I can’t wait to purchase another to make sure I always have it on hand. Try it— you won’t be disappointed! nan
