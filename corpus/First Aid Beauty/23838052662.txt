I can’t tolerate L-Ascorbic acid so this is a great option for me. I have rosacea & acne and this doesn’t irritate my skin. My dermatologist tells me I should avoid fragrance in skincare, so it’s great that it is fragrance free. Many brightening vitamin C serums have AHAs too which is also too much for my skin, so I’m so glad this is a basic, no fuss formula. Perfect. sensitive skin approved (finally for a vitamin c!)
