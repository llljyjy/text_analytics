My biggest beef with this item is the smell. Itâ€™s fragrance free but has a terrible smell. I cleaned it off immediately. It also made my skin greasy, and I did not like that it was shimmery as the brightening. I will say that it goes on smooth and a tiny dot for each eye is plenty; this will last you a long time. Lastly, the color and shimmer would make a great highlighter. Just not for me! Smelly
