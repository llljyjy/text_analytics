I recently purchased this instead of my typical go-to, SkinFix barrier +. The overall cost of this one is much better, and I was dealing with flakiness and worries the Barrier + may not be enough. I asked a Sephora employee what to add to this moisturizer to make it similar to Barrier +, and she recommended peptides. So I paired this with The Inkey List’s Peptide Moisturizer, and it’s worked so well almost overnight. nan
