I use three other FAB products, so I was excited that they came out with a Vitamin C serum - especially b/c it came in AIRTIGHT packaging.  Most antioxidant products do not come in airtight packaging, so they lose potency which defeats the point.  Unfortunately, this bottle seemed to be made cheaply.  Not only was it rickety, but too much product squirted out and some wound up wasted on the side of the bottle.  I think FAB is aware of this as in the instructions they tell one to tilt the bottle at 45 degrees.  Of course I did that on my own, but the delivery method needed to be improved.The biggest disappointment was that this product didn’t spread well.  I don’t like products that don’t glide on decently well.  I also wasn’t a fan of the squalane inclusion.  My skin doesn’t love it.So, all of this just added up to a miss for me.  I hope FAB does better in the future with a Vitamin C serum.  Keep the airtight aspect, though! Nice idea of the airtight packaging, BUT...
