i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!! maybe not the best for sensitive skin…
