Horrible! Absolutely horrible! I’m light skinned woman and even on my skin it leaves white cast! I was waiting 30 minutes and NOTHING! I’m like a ghost! And my skin is burning and scratching so bad! I’m running to wash this off.. highly NOT recommend!! oh and forgot to mention that it feels like a paste on your face!! Horrible
