Love this product! I have rather dry and sensitive skin and have struggled with acne in the past and this product did not irritate my skin. I only use it at night due to the product piling in the daytime when I apply my sunscreen. I highly suggest slugging (I use the cerave healing ointment) to ensure max benefits. The combination has been great on my skin throughout the colder months. nan
