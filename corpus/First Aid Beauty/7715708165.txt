I have very oily skin. I’ve loved FAB products for years and decided to take a chance on this product to help with my skin. It created and clung to every single texture on my face. I tried it for a week and every single day I looked flakey and dusty. I would NOT recommend this product due to that problem. Although my skin looked matte, it didn’t make up for how bad the texture was. 0 stars - clung to dry patches
