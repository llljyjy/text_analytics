I love FAB but this product was a miss for me. I double cleanse daily at night to remove SPF and makeup if I’m wearing it. The instructions specify to apply a few pumps of this cleansing oil to dry skin, rub it around, and then wet your skin and rinse off. It’s hard to spread around on dry skin, and then when I wet my hands it rinses basically all the product off of my hands. It technically works, but doesn’t visibly seem as effective as other cleansing oils/balms that I’ve used before. One pro is that it doesn’t irritate my eyes like many balms/oil cleansers do, so if you’re sensitive to that this may work for you. Otherwise this is too expensive for too little results for me.
