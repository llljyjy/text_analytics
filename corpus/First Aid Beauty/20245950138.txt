i started using this about 2/3 days ago & i had super dry skin around my eyes & i even had a very small dry red patch under my eye & i used this & it cleared up completely in 2 days! it’s very moisturizing & the reason o knocked a star off was bc the smell. it’s not bad, but i just don’t like it. get this is you have dry&sensitive skin!!!
