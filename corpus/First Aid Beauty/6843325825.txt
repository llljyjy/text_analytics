Good consistency. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. But my god the pilling is HORRIBLE. You can’t layer this with anything. I hate that I can feel a layer of this sitting on top of my skin and it doesn’t actually moisturize as much as I thought it would given how thick it is. Returning this ASAP. not what I expected
