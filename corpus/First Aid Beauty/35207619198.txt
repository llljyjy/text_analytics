I was excited for this because I’ve heard the original ultra repair moisturizer is good, but my skin is on the oily side, so this seemed more promising. But unfortunately, it did not help with oil control at all. I have combination/oily skin, and this definitely didn’t make me feel less oily. My skin overall felt just as oily as it does with a regular moisturizer, and the hydration was just average. Didn’t Help My Oily Skin
