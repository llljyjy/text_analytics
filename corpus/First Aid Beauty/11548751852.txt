I love everything about this cleanser. The smell...the texture...the colour...the way it lathers...the feel on my skin....the clean hydrated feeling it leaves behind. This cleaner is quite the experience and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Its safe for all skin types including sensitive skin as its free from fragrance, drying alcohol and essential oils. Its a must have for any routine. The sensory experience is amaze-balls! All time favourite!
