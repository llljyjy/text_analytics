I have tried many vitamin c serums, this is the first that didn’t cause initial irritation to my skin. I do have sensitive skin, but I love the benefits from vitamin c. I’ve used this for 2 weeks now and I can visibly notice my face has a really nice, bright glow and is firmer. There is no sticky residue or any unpleasant smell; it leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. I really like the twist open applicator, it’s easy to get the exact amount needed so I’m not wasting any serum. This serum from FAB has a formula of 10% Vitamin C to brighten, firm, and reduce the appearance of fine lines. This serum also includes Vitamin E to combat free radicals while leaving skin super soft and Squalene that locks in the moisture to keep skin feeling soft and fresh. If you’re looking for a Vitamin C serum, this is it. First Aid Beauty is quickly becoming my go to for skin care with quality ingredients. FAB new Vitamin C serum
