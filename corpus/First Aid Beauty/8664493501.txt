I don’t know why, but this product slightly burns my face when I apply it.  If I apply it after an oil then it doesn’t but I don’t always want an oil.  I do have dry skin but this is supposed to be for that dry skin type, not burn it! I’m not overly sensitive or anything and usually all products work for me. Lightly burns my face when applied
