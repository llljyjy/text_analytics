This is a really solid Vitamin C serum! The claims are definitely true - this one is more on the watery side of the serum textures compared to others I’ve tried, and feels really hydrating. It’s not sticky and there is basically no scent to this whatsoever (no citrus smell, and no bitter chemical scent either). I felt that it absorbed really nicely without irritation. I also really appreciated that the pump wasn’t difficult to use and that it retracts back into the bottle to keep things secure and also help maintain the potency! Nice and hydrating serum
