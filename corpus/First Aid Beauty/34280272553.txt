I’ve been using this product for a few months and I was hoping this would be better than it ended up being. This doesn’t easily remove makeup. I have to use it twice to remove most of my eye makeup & I ALWAYS follow up with a normal cleanser to make sure all the make up is removed and my skin is clean.  I’m a big fan of this brand, but this is not my favorite product of theirs. it’s fine, but you can use this alone
