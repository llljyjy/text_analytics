Been using this for over five years and I love it. It is the only cleanser that doesn’t make me bright red after or “squeaky”. One pump from the bottle covers my whole face and neck, so it lasts for months.Protip! Apply it with dry hands on a dry face and smooth it as much as you can until its clear. Then, wet your hands and spread the rest. Run a shower and rinse it off when you first get in. Perfect clean everytime!Or, same process, but skip the shower and it will still wipe off with a soft cloth super easily. Just don’t use too much. Half a pump for the face, full pump for face and neck.Holy grail stuff right here. Perfect cleanser for sensitive skin
