I am honestly SO impressed with this sunscreen. I would never have guessed it’s a mineral sunscreen! It rubs in so seamlessly that I would’ve sworn it’s chemical. It also doesn’t sting around my eyes at all, which is what I’d expect from a mineral SPF. This has quickly become a Holy Grail for me. Be sure to apply 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every 2 hours! Truly invisible!
