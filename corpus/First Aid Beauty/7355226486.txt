I would consider myself to have sensitive, combo skin, with minimal redness through my cheeks, especially in the winter. I am always a little hesitant to try new products, as I’m prone to break out. I LOVE this cream! It is super hydrating, without being heavy and oily. I love wearing this under makeup during the day, but I have also enjoyed wearing at night. I have been using this for over a month now and have not broken out once (fingers crossed)- I even got my mom hooked on it while we were on vacation and her moisturizer just wasn’t doing it for her. Love!
