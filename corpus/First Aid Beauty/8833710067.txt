I’ve been using this product constantly for 3-4 years now and I absolutely love it. It’s a light moisturizer that doesn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores. If you live somewhere with very cold and dry winters or have very dry skin you might have to use another moisturizer on top it or go for a more moisturizing product. I’m hooked!
