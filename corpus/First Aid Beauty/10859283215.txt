Here’s the deal: this is a good product. I do recommend people try this if they’re looking for a cream for sensitive/damaged skin. This used to be great for my skin when it was stressed and dry, and it was my go to moisturizer to use with retinol, but out of nowhere it started to pill no matter where I used it or what I used it with. I’d go to sleep with it on and when I’d wake up, it looked like my pillow was covered in dead skin flakes from how much it pilled during the night. It’s such a bummer because I really did love it. Not for me anymore
