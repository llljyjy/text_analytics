The FAB sunscreen goes on without any issue and doesnâ€™t leave any residue (an issue I often have with other face sunscreens). Tube is a good decision that makes it easy to dispense the sunscreen. I have been using this for several weeks and have not seen any separation in the product (another issue with other mineral sunscreens). Very satisfied with this product! My new go-to mineral sunscreen!
