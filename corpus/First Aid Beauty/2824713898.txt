I have been using this cleanser since 2013, and it is quite literally the only face wash that doesn’t break me out. It cleanses and removes makeup, so I’ve never needed to purchase any kind of makeup remove. This stuff can take off waterproof mascara. It’s extremely gentle and non-drying. No joke, I relied on this cleanser through two years of accutane during high school, and I have never had any problems. I have nightmare skin that breaks out if the wind blows wrong, so I introduced the FAB cleanser very slowly and carefully to see how my skin would react. My skin is also tough because its both dry and acne-prone. Luckily, this stuff has legit never done me wrong. It was the only step in my skincare routine for many years. Also-- it’s pretty concentrated, so you only need a small amount to wash your whole face. A full size tube will last me at least 6 months. You need to wet your face thoroughly first and then apply the cleanser and lather. Also keep your eyes shut while washing because it stings slightly if it gets in your eyes (I guess that would be my only “complaint“). Overall this stuff has been a life saver for me and I can’t recommend it enough. My saving grace since 2013
