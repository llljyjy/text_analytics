This is the best mineral sunscreen I’ve ever used. No whitecast and no overtly strong smells from this sunscreen. It blends really well into my skin, and doesn’t leave my hands sticky after applying. The only downside of this is the pump cap. I don’t really see it being necessary and it kind of wastes plastic… the cap also makes it so you can’t really directly apply the sunscreen onto your face, but rather onto your palm/back of hands first.
