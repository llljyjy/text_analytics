I could not recommend this face lotion more! I have sensitive and cystic acne prone skin. This lotion is lightweight, has a nice smell and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Iâ€™ve used this daily for years now and I believe it has helped my skin appear winkle free too. It is not greasy and feels so light. If you have acne prone skin give this one a go! Love, love, love!! nan
