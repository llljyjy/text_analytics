Very good mineral sunscreen. I have very fair, sensitive normal to dry skin. I tested it for a week both on its own and under makeup and used the recommended amount of 1/4 teaspoon for face and neck. My skin tolerated it well with no adverse reactions, and it did not cause burning around my eyes like some sunscreens can. Takes a little more effort than some to rub in but once rubbed in it left no white cast (although, reminder, I’m quite fair so can’t speak to darker skin tones). It dries down nicely, does not feel tacky or sticky, and is a good base for makeup with no pilling. I think the price point is very reasonable and would repurchase this to keep in my rotation.
