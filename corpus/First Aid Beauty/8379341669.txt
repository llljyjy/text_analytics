As someone with rosacea, I have sensitive skin that can have skin build up on my cheeks. I use these pads every other day and can’t tell you how soft/fresh they make my skin feel. It’s the perfect exfoliant for my skin without being too harsh. It also seems to help unclog my pores when I’m breaking out so I only have good things to say! nan
