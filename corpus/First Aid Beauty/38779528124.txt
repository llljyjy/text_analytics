Living in Arizona in the summer has its challenges when you think about your skincare regimen. You can’t wear anything that is to heavy or it will just slide right off your face once you step outside the door. Well let me tell you this Vitamin C brightening is the best I have tried. You don’t feel like your pores are being clogged and when you hit the heat it stays in place. I am going on 60 and I finally feel like I have something that will make me feel refreshed everyday. I can see that my skin is more radiant, the smell is great and application is so easy. This is a total winner for all of us living in the heat, experiencing hot flashes or needing a serum that actually works. My skin feels better to the touch, I can see the dark spots are lightening and my elasticity of my skin feels firmer. You can’t go wrong with this product. I love it! Loving it.
