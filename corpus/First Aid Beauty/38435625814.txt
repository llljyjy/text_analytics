Sunscreen was very light weight and didn’t feel as greasy as most sunscreen do! The first time is did have a white taint from it but I believe I put one too much because the second time I put slightly less and it didn’t leave a white mark and it still protected me the same as the first which was great!! I would definitely recommend this product has someone with eczema it didn’t irritate my skin while wearing or after putting it I didn’t have any reaction towards it so definitely getting this product again! Good product
