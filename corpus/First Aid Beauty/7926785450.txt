I don’t have problems with it. I have combo skin & it mattifies my skin great. I think sometimes I still have dry patches but I think I just need to exfoliate because I rarely do that lol. It works great on my skin otherwise! Feels great and supple. Love it. It’s my holy grail during the summer. nan
