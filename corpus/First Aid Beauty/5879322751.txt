I really wanted to like this makeup remover since I love so many of FAB’s other products. This was a no for me. I do love the pump and the consistency. Although it removed my face makeup just fine, it does not remove my waterproof mascara.  I have to double cleanse with this and it’s still not removed.  I have noticed my eyelashes fall out more when I use this product (I’m assuming it’s because I am more abrasive than normal since it’s not easily removing my makeup). I’m sure it is fine for non waterproof mascara but I do not recommend for waterproof peeps. Not For Waterproof Mascara
