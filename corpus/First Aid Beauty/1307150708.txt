This doesn’t have the sunscreen smell at all. I tried it without make up and with make up. It never peeled my make up off and feels more like a luxury skincare item then a sunscreen. I have very sensitive eyes and skin. I tried to use the glow recipe one and it burnt my eye. This doesn’t do that. If you have sensitive skin you need this now. It’s not oily either.It does take a few minutes to blend into skin but it doesn’t lighten your face or leave white cast. sensitive skin. best sunscreen ever
