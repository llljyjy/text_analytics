Let me just say, I have eczema acne-probe sensitive skin. I was wary because 99% of vitamin C products.  cause stinging and irritation for me - but not this one!!! It practically applies like a hydrating serum and I didnâ€™t notice any stickyness either! My other products applied over it like a dream. The unique turning pump is perfect for storage/travel and also ensures that this product is going to stay good for a long time! I will 100000% repurchase! first Vit C product to not irritate my skin!!
