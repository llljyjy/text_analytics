Have tried to answer the question on this site three times, that someone asked if this was good for mature skin and each time they said to try again later!!!  Why?  Annoying!  Purchased this item because it stated good for redness and sensitive skin.  It is neither.  My face is red and raw after using and dries out my face badly.  Would not purchased another FAB product ever. Red dried out face
