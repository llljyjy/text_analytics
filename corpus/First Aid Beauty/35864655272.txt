OMG! Where has this moisturizer been all my life?! I’m in my late 50’s and have very oily skin which doesn’t do well with most moisturizers. This has been a total game changer! It’s so hydrating without the heavy feeling I get from most other moisturizers I’ve tried (and there have been many). It feels great under my makeup too, and even makes my makeup look so much smoother. Best of all… my skin has never been more soft and radiant! Can’t say enough good things about it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Thank you FAB! FINALLY!!
