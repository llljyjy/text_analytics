I have really bad eczema and also deal with dermatitis. This cleanser works great, I love how it doesn’t strip my skin. I give it 4 stars because I’ve had better cleansers, but this one isn’t bad, it’s really good except I feel like it smooths my skin more than removes redness. Still one of my favorite cleansers and would recommend! More Smoothing Rather Than Redness Removing
