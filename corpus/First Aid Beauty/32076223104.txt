First Aid Beauty’s vitamin C serum is one that I’ll keep using. A lot of vitamin C serums have a strong scent - sometimes an odor I hate and sometimes a delicious citrusy scent. This product, however, is odorless. It doesn’t feel sticky when you apply it to your face, and it absorbs into the skin pretty well. It helped lighten some dark spots. nan
