This sun block is the goat!!!! I wore it under my makeup for over 12 hrs and it didn’t melt away. My wore beautifully over this product!!! It didn’t flake up with other products. And it didn’t leave a white cast.. ( I’m a woman of color so that means a lot) I wore it again without my makeup and felt super GLOWY ALL DAY!!!!! The GOAT
