I’ve used their oil control lotion for years. My skin has always been on the oily side, but this winter I started getting dry patches on my face. This stuff really helped. It’s a great product because you can use it all over your body. I was worried using it on my face as I have oily skin, but this left no residue, absorbed quickly and didn’t make me break out. It’s been great on my hands too! Best thing is how quickly it absorbs any where you use it. Great product to have in drawer for the dry winter months. Great multi tasker!
