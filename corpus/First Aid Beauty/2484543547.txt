It’s ok. It blends well and not too drying. The white cast is not bad, but I do notice when I wear it under foundation I do see a hint of the white cast. This product would be ideal to wear alone. For a mineral sunscreen this is not bad. Very suspicious how this product has nothing but 5 stars and the pictures posted by other reviewers are marked as “incentivized”. ok. could be better
