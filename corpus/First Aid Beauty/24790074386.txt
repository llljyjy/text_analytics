I rarely have non-hormonal breakouts (all of which are on my chin typically), and Iâ€™ve never reacted to a product before. I was hoping this would help how dry my skin gets in winter, but it made me breakout all over my face: my chin, forehead, cheeks, jaw. As soon as I switched back to the moisturizer I was using before, I stopped breaking out. Would NOT recommend as a facial moisturizer Wrecked my skin!
