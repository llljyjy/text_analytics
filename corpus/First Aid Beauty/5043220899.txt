This eye cream has a great consistency- it’s smooth and rich without being greasy. I use it both morning and night and it wears perfectly under makeup. Especially after applying foundation/concealer, which always makes these lines look dry and more pronounced.I’ve really noticed fine lines in my eye area this past year and I’ve tried tons of different eye creams to combat them. I find many of them to be expensive with little results. I like the price point of this cream and the results have been positive after using it for 2 weeks. It smooths out the fine lines, is moisturizing and even reduced puffiness.The smell is fresh and cucumber-y. I like it and will continue to use it happily. Reduces fine lines and puffiness
