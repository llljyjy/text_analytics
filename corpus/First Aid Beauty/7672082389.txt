The texture of the sunscreen is great, no grittiness and it’s definitely a light sunscreen. Left no white cast after a few seconds of rubbing it in, but I’m very fair skinned so I can’t speak for how it’d work on dark skin. Took off one star because it was still sticky after drying down and settling on my skin. nan
