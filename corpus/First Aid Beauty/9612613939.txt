I have a very dry skin in general, but especially during winter. I felt my skin tingle a little the first time I put it on because it was so dry. This feeling went away from the first use, a sign that the cream works and rehydrates! I also hate fragrance in products (causes rosacea to my sensitive skin) but this cream has none. A little gem.
