Really loving this product so far! I’ve been looking for a good mineral sunscreen with no white cast and this one does the trick! It leaves your skin with a nice glow and there’s no harsh mineral sunscreen smell. I also love the packaging, it’s a pump on a squeeze tube so it’s easy to get out and there’s a lot of product so you get alot for what you pay compared to some other sunscreens. I’m only knocking off one star because if you sweat in this sunscreen it almost feels as if it’s blocking the sweat from coming out of your pores. Great mineral sunscreen!
