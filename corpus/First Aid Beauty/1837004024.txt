I wanted to love this overnight cream! My skin is so sensitive and literally after just trying it one night I woke up with pimples. The big bumpy ones. It was very moisturizing and a LITTLE goes a long way! I’m sure it’s a great product for people who don’t have such sensitive skin. Skin too sensitive for this heavy cream
