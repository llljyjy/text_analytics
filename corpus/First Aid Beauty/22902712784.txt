I wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t. My skin isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest. CeraVe has been my holy grail for years and I just wanted to switch it up. However, anytime I would use this as moisturizer it would end up pilling off of my skin within 30 minutes. Whether I paired it with a primer and skin tint in order to do my makeup, or if I was just doing my skin care routine, it happened every time. If I had put it on before makeup, within that hour I would be having to get all of the pilled product off of my skin with a napkin. I tried so many different combos, stopped using certain products with it, etc. None worked! The only way it stopped was when I stopped using the moisturizer. The consistency of it is so nice and it makes your skin feel really good, I was just disappointed my skin didn’t love it as much as I wanted to. Wasn’t for me
