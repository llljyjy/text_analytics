OOO Y’ALL. When I tell you I’m ashy in the wintertime and need some extra TLC, I mean it. THIS..THIS! This is the thickest most hydrating cream I’ve tried. I’ve had crack on my legs because of how dry I get and this just completely soaked way down! Just when I thought it couldn’t get better, it even has a cooling effect! Love this cream, will buy again. An Essential For Those With Dry Skin
