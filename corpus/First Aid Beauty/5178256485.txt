I have recently become super obsessed with sunscreen so I know a good one when I try it. This one is an amazing one!! It’s a mineral formula and SPF 30 so it is adequate to protect your face on a daily basis. It soaks in very nicely and provides a nice base for my makeup. It doesn’t sting my eyes, it doesn’t pill, and it is fragrance free! Really impressed with this!!!! <3 Sooooo goood!
