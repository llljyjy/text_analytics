This serum has been great even for my sensitive skin. I havenâ€™t had any irritation or breakouts since starting to use it every morning. I love the consistency of the serum, and how nicely it dries down without feeling sticky. My skin definitely looks brighter and dewier/hydrated after use, and the fine lines around my eyes are plumped for most of the day! I feel like this product does so much more than the typical vit c serum. And I LOVE the way the cap twists to pump/dispense the product, even when my hands hurt so bad from arthritis I know I could still easily twist and pump this serum. Thank you!!! Multi-tasking Serum!
