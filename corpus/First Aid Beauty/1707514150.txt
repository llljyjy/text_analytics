WOW these pads are the BEST! When I’ve gotten too much sun, even thou I wear a hat plus high SPF, I’ll start using these pads at night on my face, neck, chest, even my arms & legs! These pads exfoliate your skin, get rid of any dark spots/sun damage, smooth out your skin texture, and lighten your skin rather quickly - a total WIN WIN!!!!! I first cleanse my face, then I wipe my entire face, neck, chest and other areas with these pads and then I’ll either use my retinol after on my face,neck & chest and then I apply another glycolic body lotion all over my legs & arms. The results are unreal! It’s like I’m giving myself peels at home but without the high costs, plus I’m not getting crazy peeling, just brighter, lighter, smooth beautiful skin. Trust me, these work! I take excellent care of my skin with good serums/skincare products/retinol, microneedling, light peels etc. This product is an added plus that I keep on hand especially when summer is over and I know I’m done with getting anymore sun on my body!  This large container will last you a VERY long time! The BEST for getting rid of sun damage!
