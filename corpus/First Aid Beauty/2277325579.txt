I have been on the hunt for a mineral sunscreen with 20% zinc that was safe for sensitive skin, was free from irritants, and wouldn’t completely dry out my eczema-prone skin but also stay on my face without sweating off in the sun. I have been using Biossance’s mineral sunscreen for reference. Going on, the sunscreen was a lot “drier“ and spread more like a sunscreen than the Biossance (which spreads more like a traditional moisturizer). It also dried down much more than the Biossance, which had me believing this would be a more ideal product for daytime sweating. It also had a much more matte finish which means if there was a cast, it was more translucent than the dewy finish of Biossance. However, within two days of wearing this, my skin exploded with acne. I NEVER break out unless there’s a combo of factors - sweating, on my period, dirty makeup sponges, touching my face during the day etc. And even then, it’s never more than 1 or 2 zits. This breakout was ALL over my face indicating it was a product reaction. I couldn’t believe it. It took another day for me to realize it was the sunscreen because I seriously never have an issue with products causing a breakout - I never check for oil-free or non-comedogenic products because my skin is so dry and generally loves oils and thick moisturizing ingredients. Looking at the ingredients, the coconut alkanes came up as highly comedogenic. I have to believe there’s some sort of ingredient interaction happening, perhaps with one of my other products that has some lower level of comedogenic ingredients that together with the coconut alkanes exploded my face. Unfortunately, because this sunscreen was the thing that changed my skin chemistry and broke me out, it goes. Wild breakout/product reaction
