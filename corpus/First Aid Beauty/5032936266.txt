I am 26 years old. I have dry skin and experience hormonal acne. I like to think of this as a stress-free moisturizer, meaning that I don’t have to worry that it’s not doing it’s job. It’s creamy, moisturizing, and sets in quickly. I saw a review of someone saying it smelled bad but I can’t smell this product hardly at all. It doesn’t break me out and feels gentle. A little of it goes a long way so it’s more lasting that other moisturizers. I saw someone say to not apply makeup after using this due to piling, but I wait for my moisturizer to dry and then use an oil based primer before my foundation. My Skin Loves It
