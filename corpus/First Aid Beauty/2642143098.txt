I picked up this product because I want an eye cream with retinol. I’m not looking to “fix” anything (dark circle, puffy eyes…etc). All this product has to do is provide gentle hydration for my not-really-dry skin around my eyes to win a 5 star review. Why the 3 stars then you ask? It’s because product keeps separating. It gets super annoying. I shake it up the night before and it will separate again the next day. Won’t be repurchasing. Won’t stop separating.
