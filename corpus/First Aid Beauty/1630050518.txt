Very disappointed with the value size. This is a staple so i bought the value size for when my original bottle was empty. When I started using it, the product is separated and a very oily liquid comes out. Shaking it doesnâ€™t help. I purchased three months ago so I was not able to exchange or return. I do not recommend the value size for this reason. Otherwise, the cleanser is usually very good and gentle on skin. However I will not be repurchasing. Do not recommend value size
