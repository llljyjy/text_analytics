I have a lot of fancier moisturizers with prettier packaging, but I keep coming back to this because it works so beautifully for my aging combination skin that’s prone to redness and sensitivity. I feel that my dry & oily skin areas are much more balanced when I’m using this product and it keeps my skin calm and well hydrated. Can’t really ask for more than that. nan
