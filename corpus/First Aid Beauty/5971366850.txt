I absolutely love this cream, it’s a must in my daily routine alongside the Ultra Repair Cream to compensate for the dryness that comes with my regular use of Tretinoin. I used to struggle a lot with flaking and extreme sensitivity even with spacing out my use of Tret and using ceramide heavy creams, but since using this I almost never do anymore. It helps maintain my moisture barrier and sinks into a natural-satin finish on me (perfect for applying foundation over!) and doesn’t contribute to oiliness around my nose where I can get greasy at times.It’s certainly not for oily-types so I’d caution them against this unless using it as a night cream, but for those with dry and/or dehydrated skin, it’s been game-changing for me. My skin looks and feels plump and healthy, it’s always soft, and despite being pricey up-front, you use so little at a time that the tub lasts forever. FAB kills it for the dry skinned among us. FAB brings it home for Tretinoin users!
