For the price, I would not recommend as you don’t seem to get enough product. I purchased on November 3rd and finished on December 13th. Thats just way too fast in my opinion. I used one pump sometimes less and usually use a different moisturizer at night. Other than that it’s a great, simple moisturizer for normal to dry skin. Really loved it, just be prepared you’ll run out fast. Good, not enough product for price
