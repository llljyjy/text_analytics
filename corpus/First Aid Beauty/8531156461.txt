Iâ€™ve bought this before but when I purchased them again they smelled old and made me break out. When first contacting First Aid Beauty they told me they were fine but after finding multiple containers where the seal had been broken at the store, I was informed by the company that it was a known issue which affects product quality and safety. Buy ones that have a more foil like seal as opposed to the paper one. Also check the seal at the store before buying because an employee put back several unsealed ones. Otherwise I love them and they work well for my sensitive skin. They clear up breakouts and exfoliate my skin well. Poor packaging and product quality
