This product receives a lot of hate but it does some good things. I have been using it for a little over a month now and while I haven’t seen massive results in my hereditary dark circles (nothing works) this product has some positives. First, it doesn’t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin. As someone who gets a breakout rash when trying new products this didn’t cause any issues. Second, I love the shimmer. It’s just enough to brighten my under eye area, especially when I’m doing a no makeup day. It also can be worn under makeup without piling issues — I just apply and wait about 30 min. I’ve tried Clinique and kiehls for nighttime use and this is no better or worse than either. nan
