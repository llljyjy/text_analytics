I really enjoy using this vitamin C serum! It is so lightweight and not sticky like a lot of vitamin C serums on the market. It just sinks into the skin! It is also very gentle and does not cause irritation to my sensitive skin, and has no awful smell like vitamin C serums tend to have. I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and I can use it every day with no issues. My skin feels nourished and hydrated all day long! I have noticed some difference in brightening my skin a little bit, but it doesnâ€™t seem to improve dark spots as much as I hoped it would, but I still seem to gravitate towards this serum just because of how nice it feels on the skin! Perfect for sensitive skin!
