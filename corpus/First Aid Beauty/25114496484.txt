Just started using retinol for the first time in my late 20s. This was recommended to be by a Sephora employee as it is a low dose. It did not cause any irritation, redness or breakouts for me. I had no issues with this at all and used it every other night. I just completed the full bottle and now will be going up a notch in potency. This is a great first time retinol user that is gentle on the skin. I have normal skin and not prone to breakouts. If your skin type is sensitive, I would ask a Sephora employee if this is right for you. Always find out and confirm first as Iâ€™ve heard horror stories regarding retinol usage and incorrect doses. This is the lowest dose they have at the store though, so I think it will work on most skin types. Perfect for Beginners
