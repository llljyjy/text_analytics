I had to switch from my last moisturizer due to price. This is widely recommended by so many people and the right price point. The texture doesn’t feel like it sinks into my skin well, but it is doing better taking away the redness in my checks than the last moisturizer I was using, so it must be. Overall, very happy with it. I am not acne prone and on the first day I used it I got the tiniest white-head below my lip, but that’s it. nan
