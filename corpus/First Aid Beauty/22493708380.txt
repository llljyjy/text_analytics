I cannot say enough good things about this! It uses one of my favorite stable vitamin C derivatives, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid. It offers the benefits of vitamin c but in a better tolerated and more stable form. In addition to that, this contains some really calming ingredients like oat, feverfew, tea, and licorice. Overall just perfect for sensitive skin that maybe doesnâ€™t always take well to vitamin c. Sensitive skin's best friend
