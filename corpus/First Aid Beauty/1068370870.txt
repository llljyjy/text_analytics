I love this vitamin c serum! I have been using vitamin c serums for at least 10 years and this is a favorite. I could see results after just one use. It dries nicely, doesn’t have a smell, and doesn’t pill or leave skin feeling tacky. You should definitely buy this one! It’s a good value too. The only minor flaw is the pump. Too much comes out, maybe a dropper instead or a smaller pump. Obsessed!!!
