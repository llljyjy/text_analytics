Pros: it’s sunscreen Cons: feels heavy on my face.            Skins instantly sweats as if it’s trying to get rid of the product.            Too small for the price (used it a total of three times and it’s already 1/3 of the way gone).           Need more of this product than the amount I use with my banana boat sunscreen.            Leaves face feeling heavy and greasy. Overall I say try if you can get it as a sample to see how you like it although I really wouldn’t recommend anyone spend the $30 on this when you can spend a good $10 at the drug store on a bigger size. wish I liked it.
