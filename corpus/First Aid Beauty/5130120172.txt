I received this sunscreen a few weeks ago in PR & have been testing it out ever since & let me just tell you it’s GOOD. There is no white cast at all, it blends out quickly & easily leaving a dewy finish to your skin. It also doesn’t have the typical sunscreen smell, in fact I don’t really think it smells like anything at all. It wears well under makeup & doesn’t break me out or cause any irritation. I’m very picky about which sunscreens I use on my face because I find that a lot of them don’t wear well under makeup or leave a white cast on my skin but this doesn’t! I honestly think this might be my new favorite sunscreen for my face. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out. LOVE THIS!!
