Received this product in the mail for my honest review and let me tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. Starting with the packaging of this product, super easy to use. There’s no cap for it to get lost or misplaced, just simply twist and pump. I don’t like wasting product, so one pump does the job for me. A little goes a long way, but I’m sure an extra pump will be just fine. My skin is also on the sensitive side and is easily irritated. However, this serum feels very light weight and is not sticky at all. After using this product for some time, I did notice that my skin was brighter. I definitely recommend this product and will be ordering once I run out. Thanks again FAB! nan
