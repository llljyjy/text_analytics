This cleanser is named as a cleansing oil, but it is not like other cleansing oils. It’s a very normal consistency for what you’d expect liquid soap to be, not cleansing oil. With that being said, it does do a good job of removing my makeup and leaves my face feeling very clean. I don’t find that it’s drying for me, and my skin is combination skin that tends to be on the drier side. The pump is great, and it takes 4-5 pumps to cover your face well like the instructions state. Not an oil cleanser as it says, but does the job
