I have normal to dry skin and this toner didn’t feel hydrating at all. Ive been using it for about 3 weeks and it doesn’t seem to have made an improvement in my skin. It also smells like hand soap.  If you have dry skin, try laneige cream to skin toner or the cosrx toner. This toner would be better for oily skin types. NOT HYDRATING ENOUGH
