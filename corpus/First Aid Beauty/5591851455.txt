I’ve been wanting to try an eye cream with retinol but have been hesitant since the rest of my skin doesn’t seem to get along with retinol (no matter how low the % is!) - happy to report this did not irritate the skin around my eyes at all! Super gentle! I think my under-eyes look maybe a little brighter - but I don’t really have a problem with that to begin with so probably not fair to speak to that. I did, however, have some stubborn milia around my under eyes (from a previous heavy eye cream I think). I say ‘did have milia’ because I was pleasantly surprised to find it got rid of the milia too! Only took a star off because the formula does separate a bit but I don’t mind (I just massage & shake up the tube before use). Overall great product! Gentle & great for milia-prone skin!
