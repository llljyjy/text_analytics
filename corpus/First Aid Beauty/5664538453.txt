This cleanser is perfect for my skin. I use it at night as my second cleanser, after I take off my make up with bioderma micellar water. It has no fragrance and cleans any residue make up or sunscreen left on my skin. It is not drying and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I will repurchase for sure. nan
