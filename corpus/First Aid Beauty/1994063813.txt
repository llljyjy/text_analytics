I don’t know what to say about this guy-he’s just not satisfying in any way. Not particularly great at removing makeup, not quite nourishing or balmy feeling, doesn’t leave you feeling cleansed, doesn’t have a nice texture or milky quality. Like-I’m just so exited to finish this bottle so I can finally move on with my life. There are too many great cleansers out there to settle for this. It’s Not Me, It’s You
