I was so excited to learn that FAB was releasing a Vitamin C serum because it is one of my favorite skin care products to use. I like the packing of this a lot, but because the product is so liquid it comes out really fast so I had to learn to squirt it into the palm of my hand. At initial application it felt sticky on my skin but that disappeared after I had finished my whole routine. After using this for 2 weeks I have noticed that my skin is brighter and my post pimple spots are going away sooner. I also donâ€™t love that you cannot tell how much is left in the bottle, but overall I think this is a great product. A great Vitamin C option!
