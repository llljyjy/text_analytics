I love this product. I had really bad acne that nothing seemed to counter. I also had really dry skin from psoriasis. I had been trying benzoyl peroxide products because I knew they were strong for acne, but they made my skin so much dryer. I switched to this after I saw an influencer who used to have horrible skin and told users what she used. This was what she used for acne. Anywhere there was a pimple or one coming up. That’s how I use this now. It keeps my face acne free without being harsh, drying, or leaving a residue. Most importantly of the three is the fact that it didn’t dry my face out, as I have only recently been diagnosed with psoriasis and have been looking for solutions for acne. Great for people with psoriasis or dry skin...
