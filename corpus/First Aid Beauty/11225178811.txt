I have oily acne-prone skin. I started using retinol in the winter, and my face was constantly irritated and peeling. I typically use gel moisturizers because of my skin type, but decided to buy a thicker one to help with the effects of retinol and wow! I used it day and night and my face never felt dry and it never caused breakouts. nan
