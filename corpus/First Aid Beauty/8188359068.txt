OMGosh bright is right! My beauty consultant Jenn kept her promise on this Vitamin C serum. My skin is brighter, plumper, has finer lines, and even my dark spots are fading. I love that this clean product is fragrance free, better for the earth, and the company  supports helping college kids to erase their debt. Another fantastic find from a first Aid Beauty. No wonder it’s sold out!! Yes, I would recommend using after the collagen firming cream morning and night. Also, stock up so you don’t run out❣️❣️ OMGosh- Bright is Right❣️❣️
