This sunscreen contains Zinc Oxide, Avocado Oil, and Vitamin E. It lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. It also fragrance-free and doesn’t break me out. It’s not drying, but it’s not oily either. This works great on my skin, I don’t have to worry about white streaks on my face. nan
