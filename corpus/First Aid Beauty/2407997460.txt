I don’t know how this toner isn’t viral yet. It’s the best for sensitive skin or anyone that wants to add extra hydration to their routine. It’s got a nice milky consistency (kind of like laneige) and you can instantly feel the moisture in your skin. On my third bottle! sensitive/dry skin must-have!
