This oil is disappointing. First, the smell is not at all what I’d expected. It’s very fake/synthetic, which is a problem for me. Next, there’s no “slip” feeling that you get from a luxurious oil. This is a dry oil, but if you’re looking for the typical oil feel than this isn’t for you. Finally, I like the packaging with a darker colored glass bottle but my dropper is defective - it only pulls a little product for dispensing.  I would not purchase this product again. Using it on my feet until it’s gone. Side note - I’m a FAB junkie. My desert island product is the Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum which I can’t live without. Disappointed FAB Customer
