I got this (the normal 6oz size) in their holiday set and I’ve used it every day, twice a day, since mid-January. It’s mid-July and I still have about another 2 weeks worth of product in there - you absolutely get your money’s worth on this stuff. I have normal to oily skin and find that it’s rich but not heavy, lightly herbally scented (didn’t bother my skin, might bother yours), and layers fine with other products. Just don’t leave the lid unscrewed overnight - it’ll solidify the top layer which is gross. perfect moisturizer
