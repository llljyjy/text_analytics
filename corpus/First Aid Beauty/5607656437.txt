I’m honestly so surprised this SPF has so many good reviews. I’ve tried it twice on different days on top of different moisturizers and it’s still a no for me. I’ve shaken it like crazy for it a couple of minutes and it still didn’t make a difference. it’s still has somewhat of a white cast even after rubbing it in and it’s honestly not easy at all to rub in compared to Supergoop or TULA. Forget about trying to reapply this every two hours, you will literally look like Casper the ghost by the end of the day. I wish I could return it but I don’t have the original box it came in. White Cast and Hard to rub in
