I live in AZ where the weather is extremely dry. This is the only moisturizer I trust! It wears beautifully underneath makeup and works incredibly on its own. It is worth every single penny! Every few years, the value size will go on sale for $15 and I stock up! Literally, I bought 4 value size bottles last time it went on sale. I love this stuff and I canâ€™t say enough good things about it. BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!!!
