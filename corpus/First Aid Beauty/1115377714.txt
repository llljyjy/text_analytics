I have disliked every eye cream I’ve tried, until now. I have very oily eyelids/skin, and every cream I’ve ever used before (even other clean formulas like Tatcha and Drunk Elephant) leads me to develop milia, which is the worst. Enter this eye cream - I got a sample in a skincare sample bag, and I was going to give it away, but I decided to try it on a whim. I was instantly obsessed with the subtle shimmer and how it made me look more awake - even better, I used the sample every day for a week, and not one milia popped up! I bought the full size and use it every day in the mornings - I don’t know if it’s doing anything for my actual skin, but it definitely brightens my eyes, and most important it does not clog up my oily eyelids. Major win! Brighter eyes and NO milia!
