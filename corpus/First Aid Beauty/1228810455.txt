This really helps my VERY oily skin. Before this i would get oily 15-20 minutes after washing my face. But with this moisturizer I’m matte for over 7 hours. I use this and the Murad matte sunscreen and My face looks amazing all day. A nice natural matte, not dry. No breakouts. No greasy feeling. No bad alcohol. I feel hydrated/balanced. I love this. I don’t think people with dry skin will like it, might not be enough moisture for dry skin. Oily Folks!
