I have pretty fair skin and dry out pretty quickly. This does a very great job moisturizer my skin. I also tend to get pretty sunburns and even after being very diligent in applying moisturizer, I ALWAYS peel. Last weekend, I got a really bad sunburn and used this lotion instead. to my surprise I didnâ€™t peel! I definitely love this product! Great Moisturizer and Great for Healing Sunburns
