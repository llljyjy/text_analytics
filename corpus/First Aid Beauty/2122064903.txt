I was a little unsure of this product at first. My skin is sensitive, especially to the sun. I have been converted! I put this product on clean skin and of course follow with spf. My redness was decreased! I am super excited about this considering that I’ve tried so many other products that just don’t work. This serum is definitely staying in my morning rotation. nan
