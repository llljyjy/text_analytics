When I initially bought this product I was skeptical because of my oily Tzone I mainly bought it to see if it would help with the redness and dryness of my cheeks due to rosacea. I recently started using it again as a spot treatment for my rosacea and it has really helped as far as the everyday appearance of it. Helped rosacea!
