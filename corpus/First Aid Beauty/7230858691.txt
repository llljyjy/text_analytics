Wow, I received a sample of this mini size and used it after my shower tonight in my skincare routine, i love it, wow it’s incredible!!!!!! white cream, not too thick that it’ll pill, sooo hydrating, smells delicious, not irritating with the scent as it’s a natural scent, hydrates very well, i put some under my eyes and on the sides where the smiling wrinkles are as well as above my eyelid below my brows. incredible, i love this stuff and i might just buy some when fully finished my mini. first aid beauty is the best. so hydrating.
