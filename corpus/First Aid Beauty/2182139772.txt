This sunscreen felt light and wasn’t streaky or greasy. The sunscreen was nice going on and was easy to rub in.  It has absolutely no scent, as opposed to other unscented things that still have some sort of scent. I’m very pale and it was effective against beach sun. I would have given if 5 stars but the bottle is very small. If you’re applying it to your whole body, like when you’re in a swimsuit, it won’t even last a full day. I got this bottle for free, but I’m not sure if I would have purchased it at the cost for the size. Nice, light formula
