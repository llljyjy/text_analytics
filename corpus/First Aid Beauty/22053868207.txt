I bought this product with my own money, here are my pros and cons:Pros: first application goes on well, it blends into the skin very nicely and leaves barely any cast (I have light skin). I like to spread it on my skin and then dab it into my skin and it makes it kind of disappear. It has a natural finish, not too dewy not too dry, just perfect. The tube and design are very well made.Cons: I work in the sun and I reapply my sunscreen three times. Reapplying for the second time isn’t as seamless as the first time, but it’s okay, the cast becomes more visible. The third time just forget about it, I started wiping my face with micellar water before reapplication. The sunscreen is not perfect but I would buy again, it has been the best so far as a non-tinted sunscreen. And it has 20% zinc oxide which is really good. Pros and cons
