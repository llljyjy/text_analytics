Eucerin ❌, Vaseline ❌, Mustela ❌, Wedela ❌, Aveeno ❌, Nivea ❌, Aquaphor ❌, Dr Rx ❌, CeraVe ❌, Cetaphil ❌ Absolutely nothing has helped my extreme pain, dryness and itch to go away or be soothed like FAB Ultra Repair Cream. This is magic and it’s exactly what my hands have needed. I actually bought the mango and grapefruit a while back and I didn’t care for it on my face so I left it in my cabinet. I recently decided to give it a try on my hands and it’s just a miracle cream, I bought more last week and my hands are about 80% better, I haven’t felt the burn when I simply wash my hands, my skin isn’t splitting and my hands don’t look old anymore. It can be a bit on the pricier side but it’s so worth it. Please don’t ever discontinue. This works 100%!!! This is it! My hands have healed!!!!
