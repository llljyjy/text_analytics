This cleanser does a great job at being non-irritating and non-abrasive on the skin. It feels gentle and did not irritate my acne. But i felt that the more i used this cleanser regularly the drier my skin felt even with other products layered on top. I feel like this cleanser does some kind of oil control. I like to use this now only on the days where iâ€™ve worn make up or have sweated more to get a deeper cleanse. Otherwise i think it would be great for those with oilier skin. Great for sensitive but not dry skin!
