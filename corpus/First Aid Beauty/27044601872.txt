This product would get ten stars from me! I never want to be without it.. I have been using it since last fall. I live in very dry, cold, windy climate in the winter and always struggle keeping my skin hydrated throughout. I end up with eczema patches on my eyelids every winter. This was the first winter I kept on top of my skin and made it the entirety without any flare ups or major dry issues. The consistency is milky and super easy to apply. A little goes a long way. I have used it every single night and still have 1/4 of a bottle left. I just pat into my skin with my hands on damp clean skin right after cleansing and voila this dry skin has stayed hydrated!! I never thought Iâ€™d find a product that would accomplish this so effortlessly. Will be a staple product in my skin care routine as long as its available!! #1 skincare product for dry skin
