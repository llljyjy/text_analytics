This moisture stinks. Not to mean it’s not good (although I haven’t been using it long enough to say one way or another). I mean… it actually smells bad. It’s smells like chemicals or something. I feel like I need to wash my face after I put it on because the smell will not go away. I’m just sitting here smelling my face. Additionally, the texture is strange. It’s not easy to pick up with your fingers.. you almost have to scoop it up or else it slides right off. I love the FAB face wash, but watch out for this moisturizer. Stinky
