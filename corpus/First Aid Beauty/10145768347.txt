I love this product so much but the packaging of this size is terrible. No matter what I try as soon as it reaches the bottom half to bottom third of the bottle the pump stops working and I have to unscrew the top to try and get to the product. The first time I thought it was just user error but this is my second bottle with the exact same issue. Itâ€™s less cost effective to buy the smaller tubes but worth the time and hassle to just avoid this big package. Packaging does not work
