I love that this is a gentle sunscreen with no harmful ingredients. I’m not a fan of the texture as it takes a bit of time to blend it into skin. Once it’s blended, it has a nice finish with almost no white cast. I also had trouble with the pump not working well. It worked at first but when I tried again for my neck application the pump just stopped working.. I will find a way to finish the product as I still like the gentle formula of this sunscreen. nan
