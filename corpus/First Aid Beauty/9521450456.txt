This is a great product! I love the actual bottle and the fact that it is a pump that comes out slowly. No mess left behind. It is lightweight and does not have an offputting “sunscreen“ odor. It is a good daily SPF on its own or under your daily sunscreen. Will continue to use. Lightweight, no odor daily SPF
