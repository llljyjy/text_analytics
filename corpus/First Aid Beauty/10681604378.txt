I’m always on the hunt for a sunscreen that works for me, and I was really excited when I found out that First Aid Beauty was coming out with one. I’m very specific about sunscreens because some formulations tend to break me out, and because I don’t like the strong smell. This sunscreen, however, is truly fragrance free and safe for sensitive skin. I did not experience any bad reactions to the ingredients in this sunscreen, and a great bonus is that it’s very lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast. Additionally, my skin wasn’t greasy by the end of the day even though I reapplied multiple times. However, I do wish this sunscreen was made for swimming and was sweat resistant. I received this product in exchange for my honest review, but I will continue to purchase from First Aid Beauty. Lightweight & Fragrance Free
