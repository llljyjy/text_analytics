A little about my skin:-combo/oily -acne proneI have a jar of this as a backup for when I run out of my lineup of regular moisturizers- I bought it thinking it would help my dry patches in the winter and then got too lazy to return in. EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE IT, I BREAKOUT. My skincare consists of aha/bha 2-3 nights per week and vitamin c the other nights. I typically use the Inky List Peptide moisturizer, IT cosmetics Secret Sauce, or the Glow Recipe watermelon gel moisturizer (dependent on heat/humidity) and never breakout. But as soon as I use this on my face, WHAM! pimple. I’ll give this a 1 because it also doesn’t do much for moisturizing in the winter when my skin needs more hydration and moisture. It’s overpriced and not worth the hype. makes me breakout
