This is fine. It’s moisturizing, and my makeup applies nicely in the morning after using this overnight. I’ve been using this for about four weeks and haven’t noticed any improvement in dark circles. . .  but the reason I won’t be repurchasing is based on the smell. It’s like a damp basement. Kind of mildew-y? It’s mild but off-putting. I'll pass.
