My first encounter with First Aid Beauty’s cleanser has been a very pleasant one.It is very mild with a scent that reminds me of pure innocence.It distributes nicely and small amounts do go a long way.After rinsing, my skin doesn’t feel tight or raw.I’m left with a face that feels caressed, purified and lifted with a fresh glow afterwards.I highly recommended this cleanser for anyone who wishes to keep their cleansing routine pure and simple. FABulous
