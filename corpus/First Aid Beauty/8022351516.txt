I’m obsessed with this face wash. It is so great for sensitive skin and no matter how many times I try different brands, I always come back to this one! It makes my skin feel smooth and not too taut after, even before moisturizer. The only downside is the price… while I love the product, I often struggle justifying spending that much on a face wash. Amazing product, iffy price
