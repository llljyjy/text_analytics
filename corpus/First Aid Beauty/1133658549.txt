I recently used First Aid Beauty’s sunscreen while out on a four hour kayaking trip. It worked wonderfully for me. I have sensitive skin with psoriasis and it was great for me. I also am a person who doesn’t like certain lotions because of the sticky and oily residue that it leaves. Along with all of the other First Aid Beauty lotions this one doesn’t leave behind that terrible residue. The only negative is the size. If you’re planning to use it on your whole body multiple times it will go quickly. nan
