I was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews I’ve seen for it, and I was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. My biggest complaint is how it pills. It’s almost like it’s not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. I tried different ways of applying (using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc) and it did it every time. I honestly wouldn’t mind it too much if it didn’t mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. My skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like I said earlier, it fills almost filmy. Plus, I don’t think it lives up to the “intense hydration“ name. I looked at recent reviews after I started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. My acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that’s a nice quality of it. Will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling isn’t worth the price in my opinion. Pills and feels weird on skin, disappointing
