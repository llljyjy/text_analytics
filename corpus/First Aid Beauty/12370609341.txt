Love this - I’ve been using it for about two weeks and can definitely see a difference in how my skin looks. It’s more even, less tired looking and I think some of my fine lines are less visible. It doesn’t have any fragrance, which is a must for me (no allergies, I’m just picky about smells) and it’s lightweight and absorbs quickly. I like the easy open and close, but my one complaint is that the product either shoots out to quickly or if you push lightly, it drips down the container. Not enough of a complaint to stop using it, but just something to note. nan
