I was really looking forward to using this because i’ve heard nothing but good things. Recently I’ve been over exfoliating and messed up my skin barrier, so I bought this to supplement my new routine to remedy it. Very thick and moisturizing, but I noticed that my skin felt like it was burning on first application. I thought nothing of it, but after trying it again 2 more times, I’m sure it’s this product. Maybe I’ll wait until my skin barrier has healed to give it another try. Burning Sensation
