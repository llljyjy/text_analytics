This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee when I went into the shop with a retinol burn — I wish I could express my gratitude, because she was right on target. I had a sample of another FAB cream a long time ago and remember not being a fan, but I love this one. It has a super lovely texture that I haven’t experienced in any other moisturizer… soft, fluffy, milky? It spreads easily and feels really soothing. It’s not heavy, so I think I’ll be able to use it throughout the year, even on finicky combination skin. When it’s particularly dry, I mix it with Drunk Elephant’s virgin Merula oil for the most luxurious & moisturizing last step to my routine. I also really appreciate that it’s unscented, and comes in a pump bottle instead of a pot; not only is it more sanitary, it also takes up less space on my skincare shelf. Colloidal oatmeal for the win!! Soft, light, soothing — perfect combo with retinol
