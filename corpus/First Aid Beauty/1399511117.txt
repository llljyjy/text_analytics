My all time favorite primer. The first time I bought it I thought it was just a moisturizer, which it works ok alone as a moisturizer but when used after your moisturizer as a primer, it makes your makeup application flawless. It has a pear essence that goes away once you put your makeup on. Before this, I was an avid twofaced fan, but this is a far superior product for my skin. It’s a noticeable difference for me. Even if I use without makeup it has a subtle glowing effect.  And a little goes a long way. I bought my last tube in February. Now buying my next tube end of July. I’m 45 with “happiness” lines around my eyes and corners of my mouth. Imperfect skin that needs a lil help. Flawless
