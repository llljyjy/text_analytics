This is my absolute favorite, go-to moisturizer. I’ve rebought three times now! And that’s saying something for how much product you get. I have dry, acne-prone skin and this is intensely hydrating without feeling too heavy so I can layer products before and after. It’s also an amazing deal, better bang for your buck than any drugstore face lotion of similar variety. Can’t recommend enough! The best
