I’ve been trying this First Aid Beauty 10% vitamin c brightening serum for a few days now and it’s already fantastic. Feels great going on and doesn’t make my face feel tacky afterwards. The ingredients look great and it’s safe for sensitive skin. No lid is needed with this cool twist design and it’s a pump so that air doesn’t get into the product and ruin it. I will definitely continue using this serum and I’d recommend it to anyone else wanting brighter skin. Already Fantastic
