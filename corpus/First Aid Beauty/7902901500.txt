As a woman with a deeper skin tone I love the fact that this product absorbs right into my skin without leaving a film or a cast. I have dry skin so having a sunscreen that absorbs into my skin and allows for me to still wear my makeup is super important. This is absolutely a product that goes with me in my purse everywhere I go! Love it!
