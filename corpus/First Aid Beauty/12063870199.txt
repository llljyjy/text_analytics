I purchased a set and it contained a mini of this product. I was intrigued but horrified when I noticed how pearly this product is. Why exactly does this skincare product contain shimmer? There is absolutely no reason as to why a skincare product should contain shimmer. I absolutely hate it when creams contains useless ingredients like dyes and shimmer. This makes me roll my eyes. No thanks, I don't want shimmer under my eyes.
