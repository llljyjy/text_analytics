Full disclosure, I received this product for free to try out the product and leave a review. Honestly, it’s pretty great. There is absolutely no white cast at all when you are applying it, and after using pretty consistently for the last few weeks, I haven’t noticed my pores clogging from this at all. It does feel a little sticky when it goes on, but I really don’t mind it that much! It acts as a great primer for my makeup, and leaves your skin with a great dewy glow. I will probably be purchasing this for myself when I run out. I love FAB products. Would Probably Buy Again
