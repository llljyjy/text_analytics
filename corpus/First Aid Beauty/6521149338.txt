I just got this for an exchange of my honest review. First thing first, it’s a mineral sunscreen everyone looking for a good one. I like the finish of this, leaves my face dewy yet not greasy or heavy. If your concern about white cast, you just have to be patient and give it a couple minutes. Blend it properly and it won’t leave white cast at all. I would definitely recommend this. Light and it works!!!
