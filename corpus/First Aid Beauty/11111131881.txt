I have been looking for a vitamin c serum to finish off my morning routine and this definitely did it!! I put it on in the morning before my moisturizer and it is the perfect combo. Leaves me skin feeling super smooth. I am very weird about smells and this serum is very pleasant! Highly recommend and am so excited to keep using and see how much brighter my skin gets! New Fav to my Morning Routine!!
