Honestly, nothing to rave home about. I was excited to try this but I feel like it didn’t do what it was described to do. It pilled under concealer. And the glitter/shimmer drew attention to fine lines. It didn’t plump or do much brightening at all. Wasn’t even all that hydrating. Just… meh. Disappointing! Would not buy again. Disappointing
