I have super duper dry skin and it usually chaps this time of year. I get people asking if I am a burn victim no matter what I do. Skin flaking off and everything. no moisturizer has completely helped (not even using aquaphor) until this. I pit it on and my skin stays moisturized. its magic. however, I donâ€™t like the tube and the smell is a little odd. but still amazing amazed
