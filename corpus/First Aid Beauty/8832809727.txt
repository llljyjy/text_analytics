I have tried so many face sunscreens and this one is by far the best at keeping my face from looking greasy. The formula is light and goes on so smooth, didnâ€™t leave behind any white residue. I have a darker complexion and my friend with a very light complexion also tried some and we both agreed. This is going to be my staple sunscreen of the summer! Light formula + non-greasy. It's a yes for me.
