A step up from the ultra repair cream. I don’t love having to stick my finger in the jar. Leaves the skin supple, juicy, and hydrated. A pea-size does the job but sometimes when taking the product out with your finger you can take out more and can’t put it back. Of course, I just use it up on my body or as a second layer but still a little inconvenient. If you can get a little scoop for it, do it lol. Supple and Hydrated!
