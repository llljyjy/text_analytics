My sensitive skin was not loving any of the other clean brands I had been trying. I developed dry patches, my skin was red and I’d get hive like bumps. I was at my wits end when a Sephora employee told me to try this brand as even some of the other clean lines have fragrance which can irritate. It hasn’t even been a week and after scaling back and only using this and the ultra repair cream my dry patches, redness and hives are gone and my skin feel so soft!! I am so excited to try some of their other products once I’m confident my skin can handle more. definitely first aid for sensitive skin
