These were recommended to me in store and so glad I bought them ! I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and I use acne cream twice a day, leaving my skin uneven and often very dry/peeling. I was afraid these would irritate my skin but no, it evened out my skin tone and actually even helped with my acne. I cut them in half to make them last longer. Amazing product - will keep buying. nan
