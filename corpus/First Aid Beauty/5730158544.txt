I received this for free in exchange for my honest review.I’ve been looking for a good mineral sunscreen and was excited that I got the chance to try this.Formula wise, this is great, it blends in easily. It can sometimes pill depending on what skincare I’ve used underneath, but normally it’s OK.Unfortunately, it leaves a cast on my medium toned skin. If I’m at home or just working in my garden, running errands, it doesn’t bother me.If I go out, I like to use this under foundation so that the cast isn’t noticeable.Overall it’s a good sunscreen. I’d like to see a tinted version of this! Cosmetically elegant formula
