I have super sensitive skin and my last foray into retinol was a disaster. My dermatologist encouraged me to try again and go slower. This product has not irritated my skin at all! I started out as recommended - just a few days a week and now I use it every day. Highly recommend this product if you are curious about retinol and have irritable skin like me. Great for sensitive skin.
