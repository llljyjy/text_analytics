Received a sample to try. I put it on in the morning after my daily eye patch routine. I’m not sure if it’s the eye cream itself, or the combination of the cream and eye patch ingredients, but this did not absorb at all. After 20 minutes, I could still rub this cream off in flakes. I would consider only using this at night. Definitely not something to use in the morning or under makeup. Not for my morning routine.
