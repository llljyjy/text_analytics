This is the best cleanser I’ve ever used! My skin is so sensitive, as well as being dry and acne-prone. This cleanser doesn’t strip my skin, has improved and almost eliminated breakouts, and takes off all of the residue from the day leaving my skin glowing. I love that it’s not crazy expensive. It’s fragrance free, with a slight oat-like aroma when it foams up. I got multiple compliments on my skin after only a couple days using this product. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS.
