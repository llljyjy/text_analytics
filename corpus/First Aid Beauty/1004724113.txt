I have sensitive skin and not a lot of products that work for me. I did some research and decided to try the vitamin C brighten serum. I’m so excited, I had no breakouts! I feel like this product not only brightens my skin but also moisturizes. I don’t add any other moisturizers because I feel that the serum provides enough. Less is best for my sensitive skin. I’m definitively going to continue using and look forward in trying other products from First Aide Beauty. Works well for sensitive skin
