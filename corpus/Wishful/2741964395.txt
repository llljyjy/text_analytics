Huda - you’re a sheer genius. This product is great. As instructed, I’ve used it 1 to 2 times a week but gradually increased usage. After each use, I notice brighter softer skin. I do think it is getting rid of some hyperpigmentation and smoothing out the skin in general. You have to give this a try. I have pretty sensitive skin and haven’t had any adverse reactions at all. well done
