First off this is ALOT of product for a sleep mask, almost 2oz & you don’t need much at all. This defnitely will last me a long time. To me there is no smell or taste. The consistency is thicker in the component but once you touch it & warms up, it becomes thinner & easy to apply. My only issue is, if your moving your mouth or touching your lips together then the mask doesn’t last long on the lips & I think that is due to the products consistency changing to thin once on the lips. If they could make it last longer than this would be 5 stars. ALOT of product
