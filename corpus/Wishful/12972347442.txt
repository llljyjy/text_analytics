My experience.... I use a pea size amount at least 3 times a week around 30 min before bed time to ensure my skin soaks with the goodness and absorbs the content, the texture overtime after the application transitions from a thick balm to a lightweight feeling mask with the heat of my skin, I like to leave it on overnight and wash it off the next morning for a beautiful plumped skin. My skin feels refreshed and more nourished than ever.Thanks again @huda @hudabeauty for allowing me to test out this amazing product. 100% recommended it. Great
