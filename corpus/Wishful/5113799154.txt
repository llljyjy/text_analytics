I got this as a sample in my most recent order and it was bad. As soon as I put it on my undereyes they started stinging and I threw the rest out. I love Hudaâ€™s beauty products, but unfortunately between this and the rose oil, their skin products are just a miss for me so far. Not gentle on the under eye area
