I got this as a sample with my most recent order and was excited to try it. Once I opened the package I was instantly turned off by the super strong smell, I tried to ignore it and swatched a bit on my finger and the cream appeared purple on me which was weird. I put a bit on my face and my skin instantly reacted and not in a good way. I had it on my face for a total of 10 seconds and it started to tingle a bit. Overall this wasnâ€™t for me but hey it might be for someone else. Not for me :/
