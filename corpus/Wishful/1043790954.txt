This is AMAZING!! I had tried it a few times and been underwhelmed but I had not read directions and used it on damp skin but its supposed to be used on dry skin and that is when miracles happen.It beads up in a weird way which purportedly is dead skin but the difference afterwards is amazing. My skin was baby soft - it felt better than any facial or any treatments I have ever tried.Immediately went out and bought the biggest tube! Best exfoliator I have ever used !! Used on dry skin itâ€™s a game changer
