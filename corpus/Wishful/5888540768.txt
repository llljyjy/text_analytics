I normally don’t use applicators like this but the formula is thin enough to where it doesn’t gunk up on the tip. The serum itself feels very lightweight but still moisturizing, and the applicator feels nice and cold under the eyes! The only downside would be it starts to break up my concealer even after it’s been set with powder, so I use this either at nighttime or on my no makeup days:) pleasantly surprised
