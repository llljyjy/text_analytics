I got a sample of this product and been using it for 4 days. During these days I was wearing more makeup than usual + heavier foundation, so I thought that this balm will be a perfect moisturizer. And it was - to use it prior to doing my makeup in the morning. It glides on very smoothly and acts like a great base. However, after overnight application my skin didn’t feel any different and I had a feeling that in the morning I was washing of a layer of this balm and it didn’t absorb into skin at all. It feels luxurious though, glides on the skin very smoothly, but doesn’t do much. Very expensive Vaseline
