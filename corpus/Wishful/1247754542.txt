I tried this for the first time last night on my face and I woke up with soft, youthful, and matte skin. The negative reviews got me reading about dimethicone being comedogenic and most studies I’ve read say it is non comedogenic in cosmetics. The journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology says the same. I don’t think it’s the same as vaseline like some reviews said. Try putting Vaseline on your face and see if you get the same pleasing experience the added lavender and honey ingredients create. This stuff smells great, glides on my skin, and very moisturizing without the grease. I will update my review if this changes. I received this as a sample with my purchase but that’s not an incentive to rave about a bad product. Woke up to youthful skin without the grease
