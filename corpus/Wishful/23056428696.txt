I actually really like the texture, and it was very luxurious feeling and moisturzing-- probably best for a night cream. However all that ’smoothness’ is the result of two different kinds of dimethicone being in the top ingredient spots. Now, Dimethicone is not ’dirty’ or toxic (can trap in moisture and make some people break out), but it *is* cheap and synthetic so not exactly what you’d expect from a “clean“ or “luxury“ product which is supposed to be niacinamide heavy NOT dimethicone heavy. I would recommend for those with really dry non-acne prone skin IF it were at a lower price point. So much dimethicone!
