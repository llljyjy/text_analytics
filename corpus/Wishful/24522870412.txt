I wanted to love it, thankfully I got the mini size. I little goes a long way. However it didn’t do much on the exfoliating part. It just felt like the product was rubbing its own self against my skin. My skin still felt the same as of pre-wash. It was pretty disappointing, but hey I used it on my body as a scrub, just so I don’t feel like I wasted money on soapy gummy paste. product scrubs itself, not your face.
