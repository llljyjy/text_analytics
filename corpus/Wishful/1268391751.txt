I really wanted to love it. Its lightweight, absorbs well, does not irritate my skin but the smell is just AWFUL. Took me a few uses to figure out what it reminded me of and its freaking fabuloso. Without the scent? 4 stars because I need a heavier evening moisturizer for my dry skin and I bought this to be a night moisturizer for summer. Wth the scent? 2 stars.  Terrible. Smells like fabuloso
