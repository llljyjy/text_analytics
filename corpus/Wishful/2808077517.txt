I got this a free sample. Tried it only once at night and I could feel the silicone before even applying it to my face. This moisturizer is very think but not creamy. On my face, it felt like wax. It’s so thick and fake feeling. Couldn’t stand the way it made my skin feel that I washed my face. too artificial for me
