Iâ€™ve been sick for about a week now, so my skin has been pale and dry. I tried this last night and wow when I woke up (and even after washing my face!), my skin was still hydrated and glowing! It totally rejuvenated my skin. It remained hydrated throughout the day too. It comes with a little spatula to mix the formula around and get the right amount. So nice! Not strongly scented, either! Another hit from Wishful!
