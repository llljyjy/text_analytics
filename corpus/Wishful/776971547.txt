I received a sample of this and loved it so much I decided to buy the full size. I know it’s supposed to be a facial moisturizer, but the lavender scent is so relaxing I love to use it on my hands and arms before I go to bed.  It has a shimmery appearance that just makes your skin look gorgeous.  It contains real lavender essential oil, so if that’s not your thing then this product is probably not for you.  Also, it does have a shiny appearance so you might want to apply to your face at night versus the daytime. Totally worth the price! Feels like a spa treatment!
