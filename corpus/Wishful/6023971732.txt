Received a sample and bought the full size. I love how you feel the dead skin roll off as you continue to work in the product. My skin looks brighter and smoother. I do not break out from this product and have seen a reduction in clogged pores, especially on my chin/cheeks from masks. Itâ€™s a beautiful product and is a 2 minute luxury! I use it on damp, not wet skin and really work it in. nan
