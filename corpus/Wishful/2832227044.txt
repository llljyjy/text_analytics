I was skeptical of this product but used my points to get the mini and was very surprised. I have combination skin, hormonal acne and dry patches so it is hard to find a good moisturizer. In the morning itâ€™s great before makeup, it helps my foundation to slide over the dry patches smoothly (and the dry patches have improved). At night I use this over UFO oil and finish it off with Vaseline on top. Sounds counterintuitive to smother acne in moisture- but my skin has honestly never looked better. Bought the full size. Love it!
