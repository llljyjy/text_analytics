I am medium brown skinned South Asian female in my early 40s. Suffer from very oily skin and break outs basically since I was 11. The biggest struggle has been post inflammatory hyperpigmentation that LINGERS forever. I used various lightening products (hydroxyquinone was the worst for me, even at lowest concentration) and my extremely sensitive skin would get WORSE from them, basically burning my already hyper pigmented skin and therefore darker spots for weeks and weeks and weeks. It’s been frustrating. I can manage my acne but the hyperpigmentation… even from a rash , would linger. This stuff is AMAZING. I thought i had been on it maybe a month because the results were phenomenal and when I checked the date of shipping and package delivery, I was stunned it hadn’t even been two weeks yet. I use nightly after a really really gentle cleanser (I use an Aussie  brand called Goodness that I only found on Walmart website in the US). then i use the other wishful product exfoliated with aha /bha that another reviewer recommended. Finally i massage this oil in all over my face, focusing though on the huoerligmented areas. The results were fast. the first week i already noticed a difference. it’s almost been 14 days and i can go without makeup . I still wear concealer and powder simply out of habit. but i no longer need foundation. this stuff and aha/bha exfoliator have been miracles. I wish i had used this heads ago. would have saved my self esteem, heartache and   not to mention money. this actually works
