This oil shocked me. It absorbed so well. Did not leave me feeling greasy. And my skin has looked more even and brighter—not sure if thats solely from this oil. I felt my skin stayed hydrated/moisturized while using this. The only reason I really hated about it was the smell! Omg, the smell was so strong and really caught me bu surprise. I don’t personally like the smell but I will continue to use and repurchase this. This might actually be my favorite oil of all time. nan
