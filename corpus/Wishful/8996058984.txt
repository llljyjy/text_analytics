Received a sample, the next day I purchased. Glides on like silken honey, has a pearly finish making you shine like the warm sun, thick and creamy but with a jelly consistency and skin drinks this stuff little by little as the hours go by; doesnâ€™t just sit on top of skin. Lovely Lavender scent that calms before bedtime. Perfect for winter; non greasy or filmy. You CAN have it all!
