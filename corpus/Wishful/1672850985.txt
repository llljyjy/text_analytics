Got a free sample of this with a recent purchase and I’m in love. The fragrance is true lavender, which I’m not the biggest fan of, but it’s so good I can look past it. I have combo skin, winter dries me out so bad and it’s hard finding the right amount of moisturizer that helps dry skin but doesn’t break me out. This is it. This is better than DrJart’s ceramidin cream, which has been my go-to for years. I’m officially converted. impressive
