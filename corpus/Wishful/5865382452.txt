I rarely purchase things after trying samples, but I couldn’t help myself on this one. The fragrance is very mild and natural, and my skin feels so soft after using. I don’t love the way it balls up when you start rubbing it, but since it’s a face wash it’s no big deal. I use it only a couple times a week and I definitely feel an improvement in texture. nan
