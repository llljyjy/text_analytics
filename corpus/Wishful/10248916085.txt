I tried it as a free sample a few months ago and as soon as it was empty i went and got the big size. Iâ€™ve been using it every morning since then and i have not had any breaking out like before since.At first, the texture feels kind of greasy on the fingers, but after applying it, my skin feels smooth, hydrated and glowy. It does feel a tad greasy on rare occasions, but other than that, it does wonders for my type of skin. I also love the mild scent of lavender and honey. Beautiful product for my mixed skin
