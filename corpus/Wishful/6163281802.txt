Hands down one of my favorite moisturizers! If you’re looking for a moisturizer that leaves your skin hydrated and plump for several hours, this is it!! I apply this one at night, and when I wake up the following morning my skin almost feels like it did after applying the moisturizer. It has a thicker consistency, but goes on smoothly and absorbs. It has a subtle fragrance as well. Also, if you’re looking for an Elemis dupe, this one comes pretty dang close! Elemis Dupe!!
