I like this moisturizer but I don’t love it. I think it’s good at moisturizing but that’s really all I can say about it. I personally didn’t feel like it did much extra for my skin and isn’t really worth the price point. I’ve finished my jar and don’t plan to repurchase. Don’t get me wrong there isn’t anything bad about it however I do feel like there are other moisturizers for less money that are more beneficial to the skin. If you have sensitive combo skin its a fine lightweight moisturizer I just expected a little more from it. Just okay!
