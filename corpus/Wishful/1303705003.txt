The lavender fragrance is overwhelming. I received a sample of this and, full disclosure, did NOT apply to my face. I used it as a hand cream. It’s very silicone-heavy. In fact the silicones outweigh the niacinamide as far as ingredients are concerned. There’s a subtle, superficial “glow” effect to this cream, which might make it a nice addition under your makeup if you don’t have sensitive or compromised facial skin. If you do, steer clear. This won’t do you any favors and could irritate. Overall I don’t see the point in this product, especially at this price point. There are so many options that are so much better and contain actives that do more. Save your money. Not Worth the Price
