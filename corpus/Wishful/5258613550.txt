I have normal to dry skin and I wanted to find a face scrub that removes dry skin and makes my face soft afterwards. This did not do that. I bought into the hype and after a month of use I can confirm it makes your skin very dry afterwards and my skin hasnâ€™t gotten better. I would save your money and look for something better! Not everything that is hyped is good. Not worth it
