I’m actually surprised to see any bad reviews about this product…I think it’s definitely underrated. I would say I have sensitive skin. I had acne in my teens and now at 37, my skin has a few age spots and discoloration as well as dryness in my cheeks and forehead. I’ve been using cerave because it’s gentle but it has always felt like it works when you first apply but it doesn’t last throughout the day and I have never seen an overall improvement in my skin texture, just seems like a temporary solution. but the wishful honey balm is my new fave. 1) the scent is NOT as strong as some other reviews indicated- it’s subtle and does not last 2) it feels like silk and just rolls on so smoothly 3) perhaps most importantly, I’ve seen lasting results in just three days using the product at night before bed and in the morning. My skin looks visibly brighter and softer and I keep touching my face because I can feel the difference. I put makeup on over it and my skin stays well hydrated all day (no flaking or dryness after application). I definitely think it’s worth trying. Smooth and long lasting hydration
