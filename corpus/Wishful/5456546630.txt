This product feels synthetic and poor quality. The pearly hue does not compliment a natural or minimalist look if that’s what you’re going for. Additionally, the jelly texture was not pleasing for me. I’m trying to wrap my head around the marketing as well- honey balm, moisturizer, jelly, … please pick one! The only thing I’m “wishful” for is my money back after purchasing this. Wishful for a Refund
