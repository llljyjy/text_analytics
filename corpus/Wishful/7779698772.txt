Not a fan. This may work for some other people and if it does thats awesome. This product made my skin so dry and flakey. I kept giving it a few more days thinking that my skin just needed to get used to it. Its highly perfumed and is so thick without any moisture at all. I do hope this works for you, it just wasnâ€™t for me. Just not for me.
