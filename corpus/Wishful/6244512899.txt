So I have oily skin naturally, but since I use tretinoin and other actives, my skin is peeling and dry, I also have rosacea, so I was looking for the most nourishing cream. This felt so good on my skin, and it did not pill since a lot of creams with dimethicone tend to do. I also applied this under my favorite sunscreen by paula’s choice the youth extending spf 50, which did not pill, and I apply a lot of sunscreen. So this is a dream combo for me, and during the day if I feel dry I spray the Laneige cream spray- another great product. As I read the other comments about the “bad“ ingredients, I have to say that  it has lavender oil, I am sure they formulated it in a way that is not bad for your skin. You really have to see what works for you and not go by what people say. If I had listened to all the comments, I would also not buy this, but I received it as a sample and I gave it a chance. If your skin is peeling and has dry patches try this, but use it under a hydrating moisturizer like clinique moisture surge or something similar and then use this to seal in the moisture. It feels like relief to my peeling dry skin
