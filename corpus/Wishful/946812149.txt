I have extremely dry,  sensitive and reactive skin that I have tried to help with retinols and chemical exfoliants that didn’t help or just made my dryness worse and caused hives. I bought this for my mom on a trip to sephora and tried it a few times when I would go visit and since my skin didn’t react that was a huge plus. It’s pricey so I was hesitant but bought a trial size to test out. Well using this with my new less pricey finds, the ordinary  squalene and cerave moisturizer has been the best routine I’ve had since I was in my early 20s, I’m now 40. I just bought a large size after being without for about a week and I’ve noticed a difference in my dryness and overall glow. A little goes a long way. My trial size lasted me a long time and I used mostly everyday. I also feel like this helps my cerave cleanser to get all the makeup off since the cleanser is super gentle. I’m going to continue to buy this product. I absolutely love it!! Wonderful!
