Love this product. Very nourishing. People complain about the scent, but the ingredients are clearly stated & say the product includes lavender oil. I like the scent & don’t find it lingers at all. If you have an allergy or aversion to lavender, then it wouldn’t be for you. I’m already planning my next purchase of this. Want to try more from Wishful. nan
