Just purchased this today after doing some research online & then some comparisons in-store between moisturizers. I believe I’m going to be happy with this product, I am a fan of the quality, texture & ingredients so I cannot wait to see some results. There is only one exception I have & that is the fragrance. It is significantly strong. I personally can cope with it as it’s absorbing into the skin but for those that are really sensitive? It’ll likely be too much. Will update in time So far so good, just strongly scented.
