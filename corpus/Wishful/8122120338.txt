The fragrance in this product is nice.  Those complaining… go pick a fragrance-free product?  There’s tons out there, and some of us enjoy fragrance in our skincare!That said, I wasn’t crazy about this moisturizer as I did find it irritating, a problem which I practically never have with moisturizers (fragranced or non-).  I think it may be the actives.  For me I’d rather have my actives in separate products and a cream that only moisturizes so that I don’t have to worry so much about interactions.  That said if you want a quicker routine that includes niacinamide, this may be right for you. nan
