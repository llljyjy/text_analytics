I bought the biossance night time cream because I wanted a lavender feel, had a horrible reaction and burning. I had a tester of this in the same box and to my surprise opened to find lavender, jelly, soothed the irritation from the other products. I ended up buying a large jar and am so glad. love this! wouldnâ€™t wear during day but is awesome as my night time moisturizer. nan
