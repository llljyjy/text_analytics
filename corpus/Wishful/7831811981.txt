I’ve had this product for a year now and I use it here and there for facial exfoliation, but have never really noticed too much of a difference, I’ve not been really wowed, until recently.  I recently had a sunburn and it’s completely healed up but I’ve had some stubborn dry skin on my chest that I just could not get to go away. Finally, as like a last ditch “what the heck” option, I decided to try this product and see if it would help, and just wow. When I tell you it got every thing off and completely cleared my dry skin issue on my chest with just one application I am not kidding. I’ve never left a review before but I was so stunned by the results and difference in my skin with just one application. I definitely recommend this product, I have extremely sensitive skin as well and did not have a reaction. There is a bit of a fragrance but it’s not too bothersome. This Definitely became a holy grail exfoliater for me. Wow!!
