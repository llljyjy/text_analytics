Fun to use, great exfoliant, beautiful smell, and still gentle on the skin. I prefer wash-off BHA/AHA because leaving it on my skin can make me dry out or break out. This is perfect for twice a week in the shower. I love that it’s also a very gentle physical exfoliant -- the texture is fantastic and it really feels like it’s working. I’m annoyed by the price but the 100mL bottle lasts a few months so it’s worth the splurge for me. Worth the splurge
