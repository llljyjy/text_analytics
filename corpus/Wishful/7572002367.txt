i was hesitant to buy because of the reviews says itâ€™s beads up instantly. Bought it anyways and the beading happened but i continued to use it anyways and it turns out i just had a lot of dead skin! the beading is actually dead skin! this product works like magic and makes my sensitive skin super soft. highly recommend this product. like all skin care you just have to give it a chance! i love this exfoliator!!
