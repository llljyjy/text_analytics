This is one of the few sleep masks that do not irritate my skin. So yes, ingredient list is short but in my case that is for the best. I would not say that my skin feels glowing after using it, but it does a decent job in moisturizing and maintaining a healthy look. After application, it would remain tacky, but it doesnâ€™t concern me. All in all, love it so far. decent sleep mask for sensitive skin
