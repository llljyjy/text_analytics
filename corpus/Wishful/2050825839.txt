This is no bueno!! I rarely breakout and when I do it’s normally that time of the month and on my chin. Well, well, well! I have pimples and red bumps on my cheeks near my nose and spread over my cheek bones. I’m appalled and mad!! I’ve only used this for three days and I’ve never ever had a reaction like this to anything in my life, nor have I had pimples on my cheeks ever!! DO NOT BUY!! Bad for your skin!
