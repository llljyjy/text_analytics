I’m not sure if this is bad for my skin but I got this about a year ago as a sample and I loved it I don’t use it a lot only if I’m going to do a full face makeup because this helps with all my issues. Makes my makeup so flawless and I’m 100% sure it is this product if your make cakes up and you have mature skin give it a try Can’t live without this scrub
