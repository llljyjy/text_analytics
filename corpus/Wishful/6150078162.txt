I’m loving this moisturizer.  The texture is really lovely.. it’s a little firmer than most moisturizers. A little goes a long way. This melts into the skin well, but it is a little greasy feeling. But it doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy all day. And doesn’t break my makeup down after application. It has a really lovely glow to the skin. So even if you didn’t apply makeup, you would get a nice little glow from within without glitter all over your face. After makeup application though the glow pretty much goes away I think. The scent is very spa like and relaxing. Did not beak my skin out or irritate. nan
