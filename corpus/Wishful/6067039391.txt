I was very intrigued by this product texture and I wanted to put it to the test. I used the product on half of my face and left the other half with my normal skin care. After just one night of use I can feel a difference: my skin feels softer and plumper. I cannot wait to see the results after continuous use. Side note: the product has no fragrance and thatâ€™s a very good when it comes to skin care. Intriguing texture
