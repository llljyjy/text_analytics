Received a sample with a purchased product.  Tried it 2 nights ago. Initially I like the interesting “feel“ of the product.. unfortunately that is the only thing I liked.  My skin did not enjoy this chemical peel and thatvmay be my own fault but it definitely damaged my moisture barrier and my skin’s surface. Going on, it felt ok. Taking it off, I noticed a light flush.  Last night though was the worst.  My skin is screaming every time I touch it now, when I wash and even when I moisturize!   I looked up reviews online and found a video from James Welsh showcasing this product and he also mentioned that there is an array of ingredients that are known to irritate skin.   Too late for me.   This was my personal experience with it, it may be different to others of course.  I just felt I needed to voice mine and try to help people decide if they are new and curious and want to try this product at all that this may happen. Angry skin after using
