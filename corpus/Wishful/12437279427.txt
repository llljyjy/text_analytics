I have dry, very sensitive skin. This moisturizer feels great going on and smells nice…I just felt it didn’t hydrate my skin as much as my skin needs. If I’m comparing similar moisturizers around/near this price point, I reach for SkinFix triple lipid peptide moisturizer over this one every time. nice moisturizer, just not for me
