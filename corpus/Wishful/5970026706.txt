Beautiful and brilliant. Makes the skin pearly iridescent, and soft, and very glowing and healthy. If you’re into radiance this is a perfect product choice for you. Comes in a fairly big sized pot, and i feel it’s totally worth it. It’ll last a long time. I guess my only thing would be that I’d wish for it to be a bit less thick like a lotion because that’s just the texture I prefer personally, but at least I know that a little will go a long way and this will last a long time. Yeah guys It’s worth it. Skin like mamas pearls
