I got a sample of this in my recent package and decided to put it on as my last skin care step. Immediately as I put it on, it smelled terrible but it felt good on my skin but I was thinking to myself I can get over the smell, let me tell you a minute did not go by before I washed my face and started all over. It doesnâ€™t even smell like rose and too fragranced ! Feels good but not worth the smell
