This is a really strange scrub. Youâ€™re meant to use it on dry skin, but as you rub it in, it sort of creates these little pills that you then rinse off. I could see how that would freak someone out if they had tactile sensory issues. My main issue is that the scent is overpowering and heavily perfumed, which I do not like. nan
