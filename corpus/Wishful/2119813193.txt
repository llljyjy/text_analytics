I got a sample of this and thought it was body cream at first because it was so thick. However, it literally melted into my skin and it feels great— so hydrated! I can count on one hand how many times I’ve been converted from a sample but this one got me! Like others have said, the smell is meh. Definitely chemically honey scented but it goes away fairly quickly.Looking forward to ordering the full size now. melts into skin
