This might be the only chemical peel available at Sephora. I normally use K-beauty brand chemical peels, but I ran out of product and needed a replacement ASAP. The quality of the product is quite good. It’s made in S. Korea and it had the same sanitary packaging that’s found on Asian skin products. The mini size is perfect for travel especially since chemical peels can degrade with time and exposure. It’s nice to have one that can be kept in its original bottle. My only warning is that this chemical peel is strong, much stronger than the ones you find on the Asian market. I don’t recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin. It’s also expensive. $20+ for 3oz of product is very steep. If you’re in a pinch, this is a good temporary substitute. There’s no way I could recommend the full product at full price. expensive and strong
