I received this as a sample, and I can’t understand how it has good reviews. Firstly, it has literal shimmer. It’s like liquid highlighter was mixed in with the formula which is confusing because I don’t know why this is added in a moisturizer. It has no skincare benefits. Secondly, there is a very intense lavender fragrance, so if you have a sensitivity to fragrance- beware. Third, it leaves a very greasy film on the skin that doesn’t absorb. I really dislike this because I ended up with oil marks on my pillow case hours after I applied it, which never happens with the other moisturizers I use. This formula personally does not work for me, and I think it’s a good rule of thumb that your skin care should not double as a shimmery highlighter... I can’t say I would recommend this to anyone, and I also find the price absurd for the poor quality. Shimmery, very fragranced, greasy..
