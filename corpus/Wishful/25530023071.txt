I was not a fan at first. I thought it was hella greasy... it truly was! But I knew the ingredients were perfect for my skin so I told myself that I’d finish the product and then move on to another one... Today, I’ll stick with this little guy. I’m not going to shop for another one. It doesn’t feel greasy anymore, my skin is noticeably better and clearer... and just a little goes a long way. 55g lasted 4 months!Yes, it feels weird the first month of use.It takes time to love this product.But damn it’s worth it.(also the smell is great haha) Loving this one takes time
