SO happy Merit has expanded into skincare! I love everything I’ve tried from their makeup line so had really high hopes for their skincare. I’ve only been using this product for the last few days so I can’t comment on any long-term results, but I love the instant glow it gives me. It’s very lightweight so you get a nice glow right away without looking greasy. I took a star off because the pump dispenses a lot of product so if you have a small face like I do it dispenses a bit more than you need. The packaging is otherwise really beautiful and has a luxe look and feel! Can’t wait to try more from Merit’s skincare! Instant glow
