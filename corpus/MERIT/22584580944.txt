I’m a huge fan of Merit so I was super excited to try this. I love the ingredient list, the packaging and beautiful design, and the pump as well! This product gives me a glow after application and is gentle which I love - I’m super prone to break outs and it’s kept my skin looking great. But I’m honestly not a big fan of the consistency - I love more of a creamy but light/airy texture. This feels very liquidy and separates in the bottle, the absorption once you apply isn’t the best either. All in all nice product, I’ll give it a chance and see how it performs in the long run. Like it but not sure it's for me
