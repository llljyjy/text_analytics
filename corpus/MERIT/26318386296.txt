The Instant Glow Serum instantly makes my skin look and feel so rejuvenated, plumped, and healthy! I have combination skin and really struggle with finding products that genuinely make a difference for my skin. This serum sinks into my skin and instantly gives me a glowing, “that girl“ look that I have not been able to achieve with any other product. Even though my skin is oily, this serum leaves my skin looking dewy instead of over-hydrated. The niacinamide is amazing for reducing inflammation, acne, and pore size, and is an ingredient that I have always loved using for my skin. On the other hand, the hyaluronic acid leads to the stretching and flexibility of the skin, which helps to reduce acne scarring. I brought this product with me to Europe because I knew my skin might dry up a bit from the sun and seawater, and it was perfect for giving me such an effortless and healthy look. I would really recommend this product, MERIT truly did it again <3 Absolutely in love with this product!
