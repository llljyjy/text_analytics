Honestly, I am so impressed by the The Instant Glow Serum (Great Skin) and how easily I was able to incorporate the product into my existing skincare routine. The serum, while a small amount goes a long way, offered me such a glow payoff even after applying foundation. I’ve also noticed how smooth my cheeks in particular are after using twice a day. This area of my face has been so acne-prone since wearing masks most of the day - I’m so hype to find glow support with this. I am also looking forward to my skin having a consistent glow especially through the winter season. Glow Obsessed
