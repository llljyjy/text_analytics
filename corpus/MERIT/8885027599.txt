It is water like texture. The pump just shoots it out. It is is a game of luck everytime I try to use it. Will it mess all my counter up or not. Annoying! Also I see no difference using it. Yes it glows up your face for a second, but then it soaks in an the effect is gone. Whatâ€™s the point? Messy water
