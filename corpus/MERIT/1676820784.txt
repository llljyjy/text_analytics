I really really love this serum. It melts into your skin and gives you a definite glow. It’s really amazing actually! I love wearing it and just leaving my skin bare which I do often but it’s also really lovely underneath makeup. Every product I have tried from Merit has been high quality, effective and beautiful to use. Truly love this brand.Note: Do agree with others that it is quite liquid-y so pump carefully in your hand the first time or it’ll splash everywhere. Don’t find this to be a bad quality at all, it’s actually what makes it melt in so smoothly with no stickiness or overtly oily! Legit
