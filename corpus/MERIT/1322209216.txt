This skin serum is amazing for mature dry winter skin! I tried it for the first time two days ago and I want to use it everyday now under my makeup. I just move from California to the east coast and my skin is much drier suddenly. I have been buying other black rose oil products and serums etc...Merit is only 38 dollars and my skin looks amazing. It was 28 degrees last night when I had to face to cold on this mountain to walk my dog....I rubbed this on my face and my husbands and our faces did not chap. in 30 mile per hour winds. Sold!!Thank you Merit and Sephora. My skin looks healthy with this on.
