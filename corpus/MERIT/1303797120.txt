I’ve only been using this serum for a week so I cant comment on the long term benefits but this does produce a glass skin finish even on my normal but mostly dry skin! The serum itself has no scent to it and has a unique feel - almost like a dry oil but more hydrating that that. I love that it’s a biphase (or maybe triphase?) because it looks pretty in the bottle and it’s fun to shake up the serum and “mix“ it before applying. because the serum feels thin you’ll have to work quick to get it on your face. If I was picky id ask for this to have a thicker texture to it so I don’t feel it run between my fingers -- but I still absolutely love how it makes my skin feel and look! finally a possible way to have glass skin. I’ve been able to wear my kosas foundation with it just fine too. If you need lightweight, this is it. if you want glass skin when you even have not so special 40 year old skin? This might be for you too! Fantastic so far!
