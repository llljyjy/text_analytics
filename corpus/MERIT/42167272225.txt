I was pleasantly surprised by this serum. It has an oily yet very light texture. With my sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin, I’m often reluctant to try new products, but I can say that I’m very happy to add this product to my beauty routine. The niacinamide helps with the healing of my blemishes, the hyaluronic acid moisturizes my dry skin and the caffeine stimulates the blood circulation in the skin to reduce acne and firm the skin. Also, it does no disturb my makeup. I highly recommend it. An amazing addition to my routine!
