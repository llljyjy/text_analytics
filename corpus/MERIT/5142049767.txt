I’ve been using this serum every morning for the past two weeks and I LOVE it! It’s my first step right after skincare and before I put moisturizer on, and I really feel like it makes me skin look extra glowy and smooth. I have sensitive skin, so this serum hasn’t irritated it at all. The *only* thing I struggle with is getting the product out of the bottle — because it’s so light and thin (which I love) it’s hard to keep it all in my hands and then apply it to my face. I still get 98% of the product onto my face. Maybe I just need some tips on how to apply more expertly. That said, still 5 stars from me! Hydrating & Glowy
