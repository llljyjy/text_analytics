Been using this for a few days and I am impressed! This formula is different from other serums in that it is bi-phase so you do have to shake it up. But when you apply it, you immediately notice glowy skin. It leaves my skin hydrated and supple. It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue left afterwards. Totally recommend adding it to your skincare routine! A new must-have for your skincare routine!
