I was gifted this product, but I’m loving it so far. The bottle, packaging, and product feel luxe and calming. The serum is different than traditional serums, it’s more watery but I think this is to its benefit. It absorbs like a second skin and is great moisturizer. I’m not yet sure how it will impact the text of my skin, but I’ll update this review as time goes on! Lastly, I do wish it had a stronger smell. I can’t smell it at all! Some people will love that, I love a subtle scent. Light & beautiful
