After using this product for about a week, I absolutely love it! From the packaging to the formula Merit knows what they are doing! The pump is a little faulty but that’s my only complaint. This glow serum doesn’t have any smell which I’m a fan of. Plus it leaves your skin feeling healthy and glowing. I definitely will buy it again!! Glowing Skin + Luxury Packaging
