I love how lightweight and fresh this serum feels; however, after using this product for a week it caused me to break out a little.  My skin is super sensitive and acne prone.  I want to mention that I did not mix this product with any other product.  I only put this on my skin in the AM.  If this product did not cause me to break out, I would purchase it because I really do love how lightweight it feels. nan
