Full transparency: I was gifted this product in exchange for my review. I’ve been using this product for a little bit over a week now. I apply once a day in the morning before my usual moisturizer and sunscreen. It’s a great product for dry skin like mine. I can visibly see the difference in my skin’s vibrancy before and after I apply this product. My skin appears more plump and just overall healthy. I love that it’s fragrancy free and vegan. My only downside is that the serum is extremely thin/watery. It can be a little messy to apply and it feels like it could be easy to waste product by accident. However, this will def be a staple in my routine especially as we head into the dry winter months. nan
