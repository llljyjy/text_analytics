Iâ€™m not used to using serums in my routine but this one will definitely get implemented! I used it for a couple of days to see how my skin reacted to it; honestly, I enjoyed the results. I applied it before my moisturizer and my skin felt hydrated right away. It left a nice natural glow, nothing excessive which I liked. I would totally recommend the serum My routine has changed forever !
