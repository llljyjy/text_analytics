Does give a dewy finish. I actually don’t love it under makeup though. For some reason when I apply this under my foundations, my skin doesn’t look as smooth. I have to make sure I apply a moisturizer after applying this too, otherwise it sort of just sits on top of the skin. I have dry skin and 2 pumps is enough to cover my face and neck (3 is too much and I end up feeling oily). The pump IS aggressive, as other reviews have mentioned. I have to cup my hand and pump it into it like a bowl. Haven’t noticed a difference in skin texture and pigmentation and I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks but the immediate dewy finish is nice. I like that it doesn’t really have a scent. Needs to be shaken because it separates.  I only apply this in the mornings. Probably won't repurchase.
