This serum is super dreamy. It feels like an essence and a serum had a baby. It makes my skin feel fully hydrated. I use this after washing my face and applying an essence, while my skin is still absorbing the essence. I read somewhere that hyaluronic acid works best applied to damp skin because if your skin is dry it will work the opposite way and pull the moisture out of your skin. I have no idea if that is actually true, but Iâ€™ve since always applied anything containing hyaluronic acid to damp skin and have found it to work best that way. I gently pat the serum into my skin and it definitely leaves my skin super glowy. Gives so much glow
