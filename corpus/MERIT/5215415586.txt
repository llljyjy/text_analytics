Ok, I’m convinced anything Merit makes is pure gold! I’ve been using their products since they started in 2020! This new glow serum did not disappoint. I love how light it is. I don’t usually wear a lot of make up so I just use this, my moisturizer and my tinted SPF and it just gives me that radiant + glowy look. An absolute must have in my skincare routine! Oh and the bottle is so pretty! Glowing skin all year round!
