First of all I got obsessed on how beautiful this bi-phase serum in glass packaging. Unlike my typical serum this has a liquidy texture, very lightweight, & sinks immediately on the skin. I instantly feel how it makes skin soft and feels smooth. As the name says, it leaves radiant glow that doesn’t look greasy. It doesn’t cause peeling under my moisturizer and sunscreen.  This serum can replace several serums in my routine considering it has hydrating, brightening, plumping, soothing, antioxidant, and healthy barrier supporting ingredients. A serum you must try!
