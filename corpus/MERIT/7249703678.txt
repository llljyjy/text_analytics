This new serum from Merit Beauty is incredible. Not only is the glass bottle luxurious, but so is the product inside and it rivals my more expensive serums for a fraction of the price. If you’re looking for a serum that give you hydrating skin, a radiant finish, and is non irritating, this is the one for you. As a gal with dry, sensitive skin, this product checks all of the boxes that I look for in a skincare product and then some, without irritating my sensitive skin. Overall, I am so excited about this Great Skin serum and can’t wait to continue to test it out and see how my skin looks further down the road! nan
