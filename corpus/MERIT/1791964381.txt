I haven’t been using this more than a few days, so I can’t really speak to its results, but I love that this serum is full of so many good ingredients for the skin like niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. It minimizes the need to layer several serums. You have to shake this before applying to get it all mixed up. I noticed it feels very weightless on the skin, and I have oily skin so that was a relief. I’ll continue testing this out but I have really high hopes. I use hyaluronic acid everyday and have been wanting to incorporate niacinamide into my routine. Plus, the packaging is absolutely stunning! Great ingredients, I have high hopes!
