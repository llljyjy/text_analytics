I’ve been using Glow Serum as makeup base and I’m loving it!!! It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly.My skin is oily and acne prone so it’s very important for me to have glow without oily shine. And this product actually gives that perfect healthy glow and no trace of oily face!!And the best part of this serum is that it’s also part of skincare routine with niacinamide and 4 types of hyaluronic acid in it!! Perfect Makeup Base with Healthy Glow
