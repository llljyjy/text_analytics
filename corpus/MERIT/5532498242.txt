I actually don’t see oils listed in the ingredients list but after shaking up the serum, there is a bit of a slip to the serum. It glides over the skin smoothly but any oily feeling does not last as it absorbs quickly into the skin. I’ve been using this frequently when I want a quick morning routine before doing my makeup and this preps my skin well for it. I also use it at night even when I’m not going to be wearing makeup. MERIT packaging is also stunning as always! Overall, a great add to my routine Deeply hydrating and preps skin for makeup
