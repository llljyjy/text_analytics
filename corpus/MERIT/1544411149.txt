Love the oil in the morning under makeup. However, the pump is intense and annoying. The first squirt is always intense and makes a mess. Not sure they didnâ€™t use a dropper like most do for facial oils. This also g egg s absorb too quickly to be used as a gua sha facial oil. Great oil for the AM under makeup!
