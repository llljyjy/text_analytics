Even tho it feels a little oily, don’t be scared! Being that it is light it’s adequate for normal to oily skin. With 2 pumps it was enough for one use. I couldn’t help but feel the smoothness and see the instant glow while applying it. After a couple of uses I could notice brightness on my skin! One other thing that I absolutely loved is that it is fragrance-free which is perfect for sensitive skin. HEALTHY LOOKING SKIN✨
