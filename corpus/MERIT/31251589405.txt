I am really impressed with the packaging and it’s lightweight texture  that instantly hydrates and plumps my skin for a healthy glow. It absorbs immediately, also my skin felt more radiant - moisturized - Smooth. This serum has Niacinamide which helps in Brightening. I use this serum before my makeup to add more hydration and glow, I just pat some over top of my final skincare steps. It’s also suitable for all skin types. My skin is dry and sensitive ! I found it non-irritating, So I use it anytime when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration. I highly recommend this product ! I am obsessed
