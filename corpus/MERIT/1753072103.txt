First of all, the packaging is so LUXURIOUS! This lightweight serum absorbs nicely and leaves my skin instantly feeling soft and hydrated. I’ve worn it on its own for a little bit of a glow, but I love applying it after my moisturizer and under my makeup.. It does not have a fragrance and the formula has not irritated my skin at all. I can’t wait to use this product more and will definitely be incorporating it into my daily skincare routine. GLOWY SKIN MUST HAVE!
