I truly enjoy MERIT products, & was very excited when gifted this glow serum! I’ve been looking to add a new serum to my skincare routine, so this made for perfect timing.As a woman who wears little to no makeup, I’ve always been into the “clean girl” aesthetic, and utilize products that keep my skin radiant and healthy.I’ve been using it for about a week now. After cleaning my face, I apply the Glow Serum as a primer, then proceed to add any moisturizer, makeup, etc. It holds up well throughout the day, and definitely provides a gorgeous sheen. The serum is odorless, which is a plus for me personally.While I appreciate its lightweight finish on my skin, I’m not a fan of it’s liquified consistency. It’s quite runny, and the label recommends using 2-3 pumps, but 1 is enough.Overall, I would recommend this product! A new go-to in my skin care arsenal!
