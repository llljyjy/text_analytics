Retinol is a little intimidating so i was a little nervous. This is a good start to using it. I started at 2 nights a week as recommended and then went to 3. I did not have any irritation. It helped even out some redness in my face. My skin, overall, looked great after using it for a few weeks! Great beginner Retinol
