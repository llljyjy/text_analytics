The Shani Darden Facial Sculpting Wand is a sleek and modern device that uses sound wave technology. It is easy to setup and use. It includes a charing cable, a flat disc attachment, a precision ball attachment, and a prep gel. The attachments are magnetic so they swap out easily and the included instruction guide is simple to follow. There are three intensity levels and two frequency levels. The gentle massage pressure feels soothing and instantly relaxing on the face. It helps improve circulation, releases tension, reduces puffiness, as well as lightly lifts and subtly sculpts the face. I really enjoy using this device everyday as it feels so amazing on the skin and improves the overall appearance of the face. It comes packaged in a nice box, but without a storage or travel case. nan
