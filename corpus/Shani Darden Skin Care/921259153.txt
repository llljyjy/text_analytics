This eye cream felt very hydrating around my eye area. I thoroughly enjoyed how well it melted into my skin and did not creep into my eyes like most eye creams. It had a lightweight and silky texture, no fragrance, and did not irritate my skin. The pump dispenser made it easy and mess-free. I could see and feel the difference in my eye area when I had forgotten to apply. Overall, I noticed how it improved my skin elasticity and gave me a firmer look. I had great results with consistent use. Very hydrating
