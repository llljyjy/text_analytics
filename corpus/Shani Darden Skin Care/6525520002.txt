I received this product as a complimentary sample. I have been using this retinol for about a month and I have to say it does wonders to my skin. I love the texture of it, doesn’t sting or burn. Doesn’t have an awful smell which I like. Once I started using it I saw results within 2 weeks my skin was more smooth and brighter.  I definitely saw a glow on my skin, less dullness and more even tone. Overall im amazed by this product. Definitely will continue to use. Great product
