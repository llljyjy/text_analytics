I like using this tool in the evenings prior to my routine. It’s really easy to use, I love that I don’t have to be standing in front of a mirror to use it, and the precision ball attachment for the crow’s feet is an extra bonus. It feels super relaxing, it’s like getting a really nice daily facial massage which should be a great preventative. nan
