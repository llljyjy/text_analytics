I am always a bit hesitant when incorporating a new retinol into my skin care routine because I am worried my skin will freak out. I like to start slow and slowly build up to more nights. I really like this one because it is gentle (no stinging or burning), it has no scent, and it absorbs nicely into the skin. I have combination skin and I deal with uneven skin tone and texture. I have experienced purging for the first time, but aside from that my skin is really loving this retinol and I canâ€™t wait to continue using it nan
