I love this serum, I do not have sensitive skin but every time I’ve tried to use retinol or incorporate it into my skin care routine it has either broken me out or turned my skin very red. I use one pump of this all over my face every two nights and put a heavy moisturizer around top of it and when I wake up my skin is firm but still somehow plump and I love it. I’ve been using it for a few weeks but will repurchase. I also love the glass bottle it gives it an extra luxe touch Love love
