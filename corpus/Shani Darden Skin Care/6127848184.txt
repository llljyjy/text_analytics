This is hands down my favorite lactic acid serum. I was having a serious skin freak out and had milia all around the perimeter of my face. I had this on hand and within a week or so it was all gone. It is stupidly expensiveâ€¦sigh . But it should last you a pretty long time if you use it appropriately. onestly it Milia where??
