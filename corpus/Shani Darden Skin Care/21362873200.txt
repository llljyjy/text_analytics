Soooooooo I received this Shani Darden retinol reformer for free so I could try and review the product. The instructions asked that I use it for a few weeks 3-4 times a week.  I have been using it now for about 6 weeks. Retinol does have a tendency to be a bit harsh and I do have to say this was not. I donâ€™t however see any difference in my skin, which is a bit disappointing. I have posted a before (hair up) and an after (headband) Let me know if you see a change in my skin. Hoped for more
