I was a little skeptical of this product at first but I dived right in. I’m aware of the effects of retinol products when you first start to use and started at every other day. I only had one day of dryness in 2 weeks and I think is was due to the colder weather that day. I took a before pic but I’m hoping for a little more time to show off my glamorous results. I didn’t find it helped with fine lines so far but it’s only been about 3 weeks. It definitely helped with my skin tone so far and although it brought out some acne at first , that has cleared. I would recommend this to add to your nightly routine expescially if your worried about over drying which I usually suffer from when using retinol products. Great product
