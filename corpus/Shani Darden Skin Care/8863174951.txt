I’ve been a longtime fan of Shani’s retinol reform, but I was hesitant to try the lactic acid product as my skin can be a bit sensitive with using AHA ingredients. This product claims to have 9% lactic acid, which I would say is close to published literature: one study compared 8% glycolic vs 8% lactic vs placebo, and the lactic acid had similar results to glycolic acid in fighting signs of aging, but with less irritation (Stiller et al).Thankfully, I did not experience any stinging while using this (WHEW). I did feel a mild tingle, as expected, but it did not disturb me and I was able to sleep comfortably. Upon awakening, my skin appeared more brighter and more even. I also appreciate that this formula includes some soothing ingredients, including panthenol and aloe. I speculate that these may have helped improve the comfort for my more sensitive skin.Final notes: do make sure to check the ingredients if you have allergies, as the formula does contain certain plant ingredients. Overall I am pleased! nan
