Let me start off by saying I’m only knocking off a star because of the price point. I don’t think this is a $50 moisturizer and I’ve tried a range of brands, low and high end. However, it’s really good! My first Shani Darden purchase and it has me interested in more products. I was looking for a replacement for the FAB Ultra repair face moisturizer which wasn’t in the store at the time and thought tis texture was similar, which it is. But this one just sinks in and works with the skin and whatever other products have been applied underneath, as well as it works well with SPF and makeup on top. My skin leans oily throughout the day but can feel really dry without proper moisture and this offers a great balance. Could use day or night if you’re not into heavy moisturizers for nighttime (but could also pair with night creams or eye cream). It’s very good! I resent paying almost $50 for it. Ima buy it again though. Understood the assignment
