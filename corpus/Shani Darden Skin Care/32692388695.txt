use the Shani Darden Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum a couple of times a week, in my evening skincare routine. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. I use a couple of pumps and wait for it to get absorbed into my skin before using any other products. It is very important to use sunscreen during the day after using this serum at night. I did not detect any smell. My skin has a nice glow in the morning. Wonderful Serum!
