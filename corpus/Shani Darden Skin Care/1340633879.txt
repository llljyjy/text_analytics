Received this complimentary for an honest review and wow did it exceed my expectations. As a lover of lactic acidosis, I’ve tried them all. The texture of this one is light and sinks in quickly. The results were immediate. My skin has been more glowy and even. Another important thing to know is that this product plays well with other products, no pilling and it’s great under makeup. I have played around with using it during the day and I love it before my vitamin c serum. This is a great product that I will most certainly repurchase when I run out. Do it for the glow!
