I’ve been using this for a few weeks now. I used to use a different lactic acid before and I didn’t realize how much my skin appreciates it and was missing it. This one is very soft and has a nice texture. I saw a difference in my texture and pore size within a few days. I really enjoy using this serum, a great addition to my night routine. The packaging is super nice and luxurious. Good addition to my routine!
