I was a bit hesitant when I received this product, my skin is super sensitive so I wasn’t sure if the lactic acid would irritate it as many other serums have. Thankfully, this product was not only gentle and didn’t irritate my skin but I also actually saw results within a couple weeks. The morning after application, my skin overall had a more even tone and looked more radiant. I never get enough sleep but this serum hides that well. My skin feels smoother and looks refreshed even after many sleepless nights. Gentle yet effective which is difficult to find. I will definitely continue using this serum in my nightly routine. love!
