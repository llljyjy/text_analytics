My skin is uneven, very sensitive, acne scarred, and very prone to cystic acne. Heard great things about Shani, bought her line, and have used it daily for the past 9 months. The products have worked wonders for my skin compared to where it was, but I was still getting cystic breakouts. Enter this serum. I bought a sample size, figuring I’d try it, probably not see much difference, and move on. Nope. Y’all, I’ve been using it every other night for a month now (rotate it with retinol reform) and I have not had a cystic breakout since. Not one. I’m 33 and suffered with less than happy skin my whole life, and for the first time ever, I’ve finally found something that works. Thank you Shani!!!! Yes, yes, YES
