I am going to give thus product 4 stars. I LOVED the way my face felt after applying the serum. It’s soft and smooth. I didn’t want to rush my time trying the product out b/c I wanted to give a comprehensive review that was true to my experience. I did see some of the fine lines around my eyes qnd on my forehead lessen some. I used it every night for 2.5 weeks. I noticed my skin feeling much more hydrated and soft during the time I used it qnd I’m hopeful with continued use ill see even more results.  I am going to continue to use it and give a 90 day review and a 6 month review on influenster. Check me out.
