Iâ€™m loving this Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum and feel it works wonders and has an amazing formula! I find it to be a potent yet gentle formula at the same time. I love using this at night and waking up with soft glowing skin. It evens my skin tone and exfoliates with AHA. This product is a must have. If on the fence definitely worth treating yourself. My skin has improved since using this particular product compared to others. Magic serum
