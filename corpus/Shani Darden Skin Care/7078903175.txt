I recieved this product for free in exchange for my honest review.I was thrilled to recieve this product, as I’ve already been using it in my daily skincare routine for about 2 years. I have super sensitive, breakout-prone skin, and was starting to notice some signs of aging (fine lines, uneven tone, lack of firmness, etc.) as I neared 40. I was nervous starting a retinol, so I started slowly, using it twice a week, and slowly building up to every day use. I did go through a tough 2 month when I started, as with many retinols your skin looks worse before it gets better. I’m glad I stuck with it, as I consider this product a staple in my skincare routine. It retails for ~$88 @sephora. Full disclosure: I also regularly get botox, have gotten filler, and have gone through four RF Microneedling (Morpheus8) treatments, so I consider my current skin to be a reflection of all of those along with this product. nan
