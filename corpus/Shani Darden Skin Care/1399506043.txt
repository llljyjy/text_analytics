I received this product to try for free and really like it. Iâ€™ve been using it about 2x per week for 1 month and love the results. Like other exfoliants, it reveals fresh bright skin and has been helping minimize my spots. What I love about this product is how gentle it is! I see the same results with no sensitivity or redness like other products like baby facial. This one seems similar to sundae riley but you only need to use it a couple of times per week vs every day. gentle and effective!
