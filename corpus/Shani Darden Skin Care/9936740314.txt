I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this and I like that it is not as intense as some other retinol products I have tried. I have seen improvements with my skin but it is pretty gentle so I would say beginner friendly! The packaging is high quality. Has a slight smell but goes away within a minute or two. I would recommend and I do plan on trying out other products by Shani Darden! Great for beginners wanting to use retinol
