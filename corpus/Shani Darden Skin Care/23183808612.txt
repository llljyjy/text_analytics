This was not too bad. I don’t believe this is user friendly, but once you get used to it, it’s easy to adjust and use. I’ve used it for a couple days now (on and off) and my fine lines have definitely looked softer on my forehead. Promising so far, but I’m not able to provide a definite answer for the price. nan
