I received this product complimentary from Shano Darden in exchange for my honest opinion. I am really loving this cleansing serum. It took off all my makeup instantly. It has the softest, creamy texture and it foams slightly, but not a ton. I donâ€™t know how, but it actually made my skin more hydrated and soft with only ONE use!!! I am super excited to try more from this brand. AMAZINGLY Hydrating and left me sooo SOFT!!
