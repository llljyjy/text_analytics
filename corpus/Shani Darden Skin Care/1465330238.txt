I got this product for free to test. I have to say I wouldn’t spend this much money on a lactic acid serum. There are plenty for half the price that are just as good. I did like the texture and consistency of this and it didn’t irritate my skin. I think it has the same effect of lightly exfoliating and moisturizing that my other AHA serums have. I don’t have any complaints other than the price Pricey
