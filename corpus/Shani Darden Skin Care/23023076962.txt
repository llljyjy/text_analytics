This face massager is so different from all the tools I’ve tried before! It’s a bit expensive but really does the job in reducing fine lines and improving skin elasticity overall. You won’t see deep wrinkles go away after just one use but with consistency you’ll definitely see the changes in your face. Great pick to level up your skincare game!
