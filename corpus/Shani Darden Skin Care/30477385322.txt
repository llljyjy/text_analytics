This lactic acid serum is one of the gentlest chemical exfoliators I’ve tried, which is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin! I did have a bit of stinging the very first time I used it, but I’ve been able to use it almost daily without irritation! I think the inclusion of ingredients like hyaluronic acid and aloe vera contributed to this. I have noticed a more even skin tone since beginning using this serum! nan
