Shani Darden Skin Care Retinol ReformI was ecstatic to see that I was going to get to try this retinol serum. I received this serum free from Influenster for my honest opinion after using. This had been on my “wish list” at Sephora for a while. This is not the first retinol I’ve used but so far it’s the best!  I’m 43 and can use all the help I can get when it comes to fine lines and brightening my skin. I’ve been using for 2-3x a week at night for the last 2 months. I’ve had no issues with using - no irritation. Serum is creamy & light and absorbs nicely into the skin. Sometimes I use a night time moisturizer along with it, but you don’t have to. When I wake up my face feels extremely smooth. I’ve noticed an overall change in the texture of my skin (softer/smoother), brighter/glowing and reduction of fine lines in my forehead and neck area. Overall, I’m thrilled that I got to try this and will continue to have this as part of my nighttime skincare routine! Run don’t walk & add this to your skin routine!
