I like the glass packaging. Made me a little nervous, but did feel like luxury when using. Not too fond of the smell. I did not notice a huge difference in my skin’s overall appearance, but a big factor for me is that it didn’t dry my skin out even if I forgot to use moisturizer. I had two white heads that appeared while I was using this. One of them came to a head and eventually popped before I started putting this on it. The other one I started putting this on it and it started getting smaller and smaller and eventually faded in a few days. Not drying/irritating
