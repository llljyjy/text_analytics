This is an interesting product. A cross between a cleansing oil and cream cleanser. Dispense on wet hands and rub on dry skin. It took off light makeup especially waterproof eyeliner. My skin felt clean but not dry or over-strip. A great cleanse for all season but will be a staple in my winter routine. Great cleanser for the winter
