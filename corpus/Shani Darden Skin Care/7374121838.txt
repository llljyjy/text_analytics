I was skeptical of this when I first received this but I gave this about a month of use before I reviewed to get a good opinion. I did not think I would see much difference as I’m in my 20s but I noticed something unexpected. My skin is always relatively good, only a few fine lines around my eyes mostly, but I saw the texture of my skin getting better as well as the few lines I had. Any lines I didn’t realize I had are smooth now making my skin look great. I absolutely believe this will help with any future skin issues I may have! My only complaint is it did make my skin a bit more dry but nothing unmanageable. Great!!
