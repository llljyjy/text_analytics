The Shani Darden Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum has really made a difference in the look & feel of my skin.  It is watery serum with no fragrance which I enjoy.  It has been a very gentle formula so far - I have been using this for about 2 weeks and have noticed a difference in the evenness and brightness of my skin. This has a really great combination of ingredients - AHA, PHA Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe but the price point is a bit steep! Overall I have enjoyed this product. nan
