I received this serum as a gift and I have been using this for a couple weeks now and here’s the deal! What I like about this product is that there is no strong scent and when applied it’s lightweight and doesn’t feel tacky after. It has a mixture of lactic acid, retinol, Niacinamide, and aloe. I have been using this every other night to avoid over processing my skin. The first couple times I felt a slight tingle which I love because it tells me it’s working. It’s yet to dry out my skin and I have noticed a visible and physical smooth feeling to my skin just after a week. Retinols and chemically exfoliating is key for me as I am in my mid 30’s. This will definitely be a product that I will be picking up again as part of my nightly regimen. Non-drying nightly treatment
