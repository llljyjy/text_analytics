I have given this 2 stars as the ingredient list is decent in terms of not containing anything sensitizing or pore-clogging. I have purchased it multiple times based on that and have finally given it up based on that it does absolutely nothing for my skin and I dread applying it everyday so will often go without moisturizer as a result. The texture is too thin for me and I donâ€™t notice any positive effects or even any moisturizing benefits from it. As far as an oil-free moisturizer goes it may be decent but there are better options. nan
