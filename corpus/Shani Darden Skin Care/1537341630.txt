I was excited to try this product as soon as I received it in the mail free from Influenster for my honest review. Before using the product I read the instructions because I know that retinol products can be Al little strong for certain skin types.  My skin is a little sensitive so I proceeded with caution.  I started out with just one night the first week. I love how smooth my skin feels after application. This did not bother my skin at all except for making it feel a little hot the first couple times I used it!  I have worked up to using it 3-4 days a week and I absolutely love how it makes my face look and feel.  I recently lost over 100 pounds and was worried about having loose skin on my face.   After using this product I have noticed a significant tightening of my skin! My skin has taken on this young glow that I haven’t seen in a long time!  The only thing I did not like about the product was the smell.  It’s not a bad smell just a little different. This did not effect the amazing results at all so I still give it 5 stars!  Everyone who is worried about the effects of aging really need to give this product a try! Amazing! I fell in love with this product!
