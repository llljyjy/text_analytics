Im so stoked to try this because I am enjoying Shani Darden’s retinol reform too. This eye cream is a rich cream but easy to spread. It’s moisturizing and plumping for my dehydrated undereye. Love how it’s full of skin loving ingredients and peptides. I’m milia prone and this did not give me milia and its nourishing so it’s a pass for me! Rich but no milia
