Honestly I was a bit skeptical on the wand but definitely noticed a difference even after one use. I followed the recommended videos and ways to use. I immediately noticed my face looked less puffy after one use. I took a photo from the same angle after a week and was shocked by the results. Consistent use and also pairing with Shani skincare definitely gives the best results. My fine lines around my eyes dramatically improved I almost couldn’t believe it. I can’t wait to see what this does for my skin over time. Please just add to cart!
