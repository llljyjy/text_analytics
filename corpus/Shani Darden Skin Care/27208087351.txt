The texture of the product is quite thick but it goes on to your skin without letting you feel greasy. When I first used the product, I made a mistake of rubbing it on which could not cover my entire face. Since the texture of the product is so thick, it will immediately stick to your skin once it is applied to the face. I later learned to pat/tap the product on with my palms, and it was no more problems. After a few uses, I feel that some of the fine lines are less viewable and my skin feel tighter. Unfortunately, I still cannot use it too many times a week because I will have small signs of breakout. Textra is heavy but light on skin
