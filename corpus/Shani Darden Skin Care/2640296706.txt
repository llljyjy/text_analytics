I am new to Shani Darden Skin Care and PHA. I usually like BHA, but I found PHA is better for my acne-prone/sensitive skin. Did not see any difference on the first few tries. After a couple of times of using it (I use it every 3-4 days), I can see slightly smoother skin. It looks like it helps to improve my acne and keep my skin calm. WIll try it for a longer time
