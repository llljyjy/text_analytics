I was using a drug store brand’s retinol product before using this serum and I really saw that it kept my acne in control. After finishing that, I started using the Retinol Reform regularly and even though a month passed, I still haven’t seen any difference on my skin. It does nothing to my acne or dark spots. It’s a shame as it is very expensive. So maybe retinol in it is not strong enough. I wouldn’t recommend this product. doesn’t work
