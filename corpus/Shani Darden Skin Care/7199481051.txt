It’s awesome, doesn’t irritate my severely dry red rosacea prone skin. Works fast, makes my skin look much smoother and more radiant. Helps get rid of acne. If you have the money and want to splurge, it’s definitely one of the best retinols out there. There’s just one thing. It just so happens to perform nearly identical to The Inkey List’s Retinol serum. Everything from how it looks and feels to how it helps my skin. Love Shani, but I’m not rich. Both are amazing, but I’m going back to The Inkey List after I finish this bottle. Wonderful dupe for this one. Very gentle but powerful, great stuff.
