I have dry, aging skin with hyperpigmentation. And, because of that, I use this AHA serum 2-3 times a week and other nights I use Retinol serum. I noticed minimized pores and brighter sun spots. I suggest you to use this product 2-3 times a week, and use retinol other nights, that way you wonâ€™t over exfoliate your skin nan
