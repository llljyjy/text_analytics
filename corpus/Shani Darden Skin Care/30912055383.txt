I received Facial Sculpting Wand complimentary from Shani Darden complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. This is a one of its kind sculpting device that uses acoustic wave therapy to target crowâ€™s feet and nasolabial lines. It also focuses on facial tightening using non-thermal technology. I have been using this device for almost a week now and I can definitely see some positive results.. My face seems a little toned. My cheekbones seem a little more prominent now. I love using this deivce. It is really relaxing. I also feel that the fine lines that were beginning to form near my eyes are becoming less and less visible, my skin seems a little tighter.  The Hydra Prep Gel hydrates, moisturizes and calms the skin as if also contains Aloe Vera. Definitely recommend. nan
