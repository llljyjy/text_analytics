I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Shani Darden. As an avid skincare user this Retinol Reform Serum is extremely good. The ultimate multi-tasker tackling fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone, loss of firmness and dark spots.  The Encapsulated Retinol allows for a slow release of the product throughout the night. It also has lactic acid great for gentle exfoliate, Niacinamide to help with skin discoloration and Aloe that helps calm and soothes skin irritation that could be caused by the retinol. I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks I can definitely see a different in my skins firmness and overall health of my skin. Itâ€™s gentle enough to use daily, and I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family. I would even purchase this product again as it has become a must have in my nighttime skincare regimen. Great
