I have combo/oily skin that is much more dry now that is cold. My skin is really sensitive and prone to acne and clogged pores. I have only been using this wash for a few days and I already feel like my skin texture is improving. Makes my skin feel really clean but doesn’t strip it . I’ve noticed my pores must be cleaner because my black heads are going away! nan
