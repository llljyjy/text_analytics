This is HANDS DOWN the best cleanser I have ever used. I’ve used dozens of cleansers over the years (from very pricey to drugstore options) but this is by far the best. It’s got a creamy texture with a soft lather and doesn’t irritate my eyes AT ALL. It removes all my makeup (eye makeup too) gently without drying out my skin and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I use it by dampening my palms and massaging one pump onto my face. I will never use another facial cleanser - it is that good. Worth every penny. THE ABSOLUTE BEST CLEANSER!
