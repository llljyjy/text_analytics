I received my Shani Darden Retinol Reform and I am using it daily. I am so impressed by this brand that I have discontinued using my previous brand of over 20 years. I am pleased with the package and the bottle design. The applicator is very user friendly and will compliment anyones decor. With all that said, the reason I am a huge fan of Shani Darden Retinol Reform is the incredible improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. The serum applies so smoothly and thoroughly that I feel an instant relief from the puffiness and tired look I have. I don’t have fine lines around my mouth so I am currently only using the Retinol Reform on my eye area. I know I will continue to use this product. I also believe that it is good for any gender and age. I highly recommend this product. ￼ ig cameron.dunn2
