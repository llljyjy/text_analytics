Since starting this my face no longer has the dry patches I used to struggle with and needed to exfoliate off. It has improved my skin texture, since it just feels smoother. From an anti-aging perspective though, I’m not sure it’s doing much? Been using this now for about 4 months and I don’t notice much of a decrease in my fine lines. good for skin texture
