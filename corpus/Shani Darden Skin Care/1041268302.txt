I discontinued use of my usual retinol serum and started using this daily. It’s been about 6 weeks so I feel I’ve had ample time to compare to other retinol products. I didn’t find it irritating and I do have sensitive skin. Twice daily was too much though and I noticed some slight tingling and redness. I didn’t feel like it worked as well as other products in smoothing my skins texture and I had some pretty bad breakouts while using it. Although I can’t say with certainty it was this product it just doesn’t happen with my other retinol cream. I think the price is a bit high for the lack of efficacy. The texture wasn’t my favorite and the smell could be better. Overall not a bad product but I would not purchase. Gentle Retinol
