This is hands down the best retinol I’ve used. I have oily somewhat sensitive skin. This goes on just like a moisturizer and does not irritate my skin at all. I just put a light moisturizer on top and my skin feels so soft. When I wake up I’m not greasy and this doesn’t dry my skin out like some other retinols have. It’s quite gentle but effective. I have definitely noticed that my fine lines are reduced significantly and the overall appearance of my skin is brighter. Best retinol I’ve ever used!
