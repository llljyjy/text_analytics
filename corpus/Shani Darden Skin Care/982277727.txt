I used the Shani Darden retinol almost every night for a little over 2 weeks. I love the feel of the product. When I wake up my skin feels so amazingly soft. Iâ€™ve noticed that my wrinkles in my forehead appear diminished and I also feel like my skin looks glowy. Full disclosure I have had a Botox touch up during this trial. softest skin ever
