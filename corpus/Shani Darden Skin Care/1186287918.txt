I received this product as part of a promotion. The first thing I noticed was it had a strange smell, although that’s something I don’t really mind bc I’m used to using more natural skincare w/o artificial fragrances. Upon application, it felt slightly sticky on my face and it never really felt like it absorbed well. But I did feel like my skin looked vibrant upon waking up the next day. After a few more uses it seemed like my skin was looking great- no new breakouts, vibrant, clear and glowing. nan
