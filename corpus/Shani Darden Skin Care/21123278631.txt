I really loved the facial sculpting wand by Shani Darden. I took it on vacation with me after using it at home because my face looked and felt firmer, more hydrated, and depuffed my cheeks. I love how I look after doing a session a few times.i always feel like u just glow after. I am so impressed by the technology it uses to deliver powerful results. Fantastic results!
