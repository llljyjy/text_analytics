I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. On the plus side, I found this formula to be fairly gentle and nonreactive with my skin. Its light cream texture is easy to spread and sinks in well. But it hasnâ€™t made much of an impact on my overall skin appearance and health. Which unfortunately makes it unjustifiable for the price. Can't justify the price
