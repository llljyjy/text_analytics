What’s not to love?!I’ve been using retinol for a while so I’m no newbie to the positive effects it can have on skin. I was using a lower strength formula for some time. So I was excited when I got this product to try out since it’s a stronger form of retinol and it has an AHA and BHA as well.The ingredients list looks like a dream with things like fruit extracts, green tea extract, niacinamide, lactobacillus ferment, and rice bran extract. It feels great, and even using it every other day like my old retinol doesn’t irritate my skin at all.Sure, the price point is on the higher side, but the stuff in this product is good, and it’s super effective. I definitely recommend trying it out if you’re looking for a multi-tasking retinol. Fantastic multi-tasking retinol!
