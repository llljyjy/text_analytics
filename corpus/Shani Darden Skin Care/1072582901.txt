5 stars for the product inside but 1 star for the packaging. The eye cream works very well and moisturizes as well as minimizes the look of dark circles. However, the packaging is AWFUL. The bottle itself is huge which as someone who travels a lot for work is a big pain. It also dispenses a completely random amount of product; sometimes it gives me the tiniest bit other times way more than I could possibly need. Until I see this product in new packaging I will not repurchase. Shani get on a packaging update ASAP! Great Product in the Worst Package
