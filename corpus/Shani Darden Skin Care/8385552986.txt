I started using this product twice a week as recommended for the first then bumped it up to every other night once my skin got used to using a retinol product. I must say it’s a really good product. It helped with the redness on my cheeks and my face looks brighter and clearer. I didn’t notice and improvement on fine lines though after the use of one full bottle. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Nice Retinol product
