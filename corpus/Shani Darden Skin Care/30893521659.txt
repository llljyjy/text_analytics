This eye cream is really nice. It soaks into the skin well, feels light, and doesnâ€™t flake off. No irritation at all, even when I put it on my upper lids. I frequently wake up with creases between my eyes because I sleep on my side, but this cream truly helps to get rid of them. Additionally, I adore that it contains peptides, which are fantastic for anti-aging. nan
