I bought mine a month ago from Shani’s website and agree with other reviewers that it’s basically a pricey face massager BUT. I discovered it’s a rebranded Novafon which is a theraputic massager you can use all over your body. I find it super relaxing and definitely improves circulation/ puffiness in the morning but initially thought, kind of a waste of money until I figured out that you can use it as a gentle alternative to say a theragun. With that in mind I’m not mad at the price- and glad Shani didn’t inflate the price just for having her name attached (it’s the same as if you bought a novafon from their website) Cleverly branded
