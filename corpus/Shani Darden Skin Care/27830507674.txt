My primary skincare concern is anti-aging especially around my eyes and frown lines. After using this Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum all over my face and neck, I see a noticeable improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin, which looks smoother, feels firmer and has fewer fine lines. This is a convenient liquid exfoliant as physical exfoliants can be too rough on my skin. nan
