I purchased this in the summer and was waiting to use it in the winter months. However the pump doesn’t dispense the product!! I had to pump it 20 times to get it to come out and then it stopped working.  I can see product inside but wont dispense.  An expesive product and even more expensive when you can’t even use it. faulty dispenser
