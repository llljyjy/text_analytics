I received  this bottle of shani Darden retinol cream free from Influenster  In return for my honest opinion. We’ve been using this product for the last 3 and a 1/2 maybe 4 weeks.  I’ve seen some change in my skin particularly with the fine lines So I’m going to assume that in the future if I keep using it it will make a bigger difference Though I will continue to use it hopefully believe it prevents me from having to use botox… lol Very nice!
