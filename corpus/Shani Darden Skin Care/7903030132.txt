This is a nice gel cleanser that is very gentle. I really enjoy the texture of the product--it feels smooth and has a gentle foaming action that doesn’t make my skin feel tight after use. I also really enjoy the scent, which I think is Neroli...or at least that’s what I’m picking up!As far as cleansing action, I prefer to use this on days that I’m wearing light makeup only since it isn’t the best at removing “the works“ or heavy sunscreen days. It also wasn’t a match for my waterproof mascara, unfortunately, but it’s been a really nice non-drying double cleanse option. Smells so Good!
