I love this eye cream. It has noticeably improved my dark circles. However, the packaging is horrible. You have to disassemble the bottle to get full use of the product. I get more product when I take it apart than when I use the pump as it comes. If you don’t know this, you could potentially lose a ton of product. It also bothers me how much packaging is unnecessary. It’s a huge waste of plastic. nan
