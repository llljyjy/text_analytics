I’m happy with this product and loving it. I have a stubborn small bumps in my forehead in 3 weeks it goes away. I used before more expensive lactic acid but didn’t help with it, Shani Darden did. It also gives me a glowing skin, I’m going to continue to use this and hoping for more change on my skin. It works!!
