I am a drugstore cleanser kinda gal through and through because unlike serums, it’s unnecessary to splurge on cleansers. After finishing the 1 oz bottle in Shani’s trio kit, I have been converted and can’t live without this! At first, I wasn’t convinced the cleansing serum was anything special. But I then found it is the perfect balance of everything I look for: an elegant formulation, gentle yet effective at removing mascara/make up, hydrating instead of stripping, leaves my skin supple, can be paired with retinol usage, and has a light lather. Absolutely worth a try! TRY IT!
