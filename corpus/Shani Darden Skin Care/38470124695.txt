The intensive eye renewal cream from Shani Darden has a lovely creamy and rich texture. I applied it around my eyes and slightly patted in on my skin. It has squalene and niacinamide which is perfect for hydration. Itâ€™s easy to apply with the no mess pump feature. I use it in the morning and night, loved the feel on my skin. Vegan and cruelty free. Rich eye cream
