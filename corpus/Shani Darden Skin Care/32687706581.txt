I’ve used retinol before but not a product with both retinol and lactic acid. I started out using this every other night and would apply a thick moisturizing mask on top for the evening.   I have slightly sensitive skin and didn’t have any issues so I am now using it nightly.  It says it is fragrance free but I do smell a slight smell to it, but it’s not bad. It has a thick consistency but it applied to my face nicely. After 3 weeks of use I have noticed my pores look smaller, especially around my nose area.  The fine lines around my eyes aren’t as noticeable.  I had a friend ask what I was doing differently because she said my face looked more radiant.  I know this is pricey but it really is worth it. The bottle is heavy and feels like good quality.  I dropped it a few times and nothing broke. I have issues with fine lines and redness and I feel this product did exactly what it says it claims it does. If those are concerns you have, I would honestly give this product a try. Does what it claims
