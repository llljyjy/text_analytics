I loved this serum, every time I used it at night my skin felt smooth but also hydrated and never irritated or stripped. The formulation is so worth it! Shani did amazing on this one and I’m obsessed with her eye cream so the whole line must be bomb! I love how this is gentle enough to use once or twice a week, and how I don’t have to layer a million hydrating products on top because it’s formulated well enough to lightly exfoliate and I do before my tret nights. Love this product
