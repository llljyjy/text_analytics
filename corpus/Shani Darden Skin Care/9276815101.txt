I enjoyed this serum. My skin is accustomed tostronger acids so I did wish it were a littlestronger. This would be amazing for someonestarting their journey with acids! I had myteenage daughter try this out and it helped withher hyperpigmentation areas and texturetremendously! She has extremely sensitive skin And this serum did not cause a bad reaction on her at all. The texture of this serum is a little strange and not as slippery as I wouldâ€™ve like to have seen. Nice serum for beginners!
