I’ve been quite pleased with this product as it’s working really well for me. Though my skin is used to retinol, I still started out using a couple drops 2-3 times a week. Then increased the amount over. It’s super gentle and I didn’t experience any irritation. It leaves my skin feeling and looking smooth. And over time I’ve seen noticeable improvement in tone, texture, and firmness. I’d definitely purchase. nan
