2 weeks with this serum & I’m a fan! Dark spots are lighter, skin is brighter & texture is basically gone! Hasn’t irritated my dry/combination skin, so I can safely say it’s gentle. The texture and finish is not sticky, doesn’t pill & dries down to a soft feel. Careful not to use more than 1-2x a week if your skin can handle it, because over exfoliated skin is the worst. Using spf during the day to protect this serums hard work & improvements. Honestly I have no bad things to say! Gentle but goes hard!
