I have tried so many lactic acids High end to luxury based and none of them have performed as amazing as this lactic acid. $88 are totally worth it for this product. As I have been aging past my 20s early 30s I have began to notice that my pores have gotten larger over time which has not been a fun experience however this has helped with reducing my poor size drastically! In a matter of two weeks I was already saying that my pores were getting smaller which was exciting because normally I have to go through a full bottle to see the results but this  was so much quicker. I have noticed that my skin has also had less fine lines and wrinkles I have less texture on my skin. Not to sound conceited but this is the best my skin has ever looked! nan
