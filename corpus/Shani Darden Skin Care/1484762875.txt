Lactic acid is one of those ingredients that my skin seems to always love and react to well.  I haven’t tried much from Shani Darden’s line so I was excited to incorporate the serum into my routine. After cleansing, I used to serum and gave it time to absorb- about 5 minutes- before using my regular nightly moisturizer. It paired well into my regular routine. nan
