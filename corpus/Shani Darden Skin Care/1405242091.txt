i tested this product in store, granted the pump wasnâ€™t working i figured there was no product left, but i somehow unscrewed it. the cream felt nice so i purchased it. i got home the cap was crooked and i keep pumping to no product coming out. so buyer beware, i should have read the reviews before purchasing. faulty pump!!! does not dispense product!
