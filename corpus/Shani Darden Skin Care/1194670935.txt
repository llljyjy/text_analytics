I received this product for free on Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it for about 2 1/2 weeks and so far I’m liking it, but not obsessively loving it. I’m used to retinol products so I jumped in and started using this product nightly rather than easing in to it. So far, I haven’t experienced any redness, peeling, dryness, or irritation so that is a positive. The lactic acid in addition to the retinol seems to have made my skin texture a bit smoother as well. Because this retinol formula is so easy to tolerate and the lactic acid is a nice addition, I would consider this a better-than-average retinol product. It absorbs quickly and didn’t cause any breakouts, which is also a positive. I’ll need to finish the bottle to see if there are any additional improvement in terms of fine lines, firmness, or other anti-aging benefits. Typically it would take about 6-8 weeks for a skincare product to prove effective, so I may update this after the bottle is finished to determine whether or not I will repurchase on my own. Above average retinol product
