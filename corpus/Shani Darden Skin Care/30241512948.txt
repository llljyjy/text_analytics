I received this product for free from @influenster and @shanidarden in exchange for my honest review. This retinol serum has been a blessing for my skin. I love how gentle it is but still delivers results. My skin is softer, smoother and brighter. It has improved the texture of my skin and makeup glides on a bit easier. My skin is firmer but the wrinkles and fine lines are still there but not as intense. Iâ€™m excited to continue using Retinol Reform to see how my skin improves over time. I definitely recommend this retinol serum if you want beautiful, glowing skin. Amazing product !!
