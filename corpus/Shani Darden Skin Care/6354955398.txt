Wow ! Exceptional! What a quality! it’s very hydrating, without any irritation cleansing serum, just one small pump and that’s enough for the whole face and neck. It’s not a foaming cleanser, so don’t expect much foaming. It has a pleasant almost non existent scent and rinses off clean with no stickiness. No stinging or burning sensations. It is suitable for sensitive skin. Might be the best cleansers for sensitive skin
