I like the product but there is a minuscule amount of product in the bottle.  I was unable to get any product out after less than a month.  I took off the cap and found a tiny plastic bag with some….but not much….unused product.  The way the  product is packaged is very deceptive and it is very hard to get the appropriate amount out of the container.  I like the eye cream but this is a rip off! Terrible packaging
