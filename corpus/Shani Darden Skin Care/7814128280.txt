I started with a mini size and have been using this constantly for a few months now and I’m really happy with the results. Overall my skin is smoother, fewer fine lines and also much clearer (fewer spots/pimples) I’ve recommended this to several of my friends. Other retinols irritated my skin so badly I couldn’t continue using them to see results. This is by far the best I’ve ever used. Best retinol product I’ve ever used!
