I received this product from Influenster to review. I have extremely sensitive skin and stated using this about a month ago 2x a week. It did not irritate my skin, but it it very drying so make sure to moisturize. I’ve only been using it a month and see some slight changes with my redness, but now that I can increase its use without irritating my skin I’m sure I’ll see more improvement! nan
