This is a great product and i would buy it again but the packaging is terrible and i only seemed to get a few pumps worth of product before having to take the whole thing apart. I got the freebie trial size twice and fell in love with how wonderful my skin looked so i bought the mini because the product is pricey. Even though it is a great product i am afraid to buy another and will not purchase the full size. Its a real bummer!! Please fix the applicator!
