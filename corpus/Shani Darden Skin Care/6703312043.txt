I received this product for free and have been using it for a couple of weeks now.  I like the tingling sensation when I first apply the product to my skin as it feels like it’s working to remove dead skin cells and brighten my face.  There is a somewhat sticky texture, but since I only use it at night, it’s really not a big deal.  So far, I’ve noticed lightening of spots on my face and overall evening of skin tone. nan
