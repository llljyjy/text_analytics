I didn’t expect to love this, but I honestly did. I usually stock to K beauty, so this was a departure for me, and I’m glad! All the retinol products I’ve used before helped, but this has been almost a magic bullet. I have horrible cystic acne and I’m starting to get those crinkles around my eyes from laughing for 40 years. After 3 weeks of nightly use, my acne scars have faded, new cysts are fewer and smaller, my skin tone is more even, and my skin feels smoother and firmer. I can really see the difference, too. Nothing will ever give me flawless skin, but this is the best my skin has been since before puberty. A little goes a long way, thankfully, but you can bet your bippy I’ll do what I need to in order to pay for another bottle when this one runs out.If you have acne and wrinkles, the most unfair of all combinations, try this. You won’t regret it. I certainly haven’t! Holy grail retinol
