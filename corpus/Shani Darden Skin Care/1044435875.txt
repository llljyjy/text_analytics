I absolutely love this region serum. I remembered this coming out when I worked at Sephora and have always wanted to try it. I have been using it nightly for the last two weeks. I always use a retinol serum at night but I have sensitive skin. This one did not give me any reaction and from the first use I can see that my skin is brighter in the morning. It has also helped with my fine lines and pores. I love it!!!!
