I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I had really high hopes for this product, but I’ve been somewhat disappointed. In fairness to the product, I’ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, when 12 weeks is recommended. It is a very mild Retinol. It was recommended 1-2 pumps 1-2 days per week to start, followed by moisturizer. I was easily able to use it 4 times per week with no irritation. However, I do not like the smell. It is a bit mildewy and the smell lingers for a while after you’ve applied it. I have also not noticed any changes in my fine lines and dark spots. As I said above, I haven’t been using it for the full 12 weeks, but I expected to see some difference in a product at this price point. I will edit this post if I see better results in a few weeks, but right now I’d only give this product 2 stars and that’s mainly because it’s very gently on the skin. Not Worth the Price
