Shani Darden Retinol Reform was gifted to me by Influenster and Shani Darden in exchange for my honest review. I have heard it countless times…wash, moisturize, retinol and sunscreen are the 4 steps to clean, youthful skin!!! And while I’ve been Retin-A’s number one fan for many years, I have always had to be so strategic about not putting it in certain areas, to taper off in the sunny, summer months, not to use it before certain events because I might be in a peeling faze…and so on!! Because there’s so much to think about every time I slather that magic potion on my face, I tend to use it less often than I should!! Insert Shani Darden’s Retinol Reform!! The first week I had it, I let my skin be my guide!!! I used it for 7 days straight before I took a lazy break (ie. I was too lazy to wash my face and put it on before bed). First thought was, is this working…because I wasn’t flaking, I wasn’t getting raw in areas around my eyes or nose and my skin felt perfectly happy!! The 2nd week is when I noticed, my face was in a very happy place!! My skin tone looked more even, my texture was smooth and I still didn’t have any skin sensitivity!!! Week 3, I realize that this could be something I can use daily because my skin had zero sensitivity to it and it left my skin looking improved from where I started 3 weeks prior.My take away is, it is a lightweight formula, with a mild scent and it’s verrrryyyyy gentle…maybe a little too gentle for the more mature issues I’m trying to address…but absolutely perfect for someone who is just starting a retinol or has sensitive skin. nan
