I have a few different skincare devices, some I think are more beneficial than others so I was excited to try this out and see how it compares. I was blown away by how this made my skin look like it was plumped and glowing! I do think this would work best if you do have only fine lines or as a preventative measure since I can’t say whether or not it can work that well on deep lines. I know that from using it my fine lines have looked less prominent and my skin overall has a lit from within kind of glow and the area between my nose and chin looks more plumped. I love that it came with the gel to help it glide over your skin and it gave such a nice gentle massage that really felt like a luxury spa treatment. Doing this each day is like a little bit of me time at the end of a busy day. I love that it’s fairly slim so it’s easy to travel with or store away. With diligent usage you can definitely see a difference. If you’re looking for some pampering for your skin this is a great tool to have! A must have beauty tool
