I received this gifted by the brand. I really like this cleansing serum. It feels so moisturizing but yet cleans my face. There is absolutely no stripping of the skin with this and I feel like it really cleansed my face. This is great for the dry winter as my combo skin can get pretty dry in some areas. I definitely recommend. nan
