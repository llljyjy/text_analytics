The facial sculpting wand is a slice of heaven at home. It gives the relaxation of being at the spa having your skin taken care of while being anywhere. I love using it as part of my morning ritual, waking up my skin before I start the day. It feels amazing on my jawline, and helps relieve tension in my face. Iâ€™m so happy to have added this into my life as a self care step that gets my days started off calm and relaxed. My skin always feels amazing after using it, and I can see less inflammation in my face. nan
