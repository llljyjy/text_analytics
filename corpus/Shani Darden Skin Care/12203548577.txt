I had this product shipped to me twice, the first time it spilled all over my package, the second time only a tiny bit of product spilled. I don’t understand why there is not a tamper seal/any sort of seal to keep the product from opening up during shipment. I probably will never order this product again, unfortunately I don’t have a real Sephora near me (Only JCP) otherwise I would get it in person. This product makes my skin feel great and super hydrated! Definitely disappointed with shipment... Be aware if you decide to buy online. Awful packaging good product
