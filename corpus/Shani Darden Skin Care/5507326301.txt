I received this product as a free sample. This is a fabulous serum in my opinion. I sometimes experience mild irritation with products like this, however with this one I did not. And you have to love that. I love that it is fragrance free, I have any other serums that smell like perfume, something else I also really enjoyed. I think another out of balance of this product/company is that it is cruelty free and vegan! A great serum!
