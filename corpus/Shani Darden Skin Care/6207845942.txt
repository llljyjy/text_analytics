I am familiar with retinol serums and have used them before, so I was extremely excited to try this product out. I used this product 3-4 times a week after cleansing and I did notice a difference in my skin texture and tone within 2 weeks. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I do not like the smell. It is essentially odorless, but I do prefer somewhat of a fragrance with my products. However this is so much more affordable than the Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping oil, and I love that it! If you havenâ€™t tried retinol before I would highly recommend incorporating this into to your skin care routine. Just remember that you should slowly incorporate this because it is a strong product and you do not want your skin to negatively react, I would recommend about 2 times a week starting off. Overall 4/5! I received this product from Influenster in partnership with Shani Darden in exchange for my honest review. nan
