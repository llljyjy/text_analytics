I’ve been using this product 2-3 times per week for about 1 month now. My skin has a lot of dark spots from acne and I’ve noticed a positive change after using this product! I also started to have very fine lines and this product helped reduce those. I’ve used retinol before, but never consistently and never with lactic acid like this product. After using this product, my skin feels smoother and more plump. The product is smooth and pleasant to put on before bed. I would recommend this product to others. Great product to treat dark spots
