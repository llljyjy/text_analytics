I received this Cleansing Serum complimentary from Shani Darden. This is my first time trying a product from Shani Darden and I’ve been really impressed. At first I was confused about the name of the product, but it’s a cleanser that is super gentle and lovely to use. I would highly recommend it to anyone else who has dry sensitive skin like me because it doesn’t irritate or dry out my skin at all. nan
