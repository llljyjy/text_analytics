First let me say THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!!! It is honestly amazing and I loved using it! Since it is 1 oz  I had to drop one star because the product only lasted a month which means I would be spending close $1200 yearly on this product alone which I donâ€™t think is worth it. Clinique has amazing facial toners that will do the same for a 3rd of the price. Not enough product for $100
