I like double cleansing every night to make sure my face is completely makeup-free before doing my skincare routine. I use this cleanser as a 2nd cleanse (during my “double cleanse” routine) as I feel it helps to make my face extra clean. It’s very gentle & doesn’t get too foamy, but I like the way it cleanses my face without making it feel overly dry. My sensitive skin loves this stuff! Very subtle yet cleanses skin well
