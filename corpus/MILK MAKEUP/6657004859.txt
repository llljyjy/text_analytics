I do really like this. It’s definitely not “cooling” though. But it does de-puff and just generally brighten. Using it after crying is a GAME CHANGER, my eyes were back to normal in minutes and I’m one of those who gets extremely red and puffy eyes. I haven’t tried any other under eye products like this so there could be a better one out there. I bought the full size and I definitely didn’t need to. I think for what this is the small size would last a long time even with everyday use. It definitely isn’t a treatment of any type so it’s not going to permanently help issues. It’s more a “pick me up” type of thing. I’d still repurchase unless I found something similar for less!! good! maybe not for price though
