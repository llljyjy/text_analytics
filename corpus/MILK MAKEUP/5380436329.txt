Those who do not like it are either not using it correctly or just don’t need it. I will admit that there is absolutely no “cooling” affect. So it probably should have been given a different name since so many people are giving it a low rating because they don’t “feel” anything. If you have dry under eyes and/or mature skin, you HAVE to try this. It literally wipes out dry cakey under eye concealer that seeps into fine lines. I use it several times throughout the day, over my makeup and it completely refreshes my under eyes and gives me a very youthful glow (I am 44) I receive a lot of compliments on my skin after using this. Compliments that I have never received before. After applying (over makeup)makeup will be a little streaky but just dab away with finger and waa-la. I purchased this and ran out, then I tried Tula’s eye balm out of curiosity… it’s a no for me. Very drying. I repurchased this cooling water. They better not ever discontinue this! Literally one of my best buys EVER!
