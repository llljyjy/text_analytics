I really like this makeup remover! The packaging makes the product super easy to use. I just used a couple of cotton rounds to take my makeup off and love how the dispenser makes the process so simple. I used one cotton round to take off my face makeup, and another for my eye makeup. That was it! I have sensitive skin and the product did not irritate my skin or my eyes. I will definitely continue using this to take off my makeup easily. Love how easy the dispenser makes this to use!
