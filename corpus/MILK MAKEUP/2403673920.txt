I wanted to love this product because I love balms to take makeup off. Unfortunately, it’s not silky enough to actually get all my makeup off- especially eye makeup. I’ve been using it as a first step for facial makeup removal but I don’t like how it feels inside my eyes nor does it remove it before stinging. Not for eye makeup removal
