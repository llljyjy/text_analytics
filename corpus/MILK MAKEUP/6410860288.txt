I was excited to try this one but unfortunately, it stings my eyes when I try to remove my eye makeup! It works for face makeup well though and I like that it doesn’t leave any oily residue or leave my skin dry. The container is also convenient to use with cotton rounds and it doesn’t have any noticeable scent. Just wish it worked for eyes too! Stings my eyes :(
