I do not have an answer concerning its effect on acne prone skin, but i see absolutely no reason it would affect it either way.  However, i am delighted to share my deep love for this product.  I use it a.m. and p.m. after Mario Badescu facial spray.  It loosens up that tight feeling you get after washing your face, helps with those under eye bags, and appears to somehow plump the skin.  Aptly named, it does cool the skin.  I use it on my neck as well. Run, Donâ€™t Walk To Purchase Cooing Water by Milk!
