I’ve tried many makeup remover balms. This one is at the end of the list as far as taking off makeup. The only plus is my face doesn’t feel dry when I’m done. It takes a lot of rubbing to get it off and also burns my eyes as others (I.e. Farmacy & IT Cosmetics) do not burn my eyes at all and the makeup comes off so easy. Probably won’t buy again. nan
