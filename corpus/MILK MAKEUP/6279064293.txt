This cleansing balm didn’t disappoint. It’s unscented and has a nice oily/balm consistency. It meted my makeup off pretty well including my water proof mascara. It doesn’t come with a scooper, which I don’t like for contamination reasons.  No sensitivity when it gets in my eyes and no skin reactions. I feel like the price is a little steep though considering this has 3.2 ounces and Clinique has 3.8 and is the same price for $36. This product is vegan, cruelty free, and clean which is nice. Overall, quality product. Quality balm, wish it had a scooper!
