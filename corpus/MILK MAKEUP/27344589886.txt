I’m a huge fan of milk makeup’s hydro grip primer and I was just as impressed with this hydro ungrip cleansing balm!! It does a fantastic job removing all my makeup (including most of my waterproof mascaras) and it’s very gentle on my eyes!! Not only does it remove my makeup and cleanse my skin, but it also leaves my skin moisturized afterwards! Removes makeup easily
