If you are looking for a product that will remove your waterproof mascara and matte lipstick, this isn’t it - go for the cleansing balm instead. But for a cleansing water, gentle makeup remover, toner type product this is great! Very mild, doesn’t irritate my skin, and makes my skin feel clean but not dry. I also love the packaging! The pump makes it super easy to dispense. nan
