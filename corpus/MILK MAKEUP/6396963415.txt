This product was a novelty 2-Star until I learned how to use it to its full potential. I use this as part of my morning routine, swiping it under my eyes and across my upper lid on the brow bone, and then layer OleHenriksen Banana eye cream over it. My concealer looks creamy and lasts all day. Also discovered this product works great on redness around the corners of my mouth due and again helps my moisturizer do it’s job and stay locked around my mouth. Feels great too when putting it on. Bonus, great on the tip of your nose if you’re sore and chapped due to a cold or allergies. A workhorse of many tasks
