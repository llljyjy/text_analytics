I love this product! I am a sucker for cleansing balms and this one by Milk is really great. The texture is very nice and it does an EXCELLENT job removing my makeup. My skin feels great afterwards -- not dry at all. I would highly recommend this balm! This product was gifted to me but all opinions are my own. Love this cleansing balm
