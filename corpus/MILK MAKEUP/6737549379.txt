The Milm makeup cleansing water works really well. I donâ€™t need to rub my eyes at all to remove my eye makeup, and it doesnt sting my eyes at all. The packaging is really nice, with a pump to pusj down with a cotton round, making it mess to when dispensing the product. Effective and doesn't sting my eyes
