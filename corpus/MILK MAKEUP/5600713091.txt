A great makeup removing product from milk makeup! Unfortunately this burns my eyes so I can’t use it to take off eye makeup but it works perfectly good on the rest of my face. It breaks down everything great and emulsified nicely. It’s a pretty standard texture for a cleansing balm. Packaging is cute and straightforward. I don’t necessarily think you need a $36 makeup remover but to each their own! Overall it’s a good product and if you like cleansing balms you’d like this. A solid cleansing balm from milk!
