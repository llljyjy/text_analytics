I don’t really use cleansing oils, my choice of first cleanse is always a balm. This milk cleansing balm is so creamy!!! It works so well and makes taking off mascara even easier! It also makes my skin feel so smooth. It doesn’t sting/irritate my eyes either. It legit gets off ALL my makeup. I think I’ve found a new fave! I also think it’s fragrance free? It doesn’t really smell like anything and hasn’t irritated my skin! I love it!
