I not only have dry skin but I also have very sensative eyelids that swell if I don’t apply products with natural ingredients. I  also get psirosis plaques around my eyes and eyelids making the area very sensative. This product helps to sooth my eye lids, above and around the eye. I use it as soon as I wake up to help give my eyes the boost of hydrating they need and also before applying makeup near my eyes. What’s nice about this product is there is no limit to how many times a day you can use it which is ideal for someone with my skintype. Psirosis/Dry skin Lifesaver
