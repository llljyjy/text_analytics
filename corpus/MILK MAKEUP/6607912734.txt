I absolutely love this product! It’s un scented, vegan, and cruelty free. It takes off my makeup very very well. Not as well as an oil based cleanser, but as well or better than any micellar water I’ve ever tried. The packaging is cute and so so easy to use. It is so hand to have a pump like this. The only thing is, this is a bit expensive compared to other micellar waters that are comparable. Fantastic!! Only concern is price
