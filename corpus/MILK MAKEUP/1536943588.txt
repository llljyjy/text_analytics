I have probably tried about 100 different types of cleansers on the market and this was one of my least favourite. I was actually surprised with all the positive reviews, because I did not experience anything that great about this cleanser.If you use too much product, it does a huge lather on your face, but then when you need to rinse your face, you’re all dry and flaky. If you use just a little bit, it doesn’t lather up or do anything on your face and it does not remove your make up at all. You just have some sort of filmy residue left behind. I am a combination skin type, acne prone and I found this face wash clogged my pores. For the price, I found it was not worth it and it certainly did not clean my skin well. I noticed every time I used it, I would suffer from a breakout, so sadly, I returned it. Up to this point, I have tried a couple milk products and I don’t like their packaging, so I won’t be trying anymore products. So sad, because I wanted to love this brand! Made me break out!
