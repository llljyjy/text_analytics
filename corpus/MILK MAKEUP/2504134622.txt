I received this product for free for review. I liked this cleansing balm but it wasn’t my favorite. I wear waterproof mascara so a big favor on whether or not I will stick to a product is if it will take the mascara off and it worked a bit but not all the way. I think if you wear regular mascara you’ll love this and I’d purchase it again if I stopped wearing waterproof mascara Not the best for waterproof mascara
