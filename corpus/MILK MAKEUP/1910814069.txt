Really pleasantly surprised by this! I’m not sure why my expectations were low, maybe because they aren’t a skincare brand. But this really melted my makeup and mascara off so easily and didn’t make my eyes foggy or anything after I washed it off, which is my biggest pet peeve. I’m happy with this and love that it’s unscented too. Melts like a dream!
