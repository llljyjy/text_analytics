If you have a normal to dry skin type I don’t think this will be enough for you. I got this because James welsh recommended but I should’ve known not to bc his skin type is oily. If you like dewy plump skin I don’t not think this will do it for you, to the touch my skin doesn’t feel horrible like cracked and dry but it doesn’t feel moisturized and silky like how I want a moisturizer to make my skin feel. When I wake up In the morning my skin feels stiff and taught to move. For some people I’m sure it’s great but I will not be repurchasing wouldn’t recommend for dryer skin
