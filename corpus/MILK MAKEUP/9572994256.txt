I’m actually surprised with this cleanser. This was an impulse buy and I wasn’t sure what to expect. It’s actually pretty light, but still creamy, and it lathers great. I’ve actually had very clear skin lately too. I get the occasional pimple, and lately I only get them if I don’t wash my face. There’s no fragrance if you’re sensitive to that and I think this would work best for dry to “normal“ skin. Pleasantly Surprised
