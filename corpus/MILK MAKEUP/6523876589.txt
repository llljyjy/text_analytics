Got this for Christmas as a present and I’ve tried to love it, but can’t. It just didn’t work for me, and I’m a big MILK makeup fan. It doesn’t have a cooling effect, and it made be breakout in my undereye and underlip area. And it takes a lot to make my skin break out. For the price, not worth it IMO. Not cooling and made my skin react.
