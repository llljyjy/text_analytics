thereâ€™s no better way to remove my makeup than with a balm. this hydro ungrip cleansing balm, however, is a game changer for me. typically, leftover spf and makeup makes me breakout, but with this gentle, yet effective clean formula, the hydro ungrip cleansing balm makes my skin fully clear of makeup with no film or oily residue left behind! my skin feels bouncy and hydrated after i cleanse with this! i love to massage it on my face like a mini facial! works lovely with my skin type!
