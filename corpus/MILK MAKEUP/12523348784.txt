I hated this product! WAY too thick and because it was so thick it was horrible to smooth out on to my face. I felt like I had to get really rough to get it to go on evenly. Then after it sat on my skin I was a giant grease ball. I stopped using this during the day and strictly did it at night before bed which I didnâ€™t mind as much but I will not repurchase this and so glad I got the mini and not the full size!
