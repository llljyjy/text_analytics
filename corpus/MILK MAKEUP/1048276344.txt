I have combo skin and am currently battling breakouts. I tried using this on my face but it felt heavy. I decided to use it on my nails and it works fantastic! It healed and repaired my cuticles and left my nails looking great. It has shea butter and grape seed oil so that must be one of the reasons. I ended up reaching for this instead of my L’Occitane Nail & Cuticle Oil and now that it’s done I’m finding it hard to go back. USE IT ON YOUR CUTICLES
