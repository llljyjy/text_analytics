I am a cleansing balm connoisseur, and I think this one ranks pretty high up there! I easily takes off mascara and eyeliner, melts my base off, and emulsifies with water very nicely and leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft. it is not stripping or harsh at all, very gentle. I would def recommend! Gentle and Effective
