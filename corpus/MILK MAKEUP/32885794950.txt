I have personally been loving this cleansing water, I use it to remove some of the toughest eye makeup that I have on and it works great, I pair it with a regular cotton pad and it’s done wonders. But I also love that you can use this product for more than just removing makeup, I use it as a precleanse as well on days that I don’t wear makeup for that extra hydration and soothing. Perfect Multipurpose Product!
