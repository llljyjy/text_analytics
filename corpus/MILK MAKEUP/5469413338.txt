I love the packaging on this! It is so easy to use & you don’t have to worry about accidentally pouring out too much product! This removed my eye makeup so well - I didn’t even have raccoon eyes after my shower like I do some other times when I don’t remove all my mascara / eyeliner. It didn’t irritate my eyes either! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Definitely worth checking out! NEW FAVE
