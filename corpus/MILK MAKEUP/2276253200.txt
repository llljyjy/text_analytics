Excited for another very hydrating cleansing balm. It contains hemp seed extract and aloe, which are very calming and soothing for sensitive skin. Cleaning balm is great to take any makeup or sunscreen off your face by the end of the day. No residues whatsoever. This texture might be a little heavy for oily skin though. And I hope there is no fragrance added. nan
