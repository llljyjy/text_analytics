I bought a mini (that’s no longer available), when I realized that my favourite milk cleanser had been discontinued. It works quite well. There’s no scent, and I’ve currently been using it to wash my fresh tattoos because it’s true, it doesn’t strip your skin at all. A little goes a very long way. I made the mistake of using roughly a dime sized portion and it covered my face, neck, shoulders and half my torso. My only criticism is that it’s a little hard to make sure I only get a pea sized amount whenever I use it, but it would last forever in a full size. For others complaining about how it removes makeup, I can’t really say anything since I rarely wear makeup these days, but I can say that it’s usually recommended you do a double cleanse anyway especially when wearing makeup??? So I’d think this would be phenomenal since so little goes so far. Works well
