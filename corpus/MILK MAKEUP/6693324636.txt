I’ve really enjoyed testing this product out over the last week. It’s very effective at removing make up andI love that there’s no overpowering scent and the fact that it’s nice and thick feels very nice on the skin. I also have absolutely no issues opening my eyes when using this and it causes no irritation. I really like this product. Good!
