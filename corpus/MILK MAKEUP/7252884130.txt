If you have dry skin, this is a must try. I’ve been using it over the past 3 months and I’m just about out of it but it really helped my dry patches (in combo with a ceramide serum) during the Spring when my skin was acting up. Once my skin was back to normal, a little goes a long way and it’s a great daily moisturizer for my dry-normal skin. I took off 1 star bc it is pricey for me to be buying consistently but it does work and I could see myself repurchasing as a treat to myself lol. Would also make a nice gift for someone who’s into skincare :) Worth trying if you have dry skin
