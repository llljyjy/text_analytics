I am a big fan of the brand so I had to try this makeup remover. I have been using it after their cleansing balm and it has done wonders. It gets rid of every little makeup left on my skin. Whatâ€™s even better is that it cleanses and hydrated the skin and no rinsing is required. I like it. I like it
