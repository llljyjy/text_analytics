I’m always searching for the perfect facial cleanser to smooth and clear my skin of blemishes and this does the best of all of the ones I’ve tried. As soon as I stop using this and try a something different, I end up getting texture, closed comedones and whiteheads. I’ve bought this on 3 separate occasions and it does a great job at keeping my skin balanced and not drying me out. I keep coming back!
