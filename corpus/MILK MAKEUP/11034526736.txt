I first purchased the product while traveling over the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Desert. Without this product my eyes would have drastically suffered. I finally purchased the larger 1.2oz and still love it. The product is instantly cool to the touch and I do not have it in a beauty fridge. When my eyes feel dry, I use the product and it instantly cools and refreshes the area. I do sometimes use it around my smile lines or cheek bones for extra hydration. This product does not reduce puffiness or dark circles and is simply for hydration. This product is more of an instant refresh and lasts for a few hours before reapplication. You will need to pair this product with something else to combat other under eye concerns. Must Have for Dry Eyes
