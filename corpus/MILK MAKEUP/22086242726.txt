This is a very good first cleanse, removes makeup swiftly and effectively. I love that there’s not residue from mascara left after I use this. The only thing I don’t like about this cleansing balm is the smell. There is something too weird about it and I can’t pinpoint exactly what it reminds me of but the closest thing I can compare this smell to is lard. Smells weird, but it’s a good cleanser
