My new favorite makeup remover. First of all, I love the component. It looks so great on my vanity. I love the mint green color! I also have always been a huge fan of the pump spout to distribute the product. Now, for the product itself it works very well. It easily removed my waterproof eye makeup. Itâ€™s gentle and hydrating as well. Definitely worth the price. You get a ton of product! Works extremely well
