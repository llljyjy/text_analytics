I LOVE this product! I typically have dry skin everywhere except my t-zone. On days I wear makeup my routine is: wash, toner, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, hydrating foundation, hydrating concealer, cream bronzer, cream contour, cream blush, and cream or powder highlight/illuminator. I’ve tried many different products and still always felt as though my face looked dull. After applying my makeup I lightly swiped this on my face over my makeup, on my collarbones, décolleté, and thighs and shins. Holy smokes! My face feels hydrated and it looks incredibly luminous and dewy! Not overly oily or heavy. I’m going back to buy several more asap because this will now be part of my regular routine. AMAZING!
