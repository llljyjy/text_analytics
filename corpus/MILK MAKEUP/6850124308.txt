I LOVE makeup removers like this because they’re eco-friendly and help reduce waste, so I was so excited to try this one out! This fully removed my makeup and didn’t leave my skin feeling dry OR greasy at all. Many makeup removers “strip“ my skin of all its oils but this one was so hydrating and gentle! nan
