Milk makeup does it again!! I love this cleansing balm. It takes off all makeup so effortlessly, even the waterproof makeup. The hydro grip line is so good from this brand, I have been a huge fan of the hydro grip primer for so long and now this one is also a big hit! Do your skin a favor and i stead of using cleansing wipes, start using cleansing balms, much gentler on the skin. This product isnâ€™t heavily scented and made with good ingredients. Great for travel too. Very nice product
