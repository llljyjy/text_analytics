I really love this! It works really well at removing my makeup. I even like it as a light cleanse if Iâ€™m not wearing makeup and just want to freshen up my face a bit. This does a pretty good job of removing my makeup and mostly gets my mascara. I do like to go over with warm water on a makeup removing cloth just to be sure. I love that this does not sting my eyes like other micellar waters. Great micellar water!
