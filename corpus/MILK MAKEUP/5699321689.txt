I was sent this Hydro Ungrip Makeup Remover + Cleansing Water from Milk Makeup in exchange for my honest review. This micellar water and makeup remover contains aloe, hyaluronic acid, hemp seed extract, blue Agave extract and micellar technology. This unique combination of ingredients keeps skin hydrated and soothed while removing makeup and dirt from the skin. It is fragrance free and the natural scent is barely noticeable. It feels incredibly gentle and refreshing on my skin and does an effective job of removing my makeup. I will definitely be repurchasing this one. Wonderful hydrating makeup remover
