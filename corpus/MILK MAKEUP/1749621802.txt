Finally got to try out the Milk the Hydro Ungrip Makeup Removing Balm in exchange for my honest thoughts on the product, here goes! I’m a person who wears make up often for work and noticed the wear and tear on my skin after years of make up removing wipes. Switching to a cleansing oil/balm has been game changing for my sensitive skin and this product does NOT disappoint!!! A little goes a long way, it isn’t heavily scented and my skin loves it!! I’ll definitely be recommending this product in the future. Just get it!!!!
