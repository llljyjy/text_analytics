I’m not usually too sure of the purpose of these sprays, but I received this one to try and actually liked it. It has a nice light rose scent and the nozzle  allows for a steady spray, making application easier. Plus it’s so pretty on my counter! I use after cleansing and before moisturizer. Pretty to display and smells amazing
