Love! Have only been using it at work when I need a little hydration or at night for the same reason. It’s summer and humid where I live, so my oily/combo skin isn’t too dry at the moment. But I love the refreshing boost this gives. Smell is lovely but not too overpowering. A coworker of mine also tried and fell in love. nan
