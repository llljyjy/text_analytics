This packaging is absolutely gorgeous! Very chic and is good material! It looks gorgeous on my vanity.I love the feeling of the mist and the scent, it is not greasy and the scent is nice but subtle. I do wish that the mist was a little more when spritzing. I feel like I have to spray 5-6 times for me to get a good dewy feeling. But overall, it is great! OMG this packaging!!!
