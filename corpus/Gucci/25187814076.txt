I use face mists on daily basis, and Brume de Beauté Glow Hydrating Mist is a great addition to my collection. I like using it to set my makeup and refresh my skin throughout the day, but only if I wear makeup. It’s formulated with Black Rose Oil which has soothing and hydrating properties. It also has hyaluronic acid which is my favorite hydrating ingredient. The oil is visible so you need to shake the mist bottle before using it. The mist has a noticeable Rose scent, but it isn’t overpowering. Additionally, the glass bottle with a golden cap is so gorgeous. It’ll look stunning on any vanity Hydrating luxury
