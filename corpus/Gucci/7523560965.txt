I received this setting spray as a gift in exchange for my honest opinion. I was really excited when I saw this beautiful and luxurious glass bottle. The spray is extremely fine and I get great coverage and fast absorbtion. It has a very light floral scent. It works great as a refresher throughout the day and I did notice my makeup held up better when I used as a primer. There was no pilling or skin irritations. It was good as a setting spray but it was not as good as the one I currently use. I’d score it at an 8. It does moisturize but I haven’t really noticed any glow yet. Perhaps I need to use it longer to see that result. Would I pay full price for it? Probably not, but I do enjoy it and will keep it on hand and definitely be using it as a refresher daily.
