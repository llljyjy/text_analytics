I was wondering how exactly to use this product but I decided on using it as a setting spray as well as a primer. Seems to work really well! It helps keep my makeup in place and my face feeling hydrated and dewy. Iâ€™m going to be adding this to my go to daily routine. Setting spray and primer for the win
