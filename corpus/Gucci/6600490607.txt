I’ve always known Gucci for their handbags and shoes, so I wasn’t sure what to expect when it came to their beauty products, specifically this facial mist. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. The packaging itself is sleek and has some nice weight to it. Upon spraying it, the first thing I noticed was how pleasant the scent was. I am extremely picky when it comes to fragrance in beauty products, but this scent is refreshing and light. The mist is fine and is easy to apply all over my face. I LOVE the hydrating formula. I have combination skin and the hydrating aspect really refreshed my skin and helped blend my makeup more. While I’ve used this before and after makeup application, I find myself preferring to use this prior as it helps my foundation go on easier and gives it a nicer glow. Overall, I love this mist and it is now a part of my daily routine. Love!
