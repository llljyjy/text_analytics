I never knew I needed a beauty mist in my life but I’m a believer now. Gucci Brume de Beauté Beauty Mist is light and refreshing. The scent is not overpowering but subtle and luxurious. The packaging is worthy of display and gorgeous. It would be a nice addition to your countertop or collection.  I did not use this mist as a makeup base but as a moisturizer after my bathing routine. This mist is so light that I almost thought I was spraying pure water on my face. This is why I had to give it 4 stars. Could I justify spending almost 80$ on water? I cannot but I would consider at a different price point. Gucci Brume de Beauté Beauty Mist
