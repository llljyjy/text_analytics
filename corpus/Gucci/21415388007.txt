I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really love how luxurious the packing feels. It’s glass and not plastic so that alone makes the experience great. As for the product, the way it sprays is very nice and smooth. After sprayed, my face doesn’t feel sticky, it feels very smooth. However, im taking off two stars because i don’t see anything different compared to other setting sprays. And it has a fragrance so people with sensitive skin may not enjoy that. I wish it was fragrance free. Luxurious but basic
