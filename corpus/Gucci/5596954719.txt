The Gucci Brume de Beaut√© Beauty Mist help prep my skin before creams and refreshes my skin when it is hot. I like the scent of the mist which reminds me of rose and perfume but not too strong. The key ingredients are black rose oil and hyaluronic acid which makes my skin look glowy and soft. I love using this spray anytime of the day and refreshed my makeup, preps my skin or give me a boost of hydration on a hot dry day. I love the look of the bottle which look luxe and elegant. I like that it does not make my skin oily or dry but healthy and fresh. Refreshing and Hydration
