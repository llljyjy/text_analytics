I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. This is by far the most luxurious facial mist that I have tried. The mist is very fine so no big drops landing on your face disrupting makeup. The scent is light but lovely. Signature Gucci scent. The bottle looks gorgeous on my countertop. I thought this product worked great as a prep step and a setting spray. I would give this a 4.5 star rating if possible simply because I think the price is high for what the product is. But if you have the money to spend, Iâ€™d absolutely purchase. nan
