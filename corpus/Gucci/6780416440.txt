I liked this right away from the elegant and feminine bottle it comes in. It’s definitely pretty to display. This facial spray comes out in a fine mist that is great for setting makeup without disturbing your base. You can really use this whenever you want to feel refreshed. The ingredients are skin friendly and soothing that leaves a hint of moisture but do not leave you looking shiny at all. It is a pricy item but if you’re willing to spend this is a great product! Lovely mist!
