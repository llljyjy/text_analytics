The bottle is very luxe and has a good weight to it! Warning, there is a floral scent for those that are sensitive to fragrances. I don’t mind it though. I mainly used this to set my makeup and it was a very nice experience. The mist is very light but even. However because the mist was so fine, I found myself spritzing my face a good amount of times (not sure how long this bottle will last if I keep using it haha). It gives a nice glow and works well on top of my Chanel foundation! It is very comparable to Urban Decay and Mac’s setting sprays! I would repurchase this for special occasions but not for daily use because I would go through it too quickly lol Would repurchase!
