Luxurious matte glass bottle with the iconic gold ribbed top. The spray is decent and the ingredients are actually pretty good. Product separate so you will need to give it a good shake before spraying it. I like to use this as a make up base but I definitely would not trust it as a setting spray since there are some oils in there. Like most of these reviews this is totally a splurge/vanity item meaning there are better sprays with better prices out there. Pretty packaging, basic spray
