I received this product in exchange for a review and I really wanted to love it because hello Gucci but honestly for the price I was expecting my skin to look more glowing or something but I didnâ€™t notice any difference and for that price I expect more. It also has a really strong floral smell and to me it smell Like and old lady no offense so overall not what I expected the only thing I loved was the packaging it was really pretty Not what I expected
