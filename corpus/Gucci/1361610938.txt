The packaging on this is so luxurious, mist comes out extremely fine which I’ve never experienced before but I absolutely love that aspect of it! I’ve used this with and without makeup and enjoy it both ways. Without makeup it gives my skin such a health beautiful glow. Misting over makeup helped smooth my makeup and also improve the time of wear I got from it. It also provided a natural healthy glow to the top of my makeup that just made it look more skin like. My favorite feature of this product is definitely how fine the mist is when dispensed. Did not irritate my skin in anyway. Would recommend giving this product a try, especially if you’re looking for a way to treat yourself! Super fine, luxurious mist
