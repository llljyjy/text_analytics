I received this product for free from Influenster and Gucci in exchange for my honest review.So many things to love about The Gucci Brume de Beauté Glow Hydrating Beauty Mist! It’s a multi-use/multi-functional glow hydrating face mist, so it can be used to prep the skin before makeup, set the final make-up look, or refresh skin in a cloud of hydration at any time during the day. First of all, the packaging - from box to bottle - is so gorgeous and luxe looking & feeling. The spray/mist function disperses the the product in such a smooth and soft way, which is perfect for any type of application of the product, and it settles into the skin very delicately. It has a light, subtle pleasant scent (not over-powering by any means).I have oily skin and this face mist hydrates me in a way that doesn’t make me more oily — just leaving a healthy glow. It gets absorbed by the skin quickly and it’s also non-sticky and non-greasy. New fav & absolutely holy grail perfect for summer
