I’m very sad to report this spray just doesn’t do what it claims. It’s a nice ‘refreshing mist’ but that’s about it. It is most definitely not a good setting spray as it didn’t help with that at all. It doesn’t give any “glowy” results. It is not a good prepping spray before make up. All in all I wouldn’t purchase this and I’m not even sure what GUCCI was thinking trying to market this as an all purpose spray. Beautiful Packaging
