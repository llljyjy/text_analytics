I really liked this hydration mist. My skin is sensitive and it did not make my skin break out. This does have a slight perfume to it, would not recommend if you do not like using products with perfume. The perfume is a light rosy smell, not overwhelming. The only complaint I have is it made my skin feel a little sticky when it set. nan
