I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review.Let me start off with this, I love how ultra fine this sprays out! To me, I prefer it like this because it feels like it is more evenly sprayed on my skin. This must has a light rose scent and it isn’t overwhelming or overpowering either. Being that it is scented, it may irritate skin (not me). This was very refreshing. I prefer to use this to set my makeup treasure than to prep for makeup. I would recommend this product.Let me start off with this, I love how ultra fine this sprays out! To me, I prefer it like this because it feels like it is more evenly sprayed on my skin.
