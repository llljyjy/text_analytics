Wow, my new favorite facial mist! It is so hydrating and gives me such a nice glow. I use it alone of either under or over makeup! The smell is amazing, so I also use it as a perfume and to spray my pillows and blankets! The packages is so gorgeous, and the bottle is heavy and well made. It looks so nice on my dresser. I definitely will be purchasing it when I run out! nan
