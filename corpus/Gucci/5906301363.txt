First the positive: the smell is a really nice, light rose scent, the bottle is pretty large,  and the mist is super fine. Not so positive: it’s way overpriced. There’s nothing I can see in the ingredients that would make this worth the price. It feels nice on the skin but doesn’t seem to actually do anything. Also the mist is so fine that it’s honestly not as refreshing as you might think Overpriced
