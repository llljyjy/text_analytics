Having long been a fan of Gucci perfume and their handbags, I haven’t stepped into the world of their beauty. Suffice to say, I was beyond eager to try this product (which I received for free in exchange for my honest thoughts) When I say my skin has been drier than the Sahara desert - I’m not exaggerating. My normal skincare routine, which consists of endless amounts of moisture, is not achieving the same results as they once were, on my pregnant skin. This has made me lessen on my makeup routine drastically to help my skin. This product is defined as a glow hydrating mist in which you can prep, set, and refresh. When I first tested this product on initial application, I decided to spritz it on my bare makeup-less face. Immediately I was greeted with a light pleasant scent, and a nice refreshing feel. My skin instantly glowed. I took note of my initial observations. Hours later, I noticed the dry bits on my skin were not noticeable - in fact, they were gone. I don’t know what’s in this godsend, but my skin couldn’t be more grateful. I love how multifaceted this product is. You can use it simply as a hydrating glow mist, prep your skin for makeup application, set your makeup, and refresh throughout the day when you feel your skin may need a little pick me up. This was a really great introduction to Gucci Beauty. My skin is back to being moisturized, and I give all the thanks in the world to this product for that! Godsend
