I enjoy the formula. Its lightweight and doesn’t have a strong alcohol or articial smell so its great for me. I think it does help lock makeup in place. I enjoy the heavy glass packaging my one concern is the actual spray nozzle which is rather small and does not provide a wide “full coverage“ blast of the product. It may not be a huge deal at first but i could see this being an issue as the bottle starts to approach emptiness and might start to splatter a bit. That is not the performance i would expect from a luxury item. All in all i would recommend this formula the company might need to reconsider the functionality of the bottle Nozzle leaves a lot to desire
