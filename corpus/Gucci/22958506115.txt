*I recieved these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review* This is the first Gucci product I’ve ever owned! I’ve been enjoying using this spray after doing my makeup and throughout the day when I need a little cooling off. I like the fact that the scent is light and powdery and there’s no sticky residue left on your skin. nan
