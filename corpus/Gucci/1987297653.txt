I don’t normally like setting sprays or any makeup that is scented, but this one is not as noticeable as others. The smell doesn’t feel artificial and is not overpowering. My makeup stayed on fine after I used it, but I don’t know if it’s worth the price. It felt nice. But that’s about it. ok product
