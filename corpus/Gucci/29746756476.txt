The Gucci Brume de Beauté Beauty Mist is a game changer to prep my skin without makeup and also refreshes my skin when it is hot. I love the scent of the mist which is a light, fresh scent of roses.  The key ingredients are black rose oil and hyaluronic acid which makes my skin glow and I noticed my skin is soft. I love using this spray anytime of the day—refreshes my makeup, preps my skin,  and give me a boost of hydration on a hot day. I also love this mist does not make my skin oily, just healthy and fresh! Perfect for Summer!
