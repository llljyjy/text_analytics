The packaging is beautiful, a sturdy frosted glass bottle. I can tell this is a high quality product just based on the way it sprays. It comes out as a super fine mist and doesn’t spray random big drops when you use it. It says it can be used to set, prep, or refresh your face and I think it works great for all of those. It feels hydrating and seems to help keep my makeup in place. It isn’t scented but it has rose water in it so naturally it has a rosy/floral scent which I love but I know some people don’t. Overall amazing! nan
