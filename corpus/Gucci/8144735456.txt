I love this spray! I was worried at first because Gucci perfumes are pretty strong, so I wasn’t sure if this one would me too strong to wear on my face. I was pleasantly surprised, this has the lightest most wonderful smelling scent! I use this spray before my makeup and again after my makeup. If I’m able to I also use it mid day. I love the finish it gives my face! I would definitely recommend this spray for any skin type! I have combo skin. This item was given to me in exchange for a review. Love!
