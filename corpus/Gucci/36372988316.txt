I recieved the product free from Influenster and Gucci/ Sephora in exchange for my honest review. This prep, set or refresh Hydrating beauty mist is  soothing and left my face looking radiant and hydrated. I have dry skin so this really helped keep moisture in there.

A tab bit tacky though but the longer it was on the more that feeling went away. Prep, Set or Refresh
