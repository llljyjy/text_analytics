The mist is very fine with a subtle hint of rose. It is a perfect midday refresh as it doesnâ€™t make your skin look oily. You can also use under your makeup as a skin prep. It will make your makeup last all day without rubbing off. I have sensitive skin and this product and not cause any irritation. 5/5 stars!This item was given to me complimentary for my honest opinion. Luxurious mist
