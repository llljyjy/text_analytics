This is such a beautiful mist! It is such a fine spray, it gently covers without leaving any wet spots on the face. It works with my skincare routine before I apply moisturizer and helps my skin stay hydrated for the whole day. My favorite use though is after I’ve applied my makeup to help blend, set, and soften it. It doesn’t alter my makeup but instead makes my skin have a lit from within plumpness. It works wonderfully to refresh makeup after a long day or to help reset after a long summer night. There is only a very faint fragrance which is fresh and light and doesn’t linger after its applied. This is my new favorite universal product that can be used so many ways in my beauty routine. The most beautiful mist I've ever tried!
