Imagine my excitement when I received this in exchange for my honest review! Once I unboxed it was clear that the Bottle was clean yet luxe with the beautiful gold cap. The smell was wonderful like a light rose almost herbal like spa scent. Nothing overpowering very refreshing. I used it as a setting spray Once I finished my make up I spritzed it across my face it did not feel sticky or tacky. I felt it honestly gave me a very nice glow. It kept my Make up in place and in tact for over  10 hours in central Florida heat! Honestly I feel itâ€™s worth every Penny and is definitely on my list to repurchase. Worth every penny!
