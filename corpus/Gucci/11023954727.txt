I was so pleasantly surprised when I found out that Gucci and Influenster were sending this to me to try out and review! It almost seems like an honor to me! This is just an absolutely gorgeous product! The packaging is very simple, but in a luxe, elegant kinda way! The actual product component is beautiful frosted glass with Gold writing on it, the gorgeous peach glow of the actual product is able to show through, it’s capped with a gold, textured cap with “Gucci“ stamped on the very top of it, it’s just a gorgeous over all presentation! The mist on this setting spray is PHENOMENAL! It comes out SO slow, light, widespread, and even, it’s honestly insane, in an “I didn’t think possible“ way! It does have a yummy rose scent to it that reminds me quite a bit of a Rosewater, so if you don’t like that scent, or if you’re sensitive to scents in general, this may not be the best setting spray for you, but I greatly enjoy it! It doesn’t make your face oily or sticky in the slightest, I am so grateful to add this to my collection! I am so excited to use this more! BEAUTIFUL!
