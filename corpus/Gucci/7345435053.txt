I have normal to dry skin, I love a hydrating mist to set my face. This has surpassed me go to daily! It truly is a mist, think walking through a mister on a hot summer day. It doesnâ€™t leave your face soaking wet and distributes so well and even. It does have a very VERY light rose smell which is lovely.It leaves my fave looking hydrated and dewy, but not like I just soaked my face. Absolutely amazing!
