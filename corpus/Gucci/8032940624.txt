This spray is so luxury, from the light mist to the subtle clean scent. I love wearing this alone on makeupless days after skincare, and if wearing with makeup it makes it last ALL day. This doesn’t compare to drugstore or lower price point setting, hydrating sprays. Even if you’re someone who likes no scent this is so light it’s not bothersome luxury
