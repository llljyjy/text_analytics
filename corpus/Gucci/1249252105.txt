I LOVE the FINE mist on thos bottle!!! I wish all finishing sprays could be this soft and fine at the same time.  I haven’t had any droplets on my face. It does have a slight scent but disappears quickly. I like using it before outting on makeup or in the morning when I first wake up. I have used it at the end of makeup and it helps with the powder, making it melt in. As for staying power, can’t really say it works any better or any less that some others. FINE MIST
