The Gucci Brume de Beaute Beauty Mist is a great staple to keep in your makeup bag this summer. The product itself is lightweight and super versatile. It can be used as a setting spray before or after makeup application, or as a hydrating mist. I love this mist because it contains black rose oil which helps keeps my skin super hydrated during these hot summer days. After application my skin is not only left moisturized but has a dewey glowing finish. The packaging is subtle yet elegant and the frosted pink glass bottle makes it the perfect display bottle for any bedroom or bathroom counter. I also love that this mist doesnâ€™t have an overpowering scent. I usually get concerned when I see products that contain rose in them because I am not a fan of the smell but this product really is not fragrant. I would definitely recommend! nan
