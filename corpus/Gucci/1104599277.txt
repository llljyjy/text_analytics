I really loved this product, everything about it feels luxurious. The glass bottle, the super fine mist, it’s like walking through a cloud. It lasted a good 16 hours in wear time. The only thing that threw me off was the scent. It’s not super strong but it’s floral and it’s right there under your nose.  9/10 would recommend as long as your not put off by the perfumey scent. nan
