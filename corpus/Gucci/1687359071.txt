I love how versatile this mist is. I use it as a primer, setting spray, and mid-day refresher - I am pretty much spraying myself all day long!  No matter how you choose to use this mist you will be left with a natural, youthful, dewy glow (nice change of pace from all the uber-shimmery primers and highlighters out there). The bottle is absolutely gorgeous. The softest pinky/peach bottle and gold top is glamorous, feminine and can easily double as piece of home decor.  The mist sprays so finely. I read in reviews that bothered some, but that was the first thing I noticed about this product, and one of my favorite features!  I love the light, slightly earthy, floral scent of this mist. It’s not at all artificial or headache-inducing, and is reminiscent of your favorite luxury hotel and spa.  The only reason I didn’t give Gucci Brume de Beauté Beauty Mist 5 stars is because   for the price, this is not a product that you need. Will I purchase again? Absolutely, but it’s a not a necessity - more like a luxurious treat I (you too!) deserve. Luxurious treat
