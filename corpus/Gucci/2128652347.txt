I was lucky enough to be gifted by Influenster & Gucci to try this wonderful product. Gucci’s Brune de Beauté mist is a luxurious spray of heaven. It contains black rose oil which has soothing & antioxidant properties & hyaluronic acid which we know is a superhero for hydration. It provides our skin with that beautiful youthful glow. Combined with the black rose oil, the results are amazing. The packaging is absolutely luxe. It is as exquisite as it’s formulation. A heavy glass bottle with a lavish gold cap it screams extravagance. 10 out of 10 for packaging. The mist is beautiful & remarkablely hydrating which creates a glamorous glow. It is a light mist in my opinion but covers very well. The fragrance is of a distant rose floral scent that reminds me of spring time. Far from offensive to the nostrils or any cause for irritation concerns. Though of course you may want to do a skin test. Brune de Beauté is a formulation from the skin Gods. My only flaw with this would be the price. Other than that, this is a HOLY GRAIL in the hydrating mist world. A definite must try! A Mist From The God's!
