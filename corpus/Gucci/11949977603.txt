I have extremely oily skin, so I usually tend to avoid products such as this, however I was surprised that it was able to prolong my makeup application longer than many setting powders. It gives you a dewy finish which I also kind of think helped when my face started getting oily because this spray made my face somewhat already shiny, but in a healthy way and not in a greasy way. It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky on your skin whatsoever. I also have acne prone skin, and this did not cause me to have any breakouts. I’d say it’s definitely a great choice for sensitive skin. It’s very lightly scented and reminds me of fresh roses, but it fades pretty much immediately after spraying it so if you’re sensitive to scented products, I wouldn’t let that scare you away from this product since it’s undetectable after application. The sprayer is also fantastic, because it allows you to either lightly mist your face with tiny pumps, or have a more controlled spray using longer full pumps. It doesn’t just shoot out either a half or full blast of product like others do. The packaging is really beautiful as well, and looks really classy. A frosted rose colored glass bottle, with a metal gold cap. It’s also about the height of an iPhone 13 Pro Max, so probably wouldn’t fit in a small purse too well, but otherwise not too big where it would be annoying. All in all, if you’re looking for a good makeup spray and are wondering if it’s worth the price point, I can honestly say that I would recommend this and will consider purchasing this in the future.
