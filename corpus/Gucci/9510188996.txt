I received this in exchange for my honest review and honestly I love it. It’s refreshing and moisturizing with a hint of rose scent. No worries, the scent isn’t strong or super long lasting but it’s a light and lovely scent. I am so glad I got this. It screams luxury just from the bottle alone. Luxurious
