I use this after applying makeup to help set it and make my skin look hydrated and natural. It does a fabulous job at that without making me look oily or greasy. The rose scent isnâ€™t too extreme but is present enough that I would avoid if you know your are sensitive to fragrances. The packaging is luxurious and creates a pleasant, super fine mist. Would definitely recommend! nan
