This is one of the finest mists that I’ve tried. It leaves your skin moisturized but not tacky. The mister is amazing and doesn’t leave droplets on your face. It refreshes my makeup and leaves a subtle glow. I use it as a finishing spray after powder and midday to touch up. The bottle is really luxurious and glass. There is a subtle scent but it is very light and nice; doesn’t linger. I would recommend to a friend. luxurious finishing spray
