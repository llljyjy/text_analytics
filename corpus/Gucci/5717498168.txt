I’m absolutely obsessed with this. It’s so hydrating for the skin and it makes you look like you have highlighter on even when you don’t. It’s like perfume for your skin to be honest. I also like to spray it in my hair because it gives AMAZING texture. The scent is so light and sweet. I would buy literally anything that was this scent. I am truly, truly obsessed. Obsessed.
