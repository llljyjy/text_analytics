I LOVE THIS! I use it as both a setting spray and as a way to refresh my dry face during the day. It’s a fine mist, which is perfect because it evenly covers my face. It has a light, almost floral scent that makes it feel so refreshing. This has now replaced the setting spray that I’ve been buying for years! nan
