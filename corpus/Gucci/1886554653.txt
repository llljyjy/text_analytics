This product is very luxurious in its frosted glass bottle. The spray is a pleasant rose scent. It was impressive how the mist is was so incredibly fine. There is not much visible difference in the skin before and after application but it is refreshing to apply. I use it to rehydrate my skin in between my makeup steps. A good product overall but perhaps not worth the hefty price tag. Refreshing
