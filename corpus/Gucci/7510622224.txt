I will start by saying I am more than willing to invest in luxury products as long as they are worth the price. I was hoping this could be used for both skincare and setting makeup, because I typically need more for both routines. It does offer hydration, but not enough to skip moisturizer. The mist is really fine and applies nicely over makeup to refresh and set it, but I’ve noticed it doesn’t always mix with lots of powder products. The floral scent isn’t too strong, but you definitely have to be okay with rosewater-type products to enjoy this. It looks adorable on my vanity though, but I definitely wouldn’t purchase on my own. beautiful bottle, meh product
