Lovely mist action and I love that there is black rose oil in this product because I really just like anything with rose! The scent is a little stronger than I’d like for a Beaty mist but that’s if your skin will be exposed to the sun or if your skin is just sort of sensitive like mine. I noticed some slight irritation so I spaced out my usage of this product and that seems to do better for my skin. I’d recommend only using this product lightly and as a finishing spray if you want to look dewy. Lovely light mist action
