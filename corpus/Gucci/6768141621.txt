I love the smell and texture of this spray. It’s not too heavy for oily skin but is also moisturizing. I typically use it before I apply my foundation and it helps keep the creases out all day! The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because I think it’s a bit much as a refreshing spray, and think it works better as a primer. Nice facial spray
