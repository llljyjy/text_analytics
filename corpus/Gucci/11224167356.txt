I have used this product for about a week now and I really do like it. It is a nice setting spray that doesn’t leave your face feeling oily or too dry. My face definitely feels more hydrated and looks healthier. There is a very light scent that is nice but doesn’t last long. Will be purchasing more when I run out! I received this product complementary for testing purposes. Great product!!
