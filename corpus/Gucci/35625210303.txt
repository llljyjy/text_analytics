I absolutely LOVE this spray.  I’ve never purchased, used, or tried anything like it before.  It has a nice, fresh scent but is very faint.  I’ve noticed it helps my makeup stay on as well (as it does say prep, set, refresh).  I don’t wear much makeup, so being able to keep the little bit I wear stay in place is very nice.  I would definitely say thumbs up, five stars.  I received this item for free from Influenster for my honest review, but I will most likely go buy a bottle once this one is finished! nan
