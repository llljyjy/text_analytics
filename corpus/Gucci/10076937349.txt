For me this is great as a hydrating mist rather than a finishing mist for make up. It is very hydrating and I love the mist, it makes application relaxing. If I use this as a finishing mist I find that it makes my make up look too glowy/ wet. Sometimes it exaggerates my skin texture as well with make up. If your skin is dry this would be great for you. I love using this on my bare skin and it is a very convenient product to keep with you through out your day and while traveling. Great hydration
