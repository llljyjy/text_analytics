It’s super hydrating! I actually tried using it as my “moisturizer“ one day to see if I would feel dehydrated and I didn’t! It leaves a pretty glow on the face and the mister is excellent. Smells softly floral and doesn’t give me a headache. Only gripe is that this is hardly a setting spray. It is more a refreshing mist. It doesn’t melt my makeup off, but my makeup lasts much longer when I use my normal setting spray (Charlotte tilbury). Hydrating but not setting
