The packaging was really pretty, and the spray nozzle released a really fine mist which made this feel really luxurious where some face sprays feel like you’re being spit on lol. Other than that I didn’t think this product really did much of anything to be worth the price tag it’s sold at,   I was happy to get it for free but I wouldn’t spend my money on it otherwise. Probably not worth the buy
