I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest review. I was not sure about the smell- it still is definitely not my favorite but it does fade very quickly!  I have used this as a refresher as well as a setting spray. As a refresher- i canâ€™t say i have noticed it does much. But as a setting spray it is a wonder spray!!!!!! It dries so velvetly and smooth!!!!! I absolutely love it as a setting spray! I hope when i run out that i will be able to purchase it! I really do love it! Perfect setting spray!!!!!!
