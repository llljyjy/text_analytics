This stuff is amazing! First — I love the smell. No matter how great a product is, if I can’t stand the smell (especially for a face product) I’m not using it. Second — it is SO refreshing. It keeps my makeup in tact but even gives a great refresher when I’m feeling like I need a pick me up. Lastly, the spray on this is so fine that it allows for even distribution and no droplets. Love it!! nan
