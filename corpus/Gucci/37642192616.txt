I really liked this facial mist. It had a light, floral scent, and it sprayed a super fine, soft mist. I absolutely loved how gentle the mist was and how hydrated it made my face feel. I would use this throughout the day to add some moisture to my dry skin. The scent doesn’t remain on your face, so if it’s not your favorite, you’ll barely notice it. Overall, great product! Great Mist!
