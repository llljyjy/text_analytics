Gucci Glow Hydrating Spray is pure luxury at its finest. The spray is housed in a gorgeous, heavy, peach-colored glass bottle with a gold cap, and trim, fit for displaying on any vanity. This mist isn’t all superficial; it’s effective too! With ingredients like hyaluronic acid and black rose oil, this spray provided me with soothing and hydrating properties that helped my makeup last as well as refresh my skin throughout the day. While I don’t normally like rose-scented mists, I loved the light floral rose smell that never overwhelmed my senses. The atomizer on this bottle might be the finest mist I’ve ever had the pleasure of using, which made it my go-to for rehydrating my skin and makeup during these hot summer months. If money is no object, then look no further, for Gucci has truly elevated the experience of the hydrating mist. nan
