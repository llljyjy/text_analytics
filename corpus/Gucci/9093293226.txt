Absolutely love this product. The smell of it is light but smells amazing. Also I love how it doesn’t spray too fast or too much. I am able to spray the exact amount I want. It hydrates my face so well and doesn’t leave it sticky. It’s also amazing as a setting spray. It helps my makeup to really set well. Love it!
