Okay, so I’m a Phelityl (brown) soap addict, but I wanted to give the others a try. It’s been a while since I used the sea mud bar. This is a great set if you want to figure out which of the soaps work for you. The bars are part of a bi-phasic cleansing process, and they can all be used with any of the base oils though I used the Phelityl oil. Finding the right combo for this cleansing system is like a passport to dream skin, so I highly working to find your ideal. The products are excellent quality. You need your own covered soap dish. The 3 soaps have lasted me 6 months. Cute structured understated bag as well. nan
