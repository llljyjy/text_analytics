I had high hopes since I have dark circles and people will ask about them at times. I bought this BEAUTYBIO eyelighter from another beauty supply store and it’s nothing special. Not smoothing at all and doesn’t help my dark circles either. No difference with the way my concealer applies so it’s a no go for me. I prefer the Becca/Smashbox under eye corrector. That works better than the other hundred under eye products I’ve tried in the past. So much money wasted! NOT WORTH IT
