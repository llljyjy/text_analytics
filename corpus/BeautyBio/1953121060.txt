The only thing these eye masks stick to is the packaging in which they come. I have ripped at least 3 masks trying to get them out of the package. Once you get these masks out of the packaging and apply them, they will fall off your face unless you choose to lay down completely.  Additionally, though there is a ton of liquid in the packet, these masks don’t actually seem to hold onto the serum, making it pointless to apply them in the first place. I have not noticed any visible changes to my undereyes (in either appearance or texture) after using this product. It’s a waste of money, in my opinion. nan
