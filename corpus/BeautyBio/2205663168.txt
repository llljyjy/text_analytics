I allowed a salesperson to talk me into buying this set at my local Sephora. I was hesitant because the tool felt sharp on my skin during the demonstration in store. It was not comfortable on my arm. I didn’t think that it would be smart to put something so sharp on my scalp at the roots of my hair. She told me that it is completely safe, and she said that it’s great for stimulating and exfoliating the scalp. I purchased this set, but I returned it. The package states, “Do not roll the GloPRO® attachment through loose hair.” They have the same warning online. I decided against using something on my scalp that is not supposed to touch my hair. My whole head is full of “loose hair.” I don’t have any thinning or bald spots, so I would find it pretty difficult to part my hair and roll this only on my scalp as she instructed. I regret that I allowed myself to be duped into buying such a gimmicky product that I did not want and really do not need. I’ll stick to using my electronic scalp massager with soft silicone “fingers.” Not for me - returned it
