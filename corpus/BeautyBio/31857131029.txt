The Eyelighter Concentrate is wonderful!  The product is so smooth and easy to apply.  I LOVE the fact that the applicator and the dispenser are one in the same.  No hunting for an additional tool to apply the product, or losing it and having to find a substitute.As for the benefits, it brightens my undereye area AND works as a primer.  Iâ€™m always on the hunt for an undereye product that helps with puffiness.  This is my favorite one so far! It's a Keeper!
