I’ve been using this product for 4 or more years and it’s a must for anyone over 40 as it will definitely keep your skin from aging quickly and it helps to diminish fine lines and wrinkles with consistent use.  I have a spare one in case something goes wrong with the one I have.  You can’t go wrong with this product.  It isn’t painful, however, when you put a product on your face right after using, it may sting but it dissipates quickly.  Don’t let the negative posts scare you is all I have to say about the Beauty Bio GloPro Facial tool. A must for those who want to slow down aging skin!
