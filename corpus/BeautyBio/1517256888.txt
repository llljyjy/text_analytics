I’m surprised this product has such mixed reviews bc it worked really well for me. I mainly bought it while on a trip to a wedding. While on the trip, all the traveling and not being able to sleep made my skin really dry and dull. You could see the wrinkles on my forehead a lot more and I really needed a moisturizer with instant impact. The employee recommended this to me and I bought it out of desperation along with the eye cream and I looked really refreshed! I looked great for the wedding. Recommend if you don’t have sensitive skin and need a moisturizer that gives instant results. Instant Hydration
