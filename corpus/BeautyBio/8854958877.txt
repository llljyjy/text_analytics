I noticed there wasn’t too many reviews that aren’t incentivized, so I thought I would post mine.This is a really vulnerable and difficult thing for meTo post mostly because my acne has always been a core insecurity of mine. I’m absolutely blown away by this! I did my research before purchasing, because I wasn’t about to splurge (even at the sale price of 180$) until I knew for sure this was for me. I have deep acne scars from cystic acne that I’ve had since I was a teen. I have an autoimmune disease inside my body makes acne a big challenge overall. I’m always looking for new ways to help with my scars, and believe me I’ve tried everything until I found this tool. These photos are with just one use, and I sharpened the photo to make sure it enhanced the look of my texture so you can get a true idea of what it can do on deep scars.I cannot wait to see how amazing my skin is going to look in months from now. If you consider picking this tool up wait until it goes on sale, or you get it for sale through the Sephora annual sales. Long time acne scars be gone!
