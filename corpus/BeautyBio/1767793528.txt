I was excited to try this after reading so many good reviews! Especially the review by the esthetician who mentioned the exfoliant is non-irritating. I found that it was actually quite the opposite. The crystals felt harsh, almost salt-like. It left my skin looking red an irritated for a few minutes after use. I liked the gel moisturizer, although it didnâ€™t give me the glossy look I was expecting it to. Although I did not break out from using this product, I ended up returning it because I could get the same result (at least the exfoliator part) from a drugstore item. Like the gel but not the scrub
