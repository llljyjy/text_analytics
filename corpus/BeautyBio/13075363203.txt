I just started using these eye masks, and I noticed a difference the first time I used them.  It looks like someone photoshopped my eyes- that’s how amazingly these worked for me.  I’m a contact tracer, and needless to say I’ve been busy lately.  Today was the first day off I’ve had in several weeks.  I’d actually purchased these weeks ago, but haven’t found the time to use them- probably during a time when I needed them the most. My eyes have been very puffy, dry, and all-around dull.  The skin around my eyes looked thin and frail.  But these eye masks really brought my eyes back to life- I’m truly astounded.  I should note, I’m relatively new to using eye masks- I’ve  previously only tried 2 other brands.  I (personally) found these to be far superior to the other ones I’ve tried- and they didn’t irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  After using them once, there were no more lines, and the puffiness was gone.  I kept looking in the mirror because I couldn’t believe the results were real.  I’m so happy with the outcome, and wholeheartedly recommend this product for others with the same skincare concerns. Like Photoshopping Your Eyes
