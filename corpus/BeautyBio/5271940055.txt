Honestly I used it for a month now, I don’t hate the smell, it smells like it s not using any artificial ingredients to try to make it smell better, it smells natural, which I do like. BUT the only down side for this brand, not just for this item, this brand seems to not like to make their product looks more high class.. the bottle looks cheap, and sometimes you might squeeze it too much because the bottle itself are so soft and hard to control how much it come out. When I first used it I accidentally squeeze so much out … very big waste and it happened few times. Otherwise, it was good, I use it after my face treatment, dose not damage my skin at all. cheap bottle but it works
