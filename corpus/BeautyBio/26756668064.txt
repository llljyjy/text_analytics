There is a long list of Beauty Bio products I enjoy using. There is a list of Beauty Bio products that I am not sure I could live without. This may very well be the next item on that list! When I first got it, I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect. I hadn’t read a lot of information and was mostly just excited to try something new. In the beginning I was only using it once a day, in the morning, after washing my face and before putting on my make up. I was blown away at the results! The difference it made in my under eye area, especially by the end of the day, was incredible. Where normally my make up would somewhat settle into the fine lines (aka wrinkles and creases) in the under eye area, by the end of the day…it stopped that completely. Instead of my eye area looking “tired“ by the end of the day, my make up looked just as good, if not better, by the end of the day! I am beyond impressed!I decided to see it what difference it would make if I started using it twice a day. I realized quickly that not only did I still have the benefit of the impact on my eye make up… But my under eye area simply looked brighter and fresher. My circles under my eyes were are far less pronounced. I love this stuff! I am hooked! Love It!!
