I don’t write reviews but after receiving these I am so annoyed that I feel necessary to share my experience. First of all, I had to open THREE packages before finally getting to a pair that didn’t have one patch torn AND also fallen off the plastic holder, scrunched to the bottom of its’ foiled baggie. There is hardly any liquid to them and they slip and slide off the under eye. I have used many eye masks and these were a big disappointment. I wish I took pics to post but my frustration was quicker than my brain and they were tossed in the trash before I even thought to do so. Major disappointment
