Was browsing Sephora looking for a moisturizer to help with my redness. On the influence of a particularly persuasive Sephora employee I bought the Zenbubble. I have really sensitive skin. After my nighttime skincare routine, I finished everything off with this moisturizer. Let me tell you: I watched as the redness on my skin faded over 30 seconds. Like literally visibly saw my skin even out and the redness calm down. It felt so calming and soothing and was the perfect finisher for night time. I find that using this in the morning it makes me too oily during the day. It looks good under makeup, no issues there, just turns me into a grease ball :( But it happens a lot living in Florida. Try this out if you have sensitive skin!! I love the airless dispenser too. Only con is maybe how much product for the price but at the same time you get what you pay for and this moisturizer is def worth! Calming, soothing moisturizer
