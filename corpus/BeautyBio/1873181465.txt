This is definitely one of the first eye products that is marketed as a brightener that actually works! I found after just one use, my dark circles were much less noticeable. The depuffing tool also provides a nice cooling effect, which is that touch of self care we all need in our lives. I would apply with the tool and then blot to set in with my fingers and found that was the best approach for me. For me, it’s winter and the skin around my eyes is more dry than usual, so I actually added on with an additional moisturizer for extra hydration. I don’t think that’ll be necessary in other seasons. The product itself sometimes would get stuck on the top of the depuffing tool, but I may have been using too much. Otherwise, it felt great, helped my concealer stay put, and made me look more alive first thing in the morning. I highly recommend if brightening is a solution you’re needing! Actually minimizes dark circles!
