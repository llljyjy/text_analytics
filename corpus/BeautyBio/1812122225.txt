Disappointed for the price. I agree with others that the packaging is difficult to handle while you’re working with the product, although it is beautiful and heavy. Calling the exfoliating side Glass is a perfect description, this was just way too harsh on my skin. The gloss was a nice consistency but didn’t do much for my skin. I returned it. It’s a No from me
