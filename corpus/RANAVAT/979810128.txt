This is a really cool, unique tool. I honestly feel the detox and actually see it on the wand, so I know it’s working! I’ve had it for two years and I keep the end clean by wiping with soft cloth and it’s still in great condition. This definitely does more to “de puff” than a jade roller or any tools like that. I recommend going to her website for tips on how to use. nan
