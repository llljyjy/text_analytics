This cream cleanser surprised me and I had been wanting to try it for a while. I found it deeply hydrating and smooth and it didn’t have any artificial feeling on my skin. It left my skin so smooth and soft, and I TRULY love it. It’s going to be my next full size purchase for sure! Smooth & Soft Skin
