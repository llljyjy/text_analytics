I have dry skin, so have tried several creamy cleansers, but never found one I liked.  After receiving this sample, I tried and loved Cream Cleanser.  It feels very rich while cleansing, and leaves your skin clean and balanced...not tight and no residue...great prep for your skincare regimen.  I will be buying the full size:) Luminous Ceremony Indeed...
