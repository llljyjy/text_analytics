I got this as a premium sample, and was really excited to try it. I applied it for the first time last night. Within half an hour of going to bed I had to get up, wash my face, and put on another moisturizer to get the smell off of me! I like roses — REAL roses —but this had the smell of chemically-produced rose-scented products for old ladies in the 1950s. It was horrendous. I have no idea why, in 2022, any company is making something smelling THAT heavily of fake roses. I don’t care if this stuff would make me look 20 years younger; I literally could not stand to have it on me. Be warned, if you have a sensitivity to strong floral smells, this is not the product for you! Do not buy unless you like a STRONG smell of roses
