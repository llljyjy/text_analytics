This is a good cleanser for a *second* cleanse. It is NOT effective at removing makeup. But it has a lovely scent and velvety feel. It does leave my skin feeling wonderful after use, very spa-like. A nice add-on if youâ€™d like a splurge, but nothing extraordinary (like some of the other Ranavat products). Spa-like Cleanser
