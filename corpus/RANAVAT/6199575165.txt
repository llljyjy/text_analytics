I’ve been using this serum for a few months now and I’m a big fan! I’ll switch it up but typically I will use it both day and night followed by an SPF/moisturizer or night cream, respectively. I have normal/dry skin and it’s been holding up great this winter. It feels so luxurious and with the Kansa Wand I give myself a mini face massage that’s very relaxing (and in the AM depuffing). I also like to use this as a primer before makeup because it helps keep my skin hydrated and the makeup just glides on my skin (less tugging/friction). The bottle I purchased lasted me a while (and still going) so it really does go a long way and a worthwhile investment (for your skin). Great for additional moisture and glow
