I used this cleanser on a full face of make up and it all came off seamlessly.  No residue or anything and left my skin feeling really soft.  Unfortunately, after a while, due to sensitive skin - I did notice my skin was a tiny bit drier than normal.  I would still use it and follow up with a heavier moisturizer or serum. Great cleanser!
