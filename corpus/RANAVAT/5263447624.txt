At first, I didn’t know how to use this serum. I have oily skin, so the first few times I had use it directly after moisturizing, which didn’t feel great. But then I started using the Royal Refresh (jasmine mist), then the serum and it glided on my skin, and I’d massage with the Kansa Wand. The serum makes my skin look more oily initially but it does sink in eventually. I have uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation. I don’t think my skin has evened out yet but I would definitely keep using this serum as I have not lost hope yet. Nice serum
