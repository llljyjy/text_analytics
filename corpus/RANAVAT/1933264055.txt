I’ve been wanting this for a very long time but was turned off by the price. Every time Sephora had member sales this was conveniently out of stock. I just purchased from Ranavat directly when they had their 20% off sale, and I’m disappointed. I wanted to smell saffron and instead I’m smelling rose. Duh, rose essence listed as last ingredient. My bad. But with Saffron in the name I feel like that is what should be the dominant smell, and it’s not. Back to Sisley I go. Sisley has a divine velvet saffron mask that actually smells like saffron, and is worth the price. Don’t waste your money on this one, there’s better face oils out there. Eminence has a nice one. Smells more like rose than saffron
