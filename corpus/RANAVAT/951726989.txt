This is a great cream. Love the way it feels going on and how my skin looks. BUT the smell!!!! It’s not pleasant at first I thought the product had gone rancid. It’s very strong and doesn’t fade. It makes my eyes water and I do t even have the cream near my eyes. Thankfully I have a sample and did. It spend my money on it. Stinks!
