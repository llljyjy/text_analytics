Beautiful, luxurious packaging, right off the bat. The product has the consistency of jelly, and it smells like tea with honey. The scent is very organicâ€¦ not a synthetic sort of smell at all. Once applied, the mask feels very light and gentle. I love wearing it in the summer heat while I sit in front of the air conditioner for an extra cooling affect. This is a luxurious product that is definitely worth the money. I would recommend it to people who are adverse to smells and have sensitive skin, because this is a very gentle and weightless mask. nan
