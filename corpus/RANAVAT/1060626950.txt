This is a creamy face wash. While it may suit others, I did not find it suited me. Although I only had enough for two uses, it was a little too creamy for my combination skin. I felt like I had a layer of cream left behind, which when layered with my usual vitamin c, serum, moisturizer, and sunblock, it was too heavy. This would likely be better for people with drier skin.
