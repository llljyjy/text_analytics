I’m sure this product is amazing and lots of people would like the smell but for me, I couldn’t get past the very strong rosy smell. Because of the name, I expected a more spicy smell but it was full on rose and wouldn’t disappear over time. The texture is nice so you might love it if you like the strong rose smell. Good but strong smell
