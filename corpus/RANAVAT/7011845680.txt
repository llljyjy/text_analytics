One thing I hate about washing my face in winter is how quick my face gets dry after cleansing but this cleanser leaves my face feeling moisturized. Also the smell of this cleanser is super floral and fragrant. The texture of this cleanser is super milky and probably the creamiest cleanser Iâ€™ve ever used. Creamiest cleanser ever with a decadent scent!!
