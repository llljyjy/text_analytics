love this product! the bottle sprays the mist perfectly and it feels very refreshing and hydrating. I sometimes even apply at the end of my routine after a heavy moisturizer so just feel light. I generally don’t like very strong floral scents, that give me a headache but this is just perfect. as someone with sensitive acne prone combination skin, this doesn’t break me out. I will always repurchase. nan
