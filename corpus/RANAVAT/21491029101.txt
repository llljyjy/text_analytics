This serum has been my holy grail for years and I’m so glad it’s finally at Sephora! I have really dry skin so I love how moisturizing this serum is without being too greasy and heavy. I’ve had a lot of maskne scarring thanks to the pandemic, but I’ve noticed that consistently using this serum has really helped fade the scarring, and has overall just helped my skin brighter and more supple. I also like that this serum is brightening without making my skin more sensitive to UV rays, which is usually the case with brightening products. Holy Grail for me!
