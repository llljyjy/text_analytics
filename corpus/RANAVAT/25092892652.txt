Super creamy cleanser! I usually prefer foamy cleansers, but this one felt so good I didn’t mind the non foaminess. The scent of this is my favorite! I got sent a sample, and I received a few samples of this before because I’ve made purchases on their website, but I loved using the samples before bed because the rose scent helped me fall asleep :) I’m trying to go through a few more cleansers before I open up my full size of this so I’m glad I have been able to sample before opening my full size hehe. It helps me feel cleaned without having stripped skin. Easy to rinse off! nan
