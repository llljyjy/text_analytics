After the first use, I could notice that my skin was more radiant, plus it does not irritate the skin if it is sensitive, it is quite pleasant and I loved the texture, I could notice that my pores were unblocked and that the skin imperfections significantly decreased after three uses.  I really would like you to continue using it to see the long-term results but now I think it is totally recommended. Gifted by hyper skin nan
