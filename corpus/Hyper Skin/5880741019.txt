*GIFTED*I was throughly surprised by this cleanser. I have extremely sensitive skin so I’m always cautious when trying anything that claims to be brightening and have acids. This is one of the most gentle cleansers I have ever come across. I haven’t broken out once and I’ve notice a huge improvement in the overall clarity and brightness of my skin. There is a very faint sort of orangey scent that disappears as soon as it hits my skin. Highly recommend this cleanser. nan
