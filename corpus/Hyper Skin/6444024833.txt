So I got this product was gifted by Hyper! Skin.  I was already a fan of Hyper! Skin after using their hyper pigmentation vitamin C serum so I was excited to try out the mask and I have to say it truly has made a difference in my skin I use both the vitamin C serum and the mask and I have a noticeable difference in my dark spots and hyperpigmentation I highly recommend for anyone trying to balance out their skin tone that they try out this product. Love me some Hyper Skin
