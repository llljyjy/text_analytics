Love this peeling mask. It’s yellowish and I was very reluctant to try it at first. After testing it out on my hand I decided to give it a try. Because no tingling at all when I put it on my hand. My skin is very soft and very clean after I wash it off. I love this gentle formula and the great result. One thing I don’t like is the packaging is a little bit cheap. I was gifted by Hyper Skin for reviewing purposes. nan
