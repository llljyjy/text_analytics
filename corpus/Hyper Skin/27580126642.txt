Hyper Skin gifted me Hyper Even Fade and Glow AHA Mask.I  love what this brand is doing.As a person of color I suffer with hyperpigmentation and it is awful for my mental. This mask is compromised of AHA-duo-glycolic acid and mandelic acid.They acids come together and clean congested pores and brighten dull skin.Meanwhile, niacinamide and Bearberry works to lessen the appearance of stubborn dark spots. Lastly, salicylic acid and sea buckthorn halts the dreaded breakouts. This is a product that works for all skin tones and types. nan
