I’ve been searching for an exfoliating acid product that works with sensitive skin for awhile now and with the Hyper Skin Fade and Glow AHA Mask, I think this product is it.The first time I used this, I felt a tiny bit of tingling but after that first use, I haven’t felt any type of irritation. This is usually a problem for me with AHA based products, but I love how I’m not seeing it with this mask. Immediately after use, I noticed blemishes come more to the surface, even blemishes I didn’t necessarily see before using this. AHA, or Alpha Hydroxy Acid, is a chemical exfoliant that in this product unblocks pores, improves skin texture and brightens your complexion. I will be interested in seeing overall long term results after using this mask for a few more weeks. On top of the exfoliating acids, this product contains many healing ingredients like Vitamin E and Niacinamide. Both of these help promote skin cell regrowth and keeping the skin barrier hydrated. These are two of my all time favorite ingredients!I’m not picking up any scent, and the color of the mask is very fun. I was kind of nervous the yellow would stain but wasn’t an issue at all! A Sensitive Skin AHA Mask We Needed!
