The texture of this is… interesting. It’s a very cohesive gel glob, which does make squeezing out the appropriate amount a bit of a crap shoot. Lathering it also takes more work than I’m used to because of how viscous it is. Think vegan jello that was made with a bit too much water. It cleanses the skin well and doesn’t leave me feeling super dry and tight afterwords, which is a dealbreaker for me. I can’t speak on whether or not using this as intended (leaving the lather on for a bit before rinsing) has helped to alleviate any of my post acne marks or discoloration because I’ve been an absolute fool and have been forgetting to wear sunscreen which darkens them. Overall, it’s a decent wash once the texture problems are worked out. Cute packaging, etc. Mega Goo
