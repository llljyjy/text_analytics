I have been testing out the Even Fade and Glow AHA Mask that Hyper gifted me and here are my thoughts. I love the pump packaging but it’s a little difficult to pump out. This is orange, like bright orange and has a great texture. It’s very easy to apply and easily comes off with no effort. This is an aha mask so it does tingle on my sensitive skin. You gotta you this consistently for it to be effective but I find it a bit drying so I don’t think I could use it often enough to see fading results. I don’t think I would repurchase because of this. a bit drying
