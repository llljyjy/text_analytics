I received this complimentary from Hyper Skin and I love it! It cleans congested pores and brighten dull skin while niacinamide and bearberry work to fade stubborn dark spots. My skin feels really clean after I used this Fade and Glow Mask. I used it as I needed it but, it can be used one or two times a week. I only used a dime size amount. It has a great texture. I have one dark spot that comes back now and then. My skin tone looks smoother. I have dry skin and it doesnâ€™t make it feel tight. I will be placing another order before I run out of this. Love this mask
