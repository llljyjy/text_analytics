This is a really fun cleanser! I like it a lot! It has a thick, jelly, sludgey texture that feels so cooling and fun and soft on the skin. I like that this cleanser is also hydrating and didn’t leave my skin feeling dry. This is the first product I’ve tried that is intended for reducing dark spots so I want really sure what to expect, but wow, this works fast! I felt like some of my sun spots were lightened after just one use! I like it a lot! It really works!
