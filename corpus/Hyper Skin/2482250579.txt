This is one of my favorite cleansers I discovered this year! It has a jelly-like texture and a citrus scent. It’s easy to lather but takes a bit of work to wash off. Due to that, I do prefer using it during a shower. It doesn’t strip my skin either. I haven’t used it long enough to notice any diminishing of dark spots but the ingredients is very promising! nan
