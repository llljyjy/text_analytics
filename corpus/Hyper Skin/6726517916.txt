I was excited to receive this kit from Hyper Skin.  I hadn’t tried the brand before so this was an opportunity for a fresh take.  It came in a nice cardboard box and I took everything out.  It’s a combination set to be used together.  I thought the products applied well to my face and had natural scents.  Its been a while and I use them daily.  So far I haven’t noticed a big difference to my face but glad I tried them out. nan
