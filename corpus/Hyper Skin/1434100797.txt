I was very excited to try this cleanser, itâ€™s my first time trying anything from this brand. First off, it has a very light fresh and clean scent, I love that! This is a gel consistency and when rubbing in circular motions it will foam lightly. I cleanse for 60 seconds and wash off. This leaves my skin feeling less congested and overall clean. I always tone after cleansing and my cotton swab always comes up clean meaning the cleanser removed everything! I am a fan! nan
