The cleanser is EVERYTHING!!! My skin is super oily in the summer and gel cleansers sometimes donâ€™t cut it. First impressions: the suds + texture is PERFECT! This surprisingly felt like an exfoliant but it was much more gentle. Highly recommend this! Hyper skin never fails with any of their products!! Holy Grail
