I received this duo as a compliment from Hyper skin in exchange for my honest review. I have been looking for a product for reduce dark spots and even skin looks for a long time. I love this duo. The cleanser has a nice scent and my skin didn’t  experience any tight after washing.  The serum is not sticky and absorbed quickly. I have not uses it for a long time, so I doesn’t see the difference of my dark spots, but my skin looks more glowing and smoother after using it. I recommend to try. Love it
