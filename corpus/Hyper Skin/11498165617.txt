I have to say Iâ€™m really a fan of the consistency and ingredients in this product! While there are no added fragrances, the natural ingredients give it a really fresh nice smell. I have some hyper pigmentation and it feels really nice to have something to help even my skin tone and aid in the process. It lathers well and washes off easily and is gentle enough not to leave me feeling too dry. Definitely a great one for anyone with hyper pigmentation! Goodbye Hyper Pigmentation
