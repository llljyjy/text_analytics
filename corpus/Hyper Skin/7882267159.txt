The first thing you’ll notice about this cleanser is the texture it reminds me of a jelly, and has a bright, citrus scent. I was super impressed with how bright my skin looked after using it and I didn’t have any issues with it leaving a tight or stripped feeling! Absolutely in love with this one! nan
