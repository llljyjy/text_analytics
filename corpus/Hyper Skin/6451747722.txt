This was gifted by Hyper Skin in return for my honest review. I loved the ingredients on this, and it is a strong aha mask, so it did tingle a bit when I put it on my skin, but nothing unmanageable. I would say definitely make sure to use this only once a week and apply SPF!  But, Iâ€™m liking my results so far! powerful!
