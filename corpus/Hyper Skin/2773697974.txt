I love this mask! It was gifted by Hyper Skin in exchange for a review. It’s such a unique texture and consistency, and because my skin is pretty used to acids, I didn’t experience any stinging during application. I did see some nice brightening and revitalizing effects! My skin was pretty dull and looked tired prior to using this mask, but this gentle exfoliation felt really nice. Amazing exfoliating mask
