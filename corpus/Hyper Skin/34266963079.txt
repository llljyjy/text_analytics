The mask works well when your skin feels dry. I apply the mask twice per week. It’s been two weeks now and I really can tell the difference. I feel my skin is more nutritious and glow. I’ll recommend people who is able to use AHA or BHA. The only concern is it you use it in the long run, you need to apply the sun cream every time your skin exposed to the sun. Works well
