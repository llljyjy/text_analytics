I am loving this new cleanser. It has a nice gel texture and a little goes a long way. My skin feels so soft even after one use. One more thing that I loved about this cleanser is that it did not strip away the moisture from my skin. My skin still felt hydrated and itâ€™s a huge plus for dry skin like me. It also smells so nice. My skin loves it
