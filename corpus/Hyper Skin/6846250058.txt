I was skeptical about trying this product because I tend to be picky about face products but I actually like this a lot. It has a nice refreshing citrus smell to it. It doesn’t foam up a lot and is a very gentle cleanser that leaves my skin hydrated and glowing. I haven’t noticed any dark spots fading yet but I will definitely continue to use this product to see if it works. Hydrating cleanse
