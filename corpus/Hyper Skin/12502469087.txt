THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! The only downside is the price ($38 for the mini, $58 for the full) but it has lasted me sometime now. It can feel sticky on the skin, but that’s not necessarily an issue for me. After using this my skin is so bright and glowy. It has even faded a few my hyperpigmentation spots on my face. If you’re looking for a vitamin c serum to buy this is definitely the one! Brighten your life!
