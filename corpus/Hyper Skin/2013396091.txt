This was gifted by hyper skin and I love the ingredients in this mask and that it doesn’t stain my sink or bathtub but the packaging needs work. I had to unscrew the pump, squeeze all the excess air out to create a vacuum, and then I could pump the product out. Either they need to fill the bottles way more or just use smaller bottles. That aside I do like the mask, it doesn’t sting when I apply it and my skin does feel softer after I rinse it off nan
