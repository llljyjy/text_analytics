I really enjoyed using this cleanser. I haven’t used it long enough to notice spots fading but it’s a really complete cleanse and I love the jelly texture and micro foaming action. It feels like a high quality product and I also love how it doesn’t have any strong scents to give me a headache or compete with other skincare scents. Be careful bc it’s such a jelly texture it can slip off your hand into the sink but that also means that it feels silky smooth on your skin. Great jelly cleanser
