LOVE this cleanser already. I’ve been testing out for a week and immediately I fell in love with the formulation. It’s packed with brightening and hydrating ingredients in a formula that’s gentle enough for reactive skin like myself. It has a jelly consistency that foams up to a nice lather. It’s good for anyone who may not be able to handle exfoliants but still wants to include something in routine to brighten. I left it on a few extra minutes after cleansing to use it ask a mask too, which worked super well. Overall, the formulation, the hydration & the way it leaves your skin feeling so balanced makes this a total win. Hydrating + brightening + gentle!!!
