I’ve been using this a few days! And it’s it’s the first time I’m trying a product from this line. It’s a gel type formula which is kind of new to me. Doesn’t have a scent. Spread easily and leaves a clear skin for sure. I think since I’m older I’m used to more stronger cleansers. For daily use this is light and perfect. Will probably buy again. Gel formula is interesting
