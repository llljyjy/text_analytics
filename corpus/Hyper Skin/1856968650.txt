I’ve been a big fan of AHA masks for over a decade, with those from the Ordinary and Drunk Elephant being two of my favorites. However, once the pandemic started my skin became much more prone to inflammation and hormonal breakouts, and most AHA masks have either been too strong or lacked effectiveness. This has been delivering much better results than I ever had with masks before. Over the past four months I have really noticed a difference with improving my hyperpigmentation, texture and clarity. It’s hard to imagine going back to anything else! Wonderful
