The first time I used this product, I loved it, it gave a sense of skin perfection, but after trying with several products, I noticed I don’t like it, it’s not having good behavior because of the alcohol contained. In the side holding it, I’m not wearing any makeup, but I am in the other side. I prefer other products. Apart from that, it contains Phenoxyethanol and titanium dioxide, which I avoid because of some health risks. Not useful
