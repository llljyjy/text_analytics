I tried it and I love  it . It’s application is so light and easy . It’s absorbed easily into skin. It’s hydrated and moisturized the skin deeply . It’s became my favorite face cream in the winter time . It’s act like a barrier and I used before applying the makeup. It’s really helps to stay makeup intact whole day . I love it Amazing
