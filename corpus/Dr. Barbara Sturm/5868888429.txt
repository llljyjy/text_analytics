Used points for a small bottle of this. It goes pretty quick and feels just like any other HA serum in terms of application. But I didn’t find it hydrating at all. It was as though I hadn’t used any humectants at all. Then I came here to check reviews and see that it’s $300/oz?!? That’s insanity. Do yourself a favor and spend $150 on a bottle of Bioeffect EGF serum. Hydrates so well I almost don’t need a moisturizer, even with my dry skin. And you’ll get some EGFs thrown in. My Cosrx HA toner, which is $20, hydrates better than the Barbara Sturm. Ridiculous
