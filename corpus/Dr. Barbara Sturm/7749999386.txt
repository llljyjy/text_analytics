I bought this moisturizer not from Sephora but I’ve been using it for over a month now. It’s very nice and moisturizing but I would never repurchase as I find that many other moisturizers perform just as well and some even better. No one needs to spend this much money on a face cream - even if you have the money for it. Spend it on saving the climate or a cause you care about. Why this? Josie Maran cream is like $50 and it’s just as amazing. Just because someone is a doctor, doesn’t mean they should charge so much. Pros:- decently moisturizing- absorbs into skin- no scentCons- price tag basic and not worth the price
