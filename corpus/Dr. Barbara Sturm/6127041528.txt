It’s not a bad product but it’s definitely not worth $150. They don’t do much for glow that my Elta md spf doesn’t do, but maybe if you need more layers and don’t want to spend the cash on the hyaluronic serum maybe this is a good choice? But still, I wouldn’t recommend it for that price. I received this product for free for my unbiased review. Decent product but not for that price
