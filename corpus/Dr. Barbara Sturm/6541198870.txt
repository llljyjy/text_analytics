I received this cream free from Influenster for my honest review. Overall the cream is very hydrating and leaves the skin really nice. It is great for dry skin and will definitely leave it hydrated. The down fall for me is the scent. I can not pin point it but it has an extreme chemical scent and just for that along with the price I would not purchase myself. Great cream, bad scent!
