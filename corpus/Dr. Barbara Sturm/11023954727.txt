I do really enjoy this product, I find it perfect for a daycream! It’s really thin, I’d almost even dare to say a little runny, which is why I really like it for my daytime routine, as I can’t stand a thick, heavy cream on my face during the day. However, it does have a very strong “unscented“ scent, if that makes sense to you...almost like you’d imagine a lotion you’d get from a hospital to smell...I wish they’d have at least put some essential oils or something in it to make it smell a little better, however I understand why it smells like that and why they choose to leave it unscented, so it’s definitely not a deal breaker! Really nice!
