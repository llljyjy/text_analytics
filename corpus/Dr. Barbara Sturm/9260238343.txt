I like this face cream, but it’s not my favorite. I love that it is really hydrating and does not leave my face looking oily and shiny, but it kind of smells weird and doesn’t seem as hydrating if I don’t use it with both the hyaluronic acid serum and glow drops. Still, I love that it gives me a more hydrated matte look and wears easily under makeup. My skin is definitely really hydrated and soft after using it. And I think it smells funky because it doesn’t have any added fragrances. I think this face cream definitely does well with the set and should be all used together to get a maximum benefit. Love that I got to try this product for free in exchange for my honest review from influenster. I am not sure if I would buy it with this price, but maybe on sale? Great but jot my favorite
