This is a nice cream, I don’t notice any scent to it and it feels light and moisturizing.  However, it has several pore-clogging ingredients in it and unfortunately made me break out.  It’s a nice product but just wasn’t made for acne-prone skin.  I gave it to my mom to use the rest and so far she likes it! Not for acne-prone skin
