I LOVE this cream! It is thick but lightweight, so it does not feel heavy at all. It goes on like butter, it blends perfectly and leaves the skin feeling very hydrated throughout the day. Makeup applies well on top. I used it after the hyaluronic serum and before sunscreen and makeup. My face feels smoother after using it. Only two things I dislike: packaging and price. If you donâ€™t mind splurging on a face cream, I recommend this one. I would repurchase
