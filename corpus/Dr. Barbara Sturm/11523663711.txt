Product just melts right into skin it’s like an instant hydration for your face. I can’t explain how good this feels and how your skin will just drink this, all three products, the glow drops and moisturizer as well as this product. All are 10/10 and worth the money. By far the best skincare I’ve ever used. My skin feels great. I see why it’s so incredibly expensive! Love this!
