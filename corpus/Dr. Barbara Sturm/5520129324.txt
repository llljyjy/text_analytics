I was really excited to try out this very coveted and expensive moisturizer from Dr. Barbara Sturm sent to me by Influenster complimentary for my honest review.  The packaging is exquisite - simple and made of solid glass.  The moisturizer itself is a simple white and not too rich, but also not too gel like.  It keeps my sensitive dehydrated skin moisturized all day without feeling oily - its a great balance!  It does give me skin a slight “glow“ but that fades quickly.  Overall, this is a great basic moisturizer but the price point is ridiculous.  I haven’t seen any extraordinary results from using this daily for almost 2 months, especially for this price. Good, but not worth the price
