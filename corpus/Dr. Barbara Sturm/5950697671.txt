I really like this cream for my dry skin. It’s lightweight enough to use during the day and under makeup, but it also keeps my skin moisturized while using retinol. I wish I could afford to purchase this! It does have a very very slight scent, it’s non-obtrusive, but might be something that could cause a sensory experience for some. nan
