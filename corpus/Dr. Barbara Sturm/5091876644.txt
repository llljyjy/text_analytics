First off, I love the packaging and jar of this cream. It’s heavy and high end, almost like a ceramic pot, very sleek! A little goes a long way so this will last a while. I’ve been using this in the morning and it does a good job hydrating and plumping my skin. It’s not a major difference from others I’ve used but it works well. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t add to my redness. The one thing that gets me is the smell… it has an artificial plastic smell to me, like a doctor’s office that makes it unpleasant to apply. I could be sensitive to the scent, but it’s not the best. Pleasant
