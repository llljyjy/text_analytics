This moisturizer is a little on the heavier side so make sure to use a smaller amount if you’re on the oily side. A little goes a long way! I am obsessed with the packaging, it’s very clean and heavy duty. The lotion itself feels velvety and you can tell the moisture sets in immediately. I’m excited to keep on using it but I really love it so far. My dry patches feel so much better after a couple of uses.  I’ve learned not to skimp on paying for skin care so this is worth the investment. Very rich- a little goes a long way!
