I was committed to using the combo for seven days to see how the serum + face cream + glow drops worked for my combination, acne prone skin. And I have to say the verdict is…confusing. So let me break it down:The serum & face cream combo I used together for 7 full days and at the end of it I can definitely tell my face is more radiant and pores are *slightly* less visible. The face cream was light and very hydrating- I live in a dry climate and it moisturized my skin well. However I had the worst breakout along my jawline (I always put my skincare down to my neck/chest) that would not get any better until I stopped using these products. I’ve never gotten breakouts along my jawline before, if I have a reaction to products it’s usually on my face. So while I wanted so badly to like these, I don’t think I will continue to use. Maybe other people will have better luck. I received this free from Influenster for my honest review. Mixed feelings, fragrance free and non irritating
