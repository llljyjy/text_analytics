I have been using this for the last few weeks after I wash my face and have been enjoying it.  I have dry skin and feel that it has helped with the flaking I usually experience in the winter around my nose. Am not too sure if I will repurchase as the price is high but no complaints! Very neutral smell and consistency is nice and refreshing. nan
