Ask for sample before buying… I put it on for my brother in laws wedding .. gives you that dewy look but you’ll look oily. Also, the next morning I woke up with tiny whiteheads all over my forehead and couldn’t figure out what was going on. I thought it was the new face wash, but stopped using it and it seems like the whiteheads are slowly disappearing. If you have sensitive skin - STAY AWAY. I have another wedding in 2 weeks, I hope these tiny whiteheads disappear- my makeup looks horrible on top of it. Forehead - Tiny Whiteheads!!!
