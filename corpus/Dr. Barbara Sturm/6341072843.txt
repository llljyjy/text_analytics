I was so excited to get this since Dr. Sturm is such a big name, but I’m so disappointed in this face cream. I’m 38 and these are my before and after shots (b&a) one month apart. This cream is so incredibly greasy. It made me break out and congested my pores so bad I’m still trying to get my skin back to normal after stopping this product a week ago. At first I figured I was breaking out due to adding a new product but it just didn’t clear up. I figured I would try to use it as an eye cream only but then I got little breakouts around my eyes. I’ve also had other face lotions, moisturize much better than this product. Not for me!
