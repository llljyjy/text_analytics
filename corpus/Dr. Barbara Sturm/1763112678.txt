I donâ€™t know if I started using this product at the wrong time, as in, Iâ€™ve probably been indulging in dairy a bit too much ðŸ˜¬ but I started breaking out. Since I canâ€™t determine if other factors are at play I wonâ€™t attribute that to this moisturizer. What I will say is it isnâ€™t compatible with my existing skincare routine, it would start pilling after nearly every application. This shouldnâ€™t be a problem if you plan to implement the rest of the brandâ€™s products to achieve the Strum Glow. nan
