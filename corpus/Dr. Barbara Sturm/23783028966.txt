I got the 10ml version in the flight kit and absolutely love the product. I have extremely sensitive skin and this serum did not cause any irritation. It also helped calm down my sunburn. All in all, I would recommend the product. But let me tell you that Babor (a German skincare brand) has a very similar calming serum (they also make a very similar enzyme cleanser and toner) with almost identical ingredients for half the price that works as well as this one Great product
