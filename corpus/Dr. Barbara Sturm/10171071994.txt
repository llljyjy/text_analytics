I love the Dr. Sturm face mask because it is so hydrating. I love the creamy texture of the mask and it is different from all the other ones I have tried. You can rub it off instead of using water and it gives a gentle exfoliation while maintaining hydration. Extremely innovative and easy to use. My skin feels soft and looks extremely glowy after using the mask:) Love the sturm mask
