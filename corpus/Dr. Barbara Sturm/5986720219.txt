I bought this as the Jack Black daily cleanser had been my go to for years, it was always drying my skin out but I stuck with it because I don’t like wasting money on new products if they don’t work... I started looking into more anti aging products as I got older and came across this brand. I decided to buy bunch of products with them and I started out with this cleanser.My skin has never felt or looked better but I’m not sure if I can 100% put all the praise on JUST this product, however my skin is not dry nor super oily after using this product. It’s now normal. It used to be oily t zone and dry everywhere else. My skin would get occasional breakouts and blackheads on forehead every once in a while but not terrible acne. I haven’t had any breakouts since using this product, my skin feels nice and clean and “tight“ and I just feel like theres some sort of glow to my skin now, I can’t explain it but it just looks very good.For $70 and a foam it is a lot of money for little product - what I don’t like about foam is that it seems like theres a lot of product in the bottle but it goes a lot quicker than a gel or normal liquid product. I use 2 pumps daily, twice a day (morning and night) I am PRAYING this product can last me 2 months maybe 3, the jack black would last me 3+ months it was so large at literally half the price. I will repurchase it but it’s going to be a product I will also ask for around holidays as it is so expensive I don’t like spending this much on a product that goes so quickly. I also started using Dr. Sturm’s face cream for men. I don’t think I’ll repurchase that at $215 a bottle... It’s a great face cream but not a $215 face cream. I would pay $150 tops for it and only because it’s a “premium“ brand. Good cleanser for men too!
