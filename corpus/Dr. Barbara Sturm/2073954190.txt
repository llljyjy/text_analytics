Torn because I love it .  Was super bummed . Love the product but came 3/4 full and cap was broken. Waisted a bunch just trying to get it open. This happens a lot with Sturm …lazy about returning things because you’re always so excited when you finally receive it. Last thing you want to do is bother with a return . great product but HORRIBLE packaging .
