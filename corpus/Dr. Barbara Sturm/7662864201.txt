This is my favorite hyaluronic serum I have ever used. I love the tacky-ness that it gives my skin after application and how the rest of my skincare sits on top of it. I usually have dry skin in the winter and this is the most hydrated my face has been. The issue I have with this product is the price. I hate that I love it because it is something I will never be able to justify purchasing. Best hyaluronic serum Iâ€™ve used
