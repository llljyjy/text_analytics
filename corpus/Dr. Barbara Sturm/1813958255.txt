I normally have horribly dry skin. With that + winter it’s been terrible. This cream has saved the day. It’s soooo moisturizing and kept that plump feeling even throughout the day in a dry climate. I will say - it doesn’t smell good - it doesn’t smell bad but it’s definitely not good. I will also say I have tried tons of other amazing moisturizers similar to this for less cost, but this one is really working miracles on my skin this winter! Worth trying if you are like me!! MOISTURE!!!
