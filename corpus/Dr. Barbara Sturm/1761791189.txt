I absolutely loved this face cream. I found it to be just thick enough that it moisturized my face perfectly. I find many face creams to be too thick. But I also like that it was not greasy it had the perfect consistency to it. It melted right into my skin and it rubbed in effortlessly. Perfect consistency
