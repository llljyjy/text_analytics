I didn’t want to like this face cream because of the cost, but it’s AMAZING. It has no scent but I find it has a fresh skincare scent to it. It is a thicker cream but turns into almost a water cream when on the face. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling refreshed. I find a temporary tightening in my face the next morning and I believe that, if used nightly over time, the Firming would be more permanent. *I did receive this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Surprisingly Good!
