I have tried a lot of different eye creams as I have gotten older. The good ones will let you know they’re working after several days, or even in day 1. You’ll see depuffing, or improved dark circles, or better texture, or diminished lines. But this one? Nothing. It’s just heavy and greasy and doesn’t particularly seem to absorb. Go out in the hot sun, and it’ll run into your eyes. Go buy a jar of Pond’s at the local drug store. You’ll save $130, and you won’t be able to tell the difference. Save a lot of money - buy something else
