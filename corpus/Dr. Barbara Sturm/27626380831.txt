This face cream is very pleasant to use. I like the heavy glass jar. It feels very luxurious. It has a nice light scent that comes from the shea butter instead of an added fragrance. It soaks in fast and pairs well with the other products in my makeup and skincare routine with zero pilling. However, it is winter in Wisconsin and this cream just doesn’t provide enough moisture for the dry cold weather here. I even started mixing a couple drops of my favorite face oil in and its still not enough. At $135 per ounce I would hope a face “cream“ would be able to provide adequate moisture even in winter. I like to use skincare products for at least 45 days before reviewing but I’m stopping this at 28 days because my skin is suffering and needs proper moisture. I will put this cream away for the summer and finish using it up then. nan
