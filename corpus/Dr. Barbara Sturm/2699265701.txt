I used this face cream after the hyaluronic acid serum and it has a very nice texture and glides onto the skin. It’s nice and hydrating but also lightweight and sinks into the skin quickly. I had some dry skin and I used this routine and the next day it was all gone and my face felt totally refreshed. It smells a bit like a boxed hair dye but I don’t mind the scent. It is pretty expensive so I would not repurchase but I will finish this jar. nan
