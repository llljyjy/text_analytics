I have been using this for about 2 weeks and love it so much. I didn’t want to love it as much as I did due to the price. It is a little out of my budget but let me tell you if your looking for a higher brand high quality moisturizer this is it. I have had not one breakout spot and it makes my skin feel so smoothe. It doesn’t feel sticky or tacky like some of the other brands I’ve tried, and it doesn’t look shiny on the face. After my shower it soaks in to my skin and makes it look more radiant and healthy Must have
