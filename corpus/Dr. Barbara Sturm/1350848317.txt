First of all, I am sensitive and dry skin. The Sturm Face Cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly, it is slightly not enough to moisturize me in winter, but I guess it will be perfect for summer. The skin looks firm and smooth after being applied. Also, it doesnâ€™t have any scent, which I like. Overall, it is a good cream for oily use in winter or dry skin use in summer. Lightweight cream
