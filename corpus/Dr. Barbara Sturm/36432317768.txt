I received Dr. Barbara Strum glow drops in exchange for my honest review. Here’s the deal, this is definitely a pause before you purchase item. The price tag is high, however, this definitely serves you a luxury experience with great results. I used these drops for about 3 weeks as directed and my skin has had a natural even all over glow. I found I only need a drop for my face to provide the right amount of glow. The dropper works well, but I did find it a little messy if I’m not careful with it. I think because the formula is on the thick side. I did use this along with the hyaluronic serum and facial cream, and found that it spread easily and evenly. Last but not least when used with a liquid foundation (mine is water based) I was able to achieve a great natural no makeup makeup look. I think that if you’re looking for a premium skin care brand I would definitely recommend looking into Dr. Barbara Strum products. They do not disappoint. Glow baby glow
