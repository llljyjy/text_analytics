I had to order this product twice because the first time it arrived it was less than half full. Sephora’s customer service representative was very helpful to send me a second replacement free of charge, however that one arrived half empty as well. For any product, regardless of price, this is unacceptable. However, at the price tag of $50 for just 10 ml this is ridiculous. I will not be purchasing any of Dr. Barbara’s products ever again as clearly they need to improve their quality control. Reading other reviews, I am not the first person this has happened to.
