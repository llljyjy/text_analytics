I received this as a free sample and it lasted for about a week. Currently trying to convince myself to buy the full size, despite the intimidating price. It was amazing. My skin was soft, bright, glowing, plumped to the point I didn’t feel the need to use any concealer. I used it all around my eyes and down to my cheeks, and I saw instant improvement in the redness, texture, and a mini-breakout I was having on my cheeks. I didn’t have product and dead skin “pilling“ up when I would wash my face at the end of the day, either, which is a problem I usually struggle with on my nose and cheeks. I don’t have much experience with higher end products (I usually use e.l.f. Holy Hydration for chrissakes lol) but this product convinced me to order Dr. Barbara’s “face cream“ and see if it provides similar results at a more affordable price than the super anti-aging eye cream. Regardless, I definitely recommend trying this product for yourself. Instant Results
