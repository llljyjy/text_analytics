Oh man, I did it so you don’t have to and here is the rundown: this is a fantastic(!) moisturizer, but I don’t think its worth taking out a second mortgage for. I have combo skin but during the winter I get very dry patches on different  areas of my face that my tinted moisturizer clings to. I got a DBS mini-facial before that used this product and a pea size of this product solved that problem. My skin feels incredibly supple and soft after using, however as the name suggests it is very rich which causes a slight problem for the areas of my face that are oily (darn you combo skin!). I ended up passing this on to my mother who has dry skin and she adores it. Bottom line: really great product for dry skin, fragranced but not overpowering, very luxurious metal packaging. If you don’t mind dropping a few bills on skincare, this is great for dry skin people, but for anyone combo like me you can pass. As far as high-end skincare goes, I believe La Mer is better suited for combo skin. Best for dry skin, but don’t sell a kidney over it
