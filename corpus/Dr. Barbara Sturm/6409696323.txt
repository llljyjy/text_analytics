100% love, love, love. I was so excited to use this and it did not disappoint. The Dr. Barbara Sturm Face Cream has quickly become a staple in my day to day routine. My skin feels so hydrated and firm immediately upon use. It smells clean and fresh, too. The ingredients are clean and the product is so light-weight. It never feels oily or heavy on my face and neck. Your skin will feel so soft and look radiant afterwards. I would recommend this to anyone and would for sure purchase this product after running out! A Must Use Moisturizer!
