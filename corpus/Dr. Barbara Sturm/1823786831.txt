I think this is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. The texture is so perfect, it has the creamy yet light weight texture thatâ€™s just glides on and absorbs beautifully into the skin. It provides long lasting moisturizing and hydration. This paired with Barbara Sturm hyaluronic serum is so amazing. My skin looks so good in the dry cold weather. nan
