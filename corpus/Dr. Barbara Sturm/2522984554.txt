Was gifted the following from influentser for it to work as a set. I was so excited to get this! I love skincare and was excited to try it out since I’ve had my eye on these. Hyaluronic serum: thick, feels nice, I would repurchase if I didn’t think the price was so steep. It’s only a little bit thicker than my regular use Glow Recipe version. After use for one month, I can’t tell a difference between what I used before and this. Absolutely too much for a product. Glow drops: lovely no makeup makeup/primer. Makes your skin look lovely and probably the only item I’d purchase with my own money. Love that there are great ingredients in it for a daytime look. Moisturizer: meh. Very thin. I see my skin super dry when used overnight and I’m usually an oily girl. It’s not life changing for my eczema and dry patches. It doesn’t moisturize enough for me, and I thought if never say that. JUST OK but not enough to repurchase. Meh
