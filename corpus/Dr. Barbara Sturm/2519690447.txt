This moisturizer is nourishing - but not greasy - and safe to use on my sensitive skin. When my face sting/feels dry from the retinol products I use, I can rely on this face cream to calm down my skin. I like to use a thick layer at night to seal in all the active ingredients I put on my face, and a thinner layer in the day - it sits well under makeup and prevents foundation from drying out my skin. Such a holy grail face cream. Great for sensitive, dry skin
