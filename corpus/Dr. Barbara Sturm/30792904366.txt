Dr. Barbara Sturm’s face cream is hydrating, long-lasting, and spreads very well, requiring a minimal amount for full coverage. I have been using this product for about two years -- it is a staple in my skincare routine. I use it year-round and makeup layers perfectly on top of it. I highly recommend this immaculate product. Like all Dr. Barbara Sturm’s products, the face cream helps with anti-inflammation keeping my face (and neck) hydrated and toned. A year-round staple in my skincare routine
