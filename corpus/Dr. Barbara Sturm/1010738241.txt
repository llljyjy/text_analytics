I was given this to try by Influenster. The cream feels so smooth and luxurious when you apply it. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any trouble with this lotion. I live in a very dry climate and it does a good job of keeping my skin comfortable. I took off one star because I would love if it hydrated a little more. The only other lotion I have liked better than this one is even more expensive. I would purchase this again. A very nice gentle skin cream
