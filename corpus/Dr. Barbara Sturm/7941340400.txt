My skin looks glowy and dewy after using these glow drops. Also, I liked the texture. It didnâ€™t feel sticky. In spite of this, I dislike the bottle and the packaging. When I was halfway through the bottle, by accident, I dropped it on the floor of my bathroom. It broke into pieces, so I had to throw it away. It would be nice if the bottle was more durable Love this glow drops.
