I received this first as a sample, then ordered full size. The smell is almost non-existent. Which is appreciated when you use other scented products. The texture is velvety but fairly thick. The first few days I did break out, but wanted to continue. Once I got past that-it seriously is perfect. Made my skin very glowy, reduced irritation and improved clarity. Glowy!
