I would like to try the light version. This one was really heavy and left a residue feeling on my oily and blemish prone skin. It probably wouldn’t be bad for a night cream in the winter months but definitely not light enough for my skin type during the day. I wish it had a better smell but it’s tolerable! Not terrible
