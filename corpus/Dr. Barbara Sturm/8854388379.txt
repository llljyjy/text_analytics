This Is the one. Product glides easily onto skin, dries quickly. I use Squalane oil over this and it goes on silky smooth with no pilling. My face does not get sticky or oily throughout the day like it does with other serums. Yes, the bottle is small and only comes partially filled, but that’s to protect the product from cold/heat expansion. You still get the amount you paid for. I bought the mini size to try it out, and I *try* to ration it out each day! I used a generous amount today and didn’t find it to be too much.  I hope soon I can afford the full size bottle. I’ve used many, many HA serums, and this one is simply the best. I really like that It’s simple, with no extra additives that could irritate the skin, no pilling, and makes my skin feel soft without a greasy, sticky feeling. I have super sensitive skin, and have to stay very basic with products and routine. So far, so good. yes yes y’all
