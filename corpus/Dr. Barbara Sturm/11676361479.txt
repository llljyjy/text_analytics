Tbh I had no expectations of Dr. Barbara Sturmâ€™s face cream, I thought it would be just like other creamy heavy face creams based on its white color so I was pleasantly surprised on how it applied on the skin, and how it absorbs so nice. Can definitely be used as a day cream after serums, it leaves a nice light and fresh feeling. Perfect for those looking for a day moisturizer that nourishes and has anti-aging properties. (I received this product complimentary via Influenster, and love it, would definitely recommend) Light moisturizing, nourishing
