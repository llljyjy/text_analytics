It really does everything it says it does. My face stays hydrated but doesn’t feel heavy or sticky. Sometimes the more luxurious creams make me sweat, but not this one. It’s light and absorbs fast but keeps the moisture level high. I used with the serum and glow drops and I love them all! Love love love
