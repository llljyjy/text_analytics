After using “Glow Drops” for the last few weeks, I am not impressed with the results. It does give you little glow when you apply it but nothing special about it. When I apply sunscreen or foundation after using “glow drops”, I have to rub it really good. I don’t think I would pay for the full price.. Little glow for the price
