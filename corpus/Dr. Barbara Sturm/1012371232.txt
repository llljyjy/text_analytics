I was able to try several Dr. Sturm products when they had a special set of deluxe minis in the beauty bazaar last year. I really enjoyed this cleanser, it does a good job of removing makeup and oils. It does feel a bit stripping to my normal skin. Even though I enjoy it there is no way I will pay this amount of money for a cleanser. I’m not going to participate in this insanity. Look into Dr. Babor, it’s made at the same factory in Germany and the ingredients are suspiciously similar. That’s all. Just lookin out for your wallet. good cleanser. overpriced.
