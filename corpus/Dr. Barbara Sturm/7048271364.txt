this is a beautiful hydrating and moisturizing serum that makes my dry skin look ultra glowy, healthy, and bouncy. it’s thick for a serum but not greasy or heavy on the skin when it sinks in. i have no complaints about the performance of this product. i would say, though that this is incredibly similar to the glossier future dew, which is just $24!!!!! you do not need to splurge on this at all unless you like dr. barbara sturm herself and want to support her brand (totally up to you and your preference). if you’re just looking for the skin nourishment and dewy effect, go with the futuredew!! get the glossier futuredew!!
