This face cream feels super luxurious! Itâ€™s creamy, hydrating, and envelopes your skin making it great for winter. This is great for those with dry skin. I have combination skin and this moisturizer felt too heavy for me. If you have dry skin and feel like splurging then this might be a great option for you! Rich!
