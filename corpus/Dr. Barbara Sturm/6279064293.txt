Gifted by Influenster and Dr. Barbera Sturm in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer is amazing! I truly feel silky soft after using. It’s not too heavy and it absorbs perfectly leaving behind no greasiness or sticky feeling. No issues with pilling and it layers lovely with my makeup. I love that a little truly goes a long way and that this doesn’t clog my pores or leave a heavy feeling on my face despite this moisturizer being incredibly nourishing. My skin feels supple and looks more radiant. This moisturizer is actually incredible. I’m pretty picky on moisturizers but this one makes it into my top favorites. It will be my go to for my dehydrated winter skin. I was skeptical with the price point if it was truly “that good” but it is! Absolutely wonderful!
