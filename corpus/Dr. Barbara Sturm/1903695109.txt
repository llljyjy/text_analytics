I received a sample of this, knew it would be expensive, but was blown away when I went to check the price. $385 CAD! For only 30 mls! When I was using it, I thought it felt a lot like the hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary. It’s a bit nicer and not as sticky as The Ordinary’s serum, but is that worth paying an extra $375? I don’t think so. Yeah, it’s nice but the price is absolutely insane for what you get. Just buy The Ordinary + 3 weeks of groceries
