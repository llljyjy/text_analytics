This stunning face cream reminds me so much of the luxury products my mother and grandmother used back in the day. They’d have a prominent spot on their vanities and, as a child, I always wanted to try! Everything about this product is luxe: packaging, formula, finish, scent and pricepoint. I find the consistency to be quite thick so it took me a while to figure out only to work in thin layers and add extra product to particularly dry areas as needed. It doesn’t disrupt the rest of my skincare routine, nor does it cause issues when I wear makeup overtop of it. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my combination/acne-prone skin, which is the big deciding factor when it comes to whether or not I’ll introduce a product into my routine in an ongoing way. This absorbs relatively quickly and lasts all day without looking greasy. I look forward to seeing more results from long-term use. Super luxe
