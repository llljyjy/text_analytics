I really love this moisturizer! It really helped fade some dark spots I had after some break outs and it soaks into skin nicely to wear under makeup. I really wish it was a bit thicker though. I live in the Midwest and I definitely got dry throughout the day while wearing this. This would be the perfect summer moisturizer for me! So nice!
