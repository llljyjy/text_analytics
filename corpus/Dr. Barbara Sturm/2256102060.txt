I bought this product after I over exfoliated my skin. It took weeks for my skin to heal; esp because I was using a witch hazel toner without knowing it’s actually not good for sensitive skin. SIGH. So I did some research, saw this with great reviews but hefty price tag. Well, I am very glad I did. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks now and sure enough my skin is healed. My skin is so much softer, no longer red, even texture and tone, my pores are nearly gone. It’s worth the 75$. nan
