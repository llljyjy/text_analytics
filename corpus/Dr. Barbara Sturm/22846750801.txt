My skin has been very dry ever since temperatures started dropping. I struggle with dry patches on my cheeks, making my face very sensitive and preventing smooth makeup application. However, the Sturm Face Cream has been saving my face! It is very nourishing, does not irritate my skin, and leaves my face looking glowy. It has become a staple in my routine! One of the best!
