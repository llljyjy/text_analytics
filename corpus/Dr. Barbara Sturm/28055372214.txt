I received this product for free for testing purposes. I do enjoy this product. I’m giving it 4 stars because I feel like it’s not a necessity since it’s doesn’t benefit your skin itself but, I apply it as my last skincare step & it does makes my skin look luminous & glowy ( I don’t wear face makeup). I’m not sure I would purchase in the future, but I am loving the way it makes my bare skin look. Glow Drops
