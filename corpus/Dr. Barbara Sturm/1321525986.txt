I really wanted to love this cream but it just didn’t work for me. I have very dry skin and also use tretinoin nightly. I found that that cream didnt provide enough moisture to work with my trent, but was acceptable when used on it’s own. I found that when I used tretinoin at night and this cream in the morning, my skin would get very red after using the cream. Over all it was a nice medium weight mositurizer that left a dewy feeling and I’ll give it another shot in the summer when it’s humid. The packaging on this skincare is absolutely luxurious. The jar is extremely heavy and solid. However, I hate dipping my fingers into pots - it’s just not sanitary and makes the product go bad faster. At this price point I think a spatula should be included. Nice for normal/oily skin
