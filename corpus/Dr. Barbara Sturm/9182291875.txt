I used this spf for about a year along with a full Dr. Sturm skincare routine. It was effective, and I learned there is a knack to applying it to avoiding the pilling noted by other reviewers: your skin needs to be really hydrated. I found that when my skin was on the drier side, sun drops were really hard to apply. The product pilled and just wouldn’t sink in. But when my skin was hydrated and supple, it sunk right in and meshed beautifully with my skincare and under makeup. On the one hand, I liked realizing how much more hydrated my skin needed to be…on the other, our skin goes through phases and we doing want something as important and routine as our daily spf to be difficult to apply. Another trick when it did pill (which is something I do for any product that won’t sink in Shaun) is to spray a facial mist over the skin and then massage everything in. Works every time! There’s that hydration factor again I guess. Lastly: be aware that the regulations surrounding skincare filters are different in the US than in Europe, and the formulation for this spf is different here in the states. Sturm products are made in Germany, and my guess is they haven’t just perfected the formula for the US version. In summary, if your skin is generally well hydrated and especially if you have a Sturm routine, I think these drops are great because they can blend so beautifully and look very dewy on the skin. But there are so many amazing spf’s these days where you may get more bang for your buck. And since getting pregnant and now breastfeeding, I can’t even use this one anymore and have switched to mineral sunscreens by Tatcha and Odacité which both perform beautifully. Works great but there’s a knack to using it
