I was astounded by how much I loved this cream. Knowing the cost of the product, I was a bit uneasy but the cream is well worth the price. The formula is light weight and scented just as lightly. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that a very little cream goes a long way, really can get full coverage with a small amount. I was also really happy to wake up still feeling like my skin was hydrated and not oily. I have been using this product for about a month and keep getting compliments on my skin, how natural, how glowing and how youthful I look. Thoroughly impressed and highly recommend the product. A must have
