First off let me say this line is a luxury line so I’m not going to include cost in my review, if you are looking at this line you already know the average cost. For my oily skin, out of the three products from this brand that I’ve tried, this was my least preferred. It’s not a bad moisturizer, I just found it not the right moisturizer for my skin type. I think maybe the ‘light’ version might do better for me, as this original face cream seemed a little heavy on my face. I used it at night so that’s okay that it’s maybe a richer cream, but in the summer I’m afraid it wouldn’t be good for me. My biggest issue is that my skin didn’t seem to love it, I didn’t break out but it did sting around my eyes which made me not want to use it honestly. I ended up using this on my neck and targeted areas of the face (not near my eyes) since it’s supposed to help target wrinkles, but I think it will take using it for a longer amount of time before I’ll see any difference in that regard. So overall not bad, but not amazing at this point. An okay moisturizer
