This product makes a difference after 1 use. Similar to the Tatcha rice powder cleanser but I prefer this one. It also doesnt smell bad like the Tatcha one. If youre thinking of investing in something from this brand this is probably one of my favourite products aside from the hylauronic acid. It exfoliates really gently but after using it you can immediately see the skin is brightened and evened out. Worth the money nan
