I didn’t expect to like this. It absorbs well, much better than my other moisturizers that feel like they sit on top of my skin, but it left my skin feeling a little dry. I have combo skin that leans dry in the winter so I need extra hydration. But it absorbs so well! And it doesn’t irritate my skin. I was having breakouts during the summer but it’s cleared up. Not sure if this has helped with that or that it’s the winter season. The price is too steep to purchase, but I am really happy I got to test it out. nan
