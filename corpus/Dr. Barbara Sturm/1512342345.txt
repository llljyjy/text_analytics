Of all of the VoxBox items I received to review, this is my favorite. It smells so nice- not fragrance or perfume, just a familiar lotion smell that I wish I could place so that I can purchase a similar cream when I run out. No, I would not repurchase this. As much as I find it pleasant to use and knowing the cost makes the experience feel luxurious, there is simply no reason this product needs to cost as much as it does. Itâ€™s a simple and nice lotion. No bells, no whistles, and no justification for the price. Pleasant to use, overpriced
