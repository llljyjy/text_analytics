Been using this face cream for around 3 weeks after receiving it to review it from influenster and itâ€™s been really good on my skin. I tend to have dry patches and it seems like this has been the only face cream to clear that up. My face feels smooth like a babyâ€™s bottom. No lie. My makeup has never looked so good before. This is a really good moisturizer. The down side is that I cannot afford it because itâ€™s so expensive ðŸ˜« Amazing
