I used this product once, and I absolutely loved it. It feels great on the skin and the ingredients are perfect for sensitive skin like mine. However, the dropper doesn’t work, and I’ll have to return this product. Also, it was not completely full, which is kind of a bummer for that expensive price point. I will repurchase again to see if it was only bad luck. Perfect for a healthy glowy skin
