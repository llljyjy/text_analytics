Dr. Barbara Sturmâ€™s face cream is non greasy and offers the moisture level needed for the winter months. My combo summer skin/dry winter skin feels firmer and has a healthy glow after a few weeks of use. No fragrance is a plus for me and it sits well on top of all other skin care steps I do during the wintertime! Hydrating moisturizer!
