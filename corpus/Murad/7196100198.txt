I love the texture. It layers really nicely with my other face serums + moisturizers.  However, when I put it on my face, somehow the smell of it changes from barely any smell at all to a mildew scent. It’s really gross, but I just don’t think that this formula meshes well with my natural facial oils. Returning. It's Great! Except it Stinks on My Face.
