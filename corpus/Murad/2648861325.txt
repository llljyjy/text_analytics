What I like about this eye cream is that it has a very light consistency and that I can use it under makeup. I find that the applicator is also another HUGE plus point as it helps me to depuff my undereyes in the morning. It feels really nice, cooling and soothing and I look forward to using it every morning. Personally I canâ€™t say much about whether it helps with wrinkles, but I can say that it hydrates and depuffs pretty well. I really enjoy this product and will continue using it. AWESOME eye cream, I love the applicator!
