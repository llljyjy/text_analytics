This treatment is one of the few things that worked for my cystic, deep acne. I tried it twice for various cystic acne breakouts I have had and it definitely either made the pimples shrink drastically and eventually go away, or made the pimples mature into surface pimples that were pop-able. Overall very satisfied by the effectiveness (gifted by Murad) nan
