This cleanser is exactly what it says.  It has a pearly color and does very well for my age 45 skin.  I have sensitive skin and it works well for that also.  I have used it for about 5 years, and it is a great everyday cleanser.  This cleanser does not lather up, it goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling quenched after you wash it off. I would disagree with the exfoliation description, I in no way feel exfoliation with this product at all. A tube lasts a very long time, and you don’t need very much to cleanse your whole face. This cleanser is very balancing for my skin, I don’t feel greasy or oily ever. Great for sensitive skin
