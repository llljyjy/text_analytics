I have recently gotten horrible cystic acne on my neck and I saw a video on tiktok where someone recommended this product for cystic acne. Well let me tell you, they were right. I’ve been using it consistently and after a week, the breakouts were less raised and not painful anymore. It definitely isn’t an overnight change, it does take time, but if you are consistent, you can see results. I will continue using in the hopes that it helps to fully clear my cystic breakouts.
