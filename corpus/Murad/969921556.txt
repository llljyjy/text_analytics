I received this SPF in exchange for my review. I’m very impressed! I’ve tried a few similar products (dropper-style SPFs) from other brands and without a doubt this is the best one I’ve tried. It’s a really great formula; it has the faintest white cast when first applied, and it’s a bit slick and shiny for a few minutes… but after a few minutes it dries down really nicely. I like that it doesn’t have much of a detectable scent at all, and it layers well with other products. So easy to use; I love it!! So good!
