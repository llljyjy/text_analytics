I really love Murad products, and this serum is no different! I love the pump packaging for easy dispensing. This light weight serum has a very faint earthy scent that I enjoy. The consistency is really nice and feels good on the skin—absorbs really quickly and completely. It later we’ll work other facial products too.  I did not have an adverse effects in using this, it wasn’t harsh on my skin at all. And it does give a plumpness to the skin that makes you skin feel really smooth. It will be an enjoyable one to keep using for the full benefits. A great serum!!
