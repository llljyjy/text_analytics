I love this serum as much as I love their Youth Renewal eye cream! I’m a fan of retinol and can’t recommend a good retinol serum enough, and this one in particular is perfect for people looking to start retinol or to seasoned users that want the effectiveness of retinol but not the drying or irritation of daily use. Because this serum does not dry out the skin at all, in fact it leaves my skin feeling conditioned and soft! Murad has does it again! Murad has does it again!
