Have you ever tried a product and wondered how you went your entire life without it? Yeah, that was how I felt when I started using this serum. It will 100% be in my PM skincare routine from now on. First, the way it smells....OMG itâ€™s amazing. My boyfriend even commented on how good my face smelt LOL.  It is definitely potent but not in a bad way at all! Second, the way it absolutely melted into my skin, wow I needed it. The texture is really nice and felt moisturizing on my dry skin. Overall, I am in love with this serum and highly recommend it to anyone!! Can't get enough!
