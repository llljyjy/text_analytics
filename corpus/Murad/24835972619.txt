I received this product complimentary from Murad in exchange for my honest review. If you’re like me and know all the words to N’SYNC and Destinys Childs songs, it may be time for an eye cream.This Targeted Wrinkle Corrector from Murad has a rounded metal applicator that gives you a coolness when applied to the under eye area. It also blends in very nicely and gives your skin a boost of hydration without feeling too heavy. I noticed my under eye area appears healthier, plump and nourished. I also noticed that it helps fill in some of my lines and make them a lot less noticeable. nan
