This serum is a miracle worker for me, it eases the pain of the deep hormonal acne I have so much, and it really reduces the redness too. I was expecting my skin to feel really dry after using this but my normal moisturizer kept me hydrated. I felt even more of a difference than I saw because so much of the deep acne I get hurts when itâ€™s not even visible, and this really cleared up the acne so much faster than normal for me and took that pain away. Highly recommend if you have hormonal acne and sensitive skin. Gifted by Murad Skincare. New Favorite!
