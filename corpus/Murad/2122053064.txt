First of all, the fact that this is skincare AND spf is amazing. Secondly, no white cast at all and my skin is glowing?! This serum changed the game for me when it comes to spf. I always hated putting on spf but this just feels like an extra step in my skincare routine and I love it so much honestly Love it
