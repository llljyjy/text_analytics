I have been using this for a full week now. I have fine lines on my forehead and can see a slight change in the appearance of them. Although it doesn’t list the amount of retinol in this it does have a quite a few hydrating and nourishing ingredients. You’re getting a lot of good ingredients in one product! It does contain fragrance and some possible skin irritants so be sure to check the ingredient list if you are sensitive. I’ve used several retinols and this by far is a gentle formula. I had no issues with drying skin, irritation or using other products at all. I also used Murads Youth Retinol Night Cream with it. I am excited to see my results a few weeks from now. I’m not sure at this time if this would replace my go to retinol but it is a great option for anyone looking for a gentle effective formula. I only took one star away for added fragrance. Gifted by Murad. gentle and effective
