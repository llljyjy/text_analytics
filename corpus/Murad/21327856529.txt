I really like that this serum is formulated without parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. My skin is definitely looking smoother and more radiant since I started using. The lightweight texture easily soaks in and is very gentle for a retinol product. I am seeing fine lines disappearing and much plumper skin. A definite must have to add to your pm skincare routine. Must have serum!
