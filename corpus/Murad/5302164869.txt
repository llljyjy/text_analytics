Murad is one of my favorite skincare brands and these new Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Masks are right on par with their high quality products! I put these eye masks on in the morning when I am doing my eye makeup and after 15 minutes my dark circles and puffiness have gone away! The ingredients firms the skin to reduce wrinkles which is great for applying under eye makeup because it doesnâ€™t crease all day and stays hydrated making you looked refreshed! I absolutely love these and I highly recommend! nan
