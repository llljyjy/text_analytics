This may have made a slight improvement to my stubborn bacne (hard to say, as I was using it alongside a salicylic acid-based body wash), but it’s hard to justify re-purchasing at this price point. I only used once a day, and got just over one month’s use out of it. The design of the bottle/sprayer is great, though (sprays upside down, stream is very consistent), but WAY too expensive for mediocre results. $60 for a month’s use…
