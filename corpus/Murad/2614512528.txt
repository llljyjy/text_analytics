Ok so I took my time to write a review and here’s what I think.  I love the amount of products you get for the price. This is not my first problem from Murad and I’ve been so happy with past experiences and thankfully this one is also great! I love it to target my specific areas of concern like crows feet and a stubborn rinkle in my forehead. This stuff is like a miracle worker I love it! I’d definitely recommend for you to try it out!
