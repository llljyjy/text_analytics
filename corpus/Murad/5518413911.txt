I have been loving this retinol serum so far since it did not irritates my sensitive skin but I love how super light on my skin. I also like to mention the pump being it so easy dispensing. For the past 3weeks, I have seen my skin is now more radiant and plump! I will continuously use this product and will definitely repurchase once out. Great retinol serum!
