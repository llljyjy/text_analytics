The lotion is sheer and easy to apply and smells like a summer day when you would run to the ice cream truck to grab a Creamsicle. My Thoughts:  This is such a great product. I adore the Murad range so I was very excited  to try this. I always use a high SPF as Iâ€™ve got hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage. This moisturizer with SPF is so quick and easy to apply and I love that I have all my skincare requirements in one bottle.The texture is light, easily absorbed and gives me a good level of moisture throughout the day. I think this product works for most skin types but I highly recommend it if you have dry skin like me. nan
