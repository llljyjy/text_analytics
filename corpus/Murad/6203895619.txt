I have some hormonal breakouts that have been giving me a hard time. This treatment I was gifted by Murad Skincare is on the gentle side. It has a nice texture that is not too runny or thin. It makes it easy to apply specifically on my areas of concern. I heard complaints about peeling, I myself use this product at night or whenever I won’t wear makeup or anything on top. I don’t even apply moisturizer after or before, just this. It leaves a cooling sensation on me wherever I apply it. This could be good to calm the skin. I even thought it was not drying down because it felt almost wet-like. It does help to reduce inflammation and to calm the skin, but so far I haven’t seen a significant change in my amount of breakouts. The redness has subsided too, a little. I’ll continue using it. As it is more gentle on me I can use it up to 3 times a day with no problem as directed. Calmed my redness and inflammation
