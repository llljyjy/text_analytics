TBH I was looking for the PTR version in store during the sale and was sold this instead by a Murad employee (didn’t know that until checkout so was a little annoyed). Yes it ended up being slightly less expensive than what I was planning to spend and allegedly is higher % vitamin C but I wouldn’t buy this again. I haven’t noticed ANY smell that the other reviews mention. I’ve only used for a week and I won’t comment on any differences in skin at this time. BUT it’s so stingy/itchy for a while after application. Putting makeup on top makes it worse and I use a different product at night so I’m debating only using on no-makeup days. The tube I can tell will be annoying to break open to rescue the last of this product but I’ll do it cause it wasn’t cheap! I have dry rosy skin and live in a dry northern climate. nan
