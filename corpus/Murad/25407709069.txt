I’m usually very sensitive to sunscreen and tend to do better with mineral based sunscreen vs chemical. I decided to try this product because it has zinc oxide. It has a beautiful texture and spreads onto the skin beautifully. My skin never became blotchy or irritated after application like I’m used to with other sunscreens I’ve tried. It actually calmed down any redness I had prior to putting it on and gave me a nice glow. This product is expensive but if you have sensitive skin and have spent your money on many other sunscreens to have them fail, I’d recommend this! The size is quite small so be prepared to use only a few drops each application. Sensitive Skin FRIENDLY
