Oh my gosh my new favorite spf! I already knew Murad made some excellent spf moisturizers, but this Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 is the best of them! For reference, I have normal to dry skin and need all the extra hydration I can have. This feels so comfortable on my skin and ZERO WHITECAST! So many spfs claim they have no whitecast, but not all deliver. This one truly does and I love the liquidy texture, super easy to apply. Love this! The best!!!
