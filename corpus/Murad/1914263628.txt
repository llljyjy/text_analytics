Do not fear this retinol! It’s fairly gentle and I haven’t experienced irritation since I began using it. I apply it every other night and follow with a soothing jelly cream moisturizer (and SPF the next morning), and my skin feels so smooth when I wake up. I haven’t seen long-term effects on my fine lines yet, but I’m looking forward to seeing what happens with continued use. A great first retinol!
