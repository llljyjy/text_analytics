I’ve incorporated this product into my daily skincare routine over the last month and it’s been a game changer for me. Before this product, my skin had that uneven, micro-bumpy texture. When I wore medium to full coverage foundation, I felt that my skin texture was even more obvious that it was uneven and a little rough. A Sephora Agent suggested this product to me, they told me that after I use it my skin will “look like glass“. They weren’t kidding! My natural skin looks and feels smoother overall and dewy around my cheekbones. Now, I feel even more confidence while wearing makeup as well as when I go bare faced, it’s filter flawless. Additionally, because this product has salicylic acid in it my occasional acne is well managed. To this day, I have guests at the restaurant I work for compliment my skin [without foundation] and ask me about my skincare routine. I tell them that this product [and few others] is the reason. I’ll recommend this product to everyone, all day, everyday. "Like Glass"
