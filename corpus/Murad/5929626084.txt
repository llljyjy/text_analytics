This was a game changer. Helped recover and heal my skin after popping a pimple. Prevented scarring and helped with cell regeneration. Made my skin dry and flakey, but paired with a good exfoliater did wonders. Game changer to my picking habits and also lightened blemishes. A little goes a long way. Mist have in my routine. nan
