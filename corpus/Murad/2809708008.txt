I love the texture of this product and how it feels on my skin! I would only use this at night because it is a retinol. It does have a fragrance, so if you’re particularly sensitive, this might not be the right product for you. On a different note, I do notice a difference! Particularly in my forehead area, I’m excited to see what happens in the long term! nan
