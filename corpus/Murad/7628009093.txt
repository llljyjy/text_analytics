I’ve used this retinol four times now and I absolutely love it. Obviously it takes time to see more visible results but I’ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone already. I have oily skin that’s very sensitive and this product is perfectly fine on my face. I specifically bought this product in hopes it’ll even my skin tone out and help with the appearance of wrinkles. I would highly recommend this to anyone! Like I said, just four time of using this and my skin feels and looks amazing. I look rejuvenated! love it
