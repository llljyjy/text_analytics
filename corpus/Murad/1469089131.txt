Double duty SPF, I love it. It has a light milky texture that absorbs quickly. It feels like a protective barrier but doesn’t  feel heavy or greasy. You could get away with skipping the moisturizer during summer months. For my dry skin, I would need moisturizer during the fall and winter. I’m definitely reaching for this bottle for my morning routine. Double Duty SPF
