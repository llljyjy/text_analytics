This product was gifted by Murad Skincare for review purposes. I was so excited to try this product on the few breakouts I’ve been dealing with on and around my jaw area. I applied this at night right after I showered on clean skin. I made sure not to disturb that area with other products afterwards. For me, this product was a bit underwhelming. I absolutely love salicylic acid for my oily breakout prone skin, so it’s something I’m very comfortable using. However I feel like I have other spot treatments that preform better then this one at a way better price point. Pros are that it is lighweight and didn’t cause any irritation. Better Options
