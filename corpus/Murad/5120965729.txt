This  sunscreen serum is actually very unique. It has a thicker texture than some serums and  it’s very moisturizing. It  does come out milky white and on my  light to medium tone skin, it does not leave a white cast;  but I cannot speak for those who are a darker shade than me.I have oily skin so this wasn’t the best sunscreen for me. It left my face very dewy looking which is not a look I’m going for.  This is better for drier skin types, as it does leave your skin very moisturized, very supple with a dewy sheen. It is not sticky or greasy but it is it is shinyFor oily skin types, I recommend Murad’s Invisiblur Perfecting Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 | PA+++ better for drier skin types
