Eh. Not really a fan. I regularly have oily skin, super oily, when it’s not managed along with large pores and blackheads covering my t zone. They aren’t too noticeable except on my nose, but I notice them. I tried this twice. The first time a few weeks and didn’t really see a difference. The second time I gave it 5 weeks using it only in the AM because I was using retinol at night. I seen no results or difference in my face. I started using the Inkey List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser for a week and seen better results (even though that is drying as well) the texture of my face is better and can noticeably see the surface of my skin slightly changing. I heard great things about Murad and bought a bunch of their products, but this is one I can definitely and will live without. no
