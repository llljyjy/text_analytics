This acne treatment gifted by Murad Skincare is a nice spot treatment. I found that it helps bring the acne to the skins surface when you feel a pimple coming on. The applicator isn’t my favorite. I feel like I’m dumping it on my hand or wasting product using a q-tip. I feel like if it were in different packaging, I would feel like it deserves a higher rating, but do like that it is glass so I can recycle it nan
