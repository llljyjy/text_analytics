I get terrible cystic acne.  Once it appears it’s so hard to make it go away without a visit to the dermatologist! I’m impressed with my results after using Deep Relief Acne Treatment by Murad.  Currently have one painful breakout on my chin.  I used this for several days AM/PM.  I’ve definitely noticed less redness and the acne area irritation has subsided and shrunk.  Not as painful as well.  So for me, I’m happy with the results! Gifted by Murad Skincare Brings Relief!
