This serum soothes inflamed bumps and pimples alike. I use this overnight and during the day, but without fail my blemishes look better within a few hours. No irritation or dryness either, even when I use it with or after retinol. I appreciate that it comes in a big enough size to use in larger areas too! Great for hormonal and bacterial acne!
