I received this complimentary from Murad. I have adult acne and this is one of the most gentle salicylic acid treatments I’ve ever used. It has not dried out my skin (and I apply it generously) or caused irritation. It hasn’t cured my acne, but I think it helps speed up the healing process when one pops up. I with the packaging had a pump dispenser instead of just being an open bottle, but that’s my only critique. The most gentle salicylic treatment!
