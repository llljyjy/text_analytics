This product works great! It has a bit of a learning curve though. I had to use it for about a week to get the hang of it. I use it on my forehead and notice a huge difference. I use the white tip to apply a thin layer on clean dry skin, and the metal tip to very gently smooth it out. Then let it dry completely before using serums or face lotions. Letting it dry is key! If used correctly you will see results! Loving it so far. Make my skin look amazing
