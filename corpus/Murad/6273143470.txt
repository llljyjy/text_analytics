I received these Retinol Youth Renewal Eye pads by Dr. Zion Murad complimentary for my honest review.  I use them sparingly and just prior to going out on special occasions.  I apply these gel-like patches to my skin just under the eyes.  They do leave my skin feeling firm, well-hydrated and looking pleasantly refreshed.  I do recommend this product for a temporary boost and skin rejuvenation just under the eyes. Rejuvenating Eye Masks!
