First if I typically have loved everything I’ve tried from Murad including their other SPFs but this one is a game changer.  The serum consistency allows it to absorb quickly into the skin (I have dry skin) and works beautifully under makeup with no detectable white cast or flash back in photography.  If you haven’t tried it and the ingredients look compatible with your skin I highly recommend trying it out. Game changer
