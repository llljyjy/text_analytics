The targeted wrinkle corrector is working like magic. I didn’t expect it to work so well. It immediately smoothed out the texture and fine lines. The result is incredible, I’m speechless. I use it on specific areas of my face only and dab it with metal applicator tip. I wish I had enough for the whole body. I use it during the day time before make up. I do combine it with serum, moisturizer. I’d definitely recommend it. Works like magic
