I burn so easily out in the sun and after Hurricane Ian made landfall last Thursday in my town I used Murad’s Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 everyday for about 7 days to protect my face from the sun during clean up. I love how their was no white cast and I literally had no burning. The sunscreen lasted 8 hours! I’m impressed! I wish I found this sooner!!!
