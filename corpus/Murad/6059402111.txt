This is the one of the gentlest retinol products I’ve tried. I have been using this retinol serum for about 2 weeks (once a day) and still no irritation from the retinol. I noticed that my skin has better clarity and the texture got smoother. I’m also using it to prevent from wrinkles. I have dry sensitive skin and this retinol serum works well on my skin. I recommend this product. Gentlest Retinol Serum
