I’ve been incorporating this acne treatment into my nightly skincare routine and it seems to prevent acne breakouts. I normally will see clusters of pimples on my face, but I just apply to those problem areas and now my breakouts are minimal. It also has a cooling effect right after I apply, which feels soothing when I’m dealing with any sort of skin inflammation. I’ll continue to use this as a preventative acne treatment since that’s how I’ve seen the best results. Gifted by Mira’s Skincare nan
