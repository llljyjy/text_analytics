I’ve been using this every morning for a while now and it works beautifully! I have noticed that it starts pilling if you work it too much, but that hasn’t been much of an issue for me—I get no white cast and I don’t wear base makeup (foundation, etc.). It doesn’t break out my skin and there’s very little fragrance, if any at all. Love this!
