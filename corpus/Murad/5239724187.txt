I’ve been using this wrinkle corrector from Mira’s for two weeks now. I do like how my skin feels and looks since I began using it, but don’t see any major changes to my expression lines. I do see a slight improvement of my fine lines around my eyes. Does this product replace Botox? No, but will soften and hydrate the skin. Nice but not great
