I am OBSESSED with this serum-y SPF. In the morning, as Iâ€™m getting ready I have to apply my moisturizer, serum, and SPF (while allowing several minutes in between each application for them to absorb) before my makeup, but I love how quick and easy this product is to use, and how it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Such a time saver!
