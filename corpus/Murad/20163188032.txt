This spot treatment is exactly what my acne needed! I get larger, cystic type acne blemishes around my chin but most acne treatments dry out my already dry skin to the point of flaking. With this spot treatment, the actives are going only on the blemish itself & not irritating the skin around it. It reduces the size, redness, and painful swelling for me in just an hour or two after applying, itâ€™s so impressive! This one is definitely a must have for anyone with acne struggles! I received this complimentary from Murad Skincare. nan
