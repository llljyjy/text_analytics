This was sent to me complimentary from Murad Skincare in exchange for my review. So far I am impressed with this serum. I have applied it every other night after washing and before a heavy moisturizer and I wake up with smoother feeling skin that is slowly but surely looking brighter! I havenâ€™t experienced any irritation using this every other night. I will continue to use this and hope to see consistent results with brighter skin and less texture! A good serum for skin tone and texture
