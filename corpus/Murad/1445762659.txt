I am an SPF is my BFF, sunscreen every day kinda girl, so it’s safe to say that I’m something of an expert. I’ve tried chemical and physical, creams, lotions, and gels- but never anything like this! It’s incredibly light and absorbable, and makes reapplication a breeze.  After a full week of use, I am seeing the brightening results as well.  My dark spots are fading, and my skin is glowing! Buy this- you won’t regret it! nan
