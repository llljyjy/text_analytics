I love Murad’s Targeted Wrinkle Corrector! I’ve been using it morning and night for 7 days now. In this short period of time, I’ve noticed a huge difference on my forehead and crow’s feet wrinkles. My wrinkles look smoother and have improved. Very excited to have found a product that makes a difference on my wrinkles and will prolong the use of fillers. The applicator is a plus, helps to easily apply the product. Def recommend! Love it!!
