Targeted Wrinkle Corrector is ideal to truly diminish fine lines around the eyea and soften wrinkles on the cheekbones, mouth and forehead. It beautifully plumps skin. It is very easy to use, absorbs quickly and nicely and gives skin an overall brighter appearance. The scent is light and pleasant. The texture is slightly thick and also creamy, but it doesn’t leave a cast or residue after applying it. I love the tip that allows a precise and “waste free“ application.It is great for those with sensitive skin. I simply love this product and I highly recommend it if you want to give your skin a youthful and vibrant appearance! nan
