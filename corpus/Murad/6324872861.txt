I’ve only had a chance to use this a few times since my skin doesn’t tolerate retinol every night well. Overall this has a really nice thin texture that applies easily. It doesn’t sting when applying it or dry my skin too much overnight. I like how it’s in an airless pump so that the retinol stays stable for longer. No irritation at all on my sensitive skin but I also only use it every 4th night because I know my skin. My skin does look refreshed in the morning but I haven’t been using it long enough to see a reduction in fine lines. It seems promising though. Good packaging for a retinol
