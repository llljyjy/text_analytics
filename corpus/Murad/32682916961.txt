I was gifted the Dr. Zion x Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Masks. I really liked the size, their extra large masks cover the whole under eye area. They also stay in place, no slipping or moving around, which is a huge plus! My skin felt and looked super refreshed just after one use. A definite must have!
