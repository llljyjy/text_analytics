I have dry + sensitive skin that is reactive to a lot of chemical sunscreens, so for that reason I usually opt for mineral based ones such as this - I have tried many mineral sunscreens over the years, and have to say this is one of my favorites. It leaves zero white cast (even when applied liberally), and does not collect along my beard line as others I’ve used have done. After applying, my skin feels hydrated without feeling heavy or looking greasy, so it’s a win in my book. I’ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out.
