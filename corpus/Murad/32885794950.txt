One thing about me, I love spf but I’m picky…I don’t want something that’s gonna leave me looking white, purple or grey. And for that reason I have thoroughly enjoyed using Murad’s spf 45, it protects my skin and gives me a glow that looks great even under makeup with no grey caste. She’s a winner! A definite winner!!!
