I haven’t had much time to test this out as I received it late. The texture itself is light and feels like a water based cream. It absorbs easily and doesn’t leave any residue. It has 2 percent of salicylic acid but doesn’t sting the skin. I need time to test out this treatment but have high hopes. Lightweight and doesn’t sting
