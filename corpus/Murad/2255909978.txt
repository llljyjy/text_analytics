I received the Targeted Wrinkle Corrector complimentary from Murad Skincare. This is a really good wrinkle treatment, I start noticed a difference after using for a couple weeks.  I do have a dry skin and I can see my fine lines look smoother. I also really enjoy the applicator it feels nice and its cooling. iâ€™m going to keep using this product but so far I like it. nan
