This serum is the bomb - no peeling, no drying, despite the winter heater air. My complexion is definitely smoother and more even toned. Very easy to use, absorbs fast and doesn’t leave a greasy shine. Yet I don’t have to follow up with a moisturizer most of the time. Smaller pores and more even skin tone is what’s most noticeable for me after 3 weeks. nan
