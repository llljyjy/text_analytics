I’ve never used anything from Murad before so I was excited to try this product. I love that the texture is light and absorbs really well. I’m at the age where Retinol is needed on a daily basis so I was thrilled with how well this works. I have consistently used this for two weeks and notice my skin brighter. I can’t wait to see my results with continued use. nan
