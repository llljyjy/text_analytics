I have acne prone sensitive skin (still have acne at 31), but this product is my holy grail for acne face cleanser.   I try to use it only once a day (in the PM) as it can be drying for me to use it AM and PM - a good serum and moisturizer balance it out though.  Will continue to buy this over and over again. Acne be gone
