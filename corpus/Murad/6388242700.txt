I’ve only used this serum for about a week and I am already loving it! Haven’t seen a huge difference since it hasn’t been long, but I have noticed my skin is slightly smoother. This absorbs nicely into the skin and feels gentle, doesn’t cause any irritation or dryness and I’ve been using it every day. I am excited to continue using it in my nighttime routine! nan
