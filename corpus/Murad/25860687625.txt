I’ve purchased this serum before when I had a really dark melasma patch on my forehead. I had lost my insurance at the time and couldn’t;t afford to visit my dermataologist, so I took matter sin my own hands and looked for an OTC serum that would help lighten the dark spot. This worked so well, and in about a month the dark spot cleared up. nan
