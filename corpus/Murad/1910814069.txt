Another super cute launch from glow recipe!! The bottle is adorable and functional as well. The texture of this eye cream is very soft and gel-like and hydrates my eyes just the way I like. It’s scented, but not too strongly where it would make your eyes water. I’m excited to keep using this! Great retinol, cheap packaging
