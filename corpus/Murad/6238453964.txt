Based on a recommendation from a mature skin “beauty influencer“ I decided to try this Murad retinol serum when I ran out of my SkinCeuticals 0.5 retinol serum. There were a couple of things I did not like about this. Firstly, and most important, I do not think it works very well and/or the percentage of retinol in this is very, very low. When I have used SkinCeuticals (even the lower 0.3 version), my skin has a smooth, clean, “renewed“ like feeling in the morning after applying at night. After using the Murad, my skin didn’t notice any changes or improvement or anything like the SkinCeuticals retinol does. For a product that is this expensive, that is unacceptable! Secondly, the product has a light scent to it. I have sensitive skin so I absolutely hate for my skincare products to have added fragrances.  Please save your money and buy a better retinol product. Not a great retinol product compared to others
