At first I wasnt sure about this sunscreen. Going on it felt very greasy and oily and it didnt sink into my skin right away so I thought I really wasnt going to like it. However after about 5 minutes it sank into my skin and I didnt feel oily anymore so Iâ€™m going to keep using it because theres no bad smell, the texture is okay, and in the end it does feel hydrating. Oily at first
