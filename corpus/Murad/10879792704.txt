love the feeling that the eye patches gave to my under eye area. they are made from biocellulose which adhere better on the skin. i assume the retinol is quite gentle in these patches that my under eyes were feeling hydrated, not irritated. the con that i found is that these patches come in a single use packet with a few films on them. nice on the skin, wasteful packaging
