Having under the skin acne absolutely sucks, no matter what. But this product makes it a lot easier to deal with because as soon I feel something happening, you know that super tight, painful feeling? I get mine especially around my chin and mouth and oh my gosh it hurts to eat or talk! But this product, helps to get that acne to not only rise the surface faster but helps minimize the pimple and the pain! It’s crazy good stuff and while it may have been complimentary from Murad Skincare, it’s definitely going to be a staple in my skincare collection! Excellent Product!!
