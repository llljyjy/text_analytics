Murad Skincare gifted me this product and I’m obsessed! I hardly ever use retinol because I just always hated the ones I’ve tried, but then this came along and I’m sold. The beautiful creamy lightweight formula sunk into my skin effortlessly and caused no irritation like stinging or flaking, this actually got rid of my flaking dehydration skin. My skin was looking so dull and I tried all the exfoliating and hydrating serums nothing seemed to work, then I decided to try adding this retinol and I kid you not the first morning after I noticed how radiant my face looked, it didn’t dry out right away and the flakiness was not so much! This is now a staple and it’s never leaving my stash! 10/10 A must have in my routine!
