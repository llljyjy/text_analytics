Itâ€™s the first time I am trying the Murad brand. I heard so many people talking about it and recommending it to me. This retinol is fantastic and game-changing. Someone can feel it is expensive, but it is worth it! My skin looks great, and it does help remove the dark spot and acne on the face. I notice some of my lines under the eye bag have faded, and my skin feels very soft and smooth after it.  I love this serum, and now I recommend it to others. Best retinol ever tried
