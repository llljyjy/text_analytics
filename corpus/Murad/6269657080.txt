I really loved using this! First of all, I appreciate the shape of the eye masks. I usually struggle with putting on other eye masks, but the large size of these made it so easy to reach everywhere I wanted. After usage, I did find that the area around my eyes felt more plump, so the appearance of my crows feet were diminished. The only thing is that these are pretty pricy, especially for recommended usage of 2-3 times a week. I would probably just use these ahead of special occasions! Love them!
