The texture of this spf serum is so unique, I am a big sunscreen gal and this is the only spf I have used in serum form that is a physical barrier and not chemical.  The formula is really great as a base for makeup, and it has reduced some of the dryness and clumping I get a few hours into my makeup wear.  I also wear it alone and find that it is hydrating enough that my skin doesn’t need to follow it with a separate moisturizer.  I really like the applicator because it gives me the accuracy to apply the serum a drop or two at a time, so I don’t waste any product, and a little goes a long way.  I’m hopeful that with long term use I will also reap some of the corrective benefits of the serum formula as well. Very hydrating
