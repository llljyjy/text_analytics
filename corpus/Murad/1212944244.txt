While I donâ€™t have much in the way of fine lines, I have a very expressive face and wanted to try this product to see how it helped reduce the appearance of expression lines that tend to crop up throughout the day for me. I found this treatment to be quite hydrating and it did seem to plump up my skin a bit and help my skin bounce back more quickly from expressions and my expression lines seem to go away more quickly when using this product. It has a nice lightweight and smooth texture to it that spreads easily on my skin leaving it feeling and looking more hydrated and dewy. nan
