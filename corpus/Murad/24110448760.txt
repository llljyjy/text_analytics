Retinol Youth Renewal Serum by Murad cosmetics is absolutely amazing. I been using it for a week now and i can see a huge difference in my skin. It supposed to be good for all types of skin. I’ve dry skin and ever since i have started using this serum, it’s already feeling so hydrated; as well as my skin is looking so firm and smooth. My skin feels soft. It also has a beautiful glow, which im loving!! It also helps minimize wrinkles. This serum is a game changer. It smells so good, alsoW Love the packaging. Im using this product once a day, only night time after I’m cleansing my face, before using moisturizer. Im so happy to use this product. This product is little pricey but i think its it’s worth the benefits im getting from it. Im definitely buying it again in future. Awesome Product
