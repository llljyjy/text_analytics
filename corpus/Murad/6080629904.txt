No white cast! I am:-medium skin tone-south Asian -sensitive skin-oily skin I only use mineral sunscreens due to chemical sunscreens burning my face. Most tinted mineral sunscreens still leave white cast on me like Murad City Skin (which I love). Or they are too thick or foundationy. Thick stuff on my face will break me out. I’m glad I found this. It is a watery serum that hasn’t broken me out yet. After applying, when I touch my face, it feels bouncy and hydrated. The finish is oily, but I don’t care since it is lightweight and doesn’t leave any cast. After 8hr work day my skin looks like my regular oily skin. I highly recommend if you’re like me and looking for the same things. 10/10 Have attached pics to show how dewy/oily the finish is. NO WHITE CAST, I AM BROWN SKINNED!!
