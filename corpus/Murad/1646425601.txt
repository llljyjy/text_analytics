This serum has a creamy consistency and a really unique applicator. It uses peptides and hyaluronic acid to plump up the skin and minimize the look of lines and wrinkles. After just the first use I noticed results, and after using this treatment morning and night for the last few weeks I truly have noticed a decrease in my forehead lines. I feel like it helps my makeup apply/wear better as well. Itâ€™s definitely expensive, but you really will see results! Wrinkle Warrior!
