This is a liquid/serum type of SPF, which I don’t typically gravitate towards. However, I fell in love with it very quickly. It feels very light weight on the skin and does not leave a white cast on me personally. The scent is not strong and I find it leaves me with a dewy finish, yet not oily. My only complaint about this sunscreen is that since it is a liquid/serum format, it’s hard for me to find how much I need to apply - I always follow the “two finger” method for sunscreen application, so this being runnier makes it more difficult. Besides that, I love this SPF and highly recommend. A great SPF!
