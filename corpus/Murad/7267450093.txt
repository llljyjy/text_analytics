Surprisingly, it works!Full disclosure, this item was gifted to me in exchange for an honest review, but I genuinely do like it. I’m in my early 30’s, so any fine lines I do have are not that deep. That being said, they are there, especially my forehead eleven lines. After about two weeks of consistent use, I have noticed that my skin is significantly more hydrated, therefore making my fine lines less visible. I can’t speak to the effectiveness with super deep lines, but I would imagine it would help soften their appearance. I would highly suggest for anyone looking to reduce their fine lines. nan
