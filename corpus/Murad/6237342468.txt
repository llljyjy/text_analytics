Tried the mini then eventually got the full sized. It’s worth every penny! You only need to use this once a week then work your way up to a few times a week. I’ve been using the same bottle since October and it still seems to have a lot of product! Definitely seen an improvement in my skin. Also helps with any pimples that pop up - put this before sleeping and the pimple is definitely smaller the next morning! nan
