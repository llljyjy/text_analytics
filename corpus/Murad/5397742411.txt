I’ve loved every product I’ve ever tried from Murad, and thankfully, this one is no exception! I’ve tried my fair share of acne treatments over the years, but this one takes the cake. It’s a salicylic acid treatment that helps clear and heal deep acne, and I’d definitely recommend this for anyone struggling with problematic skin. This was gifted by Murad Skincare. nan
