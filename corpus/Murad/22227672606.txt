This product sinks in really quickly and feels super lightweight on the skin. I like that itâ€™s a serum and sunscreen in one. It takes two droppers to cover my whole face and neck, so I can see myself going through this quickly. Unfortunately, it leaves a tiny white cast in my medium skin, but overall I like the product. Good but leaves a white cast
