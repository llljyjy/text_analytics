I received this wrinkle corrector free from Octoly and Murad for my opinion. I love Murad products and this did not disappoint! The texture is thin and spreads out evenly. The metal applicator tip is great for cooling around the eyes and face. It helps with puffiness. The product actually works instantly! It disguises lines and wrinkles you apply it to. It does stay tacky and doesnâ€™t completely dry down. Make sure you wait to apply any other products. Stays Tacky
