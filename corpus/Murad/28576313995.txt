I have love hate relationship with acne treatments bc my skin is so sensitive. Itâ€™s either make my acne more inflamed or make it more difficult to treat. This one is def a good option if you are like me. Overnight my blind pimple went from extremely big and inflamed to noticeable less inflamed. With continued use (4days), my pimple is completely flat and almost healed. If your skin likes salicylic acid, this is worth the try! Must try if your skin loves salicylic acid!
