I have used 2 sample sizes and I am 52 with acne scars from when I was younger. Occasionally, I also get hormonal acne as I am on hormone therapy. What I have found so far is that itâ€™s best to mildly exfoliate when applying. When applying to my nose pores, I really give it a scrub. I find that in a short period of time, I am seeing improvements. Both with my mild scarring & acne, I am purchasing the 1 oz size and excited to see the results with longer use. Works for my mild scarring & acne!
