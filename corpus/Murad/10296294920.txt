I have oily skin and my acne is TERRIBLE during the summer. Iâ€™ve tried Murad products before and they were just ok. In the past , salicylic acid has been a hit or miss with my skin. First time trying this out I applied it on a horrible zit on my t zone, woke up the next morning and it looked a lot smaller than the day before! * gifted by Murad * nan
