I’ve started to introduce this slowly into my night time routine and I’m starting to see a slight difference in my fine lines! Because I use this intermittently and I’m easing into my routine it hasn’t irritated my skin like typical retinol do. I love Murad retinol, love that it comes in a concentrated eye formula! nan
