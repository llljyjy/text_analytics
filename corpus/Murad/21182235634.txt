Overall great product! I only tried it once, so I canâ€™t tell the long term effect on you under eye area but I can say that after only one use it made my skin hydrated. The size of the patches in ny opinion are bigger than other brands so I think helps reduce the puffiness faster since it covers bigger area. Overall, my under eye area was very moisturized and probably in long term will help reduce the visibility of the fine lines. nan
