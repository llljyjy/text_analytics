Too many retinol products don’t work for me because they irritate my skin, so I start off using very little and slowly increase how much I use and how often, which is why I am super impressed with this retinol serum! It doesn’t sting, irritate, or dry my skin! Currently I’m using it 2-3 times a week and I wake up with my skin looking smoother and more even! It has a light, fresh scent and I love that it comes in a pump. Gentle and effective!
