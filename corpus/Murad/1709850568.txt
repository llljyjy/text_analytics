I really like this Murad serum.  It is a drip bottle which makes it easy to use and helps knowing how much you need to apply.  It’s a creamy white color and on the thicker side of being a serum, with that being said it glides on easily and feels smooth leaving an almost velvet sheen on your skin.  However it doesn’t feel filmy, or sticky or heavy.  After applying I don’t even realize it’s there with exception of my face feeling soft and hydrated.  I definitely recommend. A must have for any skin type!
