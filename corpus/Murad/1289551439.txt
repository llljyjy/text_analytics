I get hormonal acne and thereâ€™s nothing worse than a big, painful zit. The Murad Deep Relief Acne Treatments works quickly and effectively! I applied it to the zit in the evening and it dried it out well. I like the sleek, recycles or glass packaging. I just stick a cotton swab into the formula and apply it as a spot treatment directly to the zit. Within 2 days it was gone! Quick & effective!
