I have very sensitive skin and normally only get small breakouts(but often frequent ones). I was looking for a cleanser that would help regulate these breakouts and help me keep my clearer skin for longer. This is a really nice cleanser that is gentle but also works really well to get rid of smaller bumps or pimples within a couple uses. While the smell is quite strong(kind of like a minty/alcohol-y smell?) and takes some time to get used to, after use my skin feels very refreshed and smooth. One of the best cleansers I have tried for acne so far. This is a must-have for acne-prone skin
