It did help to clear my acne at one point but after using it for a month or so it started breaking me out. I didn’t realize this could break me out too because it’s supposed to help clearing acne. As soon as I stopped using it , my acne started healing. if you are having breakouts while using it, please try eliminating it from your routine and see if skin is improving. It worked but not for long
