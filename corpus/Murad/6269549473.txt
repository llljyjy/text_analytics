I have been pretty happy with the use of this Retinol serum by Murad. I have been a big fan of Murad in the past, but never used a Retinol product before, so I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. My skin seems to get a little irritated if I use it more than once a week, but overall, the texture is much smoother. I like it!
