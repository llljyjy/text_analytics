Is not easy to find a good SPF 45 sunscreen and I was so happy when I got this one. The texture is very light and literally melts into the skin without any white residue. It gives a very nice glow to my skin, makes it soft and the scent is very mild  and almost undetectable.  Also wears great under makeup or mixed with my foundation.  Works excellent and I love using it. MUST HAVE SPF45
