It’s difficult to find an eye mask that doesn’t migrate all over your face. This baby grips like a dream! I saw some instant hydration and had a slight cooling effect. The instructions are a little too simple on the package and you have to go to the website to find out which side is which, and that was a little annoying. They are very pricey as well, and with only 5 sets in a package. They feel really great overall and cover a large area outside of the under eye as well. Great if you have the extra money! Pricey but Nicey!
