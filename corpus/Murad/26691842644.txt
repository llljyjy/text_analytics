On the first time use you will see instant blurring effect on your fine lines, I mean the line between my eyebrows and the line on the corner of my lower lip looks blurry after applying this product.. But I know it still there, its not magic that it will be gone for the first and second use.. Been using this for 9 days now, morning and evening.. The line between my eyebrows still here just fade a little and the line on the corner of my lower lip.. Surprisingly It works better on my neck.. I have bigger and longer lines on my neck and chest and also getting deeper but now it looks smoother and some almost fading though you can still the marks that I had there but way better.. I look older bcoz of the lines on my neck and chest before, but now they cant tell.. Im turning 41 this year 2022.. lines on my neck and chest looks smoother!
