I had never used a product like this before, but it’s SO COOL! It is a “special use” product, and when they say targeted, they mean targeted: you actually apply the cream directly to any wrinkles you have, pat it in, and it helps plump up the wrinkles to make your skin look instantly smoother, similar to what I imagine botox or filler injections would do. And it actually works! I used it on the lines on my forehead which are quite deep, and it made them markedly better. I also used it on the lines under my eyes and around my mouth and it really helped plump those areas so my face looked brighter and younger and helped it looked great under make up. I even had my older sister try it and she saw results too, so I know I wasn’t imagining it! This isn’t something I’d use every day probably, but for days I wear makeup or for special occasions (and really, these days, any day I’m going to see another human is a special occasion, haha), it’s wonderful. Like an instant botox injection!
