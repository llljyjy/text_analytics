As we get older, I’m more focused on what products I put on my skin and retinol has been a major key item. I was excited to try these retinol eye masks since the eye area is where I want to focus on skin the skin is more delicate. Upon application, the eye mask feels cooling and the jelly texture makes it easy to apply onto the skin. It stays on well and keeps the area hydrated - such a luxurious feeling. This is the definitely one of the better eye mask that I’ve tried. Great for a self care night! nan
