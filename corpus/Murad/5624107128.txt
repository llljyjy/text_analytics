I first tried this product as a sample with a purchase and found that it helped with texture. I have been dealing with acne over the pandemic due to masks, and so this was a relief. However,  once I purchased the full product I found a discrepancy in the consistency, texture, and smell of the sample formula and the actual full size product formula. I hesitantly tried the actual full size product and found it to be more granular with a distinct scent. Unlike the sample, this did not help my skin. I will be returning the product. Actual product quality different than sample
