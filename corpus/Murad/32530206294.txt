murad products are good & true to what they say. this retinol product definitely makes a difference in my skincare with honest ingredients, truly renewing, and they dont promote things on their products that arenâ€™t real. this came recommended by a dermatologist and so i was excited tot ry and feel like its definitely worth it! love!
