The extra large eye mask are very hydrating.  I have really enjoyed using these eye masks.  They can be a bit tricky to get apart, I would have preferred them to be already separated in their own separate compartment.  That is the only complaint.  I love how large they are and how much serum is on each patch. Very hydrating eye mask
