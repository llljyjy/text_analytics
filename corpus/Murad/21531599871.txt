I love the finish of this sunscreen. Unlike other mineral sunscreens that feel chalky and drying, this one doesn’t feel that way. It is easy to spread and doesn’t leave a noticeable white cast. I wish it was in a tube packaging so it’s more convenient though. Despite this, I really like the formula. nan
