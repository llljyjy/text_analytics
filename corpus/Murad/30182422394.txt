Just used up a full size of this product. I had only used it 2 times per week, so I felt the bottle lasted me a long time. I’d say it did well at exfoliating, but it also wasn’t too harsh (for reference, I have dry to balanced skin with dullness concerns). I can’t say I saw drastic changes, but overtime my skin was less congested. I would recommend honestly. I did enjoy the cleanser. Effective and not too harsh
