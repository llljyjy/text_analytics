I’m in my mid thirties and I have some fine lines around my eyes. This does a good job blurring out the more superficial lines. Doesn’t do much for deeper wrinkles. I like the way this product feels and the applicator tip helps soothe the area as well. Overall it’s a nice product, but not a miracle worker nan
