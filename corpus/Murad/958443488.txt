This is my first time trying an eye mask and I think I like it! The retinol didn’t seem to be too drying, which was a concern I had. I like the convenience and the “spa“ feeling when I used these. I think for a retinol and moisture boost these work well. They were easy to apply and have a good amount of product on them so don’t dry out fast. nan
