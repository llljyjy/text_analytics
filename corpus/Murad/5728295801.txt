I received this product complimentary from Murad to try out and give my honest review. I’m a huge retinol fan and have used so many different kinds from tretinoin from the dermatologist, to differin from the drugstore, the sunday riley A+ one, and even more. I have reactive type skin that’s pretty dry, but at this point I’m pretty used to retinol so don’t really experience skin flaking or irritation like some other newer users may experience. The Murad one is really nice! I like to use it after I shower before bed and whenever I wake up in the morning my skin just feels smoother! Retinol is one of the only ingredients I feel helps my acne as well. I’ve tried hundreds of salicylic acid type of products, but I feel retinol is the only thing that has actually made somewhat of a difference in my acne. Solid Retinol!
