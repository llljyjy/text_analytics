I got the mini size of this to try, and I actually love it! Its gentle enough to use daily, but strong enough that I actually notice a difference. I have pale skin, so any blemishes typically leave a red mark, and I have found this really evens out my skin tone and fades marks. Will be purchasing the full size! nan
