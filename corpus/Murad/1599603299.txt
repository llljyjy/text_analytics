I received this complimentary from Murad Skincare. I have combination skin and often struggle with stubborn breakouts and the occasional pimples and blemishes. This Deep Relief Acne Treatment from Murad has been a game changer for me. I put a little dot on any blemishes I have before bed and by the morning they are also significantly better and heal much quicker than without it.  It also discourages new breakouts from appearing by targeting irritation-causing bacteria, hydrating, soothing, and visibly reduce the redness. It also makes me fell good that it is free of parabens, formaldehydes, phthalates, mineral oil, oxybenzone, and is also gluten-free and cruelty-free. Breakout Banisher!!
