Omg I love this SPF especially that I wanted to use it before putting my makeup so I didnâ€™t want like using most SPFs because it makes my makeup cakey and they would not mix well with my foundation. Overall I love how well It mixes with my foundation and it has amazing protection from the sun! nan
