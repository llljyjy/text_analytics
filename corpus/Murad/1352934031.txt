Murad - Correct & Protect Serum Broad Spectrum SPF 45 | PA++++I have been testing a lot of sunscreen over this summer. Quite impressed with this western sunscreen. It has similar qualities as the Korean sunscreen. It’s main ingredient is zinc oxide with 17% quite high for a mineral sunscreen. It is also formulated with PA++++ the highest level of protection currently available. This sunscreen feels very light weight on the skin creating a smooth barrier on the skin. I’m enjoying it so much. High quality mineral sunscreen
