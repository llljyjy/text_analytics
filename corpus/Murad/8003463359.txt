This is an excellent retinol serum! It absorbs quickly and does not seem to cause any irritation. It’s difficult to estimate the percentage of retinoid ingredients within here, but I will say that the addition of ingredients that boost effectiveness might give this product an edge compared to other retinols on the market. I will also add that I strongly believe retinols need around 6 weeks to work, and that purging CAN happen with them. I did not personally experience this with Murad’s product, but perhaps that is as a result of being adapted to retinoids already.Ultimately, I’d say it is worth trying. nan
