Murad gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.I’ve been using Murad products for almost 20 years so I was excited to add the Targeted Wrinkle Corrector to my routine. I am 41 with combo skin, concerned with the lines around my eyes, the 11s and also smile/frown lines. This super gentle serum is packed with peptides, hyaluronic acid and squalane and works like magic to hydrate and temporarily plump up the skin. I love the cooling touch of the silver applicator tip as I tap the product into place. Keyword here is gently TAP not rub.While the Wrinkle Corrector cannot permanently remove wrinkles and fine lines, I’ll def be reaching for this to proudly zhuzh up my wise lines for the day.
