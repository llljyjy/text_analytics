This product is exactly what I was looking for - I don’t get persistent acne, but I do get whiteheads and blemishes from time to time. I like to have something on hand to use as spot treatment for when this happens. The texture of this is thicker than I was anticipating. I was able to pour a little from the bottle onto a qtip without spilling. Also, it’s clear! After using, the next day my blemishes were practically gone. I’m thrilled with the results and am happy to have this on hand. This was gifted by Murad Skincare. Exactly what I was looking for.
