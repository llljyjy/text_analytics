I was gifted by Murad Skincare in exchange for my honest review! If you have stubborn acne and blemishes, you know that they aren’t easy to get rid of. Blemishes can be painful, itchy, red, or inflamed—and they can last for weeks!But, thank goodness the Murad Deep Relief Acne Treatment spot treatment was designed to treat acne and blemishes on the spot. It’s formulated with salicylic acid (2%), amino acids, and natural phytosteroids. Together, these ingredients target breakouts and prevent new acne from appearing by addressing irritation-causing bacteria and hydrating the skin. They also soothe and reduce redness caused by inflammation. This spot treatment does an incredible job at clearing out breakouts, reducing redness, soothing discomfort, and visibly improving the complexion. I highly recommend it! Best of all, this product is free of parabens, formaldehydes, phthalates, mineral oil, oxybenzone, and sulfates SLS & SLES. It is also gluten-free and cruelty-free! The best acne treatment
