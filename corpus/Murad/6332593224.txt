I tried this product on two different types of breakouts. Regular pimples and hormonal breakouts before and during my period. I found that it helps the hormonal breakouts a lot more than it does for regular breakouts as it did nothing for my occasional pimples. This is a great and promising product! gifted by Murad Skincare* nan
