These patches work well for me. The best part is that they are thinner than most other brands I have tried, so they stick better and stay where I put them - I can sit or stand with them on and they donâ€™t slide down like others would. This made the whole difference for me, as you can easily use it while getting ready for example. The skin feels soft long after applying these. nan
