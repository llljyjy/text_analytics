Love this product so much! I use it everyday under my eyes because it’s the biggest concern when it comes to wrinkles (I laugh a lot so crows feet and under eye lines are very prominent). I’ve been using this product everyday for the past month and a half and I’ve seen an improvement on the wrinkles under my eyes. The crows feet and lines are still there but they have decreased in prominence! I finally have less visible lines (though I still wish this product made miracles and erased them completely), but I’m happy with at least them being less visible! Life Changing!
