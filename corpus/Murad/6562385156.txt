Always wanted to try this retinol serum. I’m in my 40s and my skin needs some targeted treatment serums to target the fine lines and wrinkles. This seemed to fit, nice ingredients. The only thing I dislike is the scent but otherwise I have been able to use this every night with no irritation, skin is doing well so far. Can’t wait to see the long term results Nice addition to my pm routine
