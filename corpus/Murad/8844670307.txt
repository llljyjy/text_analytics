This single-handedly saved me from “backne”.  I started getting backne over a year ago, I think due to peri menopause. It was awful - I’ve never experienced anything like it. Nothing was working. I started using this + their acne body scrub. I was religious about using them daily and after 2 bottles/tubes of each, I’m SO relieved and happy to say it’s disappeared. There was never any redness or dryness whatsoever. This will always be my go-to and I’m beyond grateful I tried it. It. Works.
