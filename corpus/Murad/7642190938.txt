My all-time favorite sunscreen is City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ by Murad as well, so I was very excited about the new PA++++ sunscreen product by the brand. Well, it’s a pretty darn good sunscreen: it’s mineral, has no scent and doesn’t irritate my skin. Compared to SPF50, this one is more lightweight and is less moisturizing. It doesn’t dry out my skin or anything, but it feels a lot less heavy. Another difference is the amount of product you’re getting for the same price, this one has 30ml compared to 50ml of the SPF50, something to take note of. But all in all, this is an amazing product and it apparently costs the company a lot of money to get the PA++++ rating (=Extremely High UVA protection) in the US, hence the higher price tag, but for me Murad’s PA++++ sunscreens are absolutely worth it. Another great PA++++ sunscreen from Murad
