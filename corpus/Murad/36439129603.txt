I was gifted a pair of the Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Masks, was super exicted to add this into my skincare routine as I love retinol. I think it worked well, and my skin felt good and looked better than the previous night, and I do think this would require long term usage for better results. Due to the price, I personally find it expensive and wish this was available for less. All in all I’m grateful I had a chance to try this. Just to let you know, there is extra liquid that is in the packet (which I love), and the masks need to be peeled carefully. I decided to lie down so that they’d remain in one spot easily! Wish it was priced for less because I love it!
