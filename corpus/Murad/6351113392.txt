I love this as a spot treatment for deeper cystic acne and other pop ups and flares. I have used it consistently over a few days and noticed significant swelling to have gone down. This is one of those miracle products that actually treats the acne when nothing else seems to work. This was gifted by Murad skincare but thoughts are my own. Game changer
