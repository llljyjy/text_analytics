So far I really love the way this leaves my skin! It’s a bit too easy to go overboard on the application though and I do wish it was in a pump because of how thin the consistency is. It dries down to a nice satin matte finish. It works really well on my tzone which is where I’m oiliest. All in all I’d definitely repurchase this and keep it in my bag! Great Finish!
