Gifted by Murad Skincare: I’m pretty impressed by this product. I have sensitive combination skin and tend to get deep painful breakouts. While I wouldn’t say this product is a miracle, it has delivered better results than many other spot-treatment products I’ve tried. My only change would be to include an applicator. Pretty Impressive
