I’m in my 40s and starting to see fine lines and wrinkles. I know there’s no miracle fix but this definitely exceeded my expectations. I like the metal tip which is cooling and has a slight deluding effect. I notice the best results on my forehead lines and under my eyes. The wrinkles seem less deep. I recommend this for a special pick me up, and wakes up my tired face. nan
