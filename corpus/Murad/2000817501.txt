As I’ve gotten older I’ve gotten a lot of dark spots on my skin from many things some are acne scars, some are left from cuts ect. This has been the product I’ve seen the most improvement on my skin with. I incorporated this into my morning routine and topped in with a mild suncreen. The formula is not too thick and pairs beautiful under makeup. I noticed a difference on a few stubborn dark spots on my cheeks. This was just with a couples say use, I can’t wait to see over time. This product was gifted by Murad Skincare. Perfect addition
