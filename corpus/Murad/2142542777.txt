I started to notice that lately I have been getting acne on my face and it has been bad like my teen years- now that I am in my 30’s- I never thought I had to go out looking for an acne treatment. I love the Murad line already and this treatment is the icing on the cake- I didn’t expect this treatment to work over night and expected a week or two turn around time- but let me tell you, within three days my acne spots were gone. It was like magic had came anc leaned up those red bumps that I HATE TO SEE. During the summer months, I hate wearing foundation or concealer and want to just have my skin bare so this treatment gave me hope.  I used cotton swap and put it on the area over night, what I loved most was that it felt so light weight and I went to sleep not feeling like I had something sicky on my face. Good for 30's
