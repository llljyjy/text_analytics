My skin feels SO good after using this consistently for a week. It truly works and feels like an instant filler.  My fine lines and wrinkles get  plump and hydrated. Everything seems to smooth a but and reduce wrinkles within a day. My skin feels like it bounces back quicker than with my standard routine. It comes back from the lines I get after making my daily facial expressions, which is a ton. Iâ€™m more expressive than most, so this is saying a lot! So good for skin bounce back!
