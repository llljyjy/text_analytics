WOW! Where do I begin! I can not say enough great things about this product. From how easy it is to apply, to the soft, milky texture and the beautiful finish it leaves my skin with! Ahhh! I truly found the BEST SPF IN THE MARKET with this one. I have been CONSISTENTLY using Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 for over 5 months now, and I have spoken about it on my social media channels many times in the past, but every time I finish a new bottle, it hits me all over again! I LOVE THIS! Thank you, Murad!Ps. If you’re new to SPF and want to skip the “hunt for the best one”, I definitely recommend starting with this one from the get go. It’s SPF 45, it’s a mineral SPF that DOES NOT leave a white cast and it leaves your skin looking and feeling like a MILLION BUCKS! Thank me layer ;-) RUN TO BUY IT, DON’T WALK !
