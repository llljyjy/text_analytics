Great for beginners who are interested in retinol. I am in my late 20s -oily & acne prone. It never dried out my face. I use a gentle cleanser (Fresh) & hydrating toner (FAB). I also put hyaluronic acid (Neutrogena Hydroboost) at the end and on my neck. Donâ€™t mix this with any AHA/BHA or Vitamin C; and Benzoyl Peroxide will cancel out the retinol. Do research, stay consistent. My wrinkles, melasma, fine lines, and dark spots are fading. I feel like my acne is going away and my pores are minimizing but I am also using other products mentioned. I found results within a week and it keeps getting better. Great for beginners wanting to try retinol
