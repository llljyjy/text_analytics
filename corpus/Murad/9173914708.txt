Where has this product been my adult life? I feel like this bears repeating- much like the other reviewers, I don’t leave reviews. And when I took a chance on this product during the last Sephora sale, there were no reviews to go off of. (I’ve been using Murad products for 7 years now, so I went off my faith in the brand). So I wanted to add to the few reviews so far to basically agree with everyone here. Like others, I am a woman of color with tan to deep skin (I am of South Asian origin.) And the first and best thing is that this product leaves NO cast whatsoever, true to its word. I also have combination skin (which has been a mess with COVID and masking as a healthcare worker)- this product has not led to any breakouts or clogging after I started using it. Also, there’s no oily film whatsoever (despite it being a sunscreen and despite me having temperamental skin), including after I go outside. I can’t speak to this being drying, because I use it as the last step of a 7 step regimen- but it’s lightweight and sits nicely on top of my other products. To that point, I love the serum consistency- it’s more fluid that traditional SPF products, which makes it easier to spread/pat on my face after moisturizing.  if you’re struggling to find a good sunscreen (and aren’t limited by the price point), I highly recommend this product! This is a Fantastic Mineral Sunscreen
