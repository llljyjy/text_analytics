I try to use this twice a day, been using it around 3 weeks, I don’t have very deep wrinkles, mostly some light 11s and some lines on my forehead.  I can’t see i see dramatic difference. when i use it , it does seem to fill them and improves the appearance but not sure about them really going away.  Im not sure if this was worth the money i spent for it. nan
