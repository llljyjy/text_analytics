Gifted by Murad Skincare, their retinol youth renewal serum has been great thus far. My skin feels more firm with less wrinkles on my neck and smoother forehead after 1 week and a half of use. I also like the light feel although it can get sticky when using with my moisturizer. Trying to figure out a better combo with my other products but it’s promising as far as results so far. 4/5 because I would’ve liked it to blend better with other products. nan
