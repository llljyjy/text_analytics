Must have for zits. Iâ€™ve been using this for about two or three years now and honestly I own two and always have one on me in my bag. Whenever I have a zit pop up, especially when PMS-ing, I find that it either brings all the bacteria forward to pop sooner or that it lessens the redness and height of the zit within a few hours. Definitely recommend for those immediate spots. nan
