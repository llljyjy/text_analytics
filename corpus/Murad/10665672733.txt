I really like this serum, I like to layer products and this mixes very well with others. It absorbs into my skin and doesn’t leave my skin sticky like other serums. I also apply a little bit with my ring finger around my eye and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes. I will continue to use and finish it to see what results I get. So far I’m really enjoying it. My skin looks so hydrated and plumped in the morning. Skin looks so plumped and hydrated
