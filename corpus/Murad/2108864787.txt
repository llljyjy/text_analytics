I have cystic acne that normally takes at minimum a month to go away, sometimes longer. The acne I have is deep and Iâ€™ve only found one product, besides this one that actually did something.This is a new holy grail for me. It took care of my Acne in about 2 weeks, my mind was blown. I will continue to buy and recommend this product. Just make sure you use sunscreen with it during the day!! If you have cystic acne or find nothing has worked for your acne, try this. A game changer for those with cystic acne
