Being in my mid to late 20s now I realize the importance of incorporating retinol in my skincare routine. I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to try out this serum because I’ve had problems in the past with rational products burning my skin. I’ve had positive luck with Murad in the past and this serum is no exception - I LOVE this stuff! I know it says on the product to apply moisturizer after, however I apply it before and put this on top and I love the results I get from it! In the morning my skin feel more soft and supple, and I know some reviews don’t like the scent however I find it super refreshing! It is a little pricey, but if you have sensitive skin like me I think it’s worth trying out! Works great on sensitive skin!
