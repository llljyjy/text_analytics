I’ve been struggling with large painful pimples on my chin and jawline for years. I used the more concentrated version but it would run out quite quickly. A Sephora employee recommended this and i haven’t looked back. I use it daily and one bottle lasts me about a month or more. My only con is the price. I swear it’s gotten more expensive over the past half year. Holy Grail For Clear Skin
