I had this sitting in my cart for a while and broke down to get it since my crows feet have been much more prominent combating dry skin this winter. Do I think it works? Definitely see a small difference and notice results fast I have been using it religiously. Huge downside, not great to put make up over. This has become night routine only which I’m a little bummed. Your make up with cake/clump up quick and this formula takes a long time to soak in. Steep price and feel like I’m moving through it quickly since the bottle is very small!! Great product // Nighttime formula
