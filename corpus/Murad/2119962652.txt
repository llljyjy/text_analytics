This is my new #1 serum.  First of all, it’s soothing to apply and feels very cool on my skin.  I haven’t experienced any redness or irritation and I’ve been using this twice daily on my face, neck, and decollate.  Several other serum rub off after I apply a moisturizer or sunscreen on top and this one doesn’t have that problem.  It’s absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  i haven’t used it long enough to observe a change in skin texture but I’ll post a follow up.  So far, I’m really pleased with this product and I read all the review before I tried it. Outstanding Retinol Serum
