I have dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin- my skin can only tolerate mineral sunscreens but most mineral sunscreens settle white in my flaky skin and dry it out even more. This SPF is in a league of its own. When I tried it, I couldn’t believe it was mineral. It has a nice thick serum-like texture and a peachy tint and goes on invisible on my face. It dries down so it doesn’t feel greasy but it also doesn’t dry out my face after the day is over! I do also really like that it has antioxidants and a high SPF, so I actually feel protected with it. My sensitive skin didn’t have any reaction to it either, so thats a big plus. This is my absolute #1 SPF (and I’ve tried SO MANY), but it is really hard to get past the price. It is so expensive for just 50ml. When I purchased my next one, I got it from another retailer that had a discount for subscriptions and combined that with a coupon but that isn’t something I’ll be able to do long term. If this is in your budget and you don’t mind spending, GET IT. Four stars for the price, but five star product
