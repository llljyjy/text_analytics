Highly recommend these eye masks. They feel great and I notice immediate results, and continue to see improvement in my under eye area. One constructive criticism though, they are extremely difficult to peel away from each other after opening the package. This tedious process needs to be improved. My absolute favourite eye masks from another brand lay side by side between two clear plastic circles to keep them flat and separate inside the pouch. Hopefully they receive this feedback and improve the packaging. Murad, take notes.
