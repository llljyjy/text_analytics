Gifted by Murad in exchange for my honest review. The Murad Correct and Protect Broad Spectrum SPF is a skincare serum that also acts a sunscreen. It protects your skin from the sun while correcting  hyperpigmentation and discoloration. It’s a multi-task product!I love the thin milky white texture - it’s beautiful to look at! I also like that this is a mineral sunscreen that does not leave a white cast. However, I feel that this leaves my face feeling greasy with an oily sheen.  I don’t like the feeling it leaves and it is even more uncomfortable when it is very hot out. Too greasy
