Really enjoyed this on my eyes in the morning… until I went to put on makeup/the rest of my skincare. Since this is a retinol product, it’s probably intended for the evening, but I like using eye masks out of the fridge to help with depuffing. Loved this formula until I tried to put on makeup/other skincare. The product pilled underneath my makeup. nan
