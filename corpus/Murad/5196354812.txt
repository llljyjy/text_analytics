I have been using this product morning and night for the last couple of weeks.  I can’t say I’ve really noticed any significant changes in the dark spots on my face, but there is a slight change overall.  I started out with the trial size and decided to go ahead and get the regular size and keep using it as directed.  I am cautiously optimistic that I will start to see better results soon.  I’ve used other Murad products over the years and they have been AWESOME, so fingers crossed this doesn’t end up disappointing me.... Cautiously Optimistic
