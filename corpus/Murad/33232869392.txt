This is the first time I have tried a mineral sunscreen serum and I really liked it. It’s easily applied, there are no white particles left on the skin, it’s quickly absorbed and the skin is left feeling soft.I don’t like the smell very much but it doesn’t bother me either, I like its design and applicator. I really like that it hydrates and protects at the same time, without a doubt it has been one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve tried. I really like it I love it
