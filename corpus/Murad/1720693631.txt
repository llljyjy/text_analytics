What a great eye mask! I loved trying these out and they did not disappoint. They stick in place, so you’re not constantly adjusting them. They’re BIG. They cover a large space under and around the eye, which I really enjoyed. I can really tell that with longer term use these would help brighten up and hydrate my eye area. nan
