Seriously, the best mineral SPF I have used in over 20 years! I used to be in love with the older formulation of the Murad City SPF but a few years ago, they reformulated and that one became too goopy. This on the other hand is magic, blends right in to the skin, nice and light and has a barely there feel, minimal scent so easy to use! Has me using SPF every day! Please donâ€™t discontinue or change this! nan
