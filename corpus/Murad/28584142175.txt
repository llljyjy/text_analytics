I really like this product. I put it on at night with a Qtip as the last step of my skincare routine. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. It has a nice cooling sensation after you put it on. I think this will be a great product for helping my stubborn acne spots. Gifted by Murad Skincare. Love it!
