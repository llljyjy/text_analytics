These were okay - not the best not the worst. I like the shape of them a lot! It covers the entire under and outer part of my eye. I appreciate the concentrated retinol in a place I really need it. The packaging was really messy and difficult to peel apart. I feel like a lot of the product is lost when packaging is messy. In the end these made me feel refreshed after use but no more than other inexpensive products. I like them, but donâ€™t love them. nan
