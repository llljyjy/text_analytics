I was gifted youth retinol by Murad Skincare. I have used this product for about 2 weeks so I am happy to see the results it advertises. But so far, I enjoy the texture of the serum, it’s not too thick and dries well on my face. My face feels smoother and so soft! Also I have noticed it doesn’t have a funny smell and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. I definitely recommend this product!! The best serum
