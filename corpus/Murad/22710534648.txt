I’m always looking for a good sunscreen for my face and this one is good! Love it that it doesn’t leave any white cast and make my skin looks fresh and healthy. It takes a little time to settle in and eventually skin doesn’t look too oily, but I probably would only wear this if I am going pretty light on my makeup. nan
