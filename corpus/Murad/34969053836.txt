I’m a regular user of eye masks, especially in the morning because I wake up with very puffy eyes. These are unique in my collection in terms of material and shape, and treatment effect. I was afraid the retinol might be too scary to use around my eye, but these are so gentle I don’t think even someone with sensitive skin would have problems. They would be perfect to use before a special event, because as you can see from the photos, they give an immediate plumping affect and completely eradicate fine lines. I don’t know how long it takes to see results from the retinol component, but I know it’s not immediate so I’ll be continuing to try these and see what they do over the long term. Excellent for special events or photos!
