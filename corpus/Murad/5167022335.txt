I thought based on the jar packaging this would be similar to those Bi phase spot treatments (like the one Kate Somerville makes) that you dab onto your pimples, but this is more like a cream spot treatment. I don’t really understand why this didn’t come packaged in a tube and instead is in a glass jar and I need to use my own q tips to use the product, but the product itself has been working great on the hormonal acne on my chin. This was gifted by murad skincare, and I can tell this bottle will last a long time Packaging doesn’t make sense but product works
