Many retinol products make my skin irritated but not this one , complimentary from Murad. It has a lightweight texture,  absorbs nicely into my skin. I love the way my skin feels afterwards. I would highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to incorporate retinol into their routine. Iâ€™ve been using Murad products and they always deliver results. Great for sensitive skin
