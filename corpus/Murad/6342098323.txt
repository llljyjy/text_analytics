I love these Murad retinol eye patches and definitely would recommend getting! I noticed even just after one use, my eyes werenâ€™t as puffy and looked way more hydrated. I also love the size on these as it covered my eye bags and crows feet too. The retinol in them are great as those fine lines will begin to diminish! You definitely need!
