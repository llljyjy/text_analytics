Murad is by far one of my favorites brands in all Sephora. They have amazing formulations. I was using the daily clarifying peel and my skin was amazing. Now I’m trying this Retinol serum and my skin has never been better. Even though it has a powerful retinoid blend, it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I strongly recommend it! Amazing retinol choice.
