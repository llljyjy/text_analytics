I was gifted these eye masks by Murad and was excited to give them a try! I was a little worried that I might experience some irritation after use since my face can be pretty sensitive to retinol, but my eyes just felt soothed and hydrated afterwards! The fit was a bit awkward, but I just pinched them a little to fit around my eye area better. nan
