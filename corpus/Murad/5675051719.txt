These are by far the best eye patches I’ve ever tried! They are tricky, sometimes the two masks stick together when you first open that package. It’s great though because there’s still so much product after one use, and I’ll typically use the extra for the rest of my face. They feel like butter going on and leave my bags feeling so refreshed/ tightened! My favorite eye masks!!
