I got so excited receiving this Murad correct & protect Serum Broad spectrum Serum because Iâ€™ve been looking for a product that would brighten and improve my skin. I really love how lightweight and silky this product feels on my skin!! For me, I like the smell! Nothing bothering at all in my opinion. After applying I already feel my skin hydrated. I uploaded pictures and these are only 5 days apart and you can tell how it brightened and cleared my skin up! Love this product!!! 10/10! Brightened my skin immediately!!
