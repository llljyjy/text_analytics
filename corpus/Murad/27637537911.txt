Works really well! The bottle has a really easy twist off application. I usually just use a cotton swab to apply the product onto my skin. The texture of the product is thick and goopy. It leaves a cooling sensation on my face and really helps with my acne by trying up the area and reducing the sebum. Gifted by Murad skincare. Easy and great
