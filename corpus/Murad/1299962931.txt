I love Murad, so I was really excited to try this. I would definitely buy more of these. The individual packaging makes them great for travel. They felt hydrating and were comfortable to leave on for a while. My skin fest instantly hydrated and brighter. The retinol makes this a great option to see long term results also. Pricey but good
