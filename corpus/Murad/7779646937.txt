I have normal to dry skin and I like the way this sunscreen applies on. It feels lightweight and easy to blend, leaves my skin feeling soft and even-toned. Blends in my discolorations and dull areas. I feel like it’s more effective than other sunscreens I’ve tried because this one is a two-in-one innovation with spf + serum. This combination is helping brighten up my skin overall! Spf + serum in one!
