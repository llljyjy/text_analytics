I have been using Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Serum for about a week now and I am quite pleased with the results. Beginning with the packing it comes in super sleek green coloured bottle with a pump dispenser which makes the application easy and hygienic. The serum itself is light weight and super absorbent. It sinks into the skin immediately without making it look greasy. It has a pleasant fragrance which lingers on for quite some time after application. It might be a cause of concern for people sensitive to fragrances like me. I like my skin care products to be fragrance free.I definitely see noticeable results after using this. I use it at night followed by a moisturizer. My skin looks brighter and smoother which I had not experienced while using the moisturizer alone. I am slowly getting an even tone which I really excited about. Hoping to see fine lines disappear with continued usage. A must have skin care product.
