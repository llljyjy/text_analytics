I received this product a few weeks ago and have used the eye patches a few times. I am definitely impressed! I am a little picky about eye patches because I hate when they slide down your face. These do not slide down however and seem to be made of a slightly thicker material. They smell great and my eyes feel softer after use! Great no slip eye patches
