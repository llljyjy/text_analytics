This sunscreen really surprised me. As someone who loves sunscreen I normally find sunscreens to be hit or miss. This one is a hit for sure. It has a thin consistency that sinks in nicely and doesn’t leave a white cast. My skin feels hydrated and It also didn’t make me overly oily during the day. The only thing is the price, it’s quite pricey but it provides adequate protection and good benefits. Nice sunscreen!
