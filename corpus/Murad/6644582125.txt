First, I really appreciate the formula consistency. It’s not too watery but not super thick like the other acne relief products that are on the market. I normally get chin hormonal acne and the formula was able to reduce redness and some of the bumps. I def want to continue using the product to see it’s full efficacy but so far it’s great. Def recommend! Great New Acne Product!
