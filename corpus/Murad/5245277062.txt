I have finally figured this product out! At first I was trying to use it in the mornings, but last week I randomly rediscovered it in my bag and put it on at night. The next day I woke up and was blown away. My bunny lines between my eyes were smoothed to the point where I was startled, lol. This product is way better for me to use at night so I donâ€™t have to worry about layering it under makeup. And the best part is that it works in the long term too, as I have been using it every night. Really impressed! Best Used at Night
