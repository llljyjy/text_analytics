I’ve been using this product for about two weeks and I must say that I’ve really enjoyed it. It has a milky texture and I find that it soaks in to the skin nicely. It moisturizes the skin without being overly glowy. I find that this plays nicely on top of my makeup routine. I’ve such a fan of the skincare/spf hybrid products. nan
