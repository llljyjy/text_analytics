I had a really high hopes for this product, but it fell short for me in a few different ways. It was incredibly greasy and felt very heavy and oily on my skin, which is not what you want during hot weather. I expected it to feel lighter, even though it was a mineral sunscreen, but I could not combat the shine that came from it and putting make up or tinted moisturizer on top only made my skin feel heavier. I am not one to use a powder, but I feel like that’s the only way that I would’ve been able to make this product work grease-wise, but that’s not something that I want to cake on my face when it’s hot out. I also felt like it took a really long time to dry down. With some mineral sunscreens, it will dry down in your skin doesn’t feel *as* heavy, but this kind of felt like it just sat on top of my skin, and was never absorbed. It was also pretty hard to make sure that I was using the correct amount of sunscreen to get the protection that is listed on the bottle. Not a must have
