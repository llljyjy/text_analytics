These are really good, maybe even great, but not the best that I’ve used. They are definitely effective and I noticed immediate benefits of hydration and the softening of fine lines. However they are pretty pricey, particularly if you follow Murad’s recommendation of using them multiple times a week. While they slip less than most eye masks, they still slip a bit, which concerns me as it could be pulling a bit on the delicate eye area. Overall I am very impressed by the results and think they are worth a try. Note: the packaging is CONFUSING - definitely watch Murad’s video on how to take the mesh off so that you don’t waste this pricey product by applying it incorrectly. A- Not A+
