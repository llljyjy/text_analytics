I adore this serum. My skin has started aging a bit as I near my 40s, and while I’ve always taken a preventative approach, I find myself really focusing more on anti-aging and aging skin friendly products. It’s never really too early to start, honestly. This serum is really lovely when applied, my skin feels smooth and healthy immediately. Real results happened for me after about a week, I noticed a reduction in my fine lines, especially in my forehead which is my most problematic area. My skin has a nice healthy glow, looks hydrated and even in tone. All around a wonderful product I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend! I love this serum.
