I’ve had this product and have been using it consistantly for a little over a week and I’ve already seen results. It’s true that with good products, acne will get a little worse before it gets better and that’s definatly the case with this product. It cured the acne that was already pretty bad on the surface of the skin and is doing a great job with brining everything else up and getting rid of the noticable acne within about 2 days. I’m only going 4 stars because the scent of this product took some getting used to, and I wish more product came with a price of $50. Overall I would recommend. Pricey, but it works well
