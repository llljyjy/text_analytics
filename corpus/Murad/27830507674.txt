I received this complementary from Murad for review. Iâ€™m in my mid 30s and my main skincare concern is anti-aging. I love that this retinol youth renewal eye serum has an easy to use applicator that is mess free and deposits the perfect amount needed. The formula is very smooth and lightweight and absorbs quickly into my undereye area. My skin feels hydrated throughout the day and looks smoother. nan
