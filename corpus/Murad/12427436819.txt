This is not just a sunscreen it is beyond sunscreen. After using for a week I saw many differences on my skin. It gives glowing and there is no white cast at all. It has milky texture but is not sticky. For my combo skin it hard to I find a good product but I love this. Murad skin care is always the best and this sunscreen became my favorite. I decided to add it in my routine. The price is high but I it worth to invest on my skin. I do recommend Best sunscreen
