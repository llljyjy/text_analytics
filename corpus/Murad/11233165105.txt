These mask feel very refreshing and cooling when applied.  Sometimes I have trouble with bio-cellulose masks because they are so thin but these were easy to apply without sticking to itself.  You can apply and still do work if you want, they will not fall down.  Some extra serum was still in the pouch but not an excess. My under eye area looked brighten and moisturized when I removed the mask. Definitely going to be purchase more! Very refreshing and brightening.
