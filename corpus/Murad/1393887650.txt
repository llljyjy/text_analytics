I received this product complimentary from Murad skincare. This is a mineral-based serum sunscreen that is in the form of a serum! seriously, what a game-changer is this product! The finish is sheer and slightly dewy. It doesn’t leave a white cast and is not greasy. The texture itself feels like a slightly more watery lotion that’s easy to spread. nan
