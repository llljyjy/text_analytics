This product was a must try for me I love retinol and couldnâ€™t wait to try this serum. So far I dislike the smell. I would also be cautious if you have dry skin make sure to apply this at nights hydrate plenty and use it only two to three times a week. I will have to keep on trying it but im not sure its worth the price. nan
