I got this product complimentary from Murad in exchange for my honest opinion and they definitely did not disappoint! I was a little skeptical about an eye mask that contains retinol and had low expectations but these made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my under eyes. I left these on for the recommended amount of time and noticed that I had much less puffiness and looked much more awake, refreshed and rested (despite the fact that I definitely was not!). These actually work!
