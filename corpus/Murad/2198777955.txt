I love the cooling sensation of these eye masks, it’s incredibly soothing. Plus they decreased puffiness and made me look alert after a long night of no sleep. I do feel there may be a quality control issue though as my masks weren’t the same size. One was substantially thicker than the other. However, the results after wear was great. nan
