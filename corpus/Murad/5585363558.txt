I am sensitive to retinol and the few times Iâ€™ve used this, my skin has responded well!! I am kind of self conscious about my forehead lines and after one use of this they were less noticeable. On nights that I use this, I wake up with even, glowing, skin. The texture and smell is pleasant and it absorbs quickly. nan
