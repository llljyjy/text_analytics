I am very happy with my results so far, my skin feels and looks more hydrated. My skin looks brighter, and plump as well. I have sensitive skin, and have not had a problem with this product. What works best for me is to use, three days straight and then skip two. I really like the bottle itself, and the pump really gives me the right amount I need. Canâ€™t wait to see more results, but so far so good. Amazing product
