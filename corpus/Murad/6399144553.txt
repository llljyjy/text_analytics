This is my first retinol eye cream, so I don’t have much to compare to. But I will say this: it is effective enough to see some skin peeling without irritating the skin around my eyes. As to wrinkle reducing, I’m in my twenties so it’s more for prevention so I can’t speak for it’s effectiveness, but retinol should take weeks or even months before seeing results. Compared to the face retinol cream (another brand), this is definitely a much gentler formulation as my face is often irritated even with every other night use, yet I’m applying this eye serum twice daily without side effects. will buy again
