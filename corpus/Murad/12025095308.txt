I’m a big fan of Murad so I had pretty high expectations before I tried out this product.  First impression: I love the the clear holder the super cute bottle comes in - it’s a great extra barrier so it doesn’t spill when I throw it in my overnight bag.  The actual serum itself is super soft and light on my skin and I definitely noticed that my skin was not just a little more dewy, but that my fine lines were less visible.  Definitely something I’ll continue to use in my PM skincare routine. A great addition to your PM skincare routine
