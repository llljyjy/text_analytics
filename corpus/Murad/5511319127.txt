I haven’t been using this product for that long, so this review is not based on results. However, the texture of this product turns me off so much. It applies in the way that a pore filling primer would and is very thick. I appreciate a more oil or water based treatment and this isn’t it. I also find that if you have any active acne it really stings when applied to those areas. Hopefully the results are worth it… Hopefully the results are worth it…
