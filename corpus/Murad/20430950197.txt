I’ve been trying to be better at incorporating more anti-aging products into my skincare routine. This wrinkle corrector has been my go-to when trying to target fine lines around my eye area. I haven’t seen any major changes yet because I’ve been using it for a few days, but hoping to see some soon! nan
