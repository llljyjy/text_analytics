I’m a big fan of the texture of this sunscreen. It has a hydrating, serum like finish that doesn’t leave any residue or white cast. I have noticed my skin looking brighter after a few days as well. Although a little more expensive I appreciate that it’s a multi purpose product rather than just a sunscreen so I can simplify my routine. Highly recommend if you’re looking to minimize your am skincare steps! Gifted by Murad in exchange for my honest review. nan
