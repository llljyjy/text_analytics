I would love to give this product a better rating because so far I have been enjoying it, but unfortunately I found a random brownish green particle inside the bottle on my third time using it. I managed to dig it out with tweezers and I’m not sure what it is, but I’m a little bummed because for $44, I feel like quality assurance should be better. Mystery Particle Inside Bottle
