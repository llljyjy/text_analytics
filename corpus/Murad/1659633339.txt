The targeted wrinkle corrector by Murad did not disappoint! Just a little bit of product goes along way so I’m expecting this tube to last a while making it a great value. It makes my skin looks a lot more hydrated which makes the trouble spots seem less defined. It’s not magic, but it does give really good results as long as you have realistic expectations. Totally recommend! Visible results!
