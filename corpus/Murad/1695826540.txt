Retinol has always been a scary ingredient for me and finding the right one is also a journey! I really like the consistency of this one, it is not too thick which makes it easy to apply onto the skin. My skin has been enjoying this product so far. I will say, it may be too strong for sensitive skin. I did have slight purging, but it wasnâ€™t too bad. Enjoying this retinol and will be using two times a week as to not over do it! nan
