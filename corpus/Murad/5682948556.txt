This sunscreen is not bad on it’s own. It has a very oily consistency and is not moisturizing. I use Tretinoin so my skin tends to be dry. It clings to every dry spot and separates on my face. It’s also horrible under makeup. I guess if you have perfect skin you can pull it off. I didn’t notice a significant white cast and I have brown Indian skin. it’s ok..
