I’m in love with this sunscreen. This Murad correct and protect serum broad spectrum SPF 45 PA++++ mineral sunscreen has a lightweight satiny milky texture that melts and absorbs quickly into my skin. The formula contains 100% mineral Zinc Oxide which protects against UVA and UVB rays. It leaves my skin moisturized, and smoothly glows with no white cast left. It’s great as a base under makeup. It is a must-have sunscreen. A must-have sunscreen
