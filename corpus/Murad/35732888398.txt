This was gifted  by Murad Skincare to try out and Iâ€™m super impressed! It arrived in the mail conveniently when I was having a breakout. I put it on my breakout spots at night and when I woke up they went down overnight! They did not completely go away the first use, but I kept using it for a couple nights and my breakout subsided. Great product! nan
