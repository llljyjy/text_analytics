I have very minimal wrinkles but I didn’t see really much any difference using this for 10 days. It’s definitely hydrating and calming to my skin, and I think it helps provide a good base layer under makeup so foundation and concealer don’t settle into the crevices. But I do not think it’s worth the price at all. Maybe I will continue using to see if I can figure out the best way to use it. nan
