These are more like cheek patches, they slide right down my face and won’t stay on the under-eye area. Also too expensive to use daily. Retinol must be used regularly in order to have a significant benefit, so I’m not sure what the utility is of an occasional retinol patch.  It did seem to provide a very temporary benefit that lasted for a few minutes. Wouldn't stay put
