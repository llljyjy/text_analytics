Gifted by Murad in exchange for my honest review. This retinoid combines retinol and granactive retinoid (concentration unknown unfortunately.). I like that they included extra skin loving ingredients like urea, ceramide NP and squalane. I just wish they would have left the fragrance out since retinoids can be irritating. Pretty good
