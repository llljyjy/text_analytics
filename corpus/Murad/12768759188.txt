Gifted by Murad, this helped my redness breakouts and whiteheads mostly. It removes blackhead sad well, but definitely noticed a difference on my acne that has risen and reduced major redness.  I have combination skin, oily and dry, also sensitive. It doesn’t leave my skin itchy or irritated after using. Bonus points I’ve used on ingrown hairs and has helped clearing those as well! I truly recommend this product! New addition to my skin care routine!
