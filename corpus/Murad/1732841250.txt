Iâ€™ve trusted Murad products for over a decade and the correct & protect spf did not disappoint. I loved the serum spf consistency. It blended nicely into my skin and did not leave a greasy feeling on my oily skin. My makeup laid well over top. I would recommend this serum spf. My first serum SPF and I loved it!
