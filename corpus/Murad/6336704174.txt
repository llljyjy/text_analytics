I received a sample for review, so my comments are based on one use. These eye masks are large and separate easily from the packaging. They stayed in place once I applied them - moist enough to deliver the product without being drippy or gooey. They have a light scent. After 15 minutes, my undereyes felt hydrated and soft. I would be interested in trying these again to see if more prolonged use helps tighten the skin more. Would love to use again
