I was gifted by Murad Skincare. I get hormonal acne and sometimes it can be one really big, annoying pimple. I tried it one night, and the next morning it really helped reduce the swelling and redness. It’s still there, but it’s not as irritating as it was before. I just wish it came with a dropper or some other type of applicator/opening rather than having to dip a q-tip or pouring it into my palm. nan
