Murad gifted me this product for review, and so far I’m impressed! I’ve only been using it for about a week now so I haven’t seen the long term effects, but the short term ones are great so far. I feel like this product does a great job of blurring and smoothing out the appearance of fine lines. I’m excited to see what it does in the long run! nan
