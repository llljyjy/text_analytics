This is the first sunscreen that I tried on a dropper form and I’m impressed! It is very easy to dispense out the right amount, I usually do a couple drops per each cheek and also the forehead. This blends instantly and does not leave a white cast on me. It has a liquid texture that spreads easily and absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. I like that it feels very lightweight so it’s like wearing nothing but I’m still protected to the effects of the sun.I have received compliments while wearing this alone on how good and radiant my skin looks, and it also wears well under makeup. Beautiful natural finish
