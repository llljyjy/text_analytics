I was really excited to try out the Murad correct and protect broad spectrum spf. I have dry and very sensitive skin and I put on spf each morning.  The product felt so lightweight when applied and left a nice glow to my skin. There was not any white cast on after I applied and absorbs easily into my skin. The product doesn’t feel heavy it feels like a very light serum. When I applied makeup on top of the product it applied easily and nicely. I can’t wait to purchase a new one when the bottle is empty. Love this product!
