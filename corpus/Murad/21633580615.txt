I initially got a sample size version of this product and loved it! Enough to buy the full version. However I was super disappointed after buying the full size, as it only lasted a few months before the product became oily and separated. Not sure why the sample size lasted longer, after seeing a few reviews though it seems I’m not the only one whose product went bad prematurely. Not worth the price if it won’t last at least as long as the package says it will! Product goes bad fast
