This sunscreen feels so good and lightweight and it also color corrects! Some many functions all in one good bottle. Generally I tend to be skeptical in incorporating new SPF products into my beauty regimen or makeup regimen since many SPF products have the ability to create a peeling effect after being combined with foundation concealer etc. This does not do that, making it the perfect supplement to my daily routine. A great addition to the routine!â€º
