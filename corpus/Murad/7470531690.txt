Oh my god. When I say I’ve used every product under the sun, I mean it. This stuff is the best product for acne I have ever, EVER used. The minute I feel a blemish starting to form, this stuff takes care of it before it even has a chance. It’s legitimately the greatest thing I’ve ever experienced. It has a cooling effect on the skin as well. I felt 3 different pimples forming under my skin (would’ve been those big ones that start underneath), put it on them and overnight they were freaking gone. nan
