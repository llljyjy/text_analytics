This was gifted to me by Murad in exchange for my honest thoughts.  The Environmental Shield collection is my favorite from Murad because I’m all about SPF and antioxidant-rich products. This one in particular applies easily, absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling behind. It sits beautifully under makeup as well. nan
