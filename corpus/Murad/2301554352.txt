I tried this on my acne breakouts on my chin, and I think it made the pimple smaller, but it did not completely dry it out or anything like that. So I wouldnâ€™t say this is a miracle product or anything, but if you do get breakouts often, this will work to make your pimples shrink over time. This was complimentary from Murad Skincare. nan
