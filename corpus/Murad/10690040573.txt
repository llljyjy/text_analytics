I received this product complimentary from Murad. This mineral-based serum sunscreen is such a wonderful sunscreen. I love the dropper application. It has a very thin lotion like texture that goes on very smoothly and absorbs effortlessly without leaving a sticky feeling. I love that it does not leave a white cast at all and it layers beautifully with my makeup without making my skin oily during the day. It provides my skin with a beautiful soft satin finish. A beautiful sunscreen that I highly recommend! Lovely serum sunscreen
