I was glad to get this product gifted by Murad Skincare to use on the occasional pimple or cystic acne breakout. I tried it on a few spots and it seemed to help, but can definitely dry skin. The product would be better if there was a dropper - it comes out too fast when pouring. Good product, packaging inconvenient
