Overall, I liked these patches! They are the first ones I’ve used with retinol and I was nervous that keeping them on for 15 minutes might cause some irritation. However, they haven’t! I noticed after taking them off that they definitely made my skin feel immediately smoother, firmer, and my fine lines were slightly softened. So they definitely work and they feel great too. I do have to say that I struggled a little bit opening the package and separating the patches from all the little mesh pieces, especially because there’s a lot of product that can make the process messy/goopy. I also experienced a little bit of sliding around with the patches where I needed to reposition them multiple times - next time, I will apply and then lay down to prevent the sliding. The slight mess was worth the overall end result, though Good patches, just a little messy
