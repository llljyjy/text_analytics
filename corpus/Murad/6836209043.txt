Verdict: So far, so good.  The formula is lightweight, non-greasy,  absorbs super quickly, and they did not irritate my sensitive under eye area!  I only used them onceâ€¦I could see significant results, which normally with retinol takes one or two months to see visible changes. My only observation would be that they were a little big for my under eye area, people with smaller faces will find them a lit but oversized. Verdict: So far, so good!
