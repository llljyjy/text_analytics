I was gifted by Murad skincare the “Rapid Dark Spot Correcting Serum“ in exchange for an honest review. This is a tranexamic and glycolic acid based serum that helps brighten your skintone. You can use this on the AM and PM. My skin usually cannot tolerate glycolic acid but I’ve not had any issues with this formula. I use this once a day either morning and night and my skin has not had any issues with irritation, dryness, or redness. It did cause some piling during the day when I used it with my SPF which is an issue, so I will just be using it in the evening from now on. I use it all the way to my chest to help with some hyperpigmentation. I’ve not seen any major changes but with serums like this it takes time and I will continue to use. At first glance it seems like a great formula and I’m enjoying using it. A nice correcting serum
