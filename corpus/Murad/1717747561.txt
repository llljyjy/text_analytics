Murat gifted me this product to try. For reference - I have combination skin. I tend to get hormonal breakouts along my jawline and by the ears. I use this at night as a part of my bedtime routine. I apply it on any breakouts, and when I wake up in the morning, the bump has either reduced in size, or is completely gone. Such a great product to have! nan
