I can honestly say after years of searching for a sunscreen that does not leave my skin looking oily and feeling heavy, this is the one! I have serious oily skin, almost within the hour of washing my face I get greasy again. This sunscreen does not feel heavy, doesn’t leave a whitecast and is not oily at all!! My only problem is that it takes a lot of properly cover my face and it is expensive. I also like to pat it in so that it doesn’t “pill“ with my other products underneath. Overall a great product!
