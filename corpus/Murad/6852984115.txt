I use retinol in my skincare routine, and I always am concerned to use it around my eyes, but this mask is great because didn’t irritate my eye area at all. After I used it the skin was more soft and moist. I received just one set of patches so I’m not sure about the long term benefits.Gifted by Murad Skincare. nan
