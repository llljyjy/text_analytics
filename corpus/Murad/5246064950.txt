gifted by Murad Skincare. i really wanted to like this but it didn’t really work for me! it also made my skin VERY dry even after heavy moisturizers which was upsetting! I used it and put it on as directed and it didn’t really take away any of my acne spots, just made my skin dry :/ I’ll give it another few tries but I don’t think it’s for me! nan
