I really think this eye cream is helping my under eyes. I have really bad pigmentation under my eyes that I’ve been trying to get better for a long time. Within a week of daily (day and night) usage, it seems like my under eyes are a bit better. The cream itself has reflective qualities so it looks like it’s doing work right away. Gifted by Murad Skincare. Brighter Eyes!
