Beautiful packaging and (mostly) good ingredients. Mine was easy to open and easy to use. It’s hydrating and very lightweight, which I love. No bad reactions. Worked well with my oily skin. Plays well with my other products. My only complaint is the mouthwash smell - after opening it I was immediately reminded of the Listerine my dad used to buy when I was a kid. I am not a fan of putting that smell all over my face. It’s not bad enough that I won’t use it as the smell fades in a short time. Other than the menthol, I love the rest of the ingredients. I love the amount that you get for the price and for what it is but I’m honestly not sure if I would repurchase. If you don’t mind the menthol smell, it’s definitely worth a try. Decent Product - Not Fond of the Mouthwash Smell
