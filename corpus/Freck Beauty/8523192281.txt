I have tried a handful of other toners over the past few years but I always come back to this one. I have sensitive skin (rosacea) and this doesn’t aggravate it all. It isn’t heavily fragranced like so many other toners, which is great since fragrance + sensitive skin don’t mix well. I really cannot recommend this enough! nan
