I’m in love! I got this from my ipsy subscription box and I am head over heels! I am 45 years old and with combination skin. I love the way my skin completely drinks this and it makes my face feel super silky not greasy! I love the light cactus scent it has! I’m almost done with it so I will definitely repurchase. I’ve never finished a moisturizer in my life so this is definitely a great sign! I read many reviews and I don’t know why so many negative comments because this is the best moisturizer I’ve tried and I’ve tried many. The only thing I would change is the packaging but that’s just preference. My favorite cream ever!!
