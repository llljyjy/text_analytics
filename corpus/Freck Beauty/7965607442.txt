I have to say I’m impressed by this toner. Is lightweight and very gentle! After 2 weeks of constant use I noticed a bit of improvement in stubborn bumps. Also the glow was real after application! I did struggle while trying to open the cap but lesson learned I’m gonna leave it a little loose from now on. New favorite toner!
