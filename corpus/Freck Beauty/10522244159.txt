Iâ€™ve been using this toner for a few weeks and I love it! After each use, I can see the residue left behind on my cotton rounds which leaves my skin feeling so clean. I also use this toner in the mornings instead of using a cleanser for a nice refreshing morning glow. This product was gifted from Freck Beauty. Refreshing toner!
