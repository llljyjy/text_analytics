First off, the packaging of this item itâ€™s so heavy duty! It feels very expensive and looks aesthetic. I just tried this out for the first time right when it came in the mail, and a little bit goes a long way. It is a great make up remover and does not dry out your face. It comes with so much product and I love it! nan
