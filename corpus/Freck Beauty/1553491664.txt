LOVE! I have trouble finding a moisturizer that doesn’t make me either break out, over produce oil, or run into my eyes at night and this doesn’t at all! I really don’t like the price, but a friend recommended it as her holy grail, so I bought it and I’m sooo glad I did. This will now be something I purchase when Sephora is having their sales! Product is super hydrating, creamy, and very thick. A very little amount goes a very long way so this tube should last for a few months even with daily use. Holy Grail!
