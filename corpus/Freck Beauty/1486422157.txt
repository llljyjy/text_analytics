I was intrigued by the name of the product and asked for a sample. I loved the smell, ingredients and the ease of putting on this moisturizer. I was hooked and purchased it after finishing my sample. I also love the fact that it comes in a tube rather than a jar or pump. Works very well and keeps my skin moist while protecting it outdoors. Great Daytime Vitamin C Protector
