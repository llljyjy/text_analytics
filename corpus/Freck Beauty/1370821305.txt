Second time purchasing and I will preface this review by saying I like the product inside the bottle; however I remember the first time getting the lid off after initial shipment was a bugger, as stated previously in other reviews- but it eventually opened. Second time purchasing, lid cracked off and spilled the entire bottle on my carpet. Sort the lids out, mate. Shouldn’t be this difficult. What’s the deal with these lids?
