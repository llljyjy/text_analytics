I have struggled with acne my entire life (currently 25) and this is such a great addition to my morning and nighttime skincare routine. (I use The Ordinary serums with this and a toner) I noticed that everyone’s been saying it’s not good under makeup, I work from home so I never wear makeup when doing my skincare routine. I have used it as a primer before and didn’t notice anything odd but I can see where it may not work the best with makeup on top of it. Definitely buy it if you’re looking for a moisturizer that doesn’t break the bank and a little goes a long way! LOVEEEEEEEEE
