It was unbelievably satisfying to see the residue left behind on my cotton round. Makes you think about how poorly you were cleansing your skin before. After using this product my skin felt refreshed and light. My oily skin felt more balanced. It did not leave my skin stripped and it had a nice glow. Loved loved loved
