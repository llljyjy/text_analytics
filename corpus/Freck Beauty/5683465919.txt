Gifted by Freck Beauty! The CUTEST packaging. The visuals for Cactus Water are a 10/10. I have been using this product morning and night and I am shocked to see after my morning routine using a cotton ball and STILL getting residue from my face off. After a full day of my day I start my routine with this and the cotton ball is full of residue, try it for yourself! It makes my skin feel fresh, clean and clear before bed. I highly recommend this product and I will be continue to use this product in my skin care routine! Cactus water, a must!
