This may be so pronounced with this product because other company’s purposely disguise the smell but you can absolutely tell this primer has a fair amount of alcohol in it (it is also listed in the ingredients). I don’t purposely go out of my way to avoid alcohols in makeup but with this primer you cannot get over it.  The primer works relatively well but there are other ones that I prefer (like Laura Mercier’s Hydrating one). If you are sensitive to alcohols I would skip this
