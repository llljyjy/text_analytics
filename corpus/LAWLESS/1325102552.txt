Absolutely love this primer. I love the fact that it is silicone free, which helps a lot with my acne prone skin. Also helps with keeping my foundation/tint in place without pilling. I have very dry, sometimes flaky skin, so I will take all the moisture I can get. My skin feels soft and airy after putting on the primer, not at all tacky or sticky. And yet, it still keeps my makeup looking good all day. Iâ€™m definitely going to be repurchasing this product, although I wish the price was a bit better! nan
