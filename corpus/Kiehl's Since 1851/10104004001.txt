I really like this product. It didn’t do much for my skin over night so I tried it with my makeup. I used it on the bridge of my nose, and both inner cheeks, just by the nose, on top of my makeup, and it has an effect that seems to deflect the light and hide crepe or lines in that area. I wouldn’t apply directly under the eyes or on eye bags. Age 59. nan
