I have extremely sensitive skin and after using this eye cream twice daily for a few days the skin under my eyes started to burn. I didnâ€™t see a markable change in my under eye circles but my skin texture did improve. A little bit of this product goes a very long way. It might be perfect for someone without sensitive skin. nan
