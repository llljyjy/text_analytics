Wow, this product is amazing. I have been applying Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream for 30 days now. The dark area under my eyes has almost completely vanished. The fine line crow’s feet wrinkles have significantly reduced as well. The product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly with no residue at all. After applying under my eyes I work product to the outside of the eye and finally do the lids. There is absolutely no irritability to my eyes, very neutral product. I’m extremely happy with the Kiehl’s product and will be adding this to my permanent personal care routine. Works better than I hoped!
