I’m in my mid thirties, so I’m starting to get more wrinkles and dark circles that coffee just can’t help. I used this product day and night for over two months and noticed my under eyes looking less dark and more firm. I noticed results within two weeks! My eyes didn’t mind the cream, whereas some other creams I’ve tried made them sting. When I used concealer, I noticed my under eye wrinkles less and I just looked fresher. I liked the feel of the cream. I recommend! Helps eyes look fresh and bright
