I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this is the only one I’ve finished and had to get a new one for, I love it. I’m combo/oily. Im also very acne prone and this doesn’t break me out. This product makes my skin look much more plump and noticeably hydrates to a point where fine lines were diminished. I was considering baby Botox before I used this, but realized my skin was just dehydrated and didn’t like other products. I’ve used tretinoin for 3 years which leads to stinging and redness when I put lotion on, kiehls is the only thing that doesn’t sting my face. In 3 years using tret i probably tried 20 different moisturizers. This is literally the only one that doesn’t hurt. I’ll NEVER switch from this product. 4 stars because I wish it was in a pump to limit bacterial growth. Excellent product, worth the price
