I was excited by this product the moment I opened the box. I felt like a mad scientist doing a science project! I love that the product comes separate and I added the pure retinol before the first use. It definitely makes it seem like the product is at maximum strength this way and hasnâ€™t diluted down sitting on a shelf over time. To make this review simple I will just say- I saw results quickly! And continue to see results! I have received many compliments on my skin since I began using this which is the biggest sign to me that the serum works! It seems like it is actually repairing my skin. Not just making it look good for a few hours before it wears off for the day. I have absolutely recommended this to the girls in my family and will keep it in my daily routine permanently. I apply it at night after washing my face. I let my skin absorb it well before applying a light moisturizer on top and have been so thrilled with the results! I saw results quickly & keep seeing improved skin
