I’ve been using this over the past 8 weeks and I feel like it’s taken at least 10 years off my eye area. It’s thick so I do recommend either using at night or planning accordingly so you can apply makeup in the a.m. Overall, I’m very pleased with the results. Another bonus is I didn’t experience any eye sensitivity like stinging, redness, or tearing despite the strength of this product. The application is easy and a little goes a long way.
