This bottle lasted me about 3 months. It is a really nice formula. It isn’t too thick so it absorbs really fast. It also works well with my other skincare. I noticed an immediate difference on newer spots from recent breakouts or recent dark spots from sun damage. The dark areas that were much older only lightened a small amount and then plateaued but didn’t disappear. Even so, I’ll take a little over nothing all day long. I do plan on purchasing this. PSA:I received this product in exchange for my feedback. That being said, I always give my honest opinion. Works Well!
