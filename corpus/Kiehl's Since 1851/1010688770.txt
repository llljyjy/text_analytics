I love the Kiehl’s brand and trust their products to be safe and effective on my skin. This serum, however, didn’t meet my expectations. Although I applied as directed, it felt greasy on my skin. When I used consecutively the application stung a little bit (which is to be expected with retinol). I didn’t notice any improvement to my skin tone or fine lines. The product is truly fragrance-free, which I appreciate. The packaging is wasteful and adds extra plastic into the environment. nan
