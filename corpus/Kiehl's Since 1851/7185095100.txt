I have tried this product for about 3 weeks, doing it only 2 times a week since I did not want my skin to react badly to it. So far, I did not have any itching or pilling, and the product seems to be working somewhat. I noticed that my skin did change for the better and looked a little smoother than before. I guess I have to increase how often I use the product to see a full effect. Overall, this is a good product because (a) the serum is mixed prior to the first use and not before and (b) it does have an effect on your skin. It is a bid on a pricy side so not sure how many people would be able to afford it. nan
