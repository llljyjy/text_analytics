I’ve been using this product over the past few weeks and I have seen a difference in my dark and tired looking eye circles. The formula is the texture of a cream although it’s called a serum. Product goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin nicely. It is very hydrating and brightens the undereye area to a noticeable difference. There is no scent - fine by me when it comes to such a sensitive area! Packaging is fine, easy to use and no obvious issues. Only gave 4 stars because of the price, $50 feels so expensive for an eye cream! Though it is a pro and con because I do see a difference so it’s a personal choice to buy! Overall still I would say this is a decent product and I do recommend. Good Eye Cream!
