I tried out this product as a free sample. The product consistency was very smooth and light. I chose to use this 3 times a week using the “tissue-off treatment” method. The cold weather has made my skin very dry and this product worked wonders. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick hydration solution! Love it!
