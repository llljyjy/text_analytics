This is a good retinol cream (not only with good advertisement but also with good ingredients). Feels good on the skin, and spreads well, but at first, it’s white and doesn’t absorb right away, but after a moment, nothing horrible. Since I have very dry skin, I use moisturizer over this cream, but if you’re normal/oily you won’t need it. Most importantly, I can feel it’s working! My skin tone is more even, freckles are going away, and my acne is finally under control. There are no unpleasant side effects. Also, I like the packaging and will definitely recommend it! Excellent
