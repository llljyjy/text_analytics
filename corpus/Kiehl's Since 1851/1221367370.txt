I’m a Faithful customer of another big name facial cream company so I was hesitant to try this out. I stop using my brand for about 3-4 days to give this one a fair chance. Hands down this is awesome! My skin has retained moisture and looks brilliant. I’m happily amazed that there is no chemical smell to the product either. Definitely a bonus. Lightweight, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. So greasy after use. Kiehls has definitely made its way into my beauty product cabinet. Definitely added to my skin care routine
