A nice smelling overnight powerhouse repair lotion. The texture and consistency of this cream is nice. It’s a bit thicker than I expected but does cover and spread well. Overall I like this Midnight Recovery Cloud Cream from Kiehls. I have extreme combination skin, so some areas are super oily while others are dry and can be flakey during certain seasons. This overnight cream is amazing for the dry areas. It’s been amazing in healing and keeping the dry skin away. I’m very impressed in that area. But my oily areas become extremely oily - more so than usual and I’ve had a couple small blemishes from the overnight usage in those oily areas.  I will continue to use this cream around my eyes and dry areas and am still happy about it and would recommend to others to give it a try! nan
