I rarely leave reviews but this cream deserves one. I’ve had EXTREMELY oily skin for as long as I can remember (for reference, I am 28 years old and my skin would get oily 1-2h after I dabbed it with a sheet or set it with powder. Oh and I have very acne-prone skin). I’ve been using this cream for close to a month now and it has drastically improved the oiliness. I still get shiny but way, way less and more to a “I don’t need to check on it every couple hours” level. Hydrating part is enough for the dry, cold winter here and not thick to the point where I wouldn’t use it in the summer. It has also not broken me out. 10/10 would recommend Honestly a new holy grail
