Got this cleanser for half off and decided it was a good idea to use it because the reviews for the product were top notch. However I did see many negative reviews about the product and decided to ignore them. Later after using it I began to realize that my skin was completely dried out and my moisture barrier was depleted and ruined after building it up for such a long time and having nice glowy skin.  This completely ruined my day and I quickly went back into repair mode and have recently started repairing my moisture barrier again. I would not recommend this product as it dries out your face completely in two days even if you have oily or super moisturized skin like myself and never seem to have those problems. My Skin Barrier is ruined and I’m now going to have to spend a lot more time repairing it when I could be enhancing it. Trust me do not ignore the bad reviews, it’s not worth it. Dried out my skin so fast
