Wow. Unless your skin is so beyond dry that it’s almost cracking, this stuff is way way way too greasy feeling. I did not enjoy wearing it before bed. I barely used any(a little goes a very long way) and rubbed it in for almost ten minutes. Still super oily. I got in bed and just felt like I had layers of grease on my freshly cleaned skin.I will say that in the morning, I used face wipes and used a lancome essence and my skin was very soft and supple, more than usual so that’s a perk.Unless your skin is insanely dry, I do not recommend. Extremely oily - must have Extremely dry skin
