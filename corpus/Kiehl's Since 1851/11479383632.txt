Thanks to @bzzagent and @kiehls for the opportunity to try the cream complimentary for my honest review!Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream deeply moisturizes and rejuvenates your skin overnight while you sleep, helping to plump and replenish your skin’s lipid barrier. Key Ingredients:- Omega Fatty Acids (Omega 3 & 6) help replenish and strengthen the skins protective lipid barrier while supporting skin moisturization - Botanical Blend works to visibly diminish fine lines and dullness- Squalane helps restore the proper balance of natural oils in the skinTexture/Scent:- Whipped, creamy, thick consistency. Lavender scent.I’ve been obsessed with Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Oil for years so I was excited to not only see this as a cream now but to receive in the mail to review. A little goes a long way and it surprisingly absorbs quickly into the skin. Despite the stronger scent I saw no irritation when using nor did it cause a breakout. A great cream that moisturizes the skin deeply and lasts throughout the night. My skin is visibly more plump in the morning and with consistent use my skins feels stronger and more nourished.Would recommend to those with normal to dry skin! PROS:✅ Gentle. Have seen no irritation ✅ Absorbs Quickly into the skin✅ Does not leave skin feeling tacky/oily✅ Moisturizes skin deeply and lasts ✅ Skin is visibly more plump in morning ✅ Texture is more refined w/ consistent use✅ Skin is left feeling more nourished ✅ Gives complexion a subtle glow CONS:❌ Only con I have is that some may find the scent to be overpowering Deeply Moisturizes
