I’m absolutely loving this super lightweight gel cream. First application I noticed immediately that my under eyes felt much more hydrated therefore making my fine lines look less noticeable. I’ve been using this eye cream for a week mornings and evenings. After about a week used I could see that my under eye was brighter, my fine lines were plumping and I overall looked more awake. The gel texture is very smooth, which helps it to go very smooth around the eye area and absorbs quick. This doesn’t leave a greasy residue or feel sticky at all. IT WORKS AMAZINGLY
