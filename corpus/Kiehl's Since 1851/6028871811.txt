I donâ€™t know what exactly is IN this thing. No, I KNOW from looking at the ingredients list but I honestly cannot figure out which ingredient is the reason why this night moisturizer makes you wake up with smooth, even, glowing skin. I tried the Midnight Recovery Serum but I discovered that oils make my face breakout. This cream however made my lines appear nonexistent, it made my skin look even and I looked like I was glowing. Fantastic purchase. I wish there was more of the product for the price but it lasts a very long time and you only need to use VERY little of the product. It spreads very easily. It will last a very long time. Shocked and stunned!!!!!!
