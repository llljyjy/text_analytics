I have been consistently using this eye serum day and night for about 2 months and am very happy with my results. My biggest change is that my dark circles are not as bad as they once were.  I usually needed full under eye concealer to leave the house and now I can just do a little touch of foundation and I am good to go. This tiny bottle lasts a long time,  a little goes a long way. The product blends and soaks into the skin very nicely and does not leave any film behind. I love it! Love it
