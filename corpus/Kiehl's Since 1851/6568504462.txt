BzzAgent sent this for an honest review. I have not used a retinol like this before. The idea of adding ingredients myself to activate the serum is a novel one. Someone with motor impairments or limited use of steady hands may struggle. I don’t know if there’s any actual science behind the idea of adding the ingredients “fresh“. I saw no noticeable difference in this over my usual retinol serum. Gimmicky
