This is my first retinol product that I am consistently using. I apply this after a clean face and essence 6 days a week for my evening routine. No issues with redness or skin irritation. I noticed my face texture is a lot smoother.  I havenâ€™t noticed any difference yet with fine lines improvement. The serum does not have scent which I a plus for a me. So far pleased with this product. nan
