I received this product for my honest review from BzzAgent. This is OK. It does hydrate, but it leaves a sort of film on your skin and it’s hard to get off. It doesn’t sink in like I would have liked. It doesn’t feel like it’s healing your skin, but instead feels like an occlusive almost. It did hydrate, but I would recommend other hydrating masks over this. Probably just a personal texture preference. nan
