I love this Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream. The first thing I noticed is that you don’t need very much to get the job done. It does an amazing job at moisturizing my skin. My skin looks refreshed, moisturized, and healthy! This is a must have for the cold winter months. I love how light and gentle it feels on my skin. I am very happy with this product and I would absolutely recommend this to others! Yes Please
