The ingredients are great but the product when in use was way to stripping.  Stay away if you have dehydrated skin.  If your oily this could work but I still feel its to much.  It be nice if they took these “key ingredients” and pushed them higher on the ingredients list.  Maybe then it would be more pleasant to use. This could have been a great cleanser ngl
