I use it as a mask twice a week, with the occasional spot treatment. That seems to be working for me. A little goes a long way, once it starts to melt. My face always feels super juicy when I wake up, and the moisture and softness lasts, even through my next day’s routines. As a spot treatment, it’s wonderful, too. I mostly use it this way on my chin and jawline following drying acne treatments. It’s immediately soothing and keeps my horrible flaking at bay. Overall, this mask is excellent. It provides lasting moisture, and is proving to be a good match for my skin and the wintry weather. Though I haven’t tried it yet as a cleanser because I’m enjoying the treatment so much (and I already have balms galore), its oil content is really promising. It’s nice and hydrating on both the oily and dry parts, and it is keeping away the winter flakes that I hate so much. I’d call it a must-have. Period. Winter holy grail…
