I have tried many Retinol products in the past, including prescription and non-prescription, and this is one of the first retinol products that didn’t irritate my skin. I don’t use it every day - it’s an every other day product for me. The mixing/activation process was unique as well. I would definitely use this again and recommend it to others. nan
