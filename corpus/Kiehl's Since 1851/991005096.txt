I’ll begin by saying that I have never used a used a Kiehl’s product before, but have always wondered about their quality.  So, I jumped at the chance to receive a bottle in exchange for my review of  their Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum. And, boy am I glad I did!The ’Mix Your Own’ concept is pretty cool. Before your 1st use, you unscrew the bottom of the serum bottle. Then, you place a separately wrapped capsule in the bottom of the bottle, and press down to release the Retinol-Infused Powder. After removing the capsule, screw the bottom of the bottle back on, and shake the bottle to mix the powder and serum. That is it! I felt as though I had a small part in making my serum, and knew that it would be super fresh! As for the product itself, I think it is wonderful. It it easily sinks into the skin and doesn’t feel sticky. I did not notice any particular fragrance, either. Because I have pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead, that is my main concern. After just a few nights of using this, I could see a softening in them. Amazing! I will definitely purchase this product. Wow!
