I enjoyed using this serum nightly.  I have used retinol in the past, and it typically is more like ointment so I would need to put a serum on after I applied the retinal.  I really liked that this was a moisturizing serum with retinol - it was convenient having a 2 in 1 type product.  My skin has looked great while using this.  I’m not sure if the packaging is gimmicky or a necessity: You need to put this together once you open the package (powder gets dumped into the serum). Maybe there is some reason for this, but it isn’t explained so I didn’t really understand the need for the extra packaging that just created more trash and extra steps. Good nightly serum
