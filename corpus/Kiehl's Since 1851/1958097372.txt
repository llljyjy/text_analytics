But this now! This serum is amazing! It’s gentle but effective! You can really see results in a few consistent applications. It could be too strong to use daily, but every other day would be perfect! I love a good retinol and this fits the bill! It’s a luxurious serum that isn’t a waste of time! It was a little confusing at first on how to mix the two products but once I got the hang of it I was kind of embarrassed that I had a hard time understanding the instructions. I received this product free from Buzzfeed for my review. I would absolutely pay for this with my own money, it’s truly worth every penny. But this now! Don’t hesitate ❤️
