This product is honestly, amazing. It’s kind of fun mixing it too. But I have mild rosacea & it’s dramatically reduced the redness. Plus, my skin is so smooth. A little goes a long way too. The only con is the price. I received this as a free sample & I’m very likely going to purchase it when I’ve finished the bottle. expensive but so good
