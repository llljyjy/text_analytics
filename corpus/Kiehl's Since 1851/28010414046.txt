This barrier cream really delivers on the main promises that the brand has made as far as immediately repairing and relieving dry skin. The skin on my face is pretty sensitive, especially during the winter months, to most facial creams but this one does not break me out and has the perfect thick consistency that my skin needs to stay hydrated throughout the night and the day. I love how it is unscented, does not irritate my skin, and instantly takes care of dry patches on my face. I wish that this came in a bigger size or a pump style bottle. I included a before and after picture of the skin on my feet just as an example of how powerful this cream is. This product can be used for more than just your face. Itâ€™s definitely a product that I would want to use long-term. A facial barrier cream that delivers it's promises
