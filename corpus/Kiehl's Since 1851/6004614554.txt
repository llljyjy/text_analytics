I was getting exhausted buying different washes until I tried this one by luck!! If you have oily or acne prone skin, try it ! My pores are amazing now. My face gets clean and it unexpectedly washed off all of my makeup! I like that it mattifies my skin slightly like a quick mask. I used to be able to see gunk in my pores (nose and cheek) and not it’s completely gone. I know it’s the Wash because nothing made that difference in my routine and I wear makeup daily . nan
