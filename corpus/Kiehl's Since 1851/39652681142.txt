I already use prescription Retin-A, so I always use caution when adding a new serum to my nightly skincare cocktail. I found this Kiehl’s serum to be the perfect addition to my routine, especially on my neck and upper chest. Unlike other products I’ve tried, it did not cause redness, itching or peeling. Since you add the retinol powder when you open the product, you know it’s fresh—and it gets to work quickly! The serum absorbs instantly, leaving no stickiness or residue behind. I have already begun to see improvement in those pesky fine wrinkles and skin discolorations on my neck and my upper chest. Overall, a great serum that is so smooth and fresh, it’s like you haven’t applied anything at all, and those lines that have disappeared? They can be your secret, because with this serum, they will disappear—and fast! Wrinkle Relief Without the Telltale Side Effects
