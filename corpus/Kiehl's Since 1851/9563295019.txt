it does feel moisturizing and skin appears nice after first use, but every time I have taken this out of my drawer I will end up with clogged after a few weeks of use. The clogged pores don’t happen the first week and a bit, so I suddenly feel like oh maybe this doesn’t work for me! But after two weeks or so pimples that dont usually happen start happening. I want to attribute the acne to my menstrual cycle, but my prior moisturizer doesn’t have this issue. Clogs pores after continued use
