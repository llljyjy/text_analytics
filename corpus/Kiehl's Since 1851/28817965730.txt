Between all of the overnight masks I’ve tried, this one is the best so far. I live in Missouri so it’s cold and dry a lot so my face will flake with how dry it is and I’ve been using this only a week and I wake up with no more flaky skin! It’s a little thick in my opinion but things out as you rub. I can’t wait to see what results I get after a month! I definitely recommend getting this overnight hydrating mask. Great overnight mask!
