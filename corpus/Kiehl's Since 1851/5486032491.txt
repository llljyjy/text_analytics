I feel mixed about this problem. Started using to see if it would help with some forehead wrinkles. While I feel like it assisted with some fine lines and aging issues, it caused me to break out horribly. Had to stop using. Disappointed because I love Kiehlâ€™s products. Will just have to find something better suited for my sensitive skin. causes breakouts
