I initially got this as a sample but I actually really liked this face cream! It is both super moisturizing and also a bit occlusive to keep the moisture from evaporating off of your face. I normally use two separate lotions at night: a moisturizing one and then an occlusive on top but this cream does both! It is unscented, which i prefer because i have sensitive skin and scented lotions often irritate my face. I actually normally hope that I dont like pricier lotions, but I am going to have to buy this one when i run out. Based on the last two weeks, i think the 50ml jar will last me about 10 weeks. My partner also loves it! Both moisturizing and occlusive
