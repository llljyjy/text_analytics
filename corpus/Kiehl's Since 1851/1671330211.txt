Kiehls products are so amazing. The scent isnâ€™t noticeable. It has great skin feel, not oily or sticky like some products. It is highly moisturizing.  I have been using it at night. I am a pretty cheap person, but this product is worth the money and I will continue to purchase even though I got this as a sample from BzzAgent. The Kiehls products are worth the money. Best feeling treatment.
