I have sensitive skin, so normally retinol burns and dries out my skin. This didn’t do that at all! In fact, it actually did the opposite. I love that it doesn’t have any fragrance and doesn’t make my skin feel sticky.  I have used it for 2 weeks at night and I can see a difference in my fine lines. Would recommend! WHOA! This actually works!
