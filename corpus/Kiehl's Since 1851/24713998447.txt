This multi corrective eye cream is very useful for my eye zone problems. It is very hydrating and keeps my eye areas well moisturized for longer time I expected. It has been helping to reduce my under eye fine lines. It brightens my eye zone. I use it for my under eye fine lines, eye lids as well as brows zone. The texture us very good, not too thick or thin. Loved its packaging. I will continue using it for the best result. Very useful
