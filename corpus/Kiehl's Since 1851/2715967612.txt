I looooooove this oil so freaking much!! It feels amazing, hydrating and just luxurious. I keep it in my skincare fridge and the cooling effect takes it to another level. The only thing is that cannabis oil has a very distinct odour which isn’t necessarily bad but it does keep me from using it when i don’t feel like smelling it for an hour after putting it on. Regardless, I really do enjoy it and will def repurchase! nan
