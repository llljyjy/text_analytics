I have had a great experience with serum so far! It was very easy to set up and begin using. The small amount it dispenses is perfect - a little goes a long way. I started noticing a difference in fine lines after a mere five days! I canâ€™t wait to see how it continues to work on even deeper wrinkles. Very impressive serum!
