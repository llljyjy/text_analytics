I’ve been trialing this free sample for a while and I do like it. I have dark circles, which I haven’t noticed an improvement regarding, but I keep using it because it feels so darn good. I usually apply at night but sometimes I’m the morning also if I wake up and my skin feels hot or dry or irritated. It has a very cooling sensation (not tingly or minty, just the sense of getting slightly colder) as it moisturizes. I’ve even applied it to my lips a couple times when they were super cracked or chapped. I’m sure with the good ingredients that it also has great preventative properties. If it’s affordable, I may purchase it myself once the free sample I received runs out (it does seem to last a long time!) nan
