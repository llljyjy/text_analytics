I have used Kiehl’s products for years and have always had amazing results, so naturally I was excited when I got the opportunity to try their Fast Release Retinol Serum.I honestly wasn’t expecting to see really visible results as fast as I did, but within a week of use my wrinkles looked smoother and less noticeable. Even the deeper wrinkles on my forehead are less visible.For initial use, you must twist the retinol capsule onto the bottom of the bottle and shake well. Just a very small amount is all you need for each use, so this bottle should last for quite some time.Having used this serum for over the past two weeks, the results I see are getting better and better. Because I want younger looking skin, this product will remain as part of my everyday skincare routine! Thrilled with the results that I am seeing!
