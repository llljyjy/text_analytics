I live in Chicago, where winter means cold, wind, and excessively dry air. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream, which I received as a sample, is a standby product for me. It’s the only moisturizer I have found that truly repairs my skin after days outdoors (I’m very active and love hiking no matter the weather.) It’s lightweight and sinks in quickly, and makes my face feel like a dream. A forever repurchase. Midwest Winter Staple
