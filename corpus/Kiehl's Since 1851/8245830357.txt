I have tried this Keihls Overnight rehydrating mask and I am impressed my skin felt so soft in morning and I alsi feel that whiteheads and skin flakes all washed off easily with my Scrub cleanser. I was little worried about getting stained on pillows so I use a cloth on my pillow just to avoid any stain but it wasnâ€™t that bad.It feel little oily and sweaty when you apply but in just few minutes of massage it melts into skin.Works very well for my very dry flaky rough skin.I love my soft skin now.Will definitely recommend to all who are tired of trying different moisturizer for face.Its kind of Vaseline petroleum jelly like feeling once you applied. Nice hydrating mask.
