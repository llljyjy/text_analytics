After receiving this product to review, I began applying am and pm for puffiness and dark circles. Within a week, I could see that my fine lines seemed to appear less visible, I had less puffiness and the darkness under my eyes was less noticeable. After using it for about a month, I’m feeling more confident and comfortable without makeup in this area. I’ve always had young looking skin with no issues, but when 50 hits, the issues are real! I’ve tried no less than 25 eye products in the past 2 years and this is the only one I found to provide results. The only product that has worked for me!
