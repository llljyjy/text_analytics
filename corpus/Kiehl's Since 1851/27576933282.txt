I was a little reluctant to try this because of the price tag when there are many solid retinol options that are more affordable, but I’m a big fan of Kiehl’s products and was looking for a new stronger retinol, so I thought, why not! And I do like this a lot. The texture is a cream that doesn’t feel sticky or weird going on, and applies and absorbs nicely. Love that the formula includes ceramides and peptides, too! Best of all, it’s has given me the stronger results with my PIE that I was hoping for from using it the past several months. Sometimes I do experience some mild irritation/increased sensitivity the morning after I use this, but I have sensitive skin in general, and the key for me has been using minimal other products alongside it and sandwiching. nan
