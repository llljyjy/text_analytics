I tried different eye creams/gels and noticed that I cannot use all of them on the upper eye lid (burning sensation, dry skin, swelling - I had it all). My upper eye lid however is the “problem zone“, which looks tired and wrinkly (fine lines) in the morning.This is the first eye gel I can use under my eyes as well as on my upper eye lids. I lightly apply it after the serum and before the moisturizer in the morning and in the evening. It absorbs fast and hydrates the skin around the eyes well, making the skin look less tired and reducing fine lines. No bad smell, no sticky residue. Awesome cream
