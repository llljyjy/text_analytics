This serum works slow but eventually, I saw a difference in my dark spots and slight acne scars. My acne marks arent so bad but the little marks that have bothered me for ages have lightened. HOWEVER, I did get little bumps when I first started using the product. I switched up my moisturizers to see if that would solve it but it remained the same. Eventually, the problem got better but I’m particularly sensitive to products that react to my sensitive skin since you never really know if it’ll get better or worse. Overall, great for most skin types but you have to be consistent. Slow but steady
