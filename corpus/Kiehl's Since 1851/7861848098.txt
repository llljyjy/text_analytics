I don’t write reviews. I think this is the second review for sephora I’ve written in the past 5 years for sephora. Here’s what I’ll say - my skin has not been happy with me, it’s recently become very corse, very textured and overall no matter how much lotion I put on it, it never seems to hydrate.I decided it was time to mix up my lotions I was using and bought this on a whim. I used it last night and WOW. I woke up and while there’s still a little texture and dryness, my skin looked and felt soooo much better. After one use! You can use this up to 3x a week at night, but honestly this will probably be a 1x a week use for me unless my skin really needs it. Highly recommend if your skin is dry
