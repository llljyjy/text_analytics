I have been using Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum for a little over 8 weeks now. I have consistently used it in the morning. To be honest, looking back at the before/after photos I really can’t tell much of a difference. Perhaps my eyes are a little less red? It could also be a different lighting. With questionable results I will finish the bottle but will not be continuing after that. Maybe it worked better for others. nan
