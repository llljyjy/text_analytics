I’ve been looking for just the right night cream that wasn’t too heavy or greasy (I live in the Deep South). This Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery is so pillowy soft. It is still a thick cream, but the texture is lighter and it goes on so smoothly. You only need just a touch. It soaked into my skin immediately and never felt greasy. My skin just feels soft and hydrated. And the lavender scent is a bonus for me, especially before bed. After just one week’s use, I noticed the texture of my skin was better and brighter. I docked it one star just for those folks who hate or are allergic to Lavender, so if you’re not one of those folks, try it! Perfect night cream for me
