As a disclaimer, I definitely received this as a free sample. However, please don’t let that dissuade you from trying this out. I did a 12 week trial worh this product and it works. I’m black and highly melanated. I also have a little issue where I pop any pimple that appears on my face. More often than not, that leaves me with a mark. It usually fades, I haven’t experienced any permanent scarring, but it can take weeks or months! With this I’ve experienced fading in days. Maybe a week. It’s really good stuff. It WORKS
