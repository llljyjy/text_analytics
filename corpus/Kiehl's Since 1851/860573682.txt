I like the fact that you mix the product up yourself as it makes me believe the ingredients are fresh. I also like the applicator on the bottom as I don’t feel like I’m wasting product. I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks and haven’t seen any noticeable difference in my skin but products can take a while to work. I generally like Kiehl’s so I will continue to use to see if there is any difference. The serum is light and did not cause any dryness or irritation. nan
