Saw this at the Sephora store and I got super excited as I’ve been using the original ultra facial cream for years. I was like I can use this sunscreen one for morning and the original one at night but then I checked the ingredient list and it contains essential oils… why can’t they just use the same formula and just add the sunscreen ingredients? nan
