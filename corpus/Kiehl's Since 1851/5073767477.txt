I’ve always struggled with dark spots and uneven skin tone and this serum is the HOLY GRAIL! While it’s a bit more expensive than what I normally buy, it’s worth the extra bucks. I used this for a few months and my dark spots have IMPROVED significantly as well as my discoloration. Once I run out, I’m heading to the store for another bottle.As someone with sensitive skin and is peculiar about ingredients used, I recommend this to anyone looking for a dark spot solution.(there is a bit of fragrance from the peony and white birch) Ummm Yes PLEASE
