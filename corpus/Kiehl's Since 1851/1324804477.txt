Purchased this as an attempt to help treat dry skin on my eyelids and around my eyes. No fragrance, which is great. It has a thick creamy texture so it stays put and doesn’t slip into your eyes. Because it’s so thick I used it as an overnight mask. The dryness was slightly better, but my skin wasn’t absorbing it. It sat on top of my skin more like an occlusive type of moisturizer rather than hydrating like it claims. After a few weeks of using this unfortunately I started to get milia bumps as well. Will be tossing this out. Does not absorb and caused milia after a few weeks
