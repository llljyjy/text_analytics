I am scared of retinol, plain and simple. My moisture barrier is easily damaged and my face will flake and peel with the slightest change of my extremely delicate routine. I have aging skin and I am past time to incorporate a retinol but I’ve been dragging my feet. Enter Kiehls. I trust this brand and I am ecstatic to say this is a product that will remain in my routine even after this bottle is empty. I’ve been using it 2-3 times a week and heavily moisturizing in the middle. I love it. I’ve already seen improvement in my skin texture and fine lines and this is the only change. I’m excited! Scared of retinol?
