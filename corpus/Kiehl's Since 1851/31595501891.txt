I’m sorry that this is a little long but I want to do this product justice because it’s worth it (and I’m a babbler). I have been struggling with dry, sensitive skin for many years now. My skin is dry year round because I just do not produce very much oil. I have spent so much money on expensive skincare trying to find a moisturizer that will work with no luck. I can’t even use Cerave on my face because something in it irritates me. I had recently purchased one of those Sephora $10 deluxe sample bags and realized this was one of the products included in it so I decided to browse the reviews here and they convinced me to try it. No joke, the very first time I put this on my face the heavens opened up and angels started singing! Well, ok that didn’t happen but you get the picture! Immediately my face felt more hydrated than it has for a good 20 years now. I immediately ordered a bigger jar. Not once has this made my sensitive skin sting, even when applying it after I dermaplane with a surgical 10 blade. The instant and long term effects have been nothing short of amazing. I have not had dry patches on my face at all. That in itself is crazy. It plays well with my tretinoin when others make it pill, It absorbs fast enough to be used morning and night, it works wonders with my moringa oil and I have recently added polyglutamic acid with no problems as well. It could be the squalene in it that my skin has needed all these years, not sure, but I cannot believe I waited this long to try this miracle moisturizer. If you have also struggled with dry skin for a long time, I highly recommend giving this moisturizer a try. The texture itself is wonderfully light and non sticky which makes you wonder how on earth it is so moisturizing but it really is. If you really want some results then apply pure, cold pressed moringa oil at night on top of it to lock it in and watch your skin transform! A Miracle for Dry, Sensitive Skin
