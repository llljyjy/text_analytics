When I first tried out the Kiel’s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask it was more of a balm than a mask per say. But it is very smoothing and hydrating. It’s a bit of a hard balm that has to be broken down to a balm that you layer on your skin. It is very effective and after using the cream for over a week I noticed my skin has become softer and more smooth. Very hydrating!
