I received this serum thru Bzz Agent and was very excited to try it and it is WONERFULL!!!! had a little burning sensation the first 2 nights but after that it just felt good to apply. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and lines are starting to fade a little but I found it helped with my large pores I just hope I can afford it after mine is gone. nan
