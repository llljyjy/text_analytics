This is a wonderful face cream. It absorbs nicely and leaves no unwanted residue or peeling. Layers perfectly in my 6-step skincare regime. I really like how quickly it’s absorbed and the faint scent. Not too thick imo and lasts longer than an expensive cream I had been using. The effects are quick and I still feel moisturized after a few days and have no itchiness, so I’m making the switch permanent. My face is happy!
