Good Eye cream!  I noticed a difference in less than a few days of using this eye cream.  I like that it can be applied directly to the eyelids.  My eye area was immediately moisturized and visibly lifted.  After five days of use I noticed less fine lines and puffiness.   It’s gentle and does not a have a strong or noticeable sent. Some eye creams cause burning and tearing when applied too close to the eyelids that was not the case with Kiehl’s.  Goes on smooth and doesn’t peel or feel sticky. Yes to this Eye Cream!
