I was absolutely skeptical about whether an eye cream would have noticeable results for me but ended up pleasantly surprised! After using this mighty for one week, my underlying area was brighter, less puffy, and fine lines were way less prominent.  The treatment is moisturizing but not greasy and I really loved everything about it. I thought I would never pay this much for a skin care product but I am absolutely converted- this one is a winner! Impressed!
