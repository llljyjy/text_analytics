I truly enjoyed this product. The smell was fine, the texture was fine, and application was easy. Though it took a lot of shaking to get it all mixed together when I first got it, in the end it was ok. I would purchase it again, because I saw a noticeable difference in my skin. This was my first time using retinol, so I cannot compare it to others, but I would recommend this one to people. Something different.
