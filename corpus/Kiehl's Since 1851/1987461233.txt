This arrived at the perfect time as you know Florida is having its “winter days“ and my skin has been a little dry and flaky. Wish the packing was clear & glass vs plastic but like that the product is solid vs liquidity like some other masks you may have tried. The concsitensity reminds me a bit of shea butter when you see it I dab a little in my finger and it melts instantly.I like to put it on overnight as well as 15-minute treatment on my face ( I also use it on my hands). It leaves your skin super soft and hydrated I wash off with a mild face wash.If you have dry flaky skin/ just dry skin I would tell you to try it; because it leaves your skin feeling dewy (if you have oily skin I would avoid this). I would buy it again if I were going somewhere cold or our next winter. Like with all the products I normally get I try to get a sample to see if it works with my combo skin. It did not make me break out which I liked, but it does have a light scent (guessing it is the squalene). nan
