This is one of the best night lip balm that I ever used. It smells very sweet, like cocoa butter and vanilla, very indulgent but light. The texture is not too thick, it stays on all night and when you wake up in the morning your lips are silky smooth. I am almost out of it, because I love it so much. :) The best night lip balm :)
