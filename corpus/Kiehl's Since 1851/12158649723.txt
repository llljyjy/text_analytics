I thought I’d give this a try as a replacement to my current retinol serum. I like the packaging but the product itself i snot for me. I wasn’t fond of out it absorbed into my skin nor how it layered with my other products. I think it would work for some people with different skin types or different products in their routine. Didn't work well with my other products
