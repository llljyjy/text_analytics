If you’re looking for a departure from the usual retinol experience, Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum is it. From the initial release of the powder into the serum, to shaking up the bottle, to the unique way of using the product. From start to finish this is a completely different way of approaching prepping and distributing product. I did experience the typical dryness and flushing that I usually do when trying a new retinol; however, it didn’t last long. The product did what a promise to do. The only thing missing in my opinion was that glow that I typically have when using a lot of other high and retinols. I do love Kiehl’s products and will definitely consider purchasing this in the future as part of my skin care routine. The Future of Retinol
