This cream is a very rich cream. It doesnâ€™t feel greasy too heavy on your face but it is thick! This has made my face feel so hydrated and makes my face feel look so refreshed in the mornings. I also love the scent. It is similar to some aromatherapy items I have bought to help me relax before bed so this was a nice addition! Overall this is a great night cream and I will continue to use it. Hydrate & Relax
