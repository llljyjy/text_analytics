I’m a big fan of this retinol serum. I’ve been using it every night for about the past month, and I feel like I’ve finally found the right retinol for me. Other retinol serums that I have tried have either irritated or dried out my skin. This one does not irritate my skin. I apply a night cream to my face after the retinol has fully absorbed, and I haven’t experienced any dry skin as a result. I will definitely keep using this product.The only negative is that I feel like the powdered retinol never fully dissolved into the serum. It still feels a little gritty when I apply it to my skin. Great retinol for sensitive skin
