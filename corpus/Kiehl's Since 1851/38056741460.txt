I have really been enjoying this moisturizer.  I have used three other moisturizers before this and I am starting to feel a bit like Goldilocks.  So, what am I loving about this one?It has a nice extremely light scent.  I smell it when I put it on, but my husband has yet to be able to smell it. I actually look forward too using it.  I can’t wait until it is time to put it on. A little goes a long way.  I don’t feel like I need more than a dab. I already see results in just a few days.  My dry skin is already looking happier and has become a lot softer. wowed
