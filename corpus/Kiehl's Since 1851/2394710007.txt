I gave this to my mom to use after I did. Let’s just say I have to get me another one. She absolutely loved it. It gave our skin so much moisture and life back. My mom decided to try it on her hands since they were dry. She was surprised the cream worked amazingly not only for her face but her hands as well. It’s extremely lightweight and not greasy like other creams. I have extremely oily skin but this cream didn’t make my skin even more oily. It actually felt like it reduced it. If you’re looking for a facial cream that can be multi use, this is a must have. Stock up if you can but a little goes a long way. You don’t need more than dime size. Best Facial Cream
