I really wanted to like this eye cream because Kiehl’s has always been a reputable brand to me, and I use other products from them, but this eye cream didn’t really do much. The pictures included with this review were taken 9 days apart, and I can barely tell the difference between the two, other than a tiny reduction of the fine lines on my right eyelid (the left eyelid in the pictures). Overall, the best thing I can say about it is that it’s a decent moisturizer, and the texture feels awesome, but in terms of delivering the promised effects, I didn’t see much in the results. I’m also not sure it’s worth the price tag, for me at least. It’s a good moisturizer
