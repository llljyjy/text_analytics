At first i thought it would be too heavy, but I love this Kiehlâ€™s super Multi-Corrective anti aging eye cream because it is not oily, it absorbs well and keeps my skin feeling hydrated.  I have used it for 3 weeks now and i can see a difference.  My eyes are not so puffy.  It has lighten my dark circles too.  I would recommend someone to try this product. Absorbs nicely
