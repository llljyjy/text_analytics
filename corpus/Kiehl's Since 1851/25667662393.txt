I was excited to try this new retinol night serum. The packaging is very easy to use after you mix the powder and the liquid and shake. Dispensing the product is simple, simply depress the small button on the bottom and the serum will come out. I applied this to clean dry skin daily after my shower and was pleased that I had almost no scent and I didnâ€™t experience any irritation. I took before and after photos in the similar lighting, I do feel after about 2 weeks of use that my skin achieved more clarity. I like the quality of the product, and I think I will continue to purchase this to help reduce some of the lines and spots. Clean delivery system, good for sensitive skin,
