I have been using this daily at night for about a month. I liked the packaging and “freshness“ of the powder and mixing this myself. The product is a little grainy and has the consistency of a serum. I had already been using a different retinol before this, but this was very non-irritating and didn’t dry my skin. I think it’s still too early to see results, but my skin looks healthy. It’s definitely light enough to use with a cream or moisturizer over it. And always use plenty of sunscreen when using retinol! Time  will tell
