This moisturizer was fine, but not spectacular. I was sent it for free to test for two months and in that time I did not see a difference in my undereye circles or lines, but I didn’t expect to. The texture of the cream is nice and I found it absorbed very quickly for such a thick cream. It had a pleasant scent and didn’t cause my eyes or skin any irritation though I found that the first time I applied it, it stung a little bit. Possibly the vitamin C, as I’ve noticed this with other vitamin C products, but it didn’t persist and I saw no adverse effects. nan
