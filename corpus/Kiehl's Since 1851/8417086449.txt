Great retinol product. It does not cause any irritation or sensitivity. Great for acne prone skin. My breakouts were definitely reduced and even helped with scarring and pigmentation. Fine lines around my eyes seemed muted. Will continue to use and hopefully see more and better results long-term. Definitely recommend. Canâ€™t go wrong with this brand. A little goes a long way and the bottle lasts a good amount of time if you are conservative with application. Easy Retinol
