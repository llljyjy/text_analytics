I was so happy to receive this complimentary Kiehl’s retinol serum to try and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! I’ve been using it a little over a month now and my skin has never looked better!! it really has helped me feel more confident, all those little fine lines are vanishing and my skin just looks so much younger and healthier. it’s pricey but it works and that’s the most important thing.  I’d rather pay more for a good product.  kiehls never disappoints. nan
