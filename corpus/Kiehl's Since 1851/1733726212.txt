I love this stuff! My face is a combination of dry patchy skin along with super oil skin. This stuff evened out my skin in just a few nights. Unfortunately you aren’t supposed to use this every night but the few times a week that I did use it it made a huge difference to my skin. Most other overnight creams make me breakout because they over hydrate but Kiels did it again! Do your skin a favor and try this. Especially if you are in your 30s like me. This container will go a long way too. You only need a little bit, you rub between your fingers to turn it into what they call an oil and rub on your skin. It’s quick, mess free, and hydrating. Enjoy! Your skin will be thankful!
