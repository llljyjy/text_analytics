Honestly I’m not 100% sure it’s doing anything but I like how it feels on my skin. It’s great just after a shower to start my skincare regiment. Also, honestly it lasts me forever. If you use it as recommended it lasts me roughly 6 months and I end up using more than suggested simply because I shave my head and use my skincare all over. Snake oil potentially but pleasant
