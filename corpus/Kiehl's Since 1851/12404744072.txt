My favorite former coworker who has a second job at Sephora recommended this to me, she gave me a sample size and I ended up buying the full size. I use this when my pores need declogging, it makes my pores very clean and small but doesn’t dry out my face at all. You can use this a couple times per week if you need to without getting dry skin. I used to use a mask by another brand that was $20 more expensive and left my skin super dry, so I’m quite happy with this one. It’s a bit pricey but I’ll probably buy more when I run out. Great for clearing pores without drying out skin
