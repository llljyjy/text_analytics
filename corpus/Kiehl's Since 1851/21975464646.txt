I love that this product is very light weight. Doesn’t feel like it’s caked on no matter how much you put on. Though I will say very little product is needed to moisturize your whole face. I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizing cream did not break my skin out so that’s a plus for me. I like that it does not have a scent to it. I definitely recommend for people with combination skin or even dry skin. Works well
