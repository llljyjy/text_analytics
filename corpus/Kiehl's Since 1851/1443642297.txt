This formula was a bit different than any other one I’ve used. A lot of them are runny, too lquid-y, or sticky, but this had a different consistency. It was like a whipped moisturizer. It was really easy to dispense and apply, but it did apply a little thickly. The smell was also really pleasant. It had a hint of citrus but was not overwhelming in any way. I noticed a very slight difference in my under-eye lines and the 11’s between my eyebrows, but I think you’d need to use this longer to see substantial improvement. I would purchase this so I could give it a longer shot at improving my fine lines. nan
