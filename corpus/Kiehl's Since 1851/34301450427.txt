I really like the Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum and I love the Kiehlâ€™s brand.  I have tried a lot of different Retinol products from drug stores AND department./beauty stores.  This one seems to work the best for me.  I do like that when I opened the package it had directions on how to mix the retinol into the product which to me made the product seem fresher than premixed retinol creams.  It was super simple to do and took seconds.  The results of the serum have been noticeable.  My skins texture is smoother and I see less sun damage.  In general my skin appears healthier and younger.  I will use this product again. Great Stuff!!
