I canâ€™t say enough about this eye cream! It goes on smoothly, and has a consistency somewhere between a gel and a cream. It gives a mildly cooling sensation, and absorbs evenly into the skin. I noticed almost immediately that my fine lines around my eyes were filling in, and after using this product daily for several weeks, the fine lines around my eyes are almost invisible now. Also, my dark circles have lightened. This is the only eye cream that has managed to lighten my very dark circles. I have noticed a tightening of the skin above my eyes, and the hooded area is tighter as well and less hooded. This eye cream is absolutely worth the money. When used as directed, it will last you a very long time. I expect my jar will last me at least three months! Eye lift in a jar!
