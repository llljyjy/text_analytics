This moisturizer is a little too thick for my liking and it seems to not last very long. The fact that it had barrier repair is a plus. I personally probably would not but it again just because I prefer a moisturizer that lasts all day. I would recommend it to some one whose skin is a little less dry and doesnâ€™t need much moisturization Decent
