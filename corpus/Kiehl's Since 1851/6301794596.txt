I honestly am so impressed with the moisture this baby packs. I don’t know why it’s in some of our heads that in order to really do anything, moisturizers need to be thick and heavy. My skin just drinks this up and it makes me feel like I just have naturally hydrated skin it’s so light. Feels clean and is very gentle, I like that it has no scent. My skin in the winter gets so dry and red but Kiehl’s has my back with this one - a  no brainer. nan
