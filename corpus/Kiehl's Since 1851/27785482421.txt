I love this Retinol fast-release wrinkle reducing night serum, it’s a clean and lightweight serum that targets about the fine lines, wrinkles, uneven texture and loss of firmness. It comes with a bottle of night serum and a capsule of fast release retinol powder. I like the idea to activated the pure retinol infused powder into the serum.I have been using retinol skincare for a while, I’ve got some slight peeling at first but my skin is glowing after month. I especially like Keihl’s retinol fast release night serum as I can see the result in a week, I don’t have deep wrinkle but I can see my forehead and cheek are brighter, glowing and full of elasticity. I’m having more youthful skin and I’m sure the result would be more visible when I finish the bottle. For sure, I will highly recommend to my friend and family. Love my glowing skin
