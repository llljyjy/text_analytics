I use sephora like social media and am always looking for new products, and generally switch up my skin care often. This is the one single item I have been using for over 8 years. The product size is generous and it is so moisturizing. Every other eye cream left my skin as dry as the Mojave desert moisturizer like no other. 100000000 stars
