I have used this product pretty regularly since I received it 6 weeks ago and I can say I definitely have noticed a difference in my skin tone and the evenness of it.  My skin is so soft and smooth not to mention so evenly toned.  I plan on continuing to use this even after my bottle is gone.  The price is higher  than I would normally pay for something but the bottle lasts long time and I think overall the benefit of this is worth way more than the price. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
