I got a sample of this last time I was at Sephora and used it up in about 2 weeks (almost daily application as a spot treatment). I think there was a noticeable difference and I agree with others about the rapid clearing up of maskne scars - hooray! I also agree with the reviews that mention wishing the product was just a liiiiiittle bit more effective for the price point (still haven’t decided whether I will buy a full 1 ounce bottle after finishing the sample). Here’s what I’ll say about dry skin - yes, this product does sort of dry out places where you apply it. The directions say to use this under a moisturizer. So my night-time routine with this was to wash my face, use my favorite toner (Good Juju Herbal, what is good!) then use this product and apply a moisturizer and then restorative face oil to lock it all in (occlusive barrier for the win, people). Overall, I would recommend it! Just wish it was more budget-friendly :) Effective on maskne, follow with a moisturizer
