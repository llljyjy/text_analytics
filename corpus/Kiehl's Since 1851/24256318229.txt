I received a full size sample of the Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Eyezone Treatment as a Bzzagent and I cannot rave enough about this product!I am 56 years old and haven’t worn eyeshadow in several years because my eyelids have begun to droop considerably and since I’ve been using the Kiehl’s eye cream, I have been able to see some lifting and firming of my lids! Yay! I’ve also noticed that the fine lines in the corner of my eyes are tightening!Thank you so much for sending me this product! I absolutely love it and highly recommend it! I love this eye cream!!!
