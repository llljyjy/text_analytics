When I opened the jar, it reminded me of  freshly whipped cream. It has a nice whipped consistency and and somehow it lies between a thick cream and a serum.  I am using it in summers on alternate days with the retinol to balance out the skin barrier.  So far I’ve not seen breakouts or pilling. It’s still a little early toConclude anything but I always feel this cloud cream will work the best if used as a final layer after using actives. Fluffy creamy goodness
