I am glad I tried Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution. It definitely had a brightening effect on my skin. After consistent use for some time it did fade a couple of dark spots that I have. I was surprised it worked as well as it did and it worked without drying out or otherwise disrupting my skin’s texture which was really nice. I am happy with the results I got from this product. nan
