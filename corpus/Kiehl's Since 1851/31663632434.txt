This little jar of eye cream goes a long way!  It doesn’t take much to make your eyes look good!  I put it all around my eyes and my husbands.  It left the skin feeling soft but not oily.  I feel that it id did help to improve the darkness under my eyes a bit.  It moisturized the corners where we have a few lines starting to show.  It overall improved my facial appearance around my eyes.  I also like that it isn’t really fragrant or overpowering. Love this eye cream!
