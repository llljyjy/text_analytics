Outstanding, Kiehl’s! I was using a different overnight mask for my wintertime dry skin, but my skin became reactive to it, so I was compelled to try this one when it launched. I tried this mask with no expectations because my skin can be finicky, but I’m excited to say it’s amazing and it has been a savior for my dry skin. The consistency starts as a balm but then transforms and develops “slip” once massaged onto the skin. It becomes a cushiony, soft, almost oil-balm texture and it’s very rich, so make sure you pin your hair back because it will get stuck in the mask overnight. This product has saved the skin around my orbital area (not my immediate eye area, but the skin just outside and around that area), because I thought I’d be brave and use my retinoid cream during winter. I thought I would never get that dry area back to normal, but this mask has done the trick! This overnight mask from Kiehl’s couldn’t have launched at a better time, I hope they never stop making it!
