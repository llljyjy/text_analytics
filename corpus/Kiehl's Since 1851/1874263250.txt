After over a year of using The Ordinary Retinol (which I love and Very happy with), I was extremely skeptical about trying this one. Once i received it I was completely weirded out with the powder you have to mix (which ended up being the BEST THING EVER). Since I have started it I’m noticing more and more results every week. My face is clearing of blemishes, dry patches, red discoloration and so on. YOU NEED TO GIVE RETINOL TIME AND PATIENCE or it won’t work.  My skin is so plump and smooth.  It actually did a way better job than the ordinary retinol.  I highly recommend this one Best I've tried so far
