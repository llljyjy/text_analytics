Liked the packaging in that you have to mix the product whenever you are ready to start using. Does take a bit of work to mix the powder in well. Feels lightweight on the skin and did start to notice a chance in my skin after a few uses. I have dry/oily skin and I noticed a slight bit of dryness so I started off with every other day usage and worked myself up. My skin looked brighter after using this and my texture was not as noticeable. My fine lines appear slightly smaller. Will definitely purchase this for continued use. Do recommend moisturizer and sunblock with this product. nan
