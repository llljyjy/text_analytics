Compared to other Vitamin C products, Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum holds up nicely! This eye serum is hydrating and lightweight. After weeks of testing this product, I found that my under eye looked more hydrated and ‘plump’. I saw a minimal improvement in my dark circles, but I also was not sleeping 7-8 hours consistently (which can affect dark circles, regardless of products used). I believe a number of factors contribute to skincare, and water/diet/sleep definitely contribute to dark circles! I would purchase this item again, but would feel more motivated to do so if there was a sale. Love Vitamin C!
