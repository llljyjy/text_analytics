I enjoy this cleanser a lot. It’s very concentrated so you only need the smallest amount. I apply it to my face in the shower. It does go on a little thick, then I add a little water to lather then throw my head under the water to rinse. Because you only need a little it’s actually lasted me months. I think it’s a good value for a higher quality cleanser. I don’t have sensitive skin. I do find it cleanses thoroughly without stripping and I wear full face makeup almost daily. Definitely repurchasing. Recommend! Lasts a long time
