I wanted to love this because dermatologists are always hyping the importance of using vitamin C and I have always heard such great things about Kiehls products. Unfortunately, the Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum didn’t live up to my expectations. It is a decent product, but I didn’t really see any significant changes in the eight weeks I used the product. Plus, for the price of Kiehls products, I was excepting a better wow factor. Honestly, I would still purchase my cheaper vitamin C products of this one. Ok but no wow factor
