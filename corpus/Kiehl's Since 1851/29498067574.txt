I had been given this product for free by BuzzAgent in return leaving my review for them and Sephora. I left a 3 star rating because it didn’t leave my face greasy feeling it felt more like a tightening feeling when using but it didn’t lighten my face at all. It may work for different skin types but it didn’t mine at all so I don’t recommend this product especially for the price .. I am thankful I was given the opportunity to try it out though and thank you #BuzzAgent and Sephora for giving me that opportunity. Wasn't for me doesn't mean its not for you
