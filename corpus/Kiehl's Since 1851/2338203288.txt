So I have combination skin. My cheeks are usually quite dry and tight, I especially feel dryness around my mouth. This is quite a rich and thick cream. So I immediately knew it would be good for those areas. I have started using in my evening routines, targeting my dry areas. It feels so good and works very very well. Iâ€™d imagine folk with dry skin will especially enjoy this one. Good job Kiehls! great for dryness
