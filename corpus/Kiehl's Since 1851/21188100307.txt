This was my first time trying anything from Kiehl’s and I have to say I was very pleased with this product. Just like its name “Cloud Cream“, it has such a nice texture. I have oily skin, and this cream absorbed so nicely and kept me moisturized, without feeling oily whatsoever. It made my skin feel so soft and tender. I wore it at night, and I also wore it under my makeup. Both ways worked wonderful! It has such a nice scent and such a rich texture. Just like its name...
