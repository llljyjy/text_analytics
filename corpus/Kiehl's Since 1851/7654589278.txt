I’ve enjoyed testing this product. It was given to me for free in exchange for an honest review. The product isn’t as harsh on the skin as similar products can be and I experienced no adverse reactions of excessive dryness. The small wrinkles on my forehead did seem to be less noticeable. My whole face definitely looked more polished and brighter beginning after just one application. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!I appreciated the component. The retinol powder is separate from the serum and you mix them together when you open the product. There is a button on the bottom of the package that dispenses a tiny amount when you push it that keeps you from dispensing too much product. Overall I enjoyed this and I recommend it. Not too harsh!
