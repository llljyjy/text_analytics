Iâ€™ve been using this product every morning for the past few days and I feel like it is making a bit of a difference in my dark circles. The product is called a serum, but the look and texture of the formula is definitely more like the texture of a cream. It goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin nicely. It is very hydrating and brightens the undereye area immediately after application. There is no scent that I can detect, which I prefer when it comes to products that go near the eyes, or face in general.  I would definitely recommend this product for undereye improvement.
