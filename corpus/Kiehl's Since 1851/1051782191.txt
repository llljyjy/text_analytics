I used this product for three months in an effort to reduce the hyper-pigmentation and bags under my eyes. Prior to that, I was going through the a number of mixtures , tinctures, serums , etc.  to address the issue to and I saw no improvement. The skin under my eyes was so much darker than the rest of my skin, that it was difficult disguise even with concealer and foundation because I would still end up with two different colors in that area, with the under eye area appearing “chalky“. I have been using  Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution for about three months and CANNOT believe how well it has worked. The results were hardly overnight, but after consistent use, the area under my eyes is approaching its previous hue! I applied Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution to the area under my eyes and in general, on my entire face after cleansing and before completing the rest of my regular skincare routine. Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution did NOT in any way irritate my super-sensitive skin. My skin is beginning to have a pore-less appearance. The affected area also, does not look bleached or lighter than it originally was. Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution quite literally is Corrective. The relief is unbelievable. No more mixing concealers and highlighters (that would later settle into folds and small wrinkles in the skin, crease, or give me an oily look). No more constant blotting. The solution did not negatively react with any of the other skincare products I use and the overall condition of my skin has improved.  I didn’t think it could happen. Gently restores skin to natural pigment !
