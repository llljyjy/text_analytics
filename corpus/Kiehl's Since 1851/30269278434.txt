The midnight recovery omega-rich cloud cream has earned a permanent spot in my nighttime routine. It feels so light and fresh on my face. It’s thick and creamy in texture but absorbs effortlessly into  the skin. It doesn’t leave any greasy/tacky residue behind. The lavender scent soothes and calms me before bedtime. My skin feels so soft, smooth and supple in the morning. I would definitely recommend this cream to my friends and family. Amazing !
