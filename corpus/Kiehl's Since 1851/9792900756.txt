At first when I started to use this product it gave me a few bumps but that went away a few days later. I didn’t have many wrinkles to begin with but the fine lines are gone and it’s smooth and soft. The product design is fun and easy to use. This product smells nice and isnt sticky. I used two pumps at first on my face and after that I just did spot treatments and that was fine. This product did what it claimed that it would do and I even noticed the difference in just two days of using it. Yes I would recommend this to someone who needs it if it’s in your budget then go for it you won’t be disappointed. what wrinkles haha
