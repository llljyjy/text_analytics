I am really loving the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask with 10.5% Squalene. I suffer from really dry skin, especially on my face, and it usually is hard for me to find a long lasting moisturizer. This Rehydration Mask left my skin feeling soft and fully hydrated. It is very easy to apply, and I added it to my bedtime skincare routine. I just apply it on my face right before bedtime, and wake up with my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. This is definitely a keeper, and I would highly recommend adding Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask to your skincare routine , especially if you suffer from dry skin. Soft Hydrated Skin
