I really liked this product at first I wasn’t too sure. I didn’t really have dark eyes, but the little I did I started to see if fade away. The biggest change was the skin above eye started to not droop as much. The first few days my skin did feel a little irritated, I have very sensitive skin, but it went away. I would recommend this to anyone who has dark circles or looking to tighten up the skin around the eyes. I received this as a free gift from BzzAgent Must Try
