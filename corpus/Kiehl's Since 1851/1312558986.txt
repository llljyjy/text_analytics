I had a Jessner’s peel and this arrived on day six. Most of the skin had flaked off but I felt parched and dehydrated. One night of this mask and I was in much better shape! It even reduced the redness from areas that skin rubbed off before it was quite ready. The next day, I used it again with LRP Toleriane sunscreen and I wasn’t even slightly greasy. I’m not positive it would feel good on freshly peeled skin, but I had no sensitivity at the point I used it. The texture was surprising at first but does melt down once you get past the top layer. It feels like non-greasy butter and even feels lighter than the Josie Maran face butter. I’ve never found a Kiehls product that I thought was a must-have, but this is on my list now! Sorcery!
