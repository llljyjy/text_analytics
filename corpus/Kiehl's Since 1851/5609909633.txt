My skin is very sensitive and I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks from breakouts. This product has significantly reduced the dark spots and made my skin brighter and more clear. I love that it absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy residue. I apply it morning and night before my moisturizer. Love this product and am excited to continue using it for even better results! Great for Acne Marks
