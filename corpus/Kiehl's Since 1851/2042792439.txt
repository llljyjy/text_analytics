I feel like I saw the biggest difference in the dark spot (old acne scar) on my forehead within the first couple of weeks. It is slightly lighter/less red. I have not noticed any changes from those long-term. Also, I had to be really careful about applying to my forehead only and washing my hands after because it made me severely break out around my nose and chin. Itâ€™s been almost 6 weeks since I started only applying to my forehead and my skin is still trying to heal from that. Works OK
