I’ve been curious about trying a wrinkle reducing serum  so I was excited to use this one from Kiehls. I like the separate retinol cap, knowing I just mixed a ‘fresh’ serum for myself. I was afraid it wasn’t mixed thoroughly but I always shake it before use. I applied a tiny amount to my laugh lines (the only wrinkles I care about). I’m seeing a smoothness to the area, not completely gone but not as noticeable. I’m not expecting them to disappear but I like they’re not the first things I notice. Definitely going to stay in my night time regimen. Seeing results!
