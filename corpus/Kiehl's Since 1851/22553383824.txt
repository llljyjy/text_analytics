This is an anti-aging eye cream that brightens, lifts, smoothes and de-puffs the eyes and eye area. After using this cream for a week (not using any anti-aging products, just cleanse, tone, eye cream, and moisturize) I noticed that my crow’s feet lines were lighter, less noticable. I use this twice a day, not too much because I have oily skin so I always use a light hand when applying anything to my face, it feels cool going on and absorbs well into my skin. One of the things that the sets this eye cream apart from the rest is that you apply it to the complete eye area, I love that! I have already recommended this cream to one person and I plan on buying a couple jars for gifts, and when I run out I’ll definitely be buying another jar. I have quite a few different eye creams that I own because I’m always looking for that special one, this has quickly become that special one for me. I even call it an eye lift in a jar. I received this complementary in exchange for my review. Love this awesome eye cream
