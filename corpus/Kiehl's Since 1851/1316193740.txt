I am a fair to medium toned skin shade with dark splotches on my lower cheeks. I feel like I’ve tried every product, every service, etc. to minimize the discoloration but the second I step outside, they darken right back up. (Yes, I wear spf50 daily.) I received this sample in my order, have been applying daily for a little over a week, and ¡voilà! my face hasn’t had this even of a skin tone since before my teen years! Most definitely recommend this brew!! TheMagicPotion
