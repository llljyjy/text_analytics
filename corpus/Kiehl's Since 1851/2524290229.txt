I have combo/oily skin and this is one of the best moisturizers on the market. It’s not too thick but not too watery. It’s the perfect consistency to make your face feel super moisturized. Although I can be a little oily, this does not increase any oiliness for me. It’s seriously perfect! I also have sensitive skin and did not receive any breakouts or rashes from this product. I would recommend this for anyone. My favorite moisturizer!
