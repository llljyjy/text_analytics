I am always spectacle when it comes to claims of lightning and dark spots. I was very happy to find that the serum actually did what it was supposed to do. My skin looks a lot more even and there are some major spots that have faded.  There was no irritation which was really nice and it it worked great with my night creams and was easily integrated into my evening skin care regime. I prefer to use it at night because it didn’t work as well with my foundation and moisturizer during the day. I totally recommend this because it’s really amazing! Our skin takes anywhere from 28 days to 35 days to make a turnover so you definitely want to give a product a couple of months before you expect to see anything major.  I will definitely be keeping this in my skin care collection Lives up to its promises
