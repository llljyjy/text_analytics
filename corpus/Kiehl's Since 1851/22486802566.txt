my skin is acne prone and I definitely broke out when I started using this product which is expected when it comes to retinol products. overtime my skin got used to it and I love what it did to my skin after few weeks of using it. I get lesser breakouts now, my hyperpigmentation from past breakouts has lightened and the texture of my skin improved. overall it made my skin glowing. Hands down the best starter retinol serum iâ€™ve ever used. life changing results
