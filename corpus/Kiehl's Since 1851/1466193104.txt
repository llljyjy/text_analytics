- Pros: hydrating.- Cons: hard to remove, feels waxy, like butter. Does not soak in.— Overall it’s way too thick, even for my dry skin. It’s super thick, hard to apply and then even harder to wash off. Won’t work with just water. Use wipes or I had to use 3 times my face wash. I would not leave it overnight as it literally feels like there is wax/butter on your face and it won’t sink in. I might try it again one day but would not purchase again. Too wax like feeling
