I purchased this during the Spring Sephora VIB sale and have been using it twice a day almost daily since. Upon initial application my skin didn’t respond well, but this is the first product that I’ve ever used that ferulic acid and I knew that my skin just had to get used to it. Now that I’ve been using it for a few months, I think I can finally give an honest review. I can’t even begin to describe how this makes my skin look. I’ve received countless compliments about my skin over the past few months since using it. I have dry sensitive skin that doesn’t play nice with all skincare or makeup. It has improved the texture on my face especially around my mouth from wearing masks for work. I can see the difference in my skin if I don’t use it for more than two days. I saw the biggest improvement when I started using it twice a day during my morning and nighttime skincare routine. I could see a bit of difference when I began using it once a day, but the change was night and day once I started using it twice a day. If you have dry sensitive skin like me, I suggest working your way to using it once daily and then up to twice a day. Love this product and have barely made a dent. Will repurchase for sure! nan
