I thought this worked pretty well. I waited a while, and used it everyday so that I can see if there was a noticeable difference. Iâ€™m constantly tired and sometimes my under eye area can seem dark, and embarrassing.  This did help quite a bit. I noticed my under eye area seemed brighter, and less puffy. Using this everyday did not affect my makeup in any way. nice and bright.
