Honestly, even if it was more affordable I wouldn’t repurchase. There are better products out there for dark spots. I got a sample size of this, used it twice a day every day until it was empty, and nothing. No change. It’ll lighten a bit right after I apply it, but the spots come back within 10 minutes. I’m sure it works for some people, but there are much more effective products for me that I would not repurchase this. too expensive, not effective
