I’ve had this bottle for over 6 months and it’s at about 70% capacity still! A little goes a long way, gives a beautiful glow without the greasy or oily look. Not a staple item since it’s just an essence but it’s a definite treat yourself moment if you’re on the fence. I would’ve never bought this if I didn’t receive a sample of it first. Bottle lasts forever!
