I’m 50 years old and live in the Arizona desert so two things against me when it comes to skin Care. I’ve been using this product for about 2 and 1/2 weeks now I cannot say I’ve noticed a significant difference in the diminishing of dark circles, but I have noticed my skin is softer, smoother, my pores are smaller and that to me is enough for me to buy this product again. Maybe with longer use there will be a significant change in my pigmentation and making my dark circles lighter. I would definitely buy this product and recommend it. The benefits noticed not described but love
