I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few days now and I’m so pleased! I have always been a fan of Kiehl’s since the brand was recommended to me by a friend a few years ago. This cream is not greasy or chalky, it’s smooth, mid-weight and absorbs quickly and fully. My skin has been incredibly dry recently and this took care of flakes and dryness, allowing for a smooth makeup application (and a boost of confidence!). It also doesn’t pill (before or after foundation) like a lot of other moisturizers I have used. I also appreciate the nice, hydrating ingredients like squalene. nan
