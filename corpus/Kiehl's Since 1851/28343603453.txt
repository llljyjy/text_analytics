I recently moved up north and am experiencing my first real winter. This mask has been a lifesaver. When you open it up it has a hard balm like texture that warms up easily in your hands. It doesn’t have a scent which is great for my sensitive skin. I apply a thin layer and it absorbs to give a glow. It’s not too oily to wear it will leave residue on my pillow as I sleep. I can tell a noticeable difference the mornings that I use this. I have dry skin but it’s also done wonders for my partners oily skin! nan
