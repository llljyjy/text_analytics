So far, so good. It’s only been 2 or so weeks so I can’t really speak on effectiveness or changes in my skin. What I’ll say is the smell is lovely (a light lavender scent), it’s non greasy (I do my night routine right before bed and i haven’t had any transfer of product to my pillowcases), it pairs well with my retinol serum (I use the serum before I apply the oil), and the bottle dispenses fine (it has a dropper). My dry skin seems to like the oil but at this early stage, I can’t tell if it works/if my skin seems hydrated better than my night moisturizer. I’ll finish the bottle to judge better. So Far, So Good
