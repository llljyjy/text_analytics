I got this as a free sample with another purchase and was so pleasantly surprised. It’s awesome!! I don’t often use essences or toners, but this stuff immediately became a step I looked forward to in my skin care routine The smell was a bit funky the first couple of times, but then I grew to like its earthiness. The lactic acid in it suits my combination/oily acne-prone skin by gently exfoliating off dead skin cells to prevent clogged pores.  The ferulic acid in here brightens complexion and helps with evening tone. The essence is a lovely light moisturizing liquid texture applied best my putting a small amount in your palms and patting it all over your face so it absorbs well. I’ve only tried a sample size so far but would love to buy a full size (it’s just a big price-prohibitive for me at this time). One star off for the price. Luminous and healthy
