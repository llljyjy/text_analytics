Another winner from Kiehl’s! The Ultra Cream is my go-to in the summer for my dry skin, so I was excited to be selected to try this one. The cream itself has a clean scent and a similar consistency to other Kiehl’s creams I have used previously - thick, emollient, and moisturizing. I used it consistently for a week and found my skin to be both hydrated and plumper. I would recommend this to others who suffer from dry skin and need moisture. nan
