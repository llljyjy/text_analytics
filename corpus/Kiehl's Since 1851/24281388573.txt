Kiehlâ€™s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream is amazing!  My skin is very dry and this cream makes it feel soft and moisturized.  The cream is very thick but a little bit goes a long way.  I was worried that it would leave my face feeling heavy or greasy, however, it did not.  The fact that it is fragrance-free is just a bonus to me.  I would recommend this cream for anyone with sensitive, dry, or very dry skin. I Love This Stuff!
