I am using this for the past 5 to 6 weeks and I have already noticed a huge impact, scars on my face from acne started fading away. Mine is an oily face initially I had a concern to apply during day time, but it worked perfectly very well I dont feel any discomfort using it. It does its work of what it says it does in the description. Finally a dark spot solution
