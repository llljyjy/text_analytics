I love this stuff! I received it for free to try for about three months, and I can see the difference that it’s made. It is a textured cream and not oily or greasy at all, like many other under-eye moisturizers/serums I’ve used. I can see a visible difference in the dark circles under my eyes from when I first started using it to now. My sister even made a comment asking me what eye cream I’ve been using because my under-eyes look so good! I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this doesn’t irritate it or cause any kind of breakout. Highly recommend to anyone looking for real results in reducing their under-eye circles/darkness. nan
