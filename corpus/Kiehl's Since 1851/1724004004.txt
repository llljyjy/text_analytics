With the dry cold weather and use of retinoids, my skin can get really dry and flaky. This was godsend in that sense and really replenished my skin overnight! Felt immediate difference the next morning! Your skin still feels hydrated, almost oily in the am which is what i need during these months. Love that its fragrance free and filled with beneficial ingredients. Amaaaazing!
