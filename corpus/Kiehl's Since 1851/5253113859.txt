I love Kiehlâ€™s products and this serum did not disappoint. You mix it up nice and fresh! The serum is unscented and was not sticky or irritating for my skin. My complexion looked and felt smoother by the end of one week of consistent use. A little goes a long way! Daily sunscreen is a must with any retinol. Overall two thumbs up!!I was gifted this product from Bzzagent. Great for Fast Results
