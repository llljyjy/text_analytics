It’s summer and it’s too hot for a super heavy nighttime face cream, even on my dry skin. So I was excited when Kiehl’s and Buzzagent gifted me the Midnight Recovery Omega Rich Cream in exchange for my honest review.The light, whipped texture of this cream seemed like the perfect summer PM moisturizer. After using it for 2 weeks I can say I’m impressed.It’s goes on silky smooth and soaks in immediately without leaving my skin feeling weighed down.It contains squalane, an ingredient I’ve fallen in love with lately for its hydration properties. That may be why I woke up every morning with plump, radiant skin ready to start the day. I had no issues with breakouts and was able to apply it over my tretinoin with no problems.I found the light botanical scent pleasant, but not overpowering.I’d definitely recommend this cream and purchase a replacement when this runs out, particularly for next spring/summer. It’s the perfect lighter weight cream that still packs a powerful hydration punch. But I think it’s the actual silky texture that I love most. It just FEELS good. There’s a lot to be said for that. Shouldn’t a cream feel good? I think so. The perfect summer PM cream
