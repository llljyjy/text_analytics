This is probably my favorite retinol serum I’ve tried so far. I feel like it’s gentle enough that I could use everyday but I still feel it working. I’ve noticed a difference in skin after using it only a few times. My skin is smoother, softer, and is glowing more. Can’t wait to see results after a few more weeks!! Works Quickly!
