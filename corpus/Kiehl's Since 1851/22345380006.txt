new cream, new ingredients for me.  looks like a classic, but a little different.  my skin is dry/normal and in winter it is very dry, there is irritation .all I want is hydration, even more hydration)) and a light texture so that the pores do not get clogged .  The cream does its job very well.  oh yes and one more thing, itâ€™s a different package, very convenient to use, no fingers in the jar. New winter favorite
