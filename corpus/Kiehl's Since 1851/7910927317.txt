It smells like spicy, earthy hot dog water.  Which is to be expected considering the Ferulic acid and other ingredients. It’s interesting, it’s not my favorite scent but also not so bad that I can’t use it. It is fairly oily and I do have really oily skin so initially when I followed the 5 drops directions, it felt too oily and like it wouldn’t absorb. The next time I tried just one drop, layered it on and it absorbed just fine. Now, I will do one later, then add a few more individual light layers if I feel like my skin needs it. I do feel like it has helped to smooth out my skin and I have noticed less redness in my cheeks since using it in the morning. I also really like the amount of product that you get. Overall it is a good product and worth a try. Good Product
