I’ve had previous experiences with retinol creams and serums before and they all burnt my skin and left it itchy.  With this--even using a pea size a few times a week to start off with, my skin feels moisturized and smooth.  I don’t have tons of wrinkles yet, so I can’t speak to that aspect, but I have noticed an improvement on my skin.  Recommend! Good for sensitive skin!
