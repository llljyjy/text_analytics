This is my favorate face oil. I’ve been using this for years. On the nights I didn’t use this oil, I could clearly see my skin being less hydrated and less nourished overnight. It really does make a difference to my skin. I’ve tried other face oil products over the years, but ended up always coming back to this. I’ll use this forever. nan
