If you like slugging your face with Vaseline but hate the mess. This is a great option. Itâ€™s a thick solid consistency, very hydrating and easy to apply. I would much rather use this in replacement of Vaseline. I also love how dewy my face looks after applying it. Really gives the skin a nice glow. However, because of its thick texture you need to let it sit on your face for a few minutes before bed or else it easily rubs off onto your pillow. I would recommend giving this product a try, there is enough product to last months! nan
