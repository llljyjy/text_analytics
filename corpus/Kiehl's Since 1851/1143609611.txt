I was provided this product from Bzzagent to test out.  I love the dispensing portion of the packaging.  However, the capsule that gets added to allow the retinol powder could use some work .  Doesn’t seem to get all the powder out and into the serum base.  I have been using the product for a bit and it’s working ok.  It’s not causing a reaction so that’s good.  I do think that long term use needs to happen before real results show up. nan
