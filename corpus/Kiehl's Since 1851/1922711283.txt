I am a huge skincare enthusiast and love trying new products, so I was really excited to try Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream. Kiehl’s has long been synonymous with quality, effective skincare and I have always enjoyed the products that I’ve used. The packaging is a sleek, deep blue jar and by appearances, it seems small for a face cream, but once opened, I realized that the consistency is on the thicker side, meaning I don’t have to use as much. The bright blue color of the cream really drew me in. It’s so pretty!! I love that the Midnight Recovery Cream is rich in Omega 3 and 6 Fatty Acids, which helps restore the skin’s protective barrier. It also contains a botanical blend to help with fine lines and wrinkles, as well as squalene, which is easily absorbed to help replenish the barrier. I love that it’s paraben free and free of mineral oils, as well as packaged in a 50% post-consumer recycled jar. This will be a favorite of mine in the colder months when my skin can get dry and cracked. Rich Crean for Soft Skin
