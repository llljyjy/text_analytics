I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was very excited to try this Kiehl’s dark spotted corrector as I love all of the products I’ve been able to try from the brand with gentle yet effective results, so I was happy to test this out on some of the sun damage and post blemish marks that take a lot longer to fade than they did years ago. I apply it twice a day and never once did my skin burn upon application. It has a very minimal but pleasant scent. The product absorbs easily without excessive rubbing. My skin definitely seems brighter to me and my husband. I’ll likely purchase when this runs out. nan
