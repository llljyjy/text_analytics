This is my first time trying a product from this brand.  I am completely fell in love with this without a doubt it is the best one that has been tried so far. Seriously amazing. Since using Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution I have noticed a big improvement  to reduce dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and post-acne marks.I have to say that it worked wonders for my skin. I love putting on it every single morning and night.  Just be sure to use sunscreen during the day. My skin just looked soooo much better and radiant. Absorbed well and worked great under makeup. It’s gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin.The packaging is really beautiful. I’m excited to see the effects on my skin after using a whole bottle.Thank you for letting me try this. It’s fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone that has these same issues.I  know products like this do take a while so just be patient and be very consistent! Miracle Product
