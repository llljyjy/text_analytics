I am a 30 year old who is beginning to see signs of aging and changes in my skin. It’s more dry than ever and I see darkness under my eyes. I tried out this eye cream and felt different right away with how moisturized my skin felt. I have worked it into my regular routine and truly recommend it to everyone. It’s been about a month or so now and I see improvement. nan
