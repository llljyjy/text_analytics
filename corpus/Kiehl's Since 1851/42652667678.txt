3 starts mainly because i don’t have the strong hydrated feeling and dewy look when I wake up. With other lotions, such as tatcha, I had the dewy look (which I love). I got this since they were sold out in store. It works “fine.” No scent, not sticky, etc. one thing I did notice and love is that it helped my acne scaring and overall appearance of skin. My skin looks healthier but it doesn’t feel hydrated (which I why I bought it). My skin is really dry so I need something that’s upper hydrating, this isn’t it. But again, not bad but I’d only buy again to help keep my redness and acne scaring in check :) Not hydrating but made skin look a bit healthier
