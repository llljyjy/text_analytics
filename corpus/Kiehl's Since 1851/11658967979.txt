I recently was able to try Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol. First off. I really like the packaging. The bottle is heavy and a pretty blue color. I was super intrigued to see that you had to mix the retinol into the liquid when you first open it. I really liked this idea because I feel that the product is “fresher“. The texture is nice, it’s is a creamy butter yellow color that is the perfect consistency. After the first week, it seemed my face was a little softer. I kept using it and am doing this review after almost being done with the bottle. My face looks so good. I don’t have any crows feet but I  do have a small laughing line and two thin forehead lines that have been smoothed out since starting. The texture of my face is SO much better too. I’m 45 years old and people mistake me for in my 20’s as I have always wore sunscreen/skin care routine. Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol is hands down my favorite retinol release this year. The price is not extremely expensive as some other products I use. I will definitely be purchasing this!! *I received this product from Kiehl’s and BzzAgent for my honest review. These thoughts are my own* Bye Bye Texture!!
