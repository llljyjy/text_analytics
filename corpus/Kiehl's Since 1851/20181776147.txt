Not sure how much it helps, but it feels good on the skin. I redeemed a trial size for my points and was shocked how tiny it is compared to other rewards. I also need to apply more product comparably to other serums because consistency feels a bit watery and adsorbs too quickly before I spread it all over my face. I only used it for a week (not on a daily basis, just a few times) and half a bottle is already gone because of how much product is needed for the whole face, and it’s hard to call it a bottle 4 ml. It’s hard to decide whether I would recommend it to someone or not, but I guess it’s worth the try for some people. Absorbs too fast
