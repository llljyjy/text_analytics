This Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream works wonders. After a weeks use, I have really noticed the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes slowly disappear. I’ve tried many eye creams and to my surprise this ACTUALLY works. I like that it is very easy to apply, the cream is not too thick and there is no scent. It only requires a small amount and it does the job.  The small jar container really contains a lot of product and I see that it will last for quite some time. I haven’t had any eye irritation from using the cream and it blends in quite well and there is no visible cream around the eyes once applied.Overall, the Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream is exactly what I needed and now my eyes look fresher, more clean and I look well rested. Great Kiehl's Eye Treatment
