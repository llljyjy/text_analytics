After second use of this mask I really love it. The first time I tried this product it was hard to apply and I felt like it did nothing. The second time of usage, I applied it to my face with a mask brush and it was easy to apply and i left it on for 20min. After rinsing, my face was so smooth and even, my pores looked smaller, my skin was very glowy and dewy looking. I would suggest applying the mask with a brush if you did like the mask in first usage. hello
