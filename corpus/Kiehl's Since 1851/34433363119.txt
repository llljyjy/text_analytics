This cream is light and has a subtle fragrance. I wear before sunscreen and make up, it works very well for me. I have used it in my night-time routine when I donâ€™t want to lather my skin with heavy Moisturizer. It is a very good basic moisturizer. The price is little higher compared to other very good moisturizers but the ingredients are also better than most of those. Best Basic Moisturizer
