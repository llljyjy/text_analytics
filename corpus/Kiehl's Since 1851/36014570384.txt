The Kiehlâ€™s Fast Release Retinol Serum was not initially what I expected, since I had never used a high concentrated retinol product before. I was a bit surprised when after about 4 days, my skin began to peel. I was worried that because of the peeling, my face was going to end up being really dry. I kept using it though for the full two week trial, according to the buzz agent instructions, based on a free full size bottle for a review and to my surprise, the skin underneath the peeling was baby smooth. Other reviews said this product did not make their face peel but mine did. It did not burn, feel tight or cause any discomfort during the peeling process though. After the full two weeks of usage, my skin is softer, the texture is slightly more even and I did notice very very slight improvement in discoloration of my skin. The most noticeable was that my 11 lines between my eyes and my forehead wrinkles definitely have improved and are less noticeable, especially under my eye wrinkles. Overall, I am pleased with the product and would purchase again Excellent exfoliating and skin brightening serum
