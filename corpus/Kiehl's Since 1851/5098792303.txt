I had an allergic reaction to another eye cream that left the skin on my eyelids and below my eyes cracked, dry, and red. Within a week of using this eye cream, I saw and felt a marked improvement. After another week, the irritation and dryness were nearly gone. I continue to use this eye cream each night, and I’ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. It’s pricey, but a little dab goes a long way. I’m converted. Amazing results
