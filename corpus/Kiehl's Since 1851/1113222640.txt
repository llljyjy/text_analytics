This looks cloud like and whipped but it actually thick. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t feel heavy. Just know that you will need half of what you think you will need. My skin felt smoother and hydrated and makeup looked noticably different and smoother. But it did make me break out. I used it and then stopped for awhile and started again and it made me break out both times. It’s a nice cream though and used once daily would probably last six months even though the container is so small. Nice but use sparingly
