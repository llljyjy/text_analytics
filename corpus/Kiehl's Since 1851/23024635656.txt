This seems to be the perfect amount of retinol for my skin. I live this product and it has replaced all other serums. It says to apply moisturizer afterwards but itreally doesn’t feel like it needs it - I have been using it now as a sample for a few weeks and just ordered a fewbottles. Two pumps morning and night. Since I have been using the product I have noticed clear skin, overall brighter tone, my skin just feels it looks better. I don’t know what to say. I’m going to keep using this product.:-) It’s Great
