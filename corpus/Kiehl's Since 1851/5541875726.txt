This is really quite a strange sleep mask. It is a solid that you warm up between you fingers and then put on. It definitely that it does provide intense hydration. However, the smell is really quite odd. It’s almost like the smell of really weird bottled water, but super intense. And it does not go away when you put it on; I can smell it for over an hour. It also is quite greasy; this isn’t something that sinks in quickly. Basically, I do think this does what it claims to do, but I don’t think it’s special enough to overcome the greasy feel and weird smell. nan
