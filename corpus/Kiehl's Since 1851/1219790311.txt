I used this every single night and most mornings since receiving it and have mixed feelings.  I found that the formula is fairly tacky, which isn’t great for me when applying concealer atop it during the day,  But it is long lasting at night as I can still feel it on my skin when I wash my face in the morning.  unlike most serums I have used in the past, this has a cream base, most I’ve used in comparison are more watery, which provided a lot of hydration.  I don’t necessarily think that this drastically improved my fine lines or dark circles, but I do think that it does well as an under eye moisturizer. nan
