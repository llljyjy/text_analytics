I tried this as part of a free sample trial period and I’m honestly quite disappointed.  I’ve used it exclusively on some dark spots from acne scaring I have on my cheek and they are maybe slightly lighter after two months of nightly use.  I took photos in the same place at the same time of day periodically throughout the process and looking at the images, the difference between day one and day 60 is practically imperceptible.  I wouldn’t say there’s no difference, but judge for yourself based on my photos. Little Noticeable Difference
