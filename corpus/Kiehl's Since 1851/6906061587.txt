10/10 I’ve used so many dark correcting serums in the past and they take months for me to even notice a difference- but this?! Idk what they put in it but I saw results in 1 week. I was not expecting that. I’m prone to super dark spots under my chin, down my neck and chest to where I sometimes have to hide with makeup. I won’t be hiding any more!! It’s been 2 weeks so far and it is now added to my holy grail collection! Game Changer!!!
