I really loved the packaging for this serum. The bottom of the bottle was where the powder was added to activate the serum. I found that I really needed to shake more than I thought I would to get everything blended. I really like that there is an easy to push button that releases the perfect amount of serumThe serum blends effortlessly on my face. It us not too sticky, nor greasy. It does not irritate my skin or have a string scent. It absorbed into my skin quickly, but I still had plenty if time to apply it. After a week of use, I cod see that the line between my brows had softened and my skin was softer. I donâ€™t have fine lines, yet.  I really liked this and I believe that if you want to prevent lines and/or soften existing lines you should give this a try. nan
