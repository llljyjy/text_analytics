The packaging is great and feels of high quality.  I enjoyed getting to mix the product and the applicator.  Many retinols dry my skin out, leading to peeling and this did not!  I have been using it for about a month and feel my skin has less rosacea based acne and less peeling.  I havenâ€™t noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles, but that can be difficult to see. Overall it feels great on my skin. nan
