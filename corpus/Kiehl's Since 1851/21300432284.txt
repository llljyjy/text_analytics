I was looking for a cream that is able to give my skin long-lasting moisturizing upliftment and I was able to find this with Kiehlâ€™s which is made of things that are good for the skin and thus also sustainable. I liked the small packaging and the feel of the cream on the skin was just so soft and awesome. I loved this and have already recommended this to my mom to help her with keeping her skin young.
