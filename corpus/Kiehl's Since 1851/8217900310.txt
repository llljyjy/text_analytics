This is a great eye gel. I was happy to receive this item free for review but I was surprised at how good it really was. I have been using this for a few weeks now and I see a bit of an improvement in my undereye area. That’s great since most eye creams and gels just moisturize but don’t do anything restorative. This gel by Kiehls really is impressive and highly recommended. I love this eye gel
