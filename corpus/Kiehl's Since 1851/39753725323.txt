The setup of this product to mix and use is extremely easy. It comes with a retinol powder capsule that you put on the bottom of the bottle, twist on and shake, remove the empty capsule, twist the bottom of the bottle back on and viola you’re all set. The bottle also has two clear panels on each side so you can see exactly how much product you have remaining. This serum works great and really improved my wrinkles to the point of them no longer being visible! You only need to apply a very small amount for total coverage. Using my finger I applied this nightly after cleaning my face by just gently tapping my skin with it. It is thin but powerful, there is no need to rub this product in. I’m a natural redhead so I am very fair complected. This product easily and quickly absorbed into my skin, made a huge difference in my wrinkle appearance and did it’s job without creating any unpleasant or uncomfortable side effects as I have experienced with other products. It did not make my skin super sticky or puffy nor did not leave my face bright red. AND it does not have any weird or unpleasant smells either. I could literally feel my skin tighter and smoother after my very first application, plus it leaves your facial skin very soft and moisturized, tighter and toner, with a very nice gentle glow. Try this product for quick and efficient results, you will not be disappointed! nan
