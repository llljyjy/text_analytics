I have tried other Retinol serums and have had too many unwanted side effects that I stopped using them. With Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum I was pleasantly surprised. My skin tolerates this very well, it doesn’t cause my skin to be super irritated, peeling excessively, and over dry. It has a nice creamy texture to it that spreads well. I’ve noticed the texture of my skin is smoother, my fine lines seem to be fading and aren’t as noticeable. I don’t need to use a lot, I put a few small dots on each cheek, my chin and forehead. I spread it out evenly to include the undereye and crow’s feet area at night after cleansing. I let it soak in and put a light moisturizer over it. I have gotten some compliments on my skin and friends asking me what I’ve done recently. This is definitely making a nice difference for me and will continue to use this! Easy On My Skin & Effective
