Picked one of the smaller sizes of these up in the sale as I’ve not tried it before, and I absolutely love it!! Definitely up there with my favourite sunscreens of all time. The texture reminds me very much of La Roche Posay shaka fluid, it’s very light and watery, however I’d say the finish on this is definitely less greasy. Left no white cast and smells lovely! I’ve tried tonnes of sunscreens at both the higher and lower end price points and this one really stood out as a great, every day wearable one. I find many to be too greasy and thick/not fun to wear or that leave a white cast/ sting your eyes etc but this one did none of those things - I will definitely be buying more of these when they come back in stock! I lent some of this to my family when we were out for a walk last week and they all commented the same, that it was a super nice sunscreen! Can see why it’s a cult classic! Loooove this sunscreen!
