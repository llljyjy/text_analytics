First off, I loved activating the product by mixing the powder into the serum. I felt like a chemist for a second. I started off using just a couple of times per week and really didn’t see much of a difference. I increased to daily and that’s when I started to see results. (Btw, still no irritation with daily use) At first I seemed shinier than usual but then I noticed just an overall softer look and lightening of fine lines around my eyes.  I’m usually counting down the days to schedule my Botox every 3 months, but just realized I am 4 months out and in no hurry. This product has been the only difference in my routine, so I think it’s the reason. Postponed my Botox appointment!
