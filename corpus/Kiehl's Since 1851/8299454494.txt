This serum is top-notch!  This is a great product to add into your evening skincare routine.  This retinol serum is fast acting. While retinol serum can take time to decrease wrinkles, I immediately noticed an improvement to my complexion. I had a brighter, smoother after using it for 7 days.  This retinol product was gentler than both high end and drug store products I’ve used in the past. I was able to transition to everyday use without increased sensitivity or redness.  After using it for a few weeks now, I’m going to continue to use this product as part of my routine. Kiehl’s Fast-Release is Fast Acting
