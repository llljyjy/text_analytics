I have heard good things about Kiehl’s, so I was excited to give this facial cream a try. It’s also great timing since we are in the colder winter months where my skin gets so dry. When I initially put the cream on my face it was not greasy but very smooth and truly “lightweight” like it says. It also felt like it went into my dry skin SO well! I have been using it over night and I do see a difference when I wake up and my face is still soft and moisturized! Great hydration for face
