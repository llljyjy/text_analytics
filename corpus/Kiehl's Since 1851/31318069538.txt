I’ve been using this as the last step in my nightly skincare routine for the past month, and it has done wonders for my winter dryness! The texture is very smooth, but doesn’t leave you feeling oily; rather, feeling bouncy and hydrated. Which is great if you’re going to sleep and want to feel a difference when you wake up in the morning! Squalene is one of my favorite skincare ingredients for hydration, and it really shines in this mask. A little bit goes a long way, and it’s easy to slip it all around your face, and really lock in your skincare routine products with a final layer of hydration. I imagine I’ll be using this container for a really long time. Another winner in my book from kiehls! nan
