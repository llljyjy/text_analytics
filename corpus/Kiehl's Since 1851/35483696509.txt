This cream saved skin. I have very reactive skin, I develop allergic symptoms such rashes, redness, etc to almost all skincare products. After using the same moisturizer for over 6 years, I developed an allergic reaction to it out of nowhere. My skin was just really angry, it was bumpy, patchy, red and stings when I use the moisturizer. Although it wasn’t the best moisturizer, I used it because it was the only one that didn’t cause a reaction. Out of desperation, I bought Kiehl’s Ultra cream after the sales associate reassured me that if it didn’t work, I can return it zero questions asked. Within 15mins of the first application, my skin feels better and my complexion bright up almost instantly. It calm my angry skin within a day. I don’t know what magic is in this cream but I’m so happy to have given it a chance.  It moisturize well without feeling greasy. It gives the skin a nice radiance, subtle dew to the skin. I will use this for life, fingers crossed that I won’t develop an allergic reaction. Been using this for 3 weeks and every morning, skin looks great after waking up. Skin saver
