This mask has been a life saver. It is winter and my skin is terribly dry. Iâ€™m also 42 so my skin is changing and it is harder to keep in moisture. Using this mask just once saw incredible results. It   was not greasy and it melted into my face. I woke looking fresh and my skin was super plump. I use this twice to three times a week and my skin is so healthy! Winter Rescue
