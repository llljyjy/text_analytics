Thank you so much BzzAgent and Kiehls for the Complimentary product in exchange for my honest opinion. My boyfriend and myself have been using this for 2 weeks now. We both have noticed that our skin feels more supple, as well as radiant. We are both in our mid 30’s and those sneaky little lines are starting to make their way onto my expression lines. I’ve used many moisturizers, and I have to say this one is a top FAv! It doesn’t break my face out, and I wake glowing. Felling 22 again! I would highly recommend this moisturizer! Omega Rich
