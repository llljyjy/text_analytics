I have sensitive, dry eczema prone skin. I also suffer from rosacea and hormonal acne. I tend to look for products that are not heavily scented, but do a good job at moisturizing and this does just that! It squeezes out a little thick, but it blends into the skin well and absorbs practically instantly so it doesn’t feel heavy or sticky. A big plus is that it has no scent. It says suitable for dry skin prone to distress and discomfort which describes my skin situation to a T. I’m so glad I was able to try out this cream, it’s been amazing for my skin and I can’t go without using it daily. It’s just a lightweight, but super repairing cream and has worked wonders with the crazy cold dry weather. nan
