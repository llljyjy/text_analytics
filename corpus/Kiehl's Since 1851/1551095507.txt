Before trying this product I started getting eye bags and dark under eyes. I decided this was a good time to try this serum. I want to mentioned I have sensitive skin. The first time I tried this serum, it stinged after application. The following day I decided to use less and tapped it under my eyes, It did stinged less. After using this serum for weeks I noticed muy under eyes looked softer and brighter. I will continue to use this product to view the anti aging benefits of the serum. I would recommend this product if your looking for brighter and moisturized under eyes. Bright and soft!
