I have spent alot of money on eye creams, from cheap to high end. And TBH I dont see much of a difference when I use eye cream. I have oily lids and normal under eye with some creasing. I wanted an eye cream that doesnâ€™t dry out my eyes cuz I wear contact lenses. Or burn the eye area like its needles. This cream does dry my eyes a little bit but I dont feel needles around the eye area. One more thing I notice that makes me give it 5 star, it works great under makeup. I actually noticed I can bake or during winter not bake it helps my concealer not crease. Will be buying again. Great under makeup
