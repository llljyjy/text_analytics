I have been using Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum for a few weeks now at night and I have seen a significant difference in visibility of wrinkles. I really appreciate that is product uses rentinol and you get to activate the serum by mixing the products together. You can really see the retinol that’s being used as opposed to other products clip that claim to use retinol. The directions recommend starting off using this product a couple days a week and then increasing it to every day I have been familiar with retinol products and started using a product every day at night and starter to see smoother Line appearances quickly. I use about a dime side of this product on my neck and on my face and not a lot is required in fact, a little goes a long way. I like this product goes on and it absorbs in the skin quickly not leaving an oily. I also recommend to make sure to keep shaking the product before usage to make sure that the retinol doesn’t sit at the bottom. I really enjoyed using this product and would highly recommend it for fast results! Fast results for Reducing the appearance of lines
