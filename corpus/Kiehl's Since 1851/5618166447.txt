My go to. I always fall for the cute packaging of other moisturizers but when they run out I always go back to this one. Reasonably prized and such a great moisturizer that lasts all day and doesn’t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin. This is the only kielhls product I keep going back to. my favorite product from Kiehl’s!
