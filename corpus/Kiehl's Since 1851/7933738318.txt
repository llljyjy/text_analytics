It’s an okay moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling hydrated but it’s nothing special. I bought the mini version just to test it out & I’m glad I did because it’s not something that I would pay full price for. I have oily skin and I noticed that this didn’t really set that well into my face even after a couple of hours. It made my skin look really greasy after a while so I wouldn’t really recommend this. Nothing special
