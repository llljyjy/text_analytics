Started using this during the polar vortex when temps reached -20* or so. I was a little skeptical because the cream comes out of the tube rather thick. However, after it warms against your skin, it goes on and rubs in very easily--instant relief and soothing. Love the tube instead of jar because dispensing the right amount is easier.It didnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling and my face stayed moisturized almost all day.Definitely recommend. Although a little pricey, a little bit goes a long way. nan
