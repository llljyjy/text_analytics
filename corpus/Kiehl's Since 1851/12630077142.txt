This stuff is amazing! I was literally shocked to see it work in as little as one application! I didn’t have a reaction to it at all, which with the strength of the product, I’m a little surprised. No dryness, or irritation. It did however leave my skin looking freshly hydrated and smooth! I was a little intimidated with the activation of the product but the instructions were clear. It was even a little fun! I love this stuff. You cannot go wrong! It works!!!
