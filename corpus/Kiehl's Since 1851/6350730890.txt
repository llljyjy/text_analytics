Glad that I received this product to try out. I tried it for the recommended duration and the dark spot serum is a really nice feeling serum on the face. It has an easy to use bottle dropper applicator. It felt nice in my skin but the more I used it it started to make my cheek area super dry on my already dry skin. However, it helped with my complexion and slightly brightening my skin. The only thing was that it made the dark spots slightly less dark, but I expected more of the dark spots to fade. For the price point I would not buy this product again. However, I recommend this product to those who have oily skin and other skin other than dry skin looking to fade dark spots. Definitely not for dry skin because it makes your skin more dry. Faded Dark Spots slightly. Not good for Dry Skin.
