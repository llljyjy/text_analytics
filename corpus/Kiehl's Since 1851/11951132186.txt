This product somehow moistures really deeply (love that) without feeling heavy. The packaging and violet color of the product is awesome. This looks pretty on my bathroom counter. Giving it a 4-star because the scent is really heavy in my opinion. I am not a person that opts for unscented creams, I like a light scent but this one is really heavy almost to the point of getting a scent-induced headache. If this was offered in an unscented or preferably a lighter scent this would be a 5 star for me.  I would still recommend this to friends with the caveat about the really heavy scent. Great Feeling Product But Heavy Scent
