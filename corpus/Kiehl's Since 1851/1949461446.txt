Not a fan. I love rich creams and this is rich, but it has a strange spreadability problem. If you have any moisture at all left in your skin from washing, the cream slides away and won’t rub in. It makes for a very uneven application. I’ve tried ribbing it into my fingers first, etc - no real difference. It’s a hassle to apply. nan
