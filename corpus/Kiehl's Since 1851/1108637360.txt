Hey Beauties! #KiehlsGiftedMe their amazing New Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream! Supercharged with Niacinamide and Collagen Peptide to treat all four eye zones, this anti-aging eye cream visibly lifts the brow bone area, smooths the eyelid, firms the outer corner to minimize crow’s feet and fine lines, and depuffs the under eye. This lightweight, non-greasy gel texture can be easily applied under makeup and absorbs quickly into the skin for refreshed, younger looking eyes. Key Ingredients:Niacinamide Collagen Peptide This product is formulated without Parabens and is fragrance free. I’m absolutely loving this super lightweight gel cream. I love that it’s gentle on my sensitive skin and absorbs quickly. This doesn’t leave a greasy residue or feel sticky or tacky. I’ve noticed my eye area looks smoother and less puffy as well as some slight lightening of my fine lines. I can’t wait to see how my continued results will look with this product. I also appreciate that this is fragrance free. Products Shown: @Kiehls~ Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream #kiehls #gifted #skincare #skincarelover nan
