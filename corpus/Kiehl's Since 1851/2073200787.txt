I have never tried Kiehlâ€™s moisturizer before but I am so glad I did! While the price point is a little hefty, I do think a little goes a long way to make your skin feel plump and look hydrated. I use in the morning and night - sometimes I use a thicker moisturizer at night for extra hydration. This moisturizer works great as a base for makeup and I have had no problems with my makeup pilling! Feels like luxury on your face!
