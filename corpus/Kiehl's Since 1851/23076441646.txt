I was initially excited when I got a large sample size of this in my Sun Safety bag this year, but that excitement quickly faded when I applied it to my face and smelled that familiar minty smell. I didn’t know much about this brand but assumed from the packaging (incorrectly) that this would be a good, basic sunscreen with skin nourishing ingredients and without the fluff like fragrances. Why are we still using peppermint oil in high end skincare in 2022? I thought we left that behind on the shelves with Noxema. And why the orange oil? Don’t citrus oils increase sun sensitivity? That’s the opposite of what I look for in a sunscreen. It’s a good cream for my dry skin, otherwise. It dries down well, isn’t greasy, and isn’t drying. I like the ingredients like squalene and hyaluronic acid. But peppermint oil on the face? No, thank you. That’s a deal breaker for me. Peppermint and orange oil? Why?
