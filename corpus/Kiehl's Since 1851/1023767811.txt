I bought this for my Aunt that is going through Cancer treatment. She LOVES it. She’s in her 70’s and it’s really helped clean and smooth her skin without irritation or leaving any residue behind. She is very particular about what she buys and doesn’t want a multiple step system atm so it’s nice to have a bit more of a specialty cleanser. Superb for fragile skin
