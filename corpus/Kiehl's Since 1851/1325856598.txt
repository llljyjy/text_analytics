I have been using this serum for several weeks now since I received it to try out.  The first thing that really threw me with this product is that you have to mix it prior to first use.  I know one issue for me was concern that I did not mix it up well enough.  I also felt that after mixing and removing the base there seemed to be a lot of product wasted.  I never had any irritation from this product maybe a slight redness on the first or second night, but overall no big issues.    I do think after I use this I will buy again.  I have definitely seen improvement on fine lines especially around my mouth.  As you can see in the pictures attached.  I have seen some slight improvements on my deeper lines around my eyes already but overall fine lines are looking better in just a few weeks!  I would recommend trying this. nan
