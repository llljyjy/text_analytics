This product is AMAZING! My skin feels so clean and soft after I wash. I’ve also been using the Calendula toner and calming mask (2-3 times a week) and it has helped my face tremendously! I love Kiehl’s but sometimes the products can be harsh on my skin, not this line though! I have developed slight rosacea on my cheeks and this has calmed it 100x better than the cream from my dermatologist. These products will be my go to from now on! 10000% Recommend!
