I have been using the Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol serum for 4 weeks now. Mixing it up was really fun. The package had easy to follow instructions and it was so nice to know it was freshly mixed and at full potency when I began using it. There was a little peeling after the first 3 or 4 days, but I followed the directions on usage frequency to let my skin adapt and it worked just as explained. Now my skin has adjusted and I have no peeling. I keep it in my refrigerator to help keep it fresh and it feels so nice and cool to put on at night during this summer heat. The dispenser is also very innovative and it will last a long time since you only need a pea-sized dose.  I already think my skin looks smoother.  Kiehl’s is a high quality brand that has put a lot of thought into their products and I have come to expect the best from them. This product is a perfect example of that. High quality and effective!
