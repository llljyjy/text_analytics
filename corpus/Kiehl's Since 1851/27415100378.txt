I’ve tried many many clay masks, and this is the only cleat mask EVER that has left my skin feeling like a baby’s bum. I do notice the pores being slightly smaller, however I’m not so sure about the removing gunk from pores, or like clearing pores 100% I bought the mini size and I kid you not you use very little to fill your entire face, because you only need a thin layer. Also the huge size is super expensive. But I like it a lot. Pretty Good!!!
