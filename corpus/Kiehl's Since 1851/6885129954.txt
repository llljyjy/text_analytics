I love the product, compared to other sunscreens I used, this one provides enough moisture without overly pressuring skin. I can use it before and after make-up ( after make-up, I apply the sunscreen as small dots on my face and pat it gently so it doesn’t mess up the look)It leaves a glow on the skin too. If you don’t like the glow, you can cover it using setting powder too. Safe suncreen for sensitive skin
