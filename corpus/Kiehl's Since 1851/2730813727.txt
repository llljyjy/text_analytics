I think this eye cream works pretty well. I like that you can use it all over the eye area rather than just the under eye since i’m getting concerned about drooping eyelids as I get older. It’s hard to tell if it’s working at this point but I enjoy the texture as it feels moisturizing without being too heavy. nan
