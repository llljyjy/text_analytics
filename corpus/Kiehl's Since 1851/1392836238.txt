This stuff works great! It’s a bit oily and tacky. I put quite a bit on before I go to bed so it works well overnight. It’s been helping ALOT with my dry patches and flaky skin! My main qualm is the smell. It’s fragrance free but it’s a weird gross nothingness smell. It’s hard to explain but I wish it didn’t smel so weird. After wearing it for about 10 minutes, I don’t notice the smell anymore so that helps. Otherwise, this product is all it’s cracked up to be. :) great for dry flaky skin!
