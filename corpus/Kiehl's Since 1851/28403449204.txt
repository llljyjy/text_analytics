This cream comes in a beautiful dark blue jar and has light weight texture that spreads easily. It has great ingredients like Omega 3 Oil, Omega 6 Oil, and Fatty Acids to help replenish and strengthen skin barrier. It does hydrate the skin, however, it has synthetic fragrance and unfortunately, it did make me break out. The scent is pleasant (rose like) but if you have sensitive or reactive skin, I wouldn’t recommend it.If you have dry/combo skin that doesn’t react negatively to fragrances, then this cream might be a good addition in your night time routine. nan
