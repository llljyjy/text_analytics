I have really dry skin, so I was excited to try this. The first thing I noticed was the smell--it is definitely weird. I followed the directions on the container and used it 3 nights per week. It does not specify whether it should be used 3 consecutive nights or every other night. Since it is an overnight rehydrating mask, it does take a while to absorb completely. Therefore, it left my face feeling a little greasy after I first applied it. In the morning, my skin looked and felt hydrated. Overall, I thought it did a good job and would definitely recommend it. nan
