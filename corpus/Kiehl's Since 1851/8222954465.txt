I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I’m in love! I layer it after my Kiehl’s Retinol and before the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate Moisturizing Face Oil. It has a light lavender scent and the whipped texture is so smoothing and soaks in nicely. I have sensitive combination skin, so it’s nice that this provides moisture without breaking me out or feeling greasy. I received it for free, but I will repurchase in the future! So luxurious!
