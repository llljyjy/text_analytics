This eye cream has been an amazing addition to my routine. It immediately helps my eye area feel more hydrated and look more alive. I have definitely been seeing signs of aging lately and my under eye area is the worst. With the last month using this cream my fine lines are smoother and are way less noticable. My brow bone area seems tighter and more defined and my crows feet are much less prominent. Overall I am happy with not only the immediate results but also my long termish use. Canâ€™t wait to see what will happen after using it for a few more months. Works fantastic
