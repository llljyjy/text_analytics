Super great cream for my face (male, clean shaven). I would say I have a combination skin that is more sensitive on the mouth area. I cannot have something too heavy there or else I will break out, but if its too light, the skin around my mouth will crack up. This is perfect for me in that it is not greasy thick, and not super light. It works well on my forehead and nose where I sweat more (more oily). Highly recommend for everybody! Great Hydrating Moisturizer
