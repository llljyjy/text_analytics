When I first used this eye cream I wasn’t a fan, it irritated my eyes a bit. However I found I was using too much product! I used this twice a day every day for a few weeks and my dark circles have vastly improved! My under eyes feel hydrated and smooth, and I’ve noticed the tiny wrinkles improving as well! I would definitely purchase and love the brightening effect of this eye cream. Definitely recommend! Be Patient
