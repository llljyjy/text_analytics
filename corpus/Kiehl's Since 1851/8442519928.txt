I had a few dark spots on my cheeks and thought Iâ€™d give this a try. I was unable to use it daily, it dried my face out a bit much, but I used it every other day and started to notice a slight difference after 2 weeks. After 6 weeks most of my spots were light enough to cover with a basic foundation! This product definitely helped me, it could help you too! Great product at a decent price!
