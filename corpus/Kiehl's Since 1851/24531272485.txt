This is a different overnight mask than the other ones Iâ€™ve tried. The texture is thicker, like a paste, but it melts in your hands and spreads on quite easily. A little goes a long way when it comes to the effect the next day. I usually wear it over a moisturizer at night, and my skin feels super soft in the morning. The only problem is the smell: it smells a little rubbery,  but nothing too bothersome. Non greasy, hydrating night mask
