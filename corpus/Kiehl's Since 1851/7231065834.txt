I have used Kiehl’s products in the past with a lot of success but this one is a bust. It does not spread well, it is very patchy feeling and you have a hard time spreading it across an area. I have never encountered this before this product. It also gave me a burning sensation and normally I don’t have problems with this kind of product. It also leaves a dry flakey residue after being on a while. Do not recommend. Waste of money
