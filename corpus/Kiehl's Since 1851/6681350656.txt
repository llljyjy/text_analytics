Ok so I’ve always been the type to use whatever eye serum I have on hand or just buy at random…because I was always in the “they’re all the same” mentality. This one…oh my gahh! I stopped using concealer under my eyes after a week of using it, and honestly even going without makeup I don’t feel self conscious about my under eyes. It’s on my must-haves for skin care list now. nan
