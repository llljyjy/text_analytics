I ordered the Kiehl’s moisturizer because I had been happy with body cream products from Kiehl’s and quite honestly my regular moisturizer from Philosophy was unavailable.  The Kiehl’s cream has SPF which I require.  I absolutely fell in love with the moisturizer.  It is priced well and I do expect to order it again when mine runs out.  I found the SPF more efficient than the philosophy product I was using as my skin has NO tan at all after being exposed to South Florida sun. Better than I expected
