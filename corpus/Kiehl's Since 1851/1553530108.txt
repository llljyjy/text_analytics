this cream is very rich in texture - hence the cloud like name. It feels very luxe when applying, and the fragrance is relaxing. I love the color of the cream as well. However, I have noticed pilling when I put it on in my routine most of the time, and that loses a few points in my book. Iâ€™m not sure the reason, but this is the only new product in my routine. Rich cream but pills
