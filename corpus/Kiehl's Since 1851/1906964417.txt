First time trying Kiehl’s  Barrier cream and it has been a lifesaver! My skin gets very skin, dry and flaky this time of year, and this cream has helped so  much. I was worried it would be to heavy for my skin or it would be to sticky, but it’s not. Once it dries it leaves my skin feeling kind of dewy, and it doesn’t feel heavy at all. I would definitely recommend trying. Great during the cold months!
