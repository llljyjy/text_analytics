I was SO excited to receive this product! Now that I’m 37 and with the stress that comes with having a 5 and 3 year old, I’m really trying to preserve my skin/face as much as possible. So... I’ve become really into Retinol and Retinol-type products. This serum is a nighttime Retinol serum. The amazing thing is the Retinol-infused powder comes seperate of serum! You mix them together yourself so the final product is as fresh as absolutely possible for you to use! You only need a few drops so the bottle will last quite a while and there’s a clear vertical strip on the bottom so you can always see how much product is in the bottle. To dispense, you hold the bottle upside down and push the rubber “button“ on the bottom for a drop at a time. So it’s very sanitary and you don’t have to touch anything that will go back into the bottle. Even after the first night of use, I noticed my face looked very rejuvenated, glowy, my pores looked smaller, and the couple of acne spots I had were a lot smaller or basically gone!!! The one thing I highly recommend is to make sure you apply a hydrating moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin and/or are newer to Retinol, because it will make your skin more dry. As long as you use a hydrating moisturizer, especially the next morning, you will be fine. I own a lot of Kiehls products and I absolutely love every one of them. Their products ALWAYS hit it with the quality, performance, and outcome! I’m in love with this new product and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to rewind time by fading acne, pores, texture, fine lines and wrinkles, discoloration, or just wants to preserve their skin and prevent the things I just mentioned. I’m so excited about this one! Great job Kiehls! I’m In Love!!!!
