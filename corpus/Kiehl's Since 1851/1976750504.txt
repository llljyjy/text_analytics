I’ve been a fan of Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Face Oil for years now. It’s my go to facial oil for nighttime. Since the face oil worked so good for me, I was thrilled to try the Midnight Recovery Omega Rich Cloud Cream. I’ve been using this for the past two weeks and so far I am very pleased with it. To start, I love that the consistency isn’t too thick for a night cream. That makes it perfect to wear under oil because I don’t want my skin to feel heavy. I also layer this on top of lactic acid and I’ve noticed no issues with that. What I love the most is how plump my skin looks and how hydrated it feels when i wake up in the morning. I think overall this is a great night cream at a decent price point (the price is pretty comparable to other really good night creams). I’ll be getting this for my mother as well. Great Addition to the Oil
