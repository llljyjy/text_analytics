So I received a free sample of this product from Bzz Agent. I was looking forward to trying it out. Unfortunately, I did not see many improvements with its use. I found that it had great moisturizing features. I also noticed a slight improvement in tone lines at the outer eyes. I did not see any improvements in puffiness or any other fine line areas. Of note,I have sampled other products in the past and have had better results with others (Estee Lauder, Avon, Seba  Med). Was hoping to give a rave review since I received a sample, but I did not get great results, so for me it’s only a mediocre product. Was hoping for better results…
