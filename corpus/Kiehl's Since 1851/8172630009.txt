The product was fairly easy to mix, went on smooth and absorbed quickly.  I use a prescription retinol at night, so I used this one every other day instead and it has worked just as well, as far as I can tell. This was an interesting product to use. I like the idea of mixing in the active ingredient, but I donâ€™t know enough about it to understand if its a gimmick or if it really does make that big of a difference. nan
