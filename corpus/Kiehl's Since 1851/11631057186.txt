I have been using this cream for a few weeks now.  When I first opened it, I noticed the light scent it has a crispness to it that is nice and clean.  The cream is a light blue color in my opinion like a baby blue.  The texture is very light despite looking thick.  This is a night cream, so I used it every night as part of my routine.  When applying it feels thick at first but absorbs so quickly.  After absorbing there is no sticky or oily texture on the skin which is a plus for a night cream.  The next morning my skin felt softer it took about a week or so to see a slight difference in the texture and plumpness as things do not just work overnight.  I am sure with the continued use I will be seeing the results becoming more apparent. Great Moisturizer
