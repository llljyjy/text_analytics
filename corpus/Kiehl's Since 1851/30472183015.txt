I like the initial feel and texture of this product. The feel on my skin is also great and I could see myself purchasing it in the future. I don’t feel like I’ve been able to use it long enough to really notice a huge difference in the lines around my eyes, but I did notice that It helped with the under eye puffiness immediately! it does feel good to the point that I would continue to use it to see how much of a difference it will make overall! Based on the usage I have had this far I would definitely recommend the product, and I will definitely purchase the product to continue to see the benefits. Great Product
