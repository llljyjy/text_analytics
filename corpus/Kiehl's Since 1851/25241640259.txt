at first things were fine, i noticed a difference between my last moisturizer and this one. however, a few days later i realized my face would get irritated throughout the day and i couldn’t find out why. i’m pretty sure there’s something in this stuff that’s making my skin flare up and burn which sucks cuz i was looking for a good winter moisturizer that’d heal my moisture barrier:/ i have really sensitive skin btw not for those with sensitive skin:/
