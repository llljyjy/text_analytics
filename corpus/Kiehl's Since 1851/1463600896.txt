As a veteran of many retinol products, I would say this is a good “newbie” serum. I didn’t see dramatic results but it also didn’t leave my skin feeling dried out and I didn’t have any redness. There’s virtually no smell and it soaks into the skin nicely. The overall texture of my skin felt better but again, the results weren’t life changing. nan
