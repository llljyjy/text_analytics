I used this product for two weeks and as you can see from the picture, my skin looks brighter, firmer, and bouncier. There was definitely a visible difference even after the first week. My skin was lifted, hydrated and smooth. I really enjoyed this product and would definitely purchase. The packaging concept was interesting in that you mixed it up yourself. It gave me the sense that I was getting a fresher product. The product itself had a nice aroma and was thin enough to easily glide over the face. There was absolutely no irritation or redness and it was gentle to my skin unlike other retinol products. Skin feels plumper and smoother
