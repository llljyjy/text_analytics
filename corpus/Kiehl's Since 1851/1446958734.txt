I’m 37 and have bad allergies that leave me with dark circles and genetics that have gifted me with heavy upper eyelids. I used a Sephora promo code to try this product out for 10 days or something similar and O.M.G!!! The samples were so generous that I got nearly 6, weeks from them and the results were PHENOMENAL!!! Night and day! My first impression was that it was a VERY thick cream and I was concerned about it feeling gunky/heavy. Within 2 applications I found the perfect amount and it just MELTS IN. I mean this cream just melts and leaves your eye area so fresh and taut! I ran out a week back and JUST placed an order for this! I’ve tried Sunday Riley Auto Correct, Perricone Cold Plasma eye cream, La Mer, Murad, Laniege, Algenist...I’ve been all over the block with eye creams and I’m telling you this is the ONE!Don’t be put off by the texture/thickness of it and give it a few weeks! Worthy every penny! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!
