Literally so incredibly happy I tried this product! At first I thought it was a little odd that I had to mix it myself but then when I did it it was pretty cool! I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and honestly cannot believe how much my 11 lines between my eyebrows has softened up! I’ve also noticed forehead lines softening too. I imagine with continued use it’s going to look even better. Didn’t break me out either and I have sensitive acne prone skin. Kiehls never fails me Another Kiehls Hit!
