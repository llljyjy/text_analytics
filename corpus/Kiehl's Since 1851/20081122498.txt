Very moisturizing, but it just sits on my face and leaves me looking SO OILY. So I really do not recommend this for people with oily skin. I really tried to like this but I looked like I had butter on my face. Now I just try to use it at night so I donâ€™t waste my money buying this product Not for oily skin
