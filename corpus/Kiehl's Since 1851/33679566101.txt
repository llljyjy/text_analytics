The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream has such a thick and creamy texture to it, that you only need a little bit.  This makes the jar last a lot longer than I thought it would!  It has the lightest scent to it that fades away immediately.  So no worrying about any overpowering scents!  I use it twice a day, and it wears fine under makeup, especially since it absorbs so quickly and provides the perfect amount of moisture! I think this cream would be great to use any time of the year, but it’s so nourishing during Pennsylvania’s harsh winter temperatures these days!! I’d highly recommend it! Smooth & Creamy!
