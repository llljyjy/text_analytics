So it’s a mixed review because I do feel like I saw an improvement with one application on my skin.  The bad part is the smell was so strong I had to wipe it off my face after a few hours. It smells like cinnamon and wintergreen, which isn’t a bad smell, it’s just that It is really strong smell and didn’t dissipate over time.  So it’s not a product that I can use as it was overwhelming and made my eyes burn over time. Smells strong, works well
