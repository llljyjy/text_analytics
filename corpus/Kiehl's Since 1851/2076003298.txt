Great night cream! This moisturizer “mask” works as advertised.  I used it every other night and used LESS daily moisturizer! It melted into my skin and instantly made it feel better, even in the morning.  I have been using it for over a month and for the price, it’s definitely worth it- no problem.  The nightly skin cream I have is 4xmore. It will now last me longer as I will switch out every other night or so.  It’s a Win-win. Great
