First, assembling the serum is a lot of fun. Pushing the capsule into the end of the tube and shaking it up is a very interactive way to engage customers. I thought that the product might separate since there was the added retinol powder, but it seems to stay mixed.Since this is an extra strength product, I chose to use only 5 drops of the serum ever time I applied it. I don’t have sensitive skin but sometimes get a bit itchy when I overdo it on the retinol. The 5 drops seems to be a good starting dose, and I was able to use it daily while not causing any irritation.I get Botox on my crow’s feet and frown lines so I focused on using this product around other major lines around my face, specifically around my lips and marionette lines. After a couple of week so fusing the serum nightly, I noticed that the more fine lines around my upper lip were smoothing out a bit. I imagine with daily, extended use, I may see a more noticeable change and smoothing effect. I haven’t quite seen any effect on the larger, deeper wrinkles such as the marionette lines.
