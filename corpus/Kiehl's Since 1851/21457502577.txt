This product is amazing, while you do have to mix ingredients together the process is very simple and there are clear and detailed instructions (5 steps) on the back of the product. After the mixing, you dispense the product and apply. It goes on smoothly and absorbs super quickly. I have seen a brightening of my complexion and fine lines and wrinkles have softened. My wrinkles have not disappeared but I have noticed improvement.  I have not experienced any adverse reactions or excessive dryness. If you do experience dryness, just reduce the use of the product. I feel like my skin is clearer, brighter and super hydrated. I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion and honestly, Iâ€™ll spend my own money on this without a second thought. I highly recommend this product. Amazing Product.
