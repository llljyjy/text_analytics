I fell in love with this Corrective Dark Spot Solution,without a doubt it is the best one that I have tried so far. This is my first time trying a product from this brand and definitely won’t be the last. I love the very subtle floral fragrance of it. I have to say that it worked wonders for my skin. I love putting on it every single morning and night. I have noticed a big improvement to my hyperpigmentation. It does not affect the way my makeup feels or looks even if I add it right before doing my makeup, my skin just looked so radiant. It’s super gentle and didn’t irritate my skin at all. It has a rich, silky texture that fully absorbed within moments. My face literally felt instantly hydrated! I’m excited to see the effects on my skin after using less than half a bottle and I’m super excited to see the end results. It’s absolutely fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. I know products like this do take a while so just be patient and be very consistent! Absolutely amazing!!
