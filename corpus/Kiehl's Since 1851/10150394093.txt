I received this mask as a part of a free sample program. Great mask, very hydrating, especially, if you have a very dry skin. You need a little bit of a product for the application and the jar will last a long time. It’s not comedogenic, so it doesn’t clog your pores. It is not a lightweight mask, but it absorbs quite quick. It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated the morning after. I definitely recommend it. Very hydrating
