Really nice results from this mask. My skin feels really soft and nourished (I have oily skin and it doesn’t clog pores). I apply a small quantity and warm it up between my fingers before applying to face. It’s very rich and full of good ingredients I don’t expect it to be smooth and easy to apply I just care for it to work. good results consistency a bit challenging
