I’ve been using this serum for a few weeks now, and I have really been enjoying it. I was a bit apprehensive at first, having to mix the product myself, but I actually find it to be a bit of a relaxing ritual. Though I have been using this for less than a month, I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin. My fine lines have diminished considerably, and my skin has an overall glow. Definitely one of the best retinol serums that I have tried (I’ve tried many). Great Product
