the only product that has been in my routine since college! Iâ€™m not exactly sure why it works so well but it is truly a miracle in a bottle - smooths, soothes and gives a glow. With all the ideas out there about the dif skincare ingredients this face oil is still the holy grail - any time I stop using it in place of some of the more high tech products I always come right back its like magic
