This cream is very heavy and thick which is exactly what you look for in a nightcream however if you are scent sensitive or have scent allergies like me this is NOT for you. I have combination skin which is not overly sensitive except for when it comes to scented products. The scent is very strong but i figured like other creams it would dicipate, it didn’t. It was tolerable for about 10 minutes before I had to wash it off. My skin was bright red and itchy. I had to take a benadryl. My fault I should have known better and spot tested. My skin however felt hydrated afterwards. I’m torn on a star rating so I gave it a 3. It’s everything you want in a night cream minus the overpowering scent. Heavily scented
