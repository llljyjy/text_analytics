I have been using this Kielhâ€™s serum for the past two months now. One of the first things I noticed in opening it was how great it smelled-it smelled fresh, with a fragrance that was noticeable but not overpowering.it went on my skin really smoothly, and I wore it as a base under my sunscreen and moisturizer. It was easy to apply, and the application is made easy by the design of the bottle.I consistently wore this product under my skin for 2 months-it definitely improved my dark spots, but was not as noticeable as I would have liked. One issue that I had was that I was getting increased acne at this point in time, which seemed to hinder the progress of this product-it could have been a combination of wearing a mask, and just dryness in winter.Overall this is a great product, that is really easy to use in a daily routine that does work well-it just does not work super fast so have those expectations in mind! Smooth, Clear, Consistency
