I’ve enjoyed using the Kiehl’s Powerful Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum for the past 8 weeks. I can say I’ve noticed a slight improvement in dark circles after using it nightly. What I love most about this product is the velvety smooth and soft feel. It does not tug at the delicate skin under my eye, and seems to instantly blur imperfections. I also enjoy the light orange scent. This product does not irritate my eyes like other products (no redness or itching). I would recommend this product! velvety smooth feel
