This is a cult staple moisturizer for a reason!! It’s extremely hydrating and smoothing without feeling heavy or greasy. I have dry/very dry skin and this works wonders especially in the wintertime. Love that it has minimal fragrance and doesn’t leave a white cast. A must have for all skin types! An Essential Moisturizer!
