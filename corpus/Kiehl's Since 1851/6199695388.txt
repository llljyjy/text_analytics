I really enjoyed this moisturizer-it’s addition of Squalane only makes it better,as this is one of my favorite oils for my sensitive,dry,redness prone skin.This cream is not too thick or too thin,it’s just right. It sinks in nicely and it doesn’t leave behind a film or ball up when I apply my SPF over it in the am. This cream has caused no issues with my skin and has definitely helped in strengthening my moisture barrier. This is just a very simple,straightforward cream that checks all the boxes.No fragrance or mineral oil included-fragrance is a deal breaker for me,and this moisturizer provides 24 hour moisturization.All in all,an excellent product that I will definitely be purchasing when I run out.Kiehls is a favorite of mine and many for good reason.I definitely recommend this cream! Great,Basic Moisturizer
