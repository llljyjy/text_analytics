I have been wanting to try retinol for a long time. Let me start by saying I have a couple different skin issues including vitiligo, rosacea, dry skin, and some adult acne from time to time. This serum has helped them ALL! It cleared up my acne in about a week. The redness I have on my cheeks/forehead has been significantly reduced, and I no longer wake up with severe dry skin. I have tried so many different serums and creams over the years and nothing compares! I will definitely recommend this to friends and family, and will be purchasing more in the future! Incredible results!
