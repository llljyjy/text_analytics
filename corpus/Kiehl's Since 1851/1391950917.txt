This is my second jar of this stuff and I do like it, it’s really thick and creamy when it works. However, I won’t be purchasing it again. It has really bad separation with the ingredients almost slimy. You can’t have anything else on your face or it slides around. Even with a dry face the ingredients just slide around your eye until the actual green eye cream is able to penetrate the skin. Really unfortunate but that alone won’t have me buying another jar. I don’t want to be dropping that much on an eye cream if I have to constantly mix it, that just doesn’t seem sanitary to me. Bad separation of ingredients
