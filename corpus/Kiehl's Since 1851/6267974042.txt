I has expecting something different.  This night mask has a sold consistency that starts to melt as I apply it. It has a fresh kind of feel and starts to set on my skin kind of like a face balm. It has a weird scent. I don’t hate it though. I have dry dehydrated skin and I didn’t find this mask hydrating in the least. It also doesn’t stay on all night, I wake up with super dry skin. To me this is more of a sealing kind of balm , but I find a facial oil works better for my skin. I do love to use this as a hand cream though and its really nice to use as a body butter.
