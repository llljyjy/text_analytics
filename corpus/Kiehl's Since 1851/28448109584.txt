I started seeing some bags in the morning along with a few wrinkles under the eyes and Kiehl’s anti-aging eye cream actually did take away the bags and the wrinkles. I received this Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review & honestly I loved it. I’ve used it 2x a day an see a reduction in lines & wrinkles around my eyes. I am really impressed with Kiehl’s Eye Zone Treatment...the cream feels soothing on my puffy eyes and it is also brightened and hydrated the areas under the eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone who will listen to me! What beautiful eyes I have!
