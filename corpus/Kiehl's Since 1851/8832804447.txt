This moisturizer is the dreamiest color and texture. The blue color rather reminds me of a cloud smoothie. Texture wise, itâ€™s pretty thick, bit of a departure from a lot of the trendy water/gel moisturizers these days.  Botanical scent may be too strong for some people. Active ingredients are omega threes and squalene. Seems like aside from the scent, this will go well with a lot of different skincare routines. nan
