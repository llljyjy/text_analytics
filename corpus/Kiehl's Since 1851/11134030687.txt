Purchased this mini size to test the product out. I found it as a recommended product online for pores. Recently I’d noticed my pores around my nose and beneath my eyes were visible and large. It’s very drying so be sure to use toner and follow with a moisturizer. It definitely helped reduce the size and appearance of my pores. nan
