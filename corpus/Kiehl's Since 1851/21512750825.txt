It’s truly amazing how this toner can remove things I didn’t know were on my skin! I use a cotton pad to apply to my face, décolletage, and ears after cleansing, and it will always pick up at least some sort of discrepancy. My skin is sensitive and prone to acne, but it is also acclimated to using acid. For someone who hasn’t used any type of acid on their face, I would recommend just trying this out at night maybe twice a week at first to build some tolerance. I didn’t have any issues at all right off the bat, but that’s because my face has been through a lot... Overall, I love the smell! It is a nice toner that requires a gentle shake to mix the ingredients together. Surprisingly, despite containing almond milk, one of my friends who’s allergic to almonds was still able to use this product. I thought that was interesting to note. It’s very gentle and soothing to use. Takes everything off, but gently
