OMG, I am thrilled with Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream!  I guess I broke the rules as I’m also using this cream for my hands and elbows.  I thought this would be a great test because my hands really suffer in the cold winter months.  I saw the starting of my hand discomfort and so far the dryness has been kept in control.  It truly has become a dryness barrier for my trouble spots.  This is definitely different from any other product I’ve used because the dry and painful spots usually come back, but SO FAR (fingers crossed)...  The Colloidal oatmeal and beta-glucan ingredients definitely have some great benefits.  Also, if you’re someone that appreciates a fragrance-free cream Kiehl’s also come through with this too.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product to family, friends, and fellow shoppers. My dry skin dreams come true!
