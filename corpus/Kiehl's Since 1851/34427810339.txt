I love this overnight mask! The texture of the mask was a little scary at first because it was very thick but as I applied it, it applied so smoothly and absorbed into my skin very nicely. My skin the next morning felt very soft, silky, and hydrated. There was no oily or weird residue like some other products Iâ€™ve tried that claim to do the same thing. I received this product as part of a free sample program but will definitely continue to purchase once I run out! I have extremely dry skin that typically absorbs all moisture from the products I use and will look dry around the afternoon but this mask has helped so much to improve the dryness of my skin! Love the Hydration!
