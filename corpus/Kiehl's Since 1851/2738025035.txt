Absolutely LOVE this mask. I use it overnight and the next day my skin feels baby soft. Feels like a thick balm that you need to rub into a thin layer over your face - so a little goes a LONG way. Worth the price 100% for dry skin and lovely in the winter. Feels heavy and thick which is why Iâ€™d use it overnight. LOVE
