Kiehls Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum is a game changer!  I have been using Tretinoin 1.0 for quite a while and I noticed that Kiehls Night Serum is not has harsh on my skin.  I’m able to use it every night and I think that’s the difference between the tretinoin and Kiehls.  I can only use the tretinoin about twice a week or my skin will be dry and peeling.  I’ve definitely noticed a difference in fine lines and my usual hormonal acne.  I plan on purchasing when I run out.  With an $80 price tag I wanted to be sure that this stuff really works!  Also, for the love of God, please stay out of the sun when using retinol.  Keep your skin healthy! This is the real deal!
