A thick, creamy, moisturizing treatment for dry, crepey eyes! I use this every night and have found that my under eyes look better and hold makeup better during the day. A little goes a very long way. Four stars because it does nothing for under eye bags, unfortunately. I had a sample of this and came back to buy it during the spring sale. nan
