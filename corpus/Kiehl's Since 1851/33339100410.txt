I have combination skin and in the colder months my skin dries out with flaky patches on my cheeks, nose, and forehead. I started using Kiehl’s with my daily skin routine and it has been a fantastic addition! The flaky patches I had been battling the last few weeks are no more. My face feels so soft, and when I go out without makeup in the cold (8 degrees was the lowest so far) my face still feels the same, soft and supple. I have applied the cream to other areas as well, where I dry out due to eczema, and other skin issues. Oh, the moisturization is fantastic!!! It glides on smoothly and melts right into my skin. There’s no fragrance whatsoever and that is a plus. I steamed my face last night and followed up with Kiehl’s.... AMAZING!!! Try this cream!!! Get this cream!!!
