This product has dimethicone as one of the top ingredients! I just put this on and looked at the box and saw dimethicone suuuuuper high on the ingredient list. I absolutely cannot stand the feeling that dimethicone leaves on my eye area - leaves it feeling sweaty/greasy and super clogged. This is probably a Milia nightmare waiting to happen. Returning this ASAP. not a fan! dimethicone yuck!
