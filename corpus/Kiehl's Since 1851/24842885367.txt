After using this cream for a couple of weeks I am in love!!! It has my skin feeling hydrated, moisturized, silky, soft and the redness is fading away!! This time of year I look for facial creams that are specific for dryness and redness. This will deff be my new go to facial cream for the winter and fall as well. A must have in my routine!!!
