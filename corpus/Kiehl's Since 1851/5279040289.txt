This is amazing! I have sensitive dry skin, and I’ve been using a serum/moisturizer with bakuchiol that doesn’t hydrate well. This cica cream has a great texture, isn’t greasy, and keeps my skin very hydrated. I had a slight amount of redness that completely cleared using this for about 5 days. I love the Centella Sensitive Facial Cleanser too but Sephora no longer carries it. The Kiehls website has it in stock. love this!
