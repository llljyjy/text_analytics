This eye cream started out so great! I felt like my under eye puffiness/crows feet were already starting to see an improvement within one week of using it. The smell/texture/feel of the product on my skin were all awesome. However, during the second week, my skin started to react pretty poorly with small red dots appearing everywhere I applied it so sadly had to stop using. Not sure if it was because I was using it too frequently but nonetheless, too scared to continue :( Great start but not so great finish!
