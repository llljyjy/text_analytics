This Kiehl’s Fast Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum is a pretty interesting concept. It comes with a capsule of high concentrated retinol that you screw into the bottom of the bottle after removing the base. Then you push down on the bottom and it releases the capsule into the serum. Afterwards, I put the original base cap back onto the bottle. It has a button you push on the bottom and a small amount of serum comes out through the top. The serum is a light green color, but goes on clear and absorbs immediately with no residue left behind. I have oilier skin in the summer, so I don’t have to follow up with a moisturizer, but if you have dry skin you might need to. Because Retinol should be applied on dry skin, I used this after cleansing and patting my face dry. After a couple of weeks, my skin became firmer. I didn’t notice any new wrinkles forming and my other wrinkles were less obvious. Great retinol serum
