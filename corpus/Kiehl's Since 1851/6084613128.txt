This Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide was mostly disappointing. Firstly the only thing it does well is make my skin soft. It does not do everything it claims. It does have a good texture and is easy to apply. I have been using this for over a month and the only thing it has helped with is dry skin, nothing else. So overall i would just recommend this to be used as a mosturizer. It does have a very nice texture and is easy to apply but if looking for something for anti aging i dont think this is it. Just good for dry skin
