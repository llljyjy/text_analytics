If you have dryness around the eyes, I think this would be one of the best treatments you could buy. I donâ€™t really see it brightening my eyes, but I think it does depuff and it definitely helps keep the undereye area smooth (which is nice for makeup application). A little goes a long way and using too much can leave skin greasy. Great for Moisture
