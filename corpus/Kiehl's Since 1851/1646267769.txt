I have tried plenty of eye creams in the past and while I feel like they might be helping out at least slowing the progression of my fine lines, this is the first cream that actually seemed to correct the some of the fine lines that are already present. I have replaced verso super eye serum with this and would highly recommend. This stuff is great
