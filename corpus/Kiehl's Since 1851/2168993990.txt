I have been retinols for twenty years now and this has been one of the most effective and fast acting retinols I have ever used. After just a few uses and I immediately noticed how much softer my skin was. I also noticed immediately that I have zero redness. Despite always using retinols my skin often will get red but I have not experienced that once with this product. I have now been using it daily for three weeks. I still notice how soft my skin is and my fine lines have lessened. I donâ€™t notice any increase in firmness but I do see an overall improvement on clarity and dark spots. I think this is a definitely a good one and will purchase when done with sample. 20 years of retinols and this is the best!
