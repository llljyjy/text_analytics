This eye cream is fantastic! Almost too good which is why I only use it once a day. My eye area appears more firm, less crepey, and much brighter. My skin is SUPER soft and smooth which makes my eye makeup apply more evenly. I am using less concealer under my eyes since I started using the Kiehl’s cream. I’ve also started applying a bit of the cream between my brows where I have some furrow lines starting to show. It’s helping smooth out that eye area too! A little goes a long way so this pot will last quite a while. I only use it once daily, in the evening after I wash my face. I found that using it twice a day tightened my skin a bit too much and made some of my fine lines more noticeable. Once nightly seems like the magic touch! Fantastic results!
