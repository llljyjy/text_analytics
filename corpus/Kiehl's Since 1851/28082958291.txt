This is an amazing product! I’ve struggles all my life with oily and acne prone skin and I’ve tried lots of products that claimed to be helpful only to be disappointed and upset for wasting my time and money. When I was introduced to this specific cream I was skeptical. How could a cream be good for my skin if other products that claimed to be light weight failed me in the past? But I was happily surprised to see the results of it on my skin! It felt soft and plumped, and the best part not a lot of product needed!! So if you are looking for a a product that will make your skin look and feel great and that’ll last for quite some time this is for you! This is one product I definitely won’t ever change from my skin care routine. Head over heals
