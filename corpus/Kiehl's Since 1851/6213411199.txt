This cream did in one application what many others couldn’t do. It immediately relieved the red, irritated, and dry areas on my face and has kept those areas “repaired”. I would recommend it to others who suffer from sensitive skin and break out in the cold weather. A little goes a long way and the cream smooths unto skin very easily. Necessity for winter
