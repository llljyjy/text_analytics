I really like this overnight cream, for a few different reasons. For one, it’s got a really nice texture. I liken the texture of this cream, to room temperature butter, that’s been softened. It’s low key fun to apply, because of how good the texture feels, to touch. It starts off like the texture of soft butter, but as it meets the heat of my face, it turns smooth and glides effortlessly, onto my skin. I wash my face with cleanser, first, before applying this product. I also enjoy the fact that this is very much a “put it on and not worry about it” type of cream. There is no heavy smell/scent, whatsoever, and it doesn’t stick to my face. Frankly, I don’t even know it’s there, that is until I touch my face. It’s effortless, in this sense. I’ve used this product almost every single night, since I purchased it. However, It’s recommended to only use this product 2-3x a week. I’ve only recently cut back. I’ve not had one breakout, despite having sensitive skin. As for “does it work?” For me, I think it’s made a difference, sure. Side note: If you have a man in your life that “doesn’t do face stuff,” this product would make an excellent gift for them. It’s low effort, 2-3x a week night, commitment, that gives high quality results. In the morning after, when he washes this product off with his 3-in-1 castrol oil/body/face wash, he will appreciate the results. Perfect overnight cream/mask!
