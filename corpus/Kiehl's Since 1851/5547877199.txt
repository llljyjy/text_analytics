Exactly what I’d expect from a barrier cream. It’s very thick but spreadable and extremely nourishing. Loaded with repairing ingredients, it’s calming and soothing. I use tretinoin nightly so this is a great cream to put on as my last step. I love that it’s unscented, no frills and does what it claims. nan
