I’d say a full 4.5 stars-half off due to price and texture. I did receive this free from Bzzagent to try for at least a full 4 weeks before reviewing. I am not swayed by that so my rating is my own. This has a bit of a grainy texture even after shaking as directed. And it’s pricey even if this does lasts. The good tho-it does NOT sting, NO peeling, no scent. There is no need to get used to it as it is gentle but effective. It’s easy to pump from the bottom and apply. Then I follow up with moisturizer. I am 42 with fine lines and texture. My skin truly does look more refined and less “mature”. I am so grateful to have this complimentary to try. Would I buy it again? Yes IF ON SALE. It works without the fuss of other retinols
