This products packaging is the most unique I have seen. I appreciate that this is not a gimmick, but a way to keep the ingredients at their freshest and not activate the ingredients before they are ready to be used. The process to get the two vials mixed is so simple and mess free. There is very little waste. I started to use this every night after washing my face. After about one week my face started to flake. I have researched Retinol so I know this is completely normal reaction and it means the Retinol is working. I switched to every other day and the flakes cleared up and my skin has adapted to the serum. This glides onto your skin and is not visible or greasy. The next morning my face just feels silky. I cannot speak to seeing a change in my skin,, but I feel very confident it is doing good things for my skin based on the amount of Retinol this product releases.  My only con is that the vial is a little awkward to dispense You have to hold bottle upside down and push on the rubber button on the bottom. It is not so easy to push, but I like that just enough comes out so you are not wasting the product by dispensing too much. There is no scent to this product! I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Good dose of Retinol
