This cream is great! I have very sensitive dry skin so I needed something to target that, especially in the winter. I have perioral dermatitis on my face because of being a nurse and wearing masks constantly on my sensitive skin and this cream is very soothing and protective for my skin. I love how thick and rich the cream is but doesnâ€™t leave a really greasy feel on my skin, absorbs well. I am overall very happy and will be buying again! Great price as well. nan
