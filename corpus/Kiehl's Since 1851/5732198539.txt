The Kiehlâ€™s Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum is very unique in that it comes in a powder form and you mix it yourself. This assures that the serum is fresh upon first use. It only takes a small amount of this serum to cover your entire face, so the one ounce bottle should last a while. This product has no scent to it, so it should work well for those who are sensitive to fragrance. This serum is very lightweight. It absorbs quickly and completely without leaving any sort of sticky or tacky feeling on the skin. With continued use, I have noticed some improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. I would definitely recommend giving this product a try, especially if you are interested in finding a new retinol product. nan
