I was fortunate enough to had a chance to try and give an honest review Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum, first off I’ve used different retinols, and I must say I was really surprised by how fast I saw result. The self mixing of the cream with the retinol powder was actually something very new to me, I’d never done this, the whole process was very easy to do. The serum is a bit on the thin side I didn’t mind love how  it stays put and feels like it hydrates. I myself know that retinols are a little harsh on sensitive skin or thin skin. My skin started kinda peeling a bit but after a couple days it was glowing and I loved how youthful my 40 something yr young skin looked. I will definitely be buying more once I run out, and I’d be happy to recommend to family and friends. Thanks to #bzzagent #kiehl’s  for letting me try it out! Results are worth it!
