At first, I was apprehensive about this dark spot removal solution but I kept with it and have seen great results. I’ve tried a few others with big promises and no results but this isn’t the case with Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution. The key is sticking with it and adding it to your daily routine. I gained my main dark spots during my pregnancy 14 years ago. I’ve had people point them out to me and this really made me self conscious about my skin. I felt as though these spots were where people were focusing even tho they may not. This solution has really made a difference and I love it’s results!! Easy and works to remove my dark spots
