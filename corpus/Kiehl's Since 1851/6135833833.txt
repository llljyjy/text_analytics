I purchased the mini size, a month in I still have a lot left. I have dry skin, already in my early 30’s and have noticed how dry my skin gets now. I also have fine lines starting to show. A little goes a long way. I use 1 - 3 drops, I pat it  on to my face and neck after my moisturizer. I didn’t see a difference after week 1, but week 2 is when I noticed my skin beginning to glow. I even went to work without make up and my colleagues thought I was wearing foundation., they complimented my skin.It didn’t cause me to break out or make my skin oily. You may not like this if you are sensitive to essential oils or fragrance. WAKE UP AND GLOW
