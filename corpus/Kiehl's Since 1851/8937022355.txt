I haven’t bought a clay mask in years because I always felt like they never did anything for me. I decided to try this Kiehl’s one out not expecting much but after my very first application I am shocked by the night and day difference on my face after just one use! I’m beyond impressed with this product and I will 100% be buying again. Adding this to my weekly routine
