I used Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream as part of my PM routine and it was perfect for my dry skin! After doing PM double cleansing, I used Kiehl’s Midnight Cream, and instantly it got absorbed nicely, loved the texture and made my skin silky and smooth, without any trace of oil or grease. It is light and also rich. Ingredients are all great and food for my dry skin. Kiehl’s night Cream was much better than what I using right now which greasy and shiny, This is going to be part of my night skin care routine and I highly recommend it for all skin types but since my skin is dry it worked perfectly well on me. High quality!
