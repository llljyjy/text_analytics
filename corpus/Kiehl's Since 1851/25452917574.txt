In terms of thickness/texture this product is a 10/10. It’s thick and doesn’t move, doesn’t get into eyes, and sits perfectly even on eyelids.... It feels like a thick layer but absorvbs quickly and smooths the heck out of my under eye area. I’d love to see some more innovative ingredients though in this formula, seems like they could’ve added more for brightening/lifting! Very thick & smooths!
