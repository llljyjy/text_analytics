I have dry and aging skin (49 yrs).  I also live in a colder climate (Minnesota) and the winter winds can be brutal on my skin. I just knew this mask was going to be a major key to replenishment. I was wrong. Not only did my skin remain dry; I woke up to even drier skin when using the product.  I also experienced breakouts because the Ph Balance of my skin was thrown off.  I wanted to like this product sooooo much.  I used it for several weeks thinking something else was drying out my skin and activating blemishes.  Once I stopped using the product the symptoms subsided.  I also don’t care for the scent.  I do ENJOY other Kiehl’s products, just not this one. Sorry. NOPE
