This cream is lovely. It is very thick. Perfect for a night cream, especially if you have dry skin. You only need the tiniest bit to cover your whole face. It doesn’t have a heavy scent. My skin when waking up is well moisturized, it’s definitely a cream I would repurchase. I have combo skin, dry especially at my jawline and forehead. I don’t have sensitive skin and I’m 42. THICCCC
