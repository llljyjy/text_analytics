Open your skin care regimen to this beautifully blue luxurious hydrating night cream. After a week of using this product every night my skin has a radiance and slightly firmer appearance. A small amount will go a long way and will almost melt into your skin.  The scent takes me back to the good old days of getting a facial and the products I use to purchase there. Also, it is made using 100% renewable energy. Love your skin while you are loving the environment. Luxury in a Jar
