I was very excited to receive this sample. I have tried Kiehlâ€™s products before and have been very impressed. I love the Rare Earth Deep Pore Daily Cleanser!! At first I was a little confused and not sure about mixing in the pure retinal-infused powder formula. It now makes sense, it keeps it fresh! I think back on how long some of my products have sat on the shelf expiring before I even purchased. I was a little worried that this formula may cause irritation to my skin but I had no problem at all. I feel as though some of my fine lines around my eyes and forehead have softened. I will continue to use this products and would purchase in the future. nan
