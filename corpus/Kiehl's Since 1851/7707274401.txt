I received this cream from Bzzagent and Kiehls for free, in exchange for my honest review. I already had the midnight recovery face serum, so I started using both when I received the moisturizer to go with it. I think itâ€™s great for dry skin. The texture is a bit too heavy for oily. The cream is actually heavy, but very hydrating. I love the scent of lavender and natural botanicals too. Great moisturizer for dry skin. Oily? Not so much
