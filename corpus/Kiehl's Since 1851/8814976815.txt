I was super excited to test out the Kiehls Retinol night serum! It came in a cute package and I really liked that the powder was separate from the liquid. The instructions were very easy to add the powder to the liquid. An the application process is super easy as well! I have been using this product for over 3 weeks now and noticed a slight difference in my problem area which is my forehead and around my eyes. The serum feels so smooth on my skin, but I did notice a slight burning sensation for the first few days. Other than that I really like Kiehls retinol night serum and would consider purchasing it. Amazing
