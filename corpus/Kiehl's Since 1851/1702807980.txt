Sometimes when I use retinol or another strong ingredient in my skincare routine, my sensitive skin becomes a little irritated and red. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream helps the healing time so much. It’s like a dupe for the La Roche Posay Cicaplast line or the other way around. I like putting a thick layer on my face before going to sleep to maximize the moisturizing properties overnight. nan
