Really moisturizing, Iâ€™m on accutane currently so I struggle with really dry skin specifically in my face and under eyes. This product is really hydrating without causing Milia or breakouts and helps make concealer look more seamless. I notice when you open the product it separates from cream and oil laying on top, so I highly recommend shaking/ mixing before using. nan
