I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I loved the bottle and application of this serum.  Much easier to handle.  I was not impressed with the self mix formula.  The product went on my face smoothly.  Only issue was the formula was too harsh for my skin.  I kept feeling the powder mixture.   It made my face feel gritty.   Due to sensitivity to the product, I am using it very sparingly. Self mix Serum
