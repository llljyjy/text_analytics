Pros- 1. works well under makeup-great foundation primer and helps with dry patches quite well 2. Hydrates skin with small amount 3. doesn’t cause acne 4. Ok for sensitive skin CONS 1. Doesn’t improve the skin much besides some hydration 2. Maybe not worth the price unless more skin nutrition benefits 3. Could add a calming ingredient for sensitive skin/ redness (it does not aggravate sensitive skin, but for cost could be better; it’s just ok) I’ve used this for about two weeks. I can’t say if I’ll repurchase yet or if it’s worth the cost. I’m neither disappointed or very pleased. It’s ok. Pros and cons
