This is a keeper! I have one specific spot that is very noticeable and this serum/solution has lightened it up significantly. I am excited to see how much less noticeable it will become with more use. The solution comes in a glass bottle with a dropper so the amount to dispense can be easily controlled. It dispenses thick like a serum but applies thin and absorbs quickly. It has a slight scent and to me its a bit medicinal for Kiehls but its not offensive nor a deal breaker and it does fade Effective Spot Corrector
