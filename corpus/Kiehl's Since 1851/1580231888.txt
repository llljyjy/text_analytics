I just moved from Texas to Illinois and my skin is not used to the cold winter weather the Midwest has to offer! I needed something that was hydrating yet not heavy since I have oily skin. This is just that! It has a lightweight texture and absorbs quickly into the skin, yet leaves my skin moisturized all day! I donâ€™t know what I would do without it during these cold winter months! A must have for dry winter skin!
