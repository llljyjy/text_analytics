I’ve seen a number of reviews saying this product was drying. I don’t see how it could possibly be drying. This is a water based toner. The third ingredient is squalane, a shelf-stable hydrocarbon derived from squalene, which is a naturally occurring skin moisturizing agent and protector. The product also contains emulsifiers, stabilizers, one of which can help combat fungal acne, and three different oils. Squalane penetrates into the skin, and doesn’t leave heavy residue, which may make someone believe it was not providing moisture. Many moisturizing products I find tend to leave a heavy film that seems like it would be moisturizing my skin, but is actually just a thick layer that isn’t providing benefit beyond serving as an emollient. Products like this one should be used under more emollient moisturizers, but still provide important care to deeper levels of the skin that are not provided by heavier products. It is frustrating to see people who don’t seem knowledgable about skincare ingredients commenting on well-researched, safe and effective products. It sounds like someone calling a bottle of water “drying.“ For people with acne, the oil content may lead to breakouts. I find that applying this after a BHA or niacinamide step aids in avoiding breakouts. Staple for years, moisturizing and affordable
