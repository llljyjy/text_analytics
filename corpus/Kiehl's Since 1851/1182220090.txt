This cream is hydrating, but not heavy. It has nice ingredients and absorbs well. It does have a natural type scent some people may not like. I have sensitive skin, and I think this may have caused some minor breakouts on my chin, but that is not uncommon for me when trying a new product. Overall I like it and will use it on my forehead and cheeks where I am less sensitive. Hydrating but not heavy
