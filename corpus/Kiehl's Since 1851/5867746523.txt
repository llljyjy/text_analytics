I received this product as a free sample.  The is has become one of my favorite eye creams.  It is very hydrating and I did notice a slight lift or firmness of my eyebrow bone area.  I have lightly hooded lids and I have noticed a slight drop over the years.  This cream helped tighten that area again.  I had fine lines under my eyes, nothing too deep and this cream helped hydrate that area too. Perfect eye cream
