I love this moisturizer. I tried several different ones prior to this as I have very sensitive skin (rosacea) and everything else made me break out, even when it was marked for sensitive skin. I also have dry skin and this worked very well, though I do not know how those neither oily skin would do with this as itâ€™s very hydrating. Overall my skin has felt very smooth and soft all day! Good for sensitive skin
