I tried this serum for 1 month. The consistency is thin but not an issue as it absorbs quickly and very well. The smell is nice- not too strong and pleasant. I don’t believe that being able to mix the product when you get it really makes a difference in the product. It did make for a neat bottle though. I didn’t have any sensitivities to the product. It seemed to work okay but I didn’t notice any difference in my skin or my wrinkles. Overall, it was a good serum but I can’t say it will help with reducing wrinkles. Nice
