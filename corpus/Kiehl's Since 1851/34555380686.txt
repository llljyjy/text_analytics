Very moisturizing. I shower at night, so I started using this after because I scrub my face and it often dries it out. I was hoping that by using this high quality cream, it would keep my face from being oily while I slept. I saw a great improvement in my complexion after a week of using it. My skin feels very hydrated now. Helpful with Acne and Dry Skin
