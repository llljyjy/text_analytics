This cream has a delightfully light texture that packs a punch. A little goes a long way. Keeps my combo skin hydrated in my dry patches and shine-free in my oily patches. I’ve tried it underneath foundation, powder and spf and it layers nicely with whatever I’ve put over it. I appreciate that it’s legitimately scent free (it doesn’t smell like a pharmacy like some unscented products - it actually has no scent!) as I have sensitie skin. Great Multi-Tasker
