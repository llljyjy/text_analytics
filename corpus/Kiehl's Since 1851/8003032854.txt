I wanted to add sunscreen into my routine but struggled to find one that didnt leave a white cast, pill, break me out, etc. I heard such good things about the regular Kiehls moisturizer, that when i saw they had a version with sunscreen I impulsively picked it up. Of course afterwards i checked the reviews and it seemed mixed, so i was scared this wasnt going to work for me. However, ive been using it for roughly 2 months and absolutely no issues. Its a great, thick moisturizer, has a faint sunscreen smell but doesnt burn my eyes, pill, or make me break out. I find that it does make me look fairly glowy/greasy but i really dont mind that look. So although i HIGHLY recommend this, if you have oily skin/not a fan of that look i would definitely look into other options. Great moisturizer with sunscreen
