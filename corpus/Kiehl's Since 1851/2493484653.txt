My fiancé and I love this toner. It’s super moisturizing where you don’t even need to put on a separate moisturizer. The product DOES run out very quickly… it takes about a month to empty (granted, two people were using this towards the end). They recommend putting the product on a cotton pad, so maybe that’s why? super moisturizing, great toner! repurchasing!
