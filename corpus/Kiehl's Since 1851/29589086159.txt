I’m loving this sample of Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream. I have used it both in the morning and in the evening after washing my face. It’s lightweight formula leaves my skin hydrated but NOT greasy. This little tub will last me at least 6 months, if not more; as a little bit goes a long way. I would buy this to use for a general facial moisturizer, it works great with out without makeup over it, no extra oil. My skin feels soft and hasn’t experienced any breakouts. I love that it’s free of mineral oil and parabens. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a facial moisturizer that covers all the bases and won’t break the bank. Lightweight Moisturizer
