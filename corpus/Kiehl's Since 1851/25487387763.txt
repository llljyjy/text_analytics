I’ve tried tons of face creams and serums without ever really noticing a difference.I didn’t have high hopes for this but after about a week of use every night I can 100% see a difference.  My skin seems brighter, more even, slightly younger. I really wish I would of taken before and after pics.  I also tend to have sensitive skin that breaks out and gets dry with some products.  This was super gentle, no strong smell, didn’t cause me to break out or cause right dry skin.I did receive this as a sample and when I looked up the price didn’t think I would ever actually buy it.  After using it for a bit now I ordered and will keep ordering! For me to spend this kind of money on a very limited income it 100% works! This stuff is awesome!
