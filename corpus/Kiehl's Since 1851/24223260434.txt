Like the rest of the Kiehl’s products, this retinol serum did not disappoint. I really liked how you add the retinol into the base when you’re ready to use it. It’s definitely fresh and activated this way! Really cool! The product felt very light and slipped right on. I love that this is packaged in a glass bottle, but I did find that the tip would plug up- but that was easily fixed with a pin. Overall I highly recommend! Did not disappoint
