This review is for Kiehl’s Dark spot solution provided by Bzzagent for my honest review.  It’s a clear serum in a glass bottle. The serum has a very light flower scent not a chemical smell. When I originally received the 1oz bottle,  I thought it wouldn’t be enough for my over pigmentation that is occurring (on my cheeks) more as I age.  But a little does go a long way.My results from the testing was slow but eventually noticeable within a few 2 months of using it. It was not an extreme change but definitely enough for me to notice.  It was enough to lighten scars from itchy skin.I would recommend this product to anyone looking to correct they’re skin scarring.  Lastly, I did think to research the price because this is also important for my review.  For the 1oz bottle it was $60 and for the larger size it was $80.  So look around for any possible coupons and or sales because you are definitely paying for an actual working product.  4 stars out of 5 due to cost. It does what it says...
