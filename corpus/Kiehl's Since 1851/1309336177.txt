Iâ€™ve been using this eye cream for a couple of months now and have started to notice faint changes to my dark circles.  My dark circles are hereditary so I have yet to find a product that completely brightens up my under eyes.  This serum is creamy and applies on smoothly.  A very small pump is all is needed to cover both eyes.  The serum hydrates and moisturizes my eyes and has removed the puffiness making me look less tired which is great. Overall, it a good serum to combat and diminish problematic issues around the eye area. Good eye serum
