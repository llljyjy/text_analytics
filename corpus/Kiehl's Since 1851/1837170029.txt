I was looking for a thick, super creamy, super moisturizing eye cream and this delivers. I found it to be a little too slick to wear under makeup, my concealer slides around over it, so I wear this on days when I’m wearing my mask at work with no face makeup. It’s extremely thick so application works best by rubbing it between your ring fingers to warm it up, and then patting on. It can also be worn on the upper lids with no irritation. Will buy again.
