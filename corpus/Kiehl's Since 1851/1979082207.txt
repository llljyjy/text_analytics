This came at the perfect time! I have already dry skin and have use multiple overnight masks to try and help with the cold NJ winds that break down my skin everyday. This mask is packed with hydrating elements that melt into your skin and easily layer with your moisturizer! I did find it was a tad greasy but again didnâ€™t cause me to break out and was great on my super dry spots like around my mouth from wearing a mask and under my nose. Definitely great for exfoliation days! A little bit of product  goes a long long way and I can tell this jar will last a while. Super hydrating!
