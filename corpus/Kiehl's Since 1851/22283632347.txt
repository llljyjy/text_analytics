It’s a good product it definitely helped with adding moisture I received this for free for review purposes from BzzAgent and I appreciate it very much now that I’ve been using it for about 2 months I do notice my skin is less dry and feels great only thing is it’s a little pricey but otherwise it’s a great product and it does work very well I would definitely recommend it .
