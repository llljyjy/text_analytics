I received Kiehlâ€™s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution for free to test and review. I have been using it for a while now and I definitely see improvement in my skin. I have had a red mark for a over a year now on my left cheek from an old pimple and it is now light pink. I also have a brown spot on my left temple that is visibly fading. The product is definitely working for me. I will continue to use it and will recommend it to others. I have never used a vitamin C product on my face before and now I will always incorporate it into my skincare routine. Great product!
