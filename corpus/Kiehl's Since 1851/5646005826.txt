I returned this item because it already looked like it had been used. No seal, no box. Just a plastic bag. The sephora employees agreed with me and thought it was weird that Kielh’s a brand I actually respect did so poorly on packaging for this. I’m sure the product works well but I didn’t want to use it because it had no safety seal or even a box that it came in. Packaging is off for this product. No seal or box.
