My combo oily skin really likes this. After using, my face feels and looks softer, brighter and smoother. It doesn’t clog my pores or cause any breakouts. I like that it’s fragrance free, and I really like the rich thick texture. Although I e used it both day and night, I do prefer using it before bed to help lock in moisturize. Works well
