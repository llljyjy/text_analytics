I have been using this almost every night for a little over a month now and I am loving the results! It is doing a great job smoothing out my fine lines and helping to even out my skin tone a bit. It hasn’t made my skin perfect by any means, but it is helping which is nice. It also doesn’t have any scent which I appreciate. Loving this!
