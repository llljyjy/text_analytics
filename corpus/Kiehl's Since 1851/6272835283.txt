(I did receive a sample size ) I found a small change nothing to dramatic. None the less it was definitely a positive change in lightness and textures of my under eye skin. If you have veins visible obviously won’t change color of your veins but it has improved brightness I don’t have raccoon eyes anymore ! I definitely recommend this product and you must be consistent. Also , a little goes a long way! Works .
