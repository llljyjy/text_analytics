I purchased this as an alternative to the FAB Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner. This toner is a better value and has a number of the same ingredients. Iâ€™ve switched to hydrating/soothing toners in place of ones with actives while I focus on repairing and protecting my skin barrier. I am very happy with this product and it is working well for my needs! nan
