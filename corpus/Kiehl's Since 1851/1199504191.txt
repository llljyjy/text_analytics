Nothing wrong with this product! Absolutely perfect. Used it as a night mask on my dry areas of skin around my chin and jawline before leaving to Mexico. Brought with us on our trip to Mexico and 17 year old daughter and used it religiously, putting all over faces every single night! Worth the money ….. worth the wait!!’ nan
