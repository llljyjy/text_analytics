I used this product for a little over a week, morning and night, and my eyes were so smooth and moisturized. It is a bit greasy, so you may want to make sure that it’s well soaked-in before applying any makeup, and that you use some sort of primer for your eye makeup after using this. But, my eyes looked great, it smoothed out some minor crinkling that I’ve  started to see. What it doesn’t smooth out is any deep lines - at least it hadn’t in the week I used it. But it smells good, it goes on smoothly, I got no eye irritation from it, and it is very moisturizing. All in all I’d recommend it. Full disclosure: I did get a free sample size to try it out, but all opinions are my own. nan
