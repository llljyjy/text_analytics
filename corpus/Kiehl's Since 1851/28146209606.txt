I have a combination skin type that is on the dryer side. I have used this a few times at night as the last step of my skincare routine. The formula is so smooth and luxurious. I apply this lightly all over my face and, make a note, a little goes a long way. The cream is on the lighter side and absorbs so nicely! It is scented, but it’s such a clean fresh scent that doesn’t bother me at all. I have noticed such a difference in my skin while using this cream. With this incredible formula, I have noticed my skin has firmer elasticity and overall looks smoother. I love waking up with my skin feeling so soft and nourished. It sets the tone for the day! I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! I genuinely recommend it to anyone looking to up your skincare regimen! You will not be disappointed! Sleeping in the Clouds!
