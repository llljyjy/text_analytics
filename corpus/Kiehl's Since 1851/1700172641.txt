I am a longtime user of Kiehlâ€™s product and was very happy to try and review their new Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum. I was nervous at first when I read that the active ingredient was in powder form and needed to be mixed by the user. However, this process could not have been easier. The formula is quite thin and runny which helps to spread easily but I find a thicker formula to be more manageable for dispensing and application. The strength is much higher than I am used to using so I was expecting to experience irritation but surprisingly I did not. I am thrilled about the fact that I did not experience any irritation and consider this product a winner for this reason alone considering the high quality and level of retinol. Unfortunately, I did not see a difference in my skin after regular use for two weeks... Maybe a subtle difference??? However, I will continue to use the product with the hope to see some changes over time. I have  included photos for comparison purposes. No Improvement Yet But Still Hopeful
