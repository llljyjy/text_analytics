I absolutely loved this hydrating cream. It’s thick and absorbent just perfect for cold weather. It quickly gets rid of the redness on my face too. I love that you can use it day and night. I feel like it’s repaired my skin barrier because my skin feels amazing super soft. I definitely recommend this to my friends and family. Amazing facial cream
