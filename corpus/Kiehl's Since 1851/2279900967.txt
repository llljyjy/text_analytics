Tatcha has been my go to moisturizer for years but needed a change mainly because my face would be super oily by late morning after using and was looking for something less expensive. So I gave KIEHL’S a try due to the high ratings and I’m so glad I did because this moisturizer is amazing. It’s super moisturizing but does not feel greasy and definitely helped with the oiliness. My skin just looked better overall. No breakouts either! I just ordered a second jar. nan
