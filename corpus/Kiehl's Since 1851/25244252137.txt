Kiehlâ€™s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution is a truly transformative serum. It is a super clear serum clinically formulated to brighten the skin and treat hyperpigmentation. It contains a shelf stable form of Vitamin C to address issues with dullness and uneven skin tone. There are no issues with degradation of the formula once opened and the serum does not change colors, which can be problems with other Vitamin C products. This serum has an almost weightless texture that absorbs nicely into the skin and layers well with other products. It has a subtle herbal scent and is non-irritating. I used this serum for three months and started seeing results almost immediately. I used it mainly on post acne hyperpigmentation marks and it really helps to fade as well heal those spots much quicker. It also made my overall complexion brighter, more even toned, and smoother. nan
