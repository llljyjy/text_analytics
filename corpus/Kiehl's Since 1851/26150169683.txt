This eye cream has a nice cooling effect on my face. It goes on easily with no greasiness and absorbs quickly into my face and eye area. In a week’s time, I’ve noticed my brow area is more lifted and the dark circles under my eyes are diminished. The fine lines around my eyes are still there, but they seem to be lessened. Over time and with continuous use, I can see this anti-aging eye cream helping to brighten and smooth out the areas around my eyes. Great for around the eyes
