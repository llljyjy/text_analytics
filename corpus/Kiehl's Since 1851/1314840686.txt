I feel like my skin looked brighter after the first week! I have somewhat sensitive skin. I have melasma and texture issues. I used this product for a couple of weeks and I felt like I noticed a difference. My skin seemed refreshed. My fine lines did not seem as noticeable. I did stop using other products to make sure there werenâ€™t any negative interactions. It did cause some very mild peeling so I switched to every other day which seemed to help. I was super impressed by the packaging. I did not have any trouble mixing up the product. The dispenser is nice and I get just the amount of product I want to use. I would recommend and repurchase for myself. Brighter Skin
