At first, I loved it, then I grew suspicious of how silky this cream. So, I decided to investigate the third ingredient- cyclohexasiloxane. Turns out it’s a silicon based polymer described as a “volatile” emollient meaning its instability allows it to evaporate from your skin, rather than absorbing. This is actually a good thing because the skin doesn’t get that sticky feeling and the squalene can sink in!However, I just read this ingredient often requires other, heavier silicons to increase its effectiveness. Not that Kiehl’s has made any false claims regarding this product, but I feel slightly better using “clean” beauty where the ingredients are more transparent. Just FYI
