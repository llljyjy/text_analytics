The serum is lightweight and you really only need a little bit. I use it once a day, at night before bed and I noticed an improvement with my dark circles. Of course, getting proper sleep is the key to dark circles as well but I do see a difference in the 3 weeks I’ve been using it. My only concern is that it dries out the skin under my eyes. To correct that, I use a small amount of Vaseline and I’m happy with the overall result. Good product overall
