This product is completely different from other products I’ve tried in the past. I appreciate that you can control when to activate the active retinol ingredient. This was my first time seeing that in a retinol product. I also like that the serum doesn’t feel greasy or sticky. It has a smooth texture after mixture, whereas some other products on the market can feel tacky to the touch. Makes layering other night time products (such as night cream) easier for me. I do find that it absorbs quickly, so you have to apply the serum a bit quicker than others otherwise you can end up using more than a pea size to cover the full face. My only confusion was regarding the serum dispenser, as I didn’t realize it was at the very bottom until after a couple of uses. But, after I realized that, the dispenser made measuring the amount of serum much easier. The serum didn’t seem to adversely interact with other products. I did make sure to use sunscreen during the day, as I would after using any products containing retinol. The product also seemed fragrance-free, which is good if you have any reaction to fragrances. As for my skin, after 2 weeks of nightly use, I noticed a smoother complexion, but I did experience a couple of minor breakouts near my chin. However, that may be due to my skin adjusting to the new skincare product routine. Nice and innovative serum
