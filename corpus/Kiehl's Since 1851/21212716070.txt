I have been a longtime fan of Kiehls products,  especially their midnight recovery concentrate,  so I was thrilled that I was given this product to review. The Kiehls Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is a lightly scented, to me it smells like lemons mixed with botanicals, but the scent wasn’t overwhelming or unpleasant and it dissipated quickly. The texture is as promised,  light and airy yet it feels rich and luxurious on the skin. It absorbed quickly and didn’t leave behind a sticky or greasy residue. My skin felt softer, more hydrated and smoother after use. My husband who notices nothing,  kept asking me if I was doing something different because my skin looked great, (he didn’t know I was trying a new product), that’s a pretty solid endorsement. I will definitely be repurchasing this, it’s replaced my other night creams. New Favorite
