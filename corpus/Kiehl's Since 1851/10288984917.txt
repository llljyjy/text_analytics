I’m not sure why there are so many good reviews and why this is so expensive. I’ve been using this since December (it’s now April) and I see absolutely no difference. I get a healthy amount of sleep too. I still have fine lines and dark circles. This “eye serum” did nothing for me. This product also feels gunky under the eyes and smells funny. Don’t buy this. does literally nothing…
