I was waiting a little time to use it since a very short time ago I underwent a chemical peel and my skin was too Sensitive, in fact I have a problem in addition to sensitive skin ... for this I preferred to wait before trying it so that my review would not be affected for any unfavorable reaction, for not waiting a prudent time to test itâ€¦.  I have only used it 3 times a week, but honestly, I feel that it is better than many moisturizers that I have used, it has helped me a lot to keep moisture in my skin, I feel smooth, shiny and with better appearance when I get up !!!  of course at the end of the sample sent by @Bzzagent I will buy another one again, since I feel that it is very good for deep hydration in people with extreme dry skin (as is my case) ... I highly recommend this product, with all possible honesty, I promise you will not regret it or have an unfavorable reaction, on the contrary it is a marvel ... Stunning
