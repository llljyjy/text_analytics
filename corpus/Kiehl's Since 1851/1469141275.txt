I’ve been looking for a perfect mash up of a heavy creamy super moisturizer and a soothing gel moisturizer. I will look no further. This stuff is a perfect blend of both of those things. It looks super thick and creamy before you put it on and when you go to rub it in it feels like a gel! It’s a dream. Definitely would recommend it to others. Heavy moisturizer without the heavy feel
