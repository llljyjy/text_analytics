With winter in full swing, I was looking for a good moisturizer to combat any dryness this season brings. I had purchased another skincare brand who’s product claims to have the same benefit of this product, but the Kiehl’s Ultra Face Cream is far better! It soaked in quickly and is now part of my everyday nighttime routine. My skin glows daily and I’m convinced it’s because of this product! Love it and will definitely be buying more! Soft, Supple and Packed with Moisture!
