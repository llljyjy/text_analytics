I really enjoyed the unique packaging this product has.  You mix the active ingredient into the other ingredients so it is most effective.  Besides the interesting bottle, the applicator is unique as well.  There is a large rubber push button on the bottom of the bottle which I have never seen before.  Most importantly, though, the product itself is effective.  It is not drying and peeling but does reveal fresh exfoliated looking skin.  It gave my skin the dewy glowy look that I am always looking for.  I really enjoy using this product and recommend to others to try it! nan
