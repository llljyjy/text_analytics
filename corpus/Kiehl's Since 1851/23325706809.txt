I first discovered this lotion from a set I got (500 beauty points). I really wanted to find a thick moisturizer. I have sensitive skin. I love my face glowy and supple. This does way more. Protects my skin barrier and soothes redness. I finished a small jar of fresh - picture included.  Went and ordered another Kielhs jar. I love it. Even got a smaller jar from the 4x offer this week so I can use it to travel or keep in my bag for days I know the NYC winter will hit my face. It’s great under makeup as well. You won’t regret this purchase. it’s a beauty stable
