my top moisturizer tbh ... i have oily skin tho and i feel like i’m still a little oily with this but i figured to try diff moisturizers geared towards oily skin to see if they work, didn’t compared to this (tried like 2 other moisturizers) ... if can handle little oiliness, this product will help at least keep your face clear of acne, and for sure keep skin moisturized! little pricey so maybe test before purchase big, but i got the biggest ones twice so far! nan
