I usually do not try new skin brands but this cream itâ€™s One of my favorites so far. I absolutely loving the positive results in my skin. It works wonders guys. I had red acne scars and I can see a total improvement and no new acne breakouts.  The dryness around my nose with those little bumps had disappeared. I am so pleased with this cream. I just apply a tiny bit and it goes a long way. No skin irritation whatsoever. This one has become one of my top favorites facial moisturizer. Hydrated but to me it heals too. Highly recommended. I adore this cream. Love it, works
