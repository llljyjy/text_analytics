I like how it has so far noticeably reduced my fine lines and the start of crows feet around my eyes. A little goes a long way and doesn’t leave your face too oily or sticky.  It helps firm up my eyes and I notice a brighter difference. This has helped to even my skin tone and it is a nice consistency which isn’t too thick. It absorbs nicely and makes it feel hydrated.  Pleasant light scent and texture.  Very easy to apply! Would recommend to those who are looking for an high quality anti-aging cream. It helps firm up my eyes
