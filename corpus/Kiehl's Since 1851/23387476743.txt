I have dry and sensitive skin and I always look for creams that are light-weight and super-hydrating. The texture of this cream is very light, it absorbs quickly into the skin making it soft, smooth and plump. It doesnâ€™t clog my pores or leave greasy feeling. It is lightly scented. I highly recommend this. nan
