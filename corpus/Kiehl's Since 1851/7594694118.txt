First, let me start by saying that this cream feels great when applying. It’s not sticky, it’s very lightweight, and leaves my skin feeling so smooth. That being said, I just did not receive the results that I had hoped I would. If I miss one application, my face is peeling, dry, and flaky again the next day. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product for those who are prone to having very dry skin. nan
