This was a little overwhelming when I opened it.  I wasn’t sure what to do exactly but the instructions were very clear. I like that there is a window on the side of the bottle so you can see that it is mixing correctly. It was fun and interesting to get to mix my own product! The product is thin and doesn’t have a strong smell. It absorbed quickly and spread nicely.  I’ve been using it every night for 2 weeks with no issues of redness or drying.  I do see a slight difference in my fine lines around my eyes but I couldn’t get it to photograph right. I do think my skin looks brighter when I wake up and less tired. I will continue using it and may buy more. Fun to mix yourself!
