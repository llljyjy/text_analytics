I really enjoyed using this toner as it didn’t leave a sticky residue unlike many other toners I’ve used, and it’s really light. I’ve been using it for around 2 months now, and my redness and acne has decreased slowly but steadily. I use this along with the COSRX good morning low Ph cleanser, Paula’s choice exfoliator, and neutrogena moisturizer for extra dry skin. Overall, I’d say to get this product because it lasts a loooong time and is really gentle, perfect for acne prone and sensitive skin. Love it!
