In conjunction with my full skincare lineup (Paulas choice BHA, Glow recipe Niacinamide, cream based cleanser, and HLA) this is just the icing on the cake at bed time! I need a very little amount to cover my neck and face.  When I wake up to do my morning routine I can still feel the moisturizing layer on my skin and Iâ€™m NOT a light sleeper lol. Refill for me & 1 for 3 family members
