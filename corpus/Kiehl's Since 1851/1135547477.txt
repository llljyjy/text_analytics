This product does exactly what it says it will do!  I’m getting laser hair removal on my chin and upper lip, and had to start shaving to prepare.  My face was so irritated because of it, regular moisturizers just irritated it even more.  I decided to try this, and wow!  I also used it after my first treatment and it helped soothe the skin then too.  And the best part, it doesn’t make me break out! A product that actually delivers results!
