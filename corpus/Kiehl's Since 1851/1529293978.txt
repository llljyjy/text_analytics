The midnight recovery omega-rich cloud cream (which I received complimentary from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review) truly exceeded my expectations - I  am honestly blown away by how effective of a moisturizer it is! I have very dry skin - even in the summer months - so it’s always a challenge to find a cream that is moisturizing enough for me while still not causing any unwanted greasiness or breakouts. This cream is amazing at adding a heavy dose of moisture without feeling heavy at all. It’s whipped, ‘cloud like’ texture really allows it to sink into the skin quickly. It feels so luxurious to apply, and I can already tell a difference in how my skin looks and feels - my skin is plumper, softer and just healthier looking overall. Love! Fabulous moisturizer for dry, mature skin
