I really like this facial lotion. I’ve tried them all and it’s hard to find one that actually moistures my face. It’s not perfect but for the most part it does what I’m looking for. It’s thick but not too thick and has a subtle good smell to it. It hasn’t made me break out so I’m happy and will consider buying when this is finished. nan
