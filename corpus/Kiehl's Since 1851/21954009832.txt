I really like this eye cream , The consistancy is thick but gel-like and I like that because I feel like most eye creams are too thin but this eye cream isn’t and it does live up to it’s promises! I saw immediate results after only the first time using this cream. I noticed that my eyes were instantly depuffed, and my fine lines melted away. I’ve been using this for about a month now, and I’m afraid to run out of it. I see less signs of aging, my undereye skin is more firm, and less elastic. This is my new favorite eye cream, and I will continue to use it! Amazing Eye Cream!
