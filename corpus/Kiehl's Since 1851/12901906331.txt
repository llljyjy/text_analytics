I had previously gotten a sample of this product and shared it with my mom both of us loved it, but it was out of are price range however when it went on sale I bought both of us a jar. I feel like Iâ€™m using a different product I have to use so much just to get some moisture into my skin and even then it does not hold up longer than and hour until I feel dry again. Would not recommend there are better creams for better value. better creams for better value
