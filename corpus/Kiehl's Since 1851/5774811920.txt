Personally I didn’t notice any results really and it was honestly very worrisome that it had warnings not to get the serum in your eyes. You have to apply this directly below the eye which meant it was inevitable that I was going to get it in my eye, which didn’t feel the greatest. This serum could definitely use some work. nan
