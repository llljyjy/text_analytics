I have a hard time with eye creams. My under eyes get so dry and patchy that my make-up settles and I look 20 years older. I have tried so many! The fact that we wear masks make it more obvious. I keep returning to this one. This cream works. It is thick, creamy and makes my under eyes look plump and hydrated. It also works all day, even now with the winter dryness. Love this. Only flaw is that I have dark circles and it really does nothing for that (but concealer sits nice over it so not a deal breaker). Great for dry under eyes!
