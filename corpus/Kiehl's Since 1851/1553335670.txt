This is my very first time using a retinol product. I don’t have sensitive skin and assumed this was okay to use everyday as described. I didn’t experience any side effects for first 2 weeks and felt that skin did get smoother, but then I started experiencing burning sensation around my eyes and cheeks, and experienced redness, dryness (skin was feeling tight) and slight peeling (it was not pleasant and scared me off a bit) That lasted for about 1.5 weeks. I do notice my skin does feel smoother, but it makes me a bit nervous to start going back to it. I would recommend first time users to start once a week and do a patch test before starting. I still think it’s a good product but would recommend to start slow if you are a first time retinol user like me. nan
