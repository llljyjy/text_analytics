As I age I get dark spots more often, regardless of the fact I apply sunscreen several times a day. I was skeptical about this product. I tried before with different ones and without seeing significantchanges.VISIBLE RESULTSI started noticing improvements on my skin by day 16 by applying religiously dayandnight on the same spots. Just a few drops. Do not expect to see results if you do not apply it every day. And do not expect magic one day to the other, this product has its process. Consistency is the key here. My skin looked clean and more transparent effect. Especially under eyesand in zones I had pimples and I touch them.PIMPLES ERASERI’m the type of person that doesn’t wait till pimples heaths by itself. I touch my face a lot, causing it damageand leaving a dark mark. If I do it in summer, thedark spot turns more hyperpigmented and, well, takes a lot of months (and laser) to be removed. My skin tends to be gettingdarker easily.Every time I touch my face and apply this product, I notice results after day 6.CONCLUSIONYes, it’s pricey. But YES, it works. Less expensive and less painful than paying for a laser session.This product fades my dark spots and keeps my skin tone even. it has not afragrance which I really love! Visible Results
