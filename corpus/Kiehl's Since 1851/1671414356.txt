Fantastic results! I use a lot of Retinol in my daily skin care regimen as directed by my dermatologist. But when recommended she also mentioned don’t expect overnight results. Unlike with other products, in about 6 days i did see results with Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum. I can see my fine lines and deep-down wrinkles get less noticeable. This product caused no redness and really did show a reduction in my wrinkles, not perfect, but comparably to other products much better results. I would recommend this product to friends. I have loved the Kiehl’s brand for ages and considering the results the price point is fare. Extra points for it being nighttime, as it doesn’t hinder my morning routine, definitely going to purchase in the future! Actually, seeing result
