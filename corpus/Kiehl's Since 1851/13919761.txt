Very nice lightweight, smooth textured serum. Absorbs quickly into the skin. I don’t notice any scent or fragrance. I have not experienced any irritation or dryness, but my skin is not particularly sensitive to retinol. While I do enjoy this product and will continue to use it, I cannot say I have seen any results. Keep in mind, I do not use it everyday as I use other actives in my routine. I also have only been using it a few weeks. But I do think it’s a good serum. nan
