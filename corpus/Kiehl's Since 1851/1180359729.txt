It’s blue and fluffy just like a cloud. The consistency is like whipped but once applied onto the face in circular motions it’s lightweight and melts right into your skin. I love that I can exfoliate and apply this cream before bedtime and when I wake up my face feels hydrated and plumped. I love Keihl’s and their products never disappoint. Whipped & Fluffy
