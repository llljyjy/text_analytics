I think this was a pretty good quality serum. I don’t have dark circles, my issue is wrinkles and puffiness. I think it did a good job smoothing the texture under my eyes. The only thing I didn’t care for is when applying it, it doesn’t exactly absorb. It has a dry thickness to it if that makes any sense. It doesn’t feel wet. It’s velvety but takes a while to absorb. Better to use at night for this reason. Seems effective
