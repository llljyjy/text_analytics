After using Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum for a couple weeks now, I’ve noticed that my skin is looking more rejuvenated. The fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead appear softer; they don’t stand out as much as they did previously. I’ve tried similar products from other brands that didn’t seem to do much for my forehead lines. I believe that with continued use this product will help to diminish the look of the lines around my eyes and forehead. This is a very revolutionary formula that allows you to mix in the retinol when you’re ready to use the product so that it stays fresh. I love the ease of use and how well my skin reacts to the product given the fact that it has .3% retinol in the product mix in. I love seeing this Kiehl’s product on my vanity and using it nightly before bed. It has become my new ritual since owning this product. Softens Forehead Lines
