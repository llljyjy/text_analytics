I thought this would work on my dry skin (which gets worse in Winter) and it has not.  I was surprised when it was more of a hard brick rather than a cream.  It doesn’t feel greasy when you put it on and the no-scent or smell is not nice (not horrible and I don’t mind what smell if the product works).  It did nothing to make my face worse, but it did nothing at all; my skin was not smoother, it didn’t feel hydrated, and there was no noticible difference in appearance.I’m giving it a two, because maybe it would work for younger not dry skin that lives in a warmer climate.  As well it is a good size package. Hard Pass for Dry Skin
