After using this for a few weeks, I have really noticed a difference in the dryness of my skin. Living in El Paso, TX where it is a pretty desert landscape, I tend to have pretty dry skin. This has all but eliminated that. It does have a weird, almost minty smell even though it says fragrance free but I just put it on a bit earlier than bed time so the smell doesn’t bother me as I’m trying to sleep. If you have dry skin or even dry areas on your face, I would recommend this for you to try. nan
