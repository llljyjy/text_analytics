Feels nice, texture is not thick not light, itâ€™s good for dry skin and even though it is fragrance free, my sensitive skin did not like it. Stings everytime I use it, wish I read the ingredients before buying even if it us fragrance free there is till tons of other irritants in here for people of sensitive skin. Sadly not for sensitive skin!
