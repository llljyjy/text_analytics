This cream is not oily or greasy and felt very moisturizing when I put it on.  It is thick and creamy and a fun light blue color which is perfect for a “ cloud cream.“  It’s a bit on the heavy side but I love it and appreciate the omega- rich botanicals and luxurious texture. Love the way it feels on my skin
