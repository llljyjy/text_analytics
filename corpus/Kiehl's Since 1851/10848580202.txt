I’m in love with this new dark spot corrector. My skin tone is medium and I have many dark spots on my face from sun damage. I’m glad I was able to test this product because I looked in the market for so many years to find something like this that can help disappear my sun damage, but wasn’t able to find anything until I found Kiehl’s spot corrective solution. I love how the serum is light and gets absorbed in the skin nicely. I do see that my dark spots are getting lighter. But it requires time to see change. The perfect brightening serum
