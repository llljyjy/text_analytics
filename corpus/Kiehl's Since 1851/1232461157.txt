This cream is a great nighttime moisturizer. It has a whipped texture that is easily spreadable and a calming lavender scent that is perfect for bedtime. I woke up with soft hydrated skin. I avoided using this in the daytime, however, because my face ended up glowing with oil throughout the day. Otherwise the cream is a good addition to a bedtime routine. nan
