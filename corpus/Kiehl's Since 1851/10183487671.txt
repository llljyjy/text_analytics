Kiehls is a brand that I love, its quality is everything and this MIDNIGHT RECOVERY OMEGA-RICH CLOUD CREAM is no exception, it is a cream with a unique texture, I love it especially for this summer season that I want to hydrate my skin deeply but at the same time I don’t want to put anything greasy its texture is unique the skin absorbs it immediately and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling.I love it and the next day my face wakes up very hydrated it’s something different. Highly recommended! Beautiful Texture!
