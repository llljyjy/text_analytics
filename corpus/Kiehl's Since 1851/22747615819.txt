This is my go to product. It’s multi use and multi area. I’ve been using this daily, at night for three weeks. It’s perfect for under eye, eyelid, corner for crows feet and I even put it on the bridge of my nose where I’ve noticed a line developing over the past couple years. It improves the lines and is a color corrector. This is a product that actually works. Doesn’t take long to notice subtle improvements in entire eye area!! My go to product.
