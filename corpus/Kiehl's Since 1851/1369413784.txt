Very disappointed to see this product contains alcohol denat among its first ingredients. Alcohol denat is drying and should only be used once every week or two according to articles I’ve read. It’s one of the reason I’ve been weaning off of Kiehl’s. I wish they’d consider reformulating their products without alcohol products. Disappointed in the Ingtedients
