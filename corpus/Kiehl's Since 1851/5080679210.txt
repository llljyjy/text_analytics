I have finally found the holy grail face cream! I absolutely loved the the Kiehl’s face cream and have seen significant changes to my skin. This was my first time trying this brand. I have dry skin and this works great on my skin. I have been using this for more than 3 weeks. It’s lightweight and does not make my skin feel oily at all. I feel my skin complexion has gotten more clear and it has helped with dark spots. Ot leaves my skin feeling super hydrated for hours. I will definitely be purchasing this as soon as I run out of this. Needless to say this is my new favorite. Perfect for dry skin!
