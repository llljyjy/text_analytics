I’m 44 yrs old and I have crows feet and dark circles under my eyes. I feel like this product helped with crows feet but not so much for the dark circles under my eyes. I didn’t really notice a difference around my lids or brow bone either. It product feels nice and absorbs well but I don’t know that I would purchase it myself. nan
