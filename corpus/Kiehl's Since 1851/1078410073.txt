I am head over heals for this silky cream. The first thing that stood out to me was the ingredients list - this is a clean beauty cream full of nourishing items like Squalene, Shea butter, coriander seed oil, and jojoba oil. I live in a dry environment and am also at an age where I am beginning to experience fine lines and wrinkles, so I can really benefit from a lot of hydration and plumping. The texture of the cream is decadent and silky and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling overly greasy. In the morning, my skin looks healthy and happy. I would absolutely recommend this cream to anyone needing a moisturizing night cream. This is going to be a staple for me, and I know that I will buy it again. nan
