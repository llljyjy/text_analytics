I received this product as a part of a promotion.I’m a 50+ mature woman who has some wrinkles around my eye and brow area.  This product provide a great all around eye treatment, undereye, crowsfoot area and brow.  I love the texture, it absorbs rapidly and does not leave any after effect. peeling, excess product etc.  I have been only using for a few weeks and don’t notice any dramatic results but I feel like no additional new wrinkles are appearing.  Happy to use this product and you will too! EYE ZONE TREATMENT
