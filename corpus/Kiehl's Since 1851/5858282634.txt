Wow. This is a very different product, but it works. It is a bit difficult to figure out at first, mostly because you don’t want to mess it up because it isn’t cheap. However after you figure it out and start applying it you notice a difference after about the second week. Now it isn’t like a surgery, but you see a difference. Also it didn’t irrate my face like other retnoids. Can’t wait to continue to use it Kiehl's retinol
