I love Kiehl’s products, and this night cream doesn’t disappoint. This cream has a thick texture. I like it because it feels like using a sleeping mask. It is super hydrating. My skin looks plumped the next day morning. I have been using this for a few nights in a row now, it makes my skin so soft and smooth. If you want to make it thinner, easier to absorb, I would suggest to use a hydrating essence first and apply it while your face is still wet. Very hydrating
