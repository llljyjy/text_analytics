I used this product briefly, because it arrived in the peak of our brief summer season. Because it has retinol, one needs to stay out of the sun during use which can cause skin sensitivity. I didn’t have any issues while I was using it, but I didn’t want to create any. I would recommend use of this product during fall/winter when someone isn’t spending lots of time in intense sunshine for best results. It requires a LOT of shaking to activate and fully blend the retinol powder into the serum/cream. I’m not sure WHY users need to do this other than there must be a shelf life once it’s mixed and activated, if so, then that should be noted for users that there is a best use by date once mixed. Otherwise, it’s rather inconvenient to dump powder and invert caps and shake the thing until you want to use it...who has time for that? That’s why I gave it 4 stars--all this extra preparation for a product with no explanation as far as how it affects the efficacy or if there’s an expiration date once activated.That said, it absorbs quickly into the skin for a great texture, and I don’t feel the need to add any additional moisturizer at night. I felt my skin smooth and tighten around my mouth and forehead. I do like the results with this product, and I’ll use it when I’m not spending so much time outside in my garden and sunshine. Lots of extra steps prior to use
