This cream was such a pleasant surprise! It’s a nice basic everyday moisturizer that seems like it would work on every skin type. The texture is smooth and not too thick, deeply moisturizing yet not heavy. It doesn’t have much of a scent. It feels very refreshing. When I saw an esthetician after two weeks of using it every night, she said my skin looked much healthier in general than before. nan
