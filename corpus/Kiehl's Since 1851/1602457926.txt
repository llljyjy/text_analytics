Since retinol can sometimes take months to produce results, I’m not sure I can give an accurate review yet. I will say that even after shaking this for around 5 minutes, the products still didn’t seem to be completely dissolved. When I apply this is still feels somewhat gritty. Not sure if this is really worth the $80 price tag, I think for that price it should have a better ingredient list. meh
