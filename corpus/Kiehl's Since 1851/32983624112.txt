I struggle to find face creams that don’t break me out. Anything with fatty alcohols gives me breakouts and it’s so hard to find the right combination of ingredients. This is the only cream I can use now because I know for sure it works well for my skin. It’s also very moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling. Works great for my sensitive acne prone skin
