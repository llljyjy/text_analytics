I really love Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream. It is very hydrating and the perfect consistency. It soaks right into the skin and leaves your skin well hydrated for a long time. My skin has never looked better. Love how it’s fragrant free. It’s been a really dry winter and this moisturizer has saved my skin. I can’t say enough good things about this product. I highly recommend and will be purchasing in the future. Love! Recommend
