I was so intrigued by this serum and love the unique fresh activation of the packaging, knowing you will receive the freshest mix of retinol in your serum. I had to try it and I have been absolutely impressed and have seen visible results after a few weeks of use, my pores are smaller and there is just a smoother appearance to my skin as well as improved texture, a much softer feel. I have had no reactions (I am also not a first time retinol user, but have never used prescription strength or anything) no redness or sensitivity. I will definitely continue to use this Kiehls serum in my skincare routine as I am so pleased with the results. I have also noticed my foundation applies and looks much better on my face, I feel like it blends into my skin much better. I would recommend this product for those who are ready to add a retinol serum to your routine! Innovative and Effective!
