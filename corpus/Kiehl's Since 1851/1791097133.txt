I love kiehl’s products but i mostly use antiaging serums and creams by them. This cream is different from my usuals, but very much needed especially in the winter. I have been using it on face and body, especially when exposed to colder temperatures and it did wonders. I don’t feel dry and parched anymore, but nourished and protected. The only downside is that is very thick, hence very nurturing and hydrating, but I normally don’t like something so rich, so I personally have to use sparingly and only during the winter and dry months. Other than that, fantastic cream to have handy! luxurious cream for the winter months
