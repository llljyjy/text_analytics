I’ve had undereye circles my whole like, so I’m always excited to try a new product. After using this product 2-3x per week for the past 2 months I do notice a subtle difference in undereye circles and fine lines. It’s a nice lightweight serum that didn’t irritate my skin or eyes, which tend to be sensitive. I received this product for free in exchange for reviewing it, and I don’t know if the impact was significant enough that I’d buy it again, but will continue to use it and see if the benefits continue! nan
