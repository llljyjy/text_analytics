I am a fan of Kiehl’s to begin with, and this night cream is no exception!  I received the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream from @bzzagent and @kiehls in exchange for my review.  I used this night cream for two weeks and can already see an improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead.  This whipped cream has a calming lavender scent and sinks right into my skin without being greasy or heavy.  I LOVE it!  This night cream is soothing and works overnight to hydrate and moisturizer your skin.  I would recommend this product! nan
