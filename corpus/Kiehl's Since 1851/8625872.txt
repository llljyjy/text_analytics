wow i am super impressed, better then the dermatologist who by the way said it would be $350 for him to remove the brown spot i had on my cheek. said it was purely cosmetic. sooo i ended up trying Kiehls fast release and omg i never expected it to work like it did. Not only is the brown spot so less noticeable but my skin is so soft and the wrinkles by my eyes have greatly faded. i cant believe how nicely this product worked. and to think i was going to go through with the dermatologist Kiehls to the rescue. amazingly suprised
