First of all, I loved the packaging, and mixing the fresh retinol powder with the serum base was unique. The serum itself is lovely. A little goes a long way! The bottom pump lets you easily control how much is dispensed. Just a few drops are enough for my whole face with a little residual for the backs of my hands. And it absorbs in so nicely, leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft, not sticky. I will definitely be buying again. Love this serum
