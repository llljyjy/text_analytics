I have been using kiehls from almost 8 years. I keep on changing some products or add some other brands as per skin requirements. Presently I’m pregnant my skin has become extremely dry and i wanted something extra for night. Keep in mind this is extremely thick it doesn’t get absorbed easily, you have to work it out. The trick that I use is, I use some drops of any face on top of it. It smooth the cream like a butter and helps in equal distribution and absorption. My skin looks extra healthy and glowy when I wake up. extra thick cream
