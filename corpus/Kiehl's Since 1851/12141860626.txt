I feel like I have not used this product long enough to give a firm decision on it yet.  In the meantime, I can give my opinion of the product so far.  It has been about six weeks since I began using it.  I started off using it once a week, then twice a week, then three times a week, then four times weekly, then five times weekly, until I am on the week that I use it six times.  I still have not used it every day a week yet, which I will continue.When I first started using this product, it flaked bits of dry skin.  This happened after applying it about three times.  It was a little annoying because I didn’t want people to notice it and wonder why my skin was doing this.  I would remove little pieces and splash some water on the spots.I love the fact that my skin feels very moisturized.  This is only a serum but it definitely makes it have moisture.  I don’t need to use any lotion with it.I am not sure yet if it has reduced my forehead wrinkles.  Since it gives it moisture, it appears to be less visible I suppose.  It needs more time for me to observe it, but I will continue to use it until I finish the product fully.  I am hoping that my indented scar above my eyebrow is less visible after use. nan
