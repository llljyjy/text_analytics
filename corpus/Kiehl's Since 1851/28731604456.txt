The first thing I noticed about KIEHL’S Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream is the plain white box it comes in, when product isn’t in a flashy packaging, you know its the real deal. Next I see the words “KIEHL’S Since 1851“ on it and I was excited to try product with a rich history behind it. The cream itself is a very thick cream, made with Colloidal Oatmeal and Beta-Glucan, which I don’t know exactly what that is but it makes for one great barrier cream! No scent, it spread ok, make take a bit of work with how thick it is but it is so worth it, especially during the winter. Speaking of, I will never be without this for my snowboarding trips for sure! I love this stuff and use it daily. I got to try this product for free. Perfect for dry skin
