I received this product as a free trial.  I used it for two weeks and was pleasantly surprised to actually see results.  I’ve used Kiehl’s products in the past, so I had high expectations to begin with.  I was worried that the products would have a thick consistency, which I something that I don’t like to use on my under eye area.   But it wasn’t.  The product was not perfumed, some other products have a scent that irritates my eyes.  I only had to use a small bit on my eyes, which makes this product an excellent value.   As the weather gets brighter with summer months, I find myself needing under eye cream at night from squinting and wearing sunglasses.  This product was really surprisingly successful for treatment for my delicate eye area. Another Kiehl's success!
