It’s definitely lightweight but by the afternoon I had to reapply. Then mid afternoon again. This doesn’t work for me during the winter months but the fact that I had absolutely no reactions to any of the ingredients and it didn’t make my skin angry will make this great for the warmer days that are coming! It would be great for someone with oily skin or sensitive skin that’s for sure. I have pretty dry skin (in the winter, anyway) so this didn’t work great for winter but I think it will be PERFECT for summer and spring! I don’t think I would pay $33 for this, though. not so great for winter will be great for summer!
