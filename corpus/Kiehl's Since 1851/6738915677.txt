I’ve been using this anti-aging retinol serum for a month and I’m thrilled with the results. I’ve seen a big difference in the fine lines and overall appearance of my skin in general. Peptides, Ceramides and Retinol all in one amazing product! I also liked mixing the the product myself, in doing so I feel like solution was stronger because it was freshly made. It’s also super lightweight and fragrance free. Retinol Fast-Release Night Serum
