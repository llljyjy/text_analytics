I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review from bzzagent. I love how cooling feels on my skin and the cream/ gel texture of the product soaks in my skin beautifully. I don’t feel extra residue or pilling in the formula. it’s a great for hydration and fine lines around the eye area. I love to use it as a part of my night time routine. wonderful eye cream!
