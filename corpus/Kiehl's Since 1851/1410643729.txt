I love a lot of things about this product: packaging - great, easy to use pump! Consistency - fantastic, nice and creamy without being too thick or to thin. And after about 2 months of using this, I am noticing brighter under-eyes and fewer fine lines. I even used some on the back of my hands and felt like it brightened them up a bit! The only reason I don’t give this 5 stars is because it’s costly and I wonder if another product will be able to give you similar results for less. Very nice product
