I’ve been using this product for almost a week. It seems to be helping in hydrating my dry skin. It’s great to use morning and night. No oily feeling or strong smell. It’s not a heavy moisturizer but it is still hydrating. I would purchase this and have already recommended it. Hydrating lightweight moisturizer
