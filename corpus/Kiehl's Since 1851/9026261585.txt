great moisturizer with very little fragrance. I had no reaction to this face mask, which I sometimes do if a product is too thick or too heavily scented. I thought it might be a bit greasy but it really isn’t and it’s not heavy at all. Everything seemed to soak in by the morning as I used it over-night instead of wiping it off and the little dry patches on my forehead went away. nan
