I was graciously gifted this by Kiehl’s! I don’t think I’ve ever tried a Kiehl’s product I didn’t like, this was no exception! I love that this one is a rich cream, and I use retinol,  so I need something to help the dry patches. This worked flawlessly!  I use it twice a week. I will be repurchasing! The jar is a very good size so it will last for a long time. perfect for retinol users!
