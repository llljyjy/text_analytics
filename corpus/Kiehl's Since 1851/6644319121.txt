I loved that this product did not feel thick, heavy or greasy. This was just the right amount of creamy hydration and it can be used alone or on top of another moisturizer. I thought this left my skin with a nice glow (not shiny) and I went without foundation. My other makeup applied nicely on top of this and my complexion approved of a day off of coverage. I like that this versatile treatment is good for am and pm. I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. A Hydrating Facial Primer
