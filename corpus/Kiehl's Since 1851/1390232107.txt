I discovered this product during my second winter in the Boston area. It really is a miracle product for me. I recommend giving it some time to soak in before going to bed. I typically wash my face after getting my son down for bed. I put this on after and then my moisturizer on top. By the time I go to bed it has soaked in. Start slow and add more. A little goes a long way with this one. Feels great on your neck and d√©colletage area as well. I wake up with soft, plump skin. After about a week of using it nightly I started receiving compliments on my skin. Overnight miracle
