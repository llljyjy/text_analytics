This lightweight moisturizing eye cream is an easy add-in to my daily routine. You only need a small amount to feel the moisture for my under eyes. Has a mild fragrance that is not overpowering and no sticky residue is left on the face. Can easily be applied before make up and at night. I can tell my eyes look brighter and more refreshed from using this product. Moisturizing!
