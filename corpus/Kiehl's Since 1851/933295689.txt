I really love this eye cream! It is so creamy and starts off with a thick smooth consistency, but thins out as you apply it and absorbs in after a few minutes. I am in my 40s and have some fine lines around my eyes. I have been using morning and night and have noticed my eye area looks and feels more hydrated. I haven’t seen it diminish any lines really, but the area does look slightly plumper and smoother in photos and as I look in the morning for results. It does not have any added shimmer, like some eye creams for cosmetic brightening. Overall, a nice product that’s a pleasure to use and a great value for the price and amount you receive. It does not come in a box, just FYI. One caveat, when I opened the seal on this, a glob of product squirted out, it must have been upside down in transit. I was able to scoop it all back in without much trouble, so not a big deal. But, I would just tap the product on the table a few times before opening the seal to avoid this in the future. So hydrating and plumping!
