I have sensitive skin but I do love Kiehls typically and always trying their products. (Best hand cream ever!) This seems thick when you open the jar but it goes on lightweight. It really does provide excellent moisture that isn’t greasy and you wake up actually feeling like you have hydrated skin. Living in the desert, taking care of your skin isn’t an option- it’s a necessity! I would definitely purchase and recommend. Also, it’s basically fragrance free so that’s another bonus. Rich but not heavy
