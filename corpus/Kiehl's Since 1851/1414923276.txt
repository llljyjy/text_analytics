I have dry and sensitive skin and I’m a huge fan of the ultra facial cream since it works so well on me. This mask has the same effect. I love that it’s a multi purpose mask. It’s a balm that melts as you warm it up. It handles flakiness really well. Super cool that you can use it also as an intense moisturizer or a cold cream. nan
