Was looking for a new face cream for a while & this one does not disappoint! Goes on nice and light while quickly absorbing & does not feel heavy. Very moisturizing and so far lasting a good while. I have sensitive/combo skin and so far no issues using this as a last step in my routine. I recommend! nan
