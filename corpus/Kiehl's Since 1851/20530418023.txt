I have never tried a moisturizer that made my skin scaly and begin to peel, but alas this stuff did. To be clear, it began 3-4 days after I began using it and it was very minimal peeling, but it’s a moisturizer so I’d expect the exact opposite from this product. I also did not change anything else in my skincare routine  so I attribute the change to this product. I’ve stopped using, and have since seen my skin stop peeling. didn’t work for me!
