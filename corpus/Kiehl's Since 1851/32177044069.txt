Horrible product. The product was orange when itâ€™s advertised as white, leading me to think it was expired. Made eye area skin peel and burn. The more I used it, the less it peeled. Did absolutely nothing at all for dark circles. Not even a little bit. Eyes would water badly on days I used this product. Burned the eyes after rubbing them from being watery. Waste of $. Horrible
