I use tret about 3x a week religiously but had some stubborn summer freckles (potentially age spots as I’m now approaching 32). I used this twice this week and the dark spots literally have disappeared! I am SHOCKED especially given that I’ve had this bottle sitting around for 2-3 years and can’t remember being particularly impressed by it the first time around. Safe to say I will absolutely bring reincorporating it into my routine so that I stay fresh faced forever. Faded my dark spots better than tretinoin
