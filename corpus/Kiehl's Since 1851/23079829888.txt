I received this product for free from BzzAgent to try and give my honest opinion about. My face is extremely dry in the winter and it didn’t help that I work 3rd shift at a factory and go in and out of the weather. This product was a life saver for my face. This product is very thick, not runny like other lotions. I did not need a lot for my face, a little went a long way. It was easy to rub into my face, and didn’t leave it oily feeling. This product made my face so much more moisturized, no more flakey dry skin. It didn’t have a strong fragrance. It lasted from my shower in the morning until I took a shower before heading to work. I will definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family. NEW WINTER MUST HAVE
