This luscious whipped cream is an absolute delight to put on at night after I cleanse my face. It makes my skin feel soft, nourished, and supple. The botanicals used offer a light scent unlike heavy moisturizers of days gone by.  In the morning, my skin appears more plump and hydrated. Visible results after one week of use. Light Botanical Scent, Hydrating, Not Vegan
