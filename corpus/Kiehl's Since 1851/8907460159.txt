I’m enjoying this so far, my skin is super sensitive and it hasn’t broke me out. This cloud cream has a lightweight feel when applied and sinks right into the skin. My skin is oily/combo and it hasn’t made me greasy. The smell is amazing and fits in with the other products from this line. I apply it at night and when I wake up my skin looks and feels amazing. My skin was so soft and supple looking without putting any product on in the morning. I haven’t been using long enough to get any long time benefits but so far so good. My skin looked and felt amazing in the morning !!
