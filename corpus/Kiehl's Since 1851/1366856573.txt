I love this toner. Until recently I never thought that toner added anything to my beauty routine. I got a bottle of this toner as part of a starter kit and now I’m hooked. I was using the Dr. Gross pads before this but prefer this toner sooo much more. It removes any remaining dirt on may face without stripping or drying out my skin. I’m always surprised that the cotton pad still seems to show some dirt even after a double cleanse. My skin is bright, glowing and moisturized after every use. Absolutely hooked!!
