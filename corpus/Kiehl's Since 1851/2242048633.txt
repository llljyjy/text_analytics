This is a moisturizer I always have on hand but don’t use every day. It’s great for days my skin is feeling a little irritated or needs some extra tlc, because it is insanely hydrating but so gentle. It soaks in quick and doesn’t leave a residue, has no scent, and feels luxurious. Definitely worth the buy! nan
