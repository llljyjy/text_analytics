I’ve been using Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream this last week during some of the coldest weather my area has ever experienced. After several days of -30 temps my skin was dry and chapped. Not anymore!! This product is amazing at helping to reverse some of that damage. My skin feels so much better after just a few days of using. Pro tip.. I use this on my cuticles too!! This is a winter essential! Winter essential
