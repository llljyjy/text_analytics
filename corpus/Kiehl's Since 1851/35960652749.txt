I received this product complementary from bzzagent for my honest review. When I received this product, I was very impressed to know that the packaging is made from post-consumer materials using renewable energy sources, making it environment friendly in true sense. And now about the product itself, this cream is thick omega rich moisturizer which absorbs in your skin perfectly and gives you instant hydration that lasts not just whole night but makes your skin feel so good and soft even in the morning. It’s a heavy duty formula that absorbs nicely and doesn’t let your skin oily or greasy, which personally I’ve not felt that in many moisturizers that I’ve previously used. The cream has a light and pleasant fragrance which  dissipates quickly. It’s a great night cream which I would definitely recommend to family and friends and buy next time too. Long lasting hydration
