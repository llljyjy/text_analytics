My absolute “holy grail” skincare item. I’ve used this for about six years at this point and absolutely notice a difference during times when I run out or forget to use as night.The smell is super calming, no “fake” lavender smells. It absorbs so nicely during application and I use the remainder on my neck and décolleté.It leaves your skin super glowy and hydrated in the morning. Almost like you have a beauty filter on when waking up. It is a bit pricey but it totally works wonders. I’d recommend grabbing it during the holidays when it’s in a set or on sale.
