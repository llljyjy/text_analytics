I don’t know what it is about this product, but it’s the only eye cream I’ve ever used that actually moisturizes my dry under eyes and lids, keeps them that way, and doesn’t pill up or get weird under makeup.  I’ve gone through countless tubs of this and will occasionally try a new eye cream in between.  If I run out and go a week or two before repurchasing, my eyes begin to look older and crepey.  Nothing compares. Surprisingly, the best eye cream I've ever found.
