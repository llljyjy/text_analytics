I liked the feel of this serum. It dried very quickly and it didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling tacky or sticky. I did not see the results I had hoped for. I noticed a slight change in the look of a few of my lighter spots. It did not have much affect on my very dark dark spots. I would recommend this product to anyone that has very light spots or damage but not so much for those with very severe spots. nan
