No! Doesn’t work! Asked one of the employees at Sephora if there was anything for dark spots.  (I would’ve paid anything in that place).  She went straight to this product as if this serum was the best thing in the store.  I used it over 3 months religiously following the directions of course.  Thinking I know it would take time, since not anything can work overnight for this problem.  I just stopped using when getting close to 4 months it because in fact I believe it got worse.  Went to another place I bought something else and at a fraction of the cost and I started to see results within a few weeks. Nope
