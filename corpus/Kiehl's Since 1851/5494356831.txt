I have normal skin, not too dry not too oily. I have forehead wrinkles and little crowâ€™s feet forming. I started this almost 2 months ago and use it every night (not missed a night) It has not irritated my skin or left redness, But what it has done is reduce my lines significantly since using. I believe if you stay with a product and use it the way its supposed to be used it will work. Amazing, reduced forehead wrinkles
