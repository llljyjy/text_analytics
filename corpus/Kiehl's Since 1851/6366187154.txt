I really love how my skin feels using this moisturizer by Kiehl’s. During winter I tend to get fryer than normal skin. I’ve been applying this in morning and nighttime routine and my skin feels so much better. It’s softer and smoother throughout the day. Just a small amount really works and blends into my skin. It feels very moisturized and soft. Amazing
