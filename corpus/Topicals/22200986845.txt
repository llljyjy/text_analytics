Smells like eggs on steroids. Made me break out at first. But itâ€™s incredible really no other discoloration fighting product compares. My dark spots faded within a few weeks with consistent use. Just remember to moisturize in the AM and PM and stay indoors when you do use it the night before because it does make your skin sensitive at first. nan
