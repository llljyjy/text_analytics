I like this. If you can get past the smell and stop thinking it’s raw chicken, you’ll be golden. The ingredients list for this product is incredible. It has all the hyperpigmentation-fighting superstars. I’ve now used this for 6 months and have noticed a solid gradual improvement in my acanthosis nigricans under my arms. My under arm skin is thick and the darkness is BAD. Now for any of you struggling with the same, I want to disclaim that though this helped a bit, it didn’t work miracles. After 3 months of consistent use, I decided to see my derm and got started on hydroquinone (which I’d recommend over this, but if you can’t get a prescription for that, this is a great alternative). I’ve loved using this during the periods where I take a break from hydroquinone. It does a great job and never causes a bit of irritation. If you combine this with Adapalene, you’ll get even better results. If you struggle with something like acanthosis, see a dermatologist. If you can’t get into seeing one, this will give you results, but it doesn’t work miracles overnight if that’s what you are expecting. Be consistent and patient. It works great on post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne spots on the face too! be consistent and patient
