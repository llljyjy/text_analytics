It does not stink anymore, I think it is a new formula. It ir a superb combination of ingredients, I’m combo skin  and have a darks spots, but I love I don’t have to use many products to obtain this formula and I’m starting with retinol too. Go slow and let your skin heal with a good moisturizer, I’m using skinfix and doing the skin cicling. Retinol and faded, not at the same time. Retinol-recovery/ faded-recovery. Excellent formula and the perfect actives.
