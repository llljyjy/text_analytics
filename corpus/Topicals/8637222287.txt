Iâ€™ve been using this for around a week and I already see a difference in multiple areas where I have serious hyperpigmentation. I was hesitant at first because I have super sensitive skin and I am very susceptible to acne/breakouts but I have had zero problems. Also, you get over the smell and it is easy to cover! Going to purchase the big size next! nan
