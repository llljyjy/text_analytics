I haven’t seen results from it yet (I’ve only been using a month so they could be coming!) but I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt and trusting reviews swearing it will work. However. It PILLS. And it smells like nair (think unnaturally “is something burning” type smell). I hope the results make up for a pretty unpleasant user experience pilling and odor
