Lots of negative reviews but not everything it for everyone. I haven’t been able to tolerate retinols or vitamin c products and I’ve tried MANY variations. I got a sample of this from a friend about a month ago, and it has improved my skin so much. I recently heard from a dermatologist about the benefits of the individual ingredients in this, and I just happened to have this on hand. I usually get small blemishes and have acne scars/hyperpigmentation and texture. All of it has improved with this product. It definitely has a funky smell (kinda smells like turkey to me!) but it doesn’t persist. I have combination skin but more on the oily side. It’s even helped with oil control throughout the day (I use it in the morning with a sunscreen). If you need an alternative to retinols/vitamin c give this a try. I use it a few times a week. Love it
