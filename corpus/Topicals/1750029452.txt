As Johnny Beavo would say, “Whoa Mama!” I started using this twice a day, everyday from the first day I got it. Yes, I use sunscreen and my skin is able to handle a lot. It has been 21 days and my skin has gotten so much better. I had two patches of texture that WOULD NOT go away on my cheeks and today I can say its 80% gone. The smell is not as bad as some say it is. The results from this outweigh the smell. It doesn’t even last that long. A minute, maybe. Smells like nair. But wow. I am so happy with my skin and that hasn’t been said in over 2 years since I stopped BC. Also bought like butter and I love that too but Faded needed a review. If you are on the fence, get the smaller tube. That’s what I did and I still have a decent amount left after using it twice a day. But get a tube key. “Whoa Mama”
