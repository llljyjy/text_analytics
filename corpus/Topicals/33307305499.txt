I never write reviews but I really wanted to after I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about the smell. After reading all those reviews, I was expecting A LOT worse, the smells not even that bad, and it doesn’t even linger. I’ve used it once so I can’t say if it works or not, but if you’re not willing to try it because of the smell, it’s really not that bad. Faded Topicals Serum
