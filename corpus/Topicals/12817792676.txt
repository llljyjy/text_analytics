I’ve been using this for a while but I’m not sure how effective it’s been. I really started noticing a difference when I started using the Peace Out Dark Spots serum, so I don’t know if the two in tandem work together, or if that serum is doing the heavy lifting. At any rate, I think this is a great product that works well for a lot of people, I just don’t think it’s for me due to the greasiness of it. I do t have dry skin, but if you have dry skin I think you will like this. I won’t repurchase. Good product but somewhat greasy
