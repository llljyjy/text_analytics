Ok so I followed the instructions and introduced this product little by little. I started with once a week and then twice a week and finally up to every other day. This seems to have been effective because it’s been a month and I can definitely see results. Give.It.Time. The smell isn’t even that bad and goes away as soon as the product dries, you’ll be fine. I can’t wait to keep using and seeing results, I’d definitely say it’s worth a try! Be patient
