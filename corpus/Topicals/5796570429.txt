So this smells actually horrible. I usually never care about the smell of skincare and Iâ€™m not particularly sensitive to smells but I actually have to make a point to hold my breath while applying this and my partner hates it because I come to bed all stinky. However, despite the smell this actually works and busts out hyperpigmentation over time. I have really bad dark red/ purple spots deep in my skin so nothing works overnight on me but overtime this has seriously lightened some of my darkest spots. This does nothing for active acne or pimples but is great if hyperpigmentation is the problem Okay this actually stinks... but it works!
