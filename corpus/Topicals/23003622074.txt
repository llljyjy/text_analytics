I’ve been hearing about this product all over TikTok and social media being recommended by everyone who can walk and talk. So I decided to give it a try for a specific spot. I do have very sensitive skin, breakout prone however I have not had acne for years. This product started off amazing and clearly spot very quickly but then made my forehead break out like crazy and clog pores which I’ve never had a problem with. Which in the end caused more hard than good giving dark spots I didn’t even have before. It could be a bit of user error and maybe use once a day and or every other day. But I do wish I could still use. As u can seemy skin was much clearer, no acne or dark spots on my forehead or checks. Now I feel horrible and have to start all over Wanted it to be a holy grail so bad
