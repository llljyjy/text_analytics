im on my second full size tube, so i have been using this product for about 5-6 months. it has helped fade dark spots but the most noticeable difference is that it has improved the texture of my skin an insane amount. makeup goes on so smooth now since my acne doesnt protrude. however, i do still have acne. i started incorporating a zinc serum and a peel into my routine to get rid of pimples and stubborn dark spots. improved skin texture more than anything
