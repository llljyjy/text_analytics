The smell is strong I won’t lie. It smells like hair but it truly works! I had mask related acne for months and dark spots secondary to popping the pimple which would not budge. After using this product for 4 weeks the hyperpigmentation is fading. I’m finding I don’t need to use as much concealer which is amazing. My complexion looks clearer and even. I really believe this product works. It works
