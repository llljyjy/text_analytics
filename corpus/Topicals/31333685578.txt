I like the smell. It smells like it’s accomplishing something medicinal. Like it’s working!  I think it does work eventually.  Hyperpigmentation is harder to fade than it is to prevent. Also, I contacted the people at Topicals and they said NOT to use this product in combination with a retinol (maybe alternate days), and to ALWAYS use sunscreen. Try it for yourself
