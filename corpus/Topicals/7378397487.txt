This caused my face to breakout from just one use. It’s the only “new” product I’ve introduced into my routine so I know it is the cause. I waited a week to try it again and I woke up with small breakouts all over my face. I’ll use this under my arms and my Brazilian area because it’s so expensive. If your skin is sensitive, do not buy this!! 0 stars crazy breakouts!
