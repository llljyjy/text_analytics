Yes, I saw this product on TikTok. I have sensitive, oily, and acne-prone skin. I thought since this is clean at Sephora I would not have an issue. The smell was horrid. I would imagine it to be the smell of burnt something. Lastly, it triggered so many abnormal breakouts that it did not seem worth it to continue the use in order to see results on my hyperpigmentation. If you have acne-prone skin, stay away!
