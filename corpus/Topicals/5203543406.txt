FADED revolutionized my skin! When I started using it, I had a lot of acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. As a woman of color, I found that a lot of products targeted to fading weren’t necessarily built with my skin type in mind. Within weeks of using Faded, my spots faded and my textural irregularities were a million times smoother. I gained so much confidence to go out without makeup and embrace my skin’s natural texture. I use it every morning under my moisturizer and I will truly never stop using it. #1 holy grail product. See my before & after pics... the proof is in the pudding! The #1 product I recommend
