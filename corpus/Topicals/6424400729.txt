Honestly obsessed with this product. Had my doubts because I know products like this either tend to take a lot of time to work, or donâ€™t work at all. I was prepared for my skin to purge (and it definitely did, for maybe 3 weeks or so) but now I can use it every day on my hyperpigmentation with no break outs. I have struggling badly with hyperpigmentation for at least a year due to hormonal acne and I swear I can notice a difference after each use even. Also, the smell is nowhere near as people make it out to be (I think they fixed this actually). Buy it
