This serum really does smell bad. The Topicals website warns that it has a ‘sulfur’ smell. It smells like Nair in the worst ways. HOWEVER- it does work very well. I have used it on some spots where I picked some zits, and the scars were gone in a couple of days. I also used it on my chest where I had some sun spots and it has improved the discolouration quite a bit. And you’ll see an improvement in a couple of days so it works quick! Overall I am very impressed with this product— I can look past the smell because it works so well! smells bad but works so well!
