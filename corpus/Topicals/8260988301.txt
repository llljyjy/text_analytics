Okay so… I just recently purchased this product with high hopes of it helping with post-acne scarring. And I still have high hopes. BUT THE SMELL. It’s bad :( I thought I got a defective tube until reading more reviews mentioning the awful smell as well. Don’t get me wrong - if the product works, I will still use it, but I find myself not wanting to grab for it because I know what I’m in for. I’m highly sensitive to smells so this took me aback a bit, but I’m hoping with continued use I see worthy results & get used to the odor. Just thought it was worth mentioning for anyone who is considering purchasing this product or for those who have any sensitivity to strong scents (or unpleasant ones). We Have To Talk About the SMELL
