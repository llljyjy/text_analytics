I don’t know how to feel about this product. Saw great reviews so decided to give it a shot. I noticed that I was getting little tiny bumps on my forehead and I wasn’t sure why until I realized it was this product. I decided to use it on my cheeks/chin only instead. Would still get closed comedones here and there. Besides that I didn’t really see a difference in my hyperpigmentation/blemishes and I was using this product almost every  night. Sadly not for me. idk
