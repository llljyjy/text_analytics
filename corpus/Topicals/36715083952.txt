Didn’t work. Maybe it’s just me but I used it for 2 months and nothing has changed. I personally recommend the ordinary’s serum, its cheaper and I applied it for a week and it actually made my Acnes and black heads much better.Or maybe it’s because I stopped wearing mask a couple weeks ago because school is over. However it’s just my experience and opinion. nan
