I really wanted to love this product. After having perfect skin in my teenage years, I started breaking out heavily on my forehead recently. I’m a skin picker, so I can’t help but pick at my acne which results in aggressive scarring and a lot of redness. I gave this product a fair chance and used it for over a month. Yes, the product does help with hyperpigmentation and brightens the skin… HOWEVER… I started getting a million little white heads and bumps on my face :( As a result and for the price, this product is not worth it for me. If you have sensitive skin this product might not be for you. Ehhhhh…
