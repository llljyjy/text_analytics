I honestly couldn’t be anymore satisfied with this product. The results speak for themselves. I’ve only been using it consistently for two weeks. Be sure to use a daily moisturizer after you wash in the morning. I have sensitive skin and this product did not bother me at all. Not even on my eczema spots. Please try this product!
