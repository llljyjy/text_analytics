I wanted to love this. I waited for it to be back in stock to purchase but I think I had a bad reaction and my face broke out crazy! I used it 1x a week the first week as per the instructions but the following week I used it 2x. Idk if that caused the reaction or maybe because I used Paula’s choice salicylic on the days between using topicals but my face broke out so now I’m returning it to be safe High hopes
