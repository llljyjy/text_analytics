Smells like burnt rubber but works super well. If you can get over the smell it’s not too bad. I found once I put moisturizer on the smell isn’t so bad. Does fade my acne scars but you can only use it a few times a week. Large amount of product for the price though considering you use so little. DOES THE JOB SMELLS LIKE BURNT RUBBER
