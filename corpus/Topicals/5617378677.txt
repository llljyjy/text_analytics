I saw a few bad reviews and I was a little nervous but within one week using as directed I saw major improvement. The product can be strong especially if you have sensitive skin or have not used vitamin c before so I would keep that in mind. I am very happy with my results. I am brown to dark brown with combination skin. I recommend using at night but if you do use it in the morning use a high spf like 100 Great! donâ€™t let the bad reviews turn you away
