It’s not even been a month and I can already see my scar has been getting lighter I pacifically got this product because I had a scar in the middle of my face that was so dark and horrendous that I needed it gone by the end of summer Usually I use ordinary for my scars but I wanted some thing that would maybe work quicker this definitely does the trick it hasn’t even been a month and I can see it fading away ordinary would take about 3/4 months The only downside is the product kind of smells weird but honestly with the way it working idccc I don’t use it on my whole face because I scared I might break out but I haven’t broken out yet I would just say put it directly on the dark spots working in less than a month
