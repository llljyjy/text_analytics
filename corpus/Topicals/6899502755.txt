Staple in my skin care routine! Yes it does have a metal like smell but it goes away quickly. Don’t get discouraged if you use it and break out a little. It’s normal for your skin to purge when trying new products. Especially ones with strong ingredients like Tranexamic Acid. I have been using it now for a little over a month and have seen drastic results. My skin is much smoother, brighter and almost 70% of my scars have faded. I’m surprised at how well it works. My advice, stick with it. No product transforms your skin overnight. Consistency is key. (PS: I have blemish prone sensitive skin) Staple in my Skin Care Routine! Stick with it.
