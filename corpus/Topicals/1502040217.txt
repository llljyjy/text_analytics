I love this! I use it almost everyday now. I stopped for a little because my skin was sensitive after a facial. But I realized that this product does not sensitize my skin. If anything, it feels softer and smoothers and more hydrated after. I put it on almost every night and the next morning I wake up so glowy! I even used it under my gentle retinol last night expecting to wake up with some dry patches and there was none! It’s been working well for my lighter acne scars and I’m assuming will take more time for the darker and newer ones. Keep in mind, younger skin regenerates faster than older skin. I am 23 so the sales associate said I can expect faster results and suffice with the smaller size. nan
