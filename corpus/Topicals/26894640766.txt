I bought this for some acne scars that Iâ€™ve had for a few months and just wanted the get rid of. I used it on them and on my cheeks because I also had some hyperpigmentation. The next few days a few whiteheads had formed where I had used the product. I think this is due to the coconut oil in the formula, which is known to cause pores. I thought since it was in a low amount it would be fine, but for my sensitive skin it was not. And not the mention the smell, which is rancid and smells like cat food. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin!! I wish this had worked because I paid $36 dollars for it, but it is the worst thing I have every used on my skin. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. STAY AWAY!!
