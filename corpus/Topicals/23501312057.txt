i did not expect it to literally smell like raw eggs but thankfully i am not sensitive to smell. I did not see much of a difference in the beginning. As soon as I started using it every other day at night, there was a noticeable brightness/ glow on my face the next morning. Therefore, definitely recommend it for hyperpigmenation if you are not sensitive to smell. consistency is key
