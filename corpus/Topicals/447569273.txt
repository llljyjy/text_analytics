I have a lot of hyperpigmentation from breakouts, and I find this works well to fade my dark spots. You will not find a product on the market that has so many brightening ingredients in one product, and this is why I reach for this product over others from more expensive brands that are usually one-note products. Yes, the smell is atrocious but you get used to it and I would prefer this kind of product over one that uses masking fragrance or takes out an active ingredient to make it a more pleasant experience. Iâ€™m very results-oriented and this is a stellar product in spite of the drawbacks. Smells awful but you get used to it!
