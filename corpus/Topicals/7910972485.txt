I was really surprised to find how well this actually works. This is not a bleaching cream or miracle product that’s going to even you out overnight, also it has a scent that I believe comes from the active ingredients; kinda reminds me of Nair. Needless to say, this serum does a good job of easing my skin into being even and it always leaves me looking radiant. I enjoy layering it with heavier creams and oils but I recommend following the instructions exactly as they’re given for the best results. Great Product, Not A Black
