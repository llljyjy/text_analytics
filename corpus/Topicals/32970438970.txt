Smells absolutely awful, like morning breath, even when breathing through the mouth while applying it you can taste it. Anyways this product is absolutely amazing! It’s the best product I’ve even used for acne scars. I’ve been using it every third day for two months and I’m able to notice a very large difference in the colouration and existence of my scars. worse product I’ve ever smelled in my life
