Love this. If you break out, this will be helpful with the hyperpigmentation after the break out. I struggle with breakouts on my skin due to the mask. Not a big fan a mask. Though once my skin breaks out, this serum is helpful. With the breakouts leaving its hyperpigmentation this helps fade the hyperpigmentation. But I ain’t a big fan of the scent. Which if you don’t mind a scent to it, then this is perfect for you! Perfect for breakouts!
