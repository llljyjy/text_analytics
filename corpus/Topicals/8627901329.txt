I actually didn’t expect much from this product when I first purchased it. I saw a bunch of ads about it and caved in when I saw it in person. After trying it a couple of times I absolutely love it. My skin looks so good in the morning and throughout the day. My skin looks really plump and hydrated after sleeping with it on overnight. I also love that it helps with hyperpigmentation. I’m only rating it 4 stars because THE SMELL. I was very confused when I first opened it up because it smelled so bad. The product itself reeks like perm and rotten eggs. But since I enjoy the way it makes my skin look I can get past the nasty smell. I would highly recommended to only use the product when you’re only going to be at home because if you were to go out you’ll definitely smell like eggs lol! Love it, BUT smells like perm/rotten eggs
