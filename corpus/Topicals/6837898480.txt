I thought people were kidding when they said they could stand the smell. Ok itâ€™s bad lol BUT it works. I will sleep with a stinky face to wake up with a baby face the next day forever! My scars are already fading after one week of use and mySkin is SO soft. I have a lot of acne scars fresh and old ones and texture and this works wonders on my skin! worth it
