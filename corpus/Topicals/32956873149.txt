First of all, I don’t know why people complain about the smell, it’s not that bad but I love how people these days want products with no artificial fragrance and then complain about the natural smell, bottom line, people will always complain. Second, this product is AMAZING - I’ve tested it for about 3 weeks now (fist week only did it one night to see how my skin reacted, second week every other night and now every night). I’ve struggled with hyperpigmentation every time I get a pimple no matter what. It’s got a PERFECT combination of powerful ingredients that I’ve already tried in the past but I love how this product combined the best. Great job and this is now a staple in my every day skincare routine. Be consistent if you don’t see results right away, trust me :) please read!
