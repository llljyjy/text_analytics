The sulfur smell goes away within a minute or so of application so you’re missing out on a really good product if the smell is what’s holding you back. This is amazinggggg for discolouration from acne and I’ll definitely be buying again ! (FYI seems they’ve added a fragrance to cover up the smell) a little stinky but works!!
