I purchased this to help with my dark spots and after reading multiple reviews, I was convinced this would work for me. I’ve only been using it for a few weeks now & I have not seen a difference but I do have hope that it’ll eventually do what it’s supposed to do. However, what I was not expecting was for it to have a strong scent. I’m not really into scented skincare products and because this has a strong scent I most likely will not repurchase (unless it actually clears my dark spots) Hate the way it smells
