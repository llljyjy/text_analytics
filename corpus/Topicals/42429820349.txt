honestly if I could give it a 0 star rating I would. I had pretty clear skin before using this product but I bought it to try and fade really mild hyperpigmentation. instead this product broke me out insanely bad and leaving me with really sever painful acne. it has given me all this tiny bumps on my face (closed comedones?) and I seriously have never felt so insecure and helpless about my skin. I would not recommend this to anyone. waste of money. worth 0 stars
