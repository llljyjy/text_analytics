I really love this. My skin care has more AHA, BHA, PHA to it but this works fine with it. I honestly love this product. I tried the mini and it really reduced some bad acne from the masks. I fought a long time with mask acne and this has truly helped a lot with the discoloration. I don’t mind the smell but I recommend trying the small tube if you are unsure. Personally I really love this so I’m going to get the bigger tube. I use this at night to help the healing process. It works for me!
