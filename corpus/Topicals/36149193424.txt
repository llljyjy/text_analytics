when i first tried this product, it i used it once that week like the box stated. then the next week i just officially added it to my routine I’ve only used this product 3 times so i cant tell you about results yet, but the bottle is absolutely useless when i tried to open the bottle first when unboxing this product it just came flying out. and every time i try to get product from the bottle too much comes out its just wasteful. the smell can trigger some people and that could cause some to be inconsistent with this product. Imo the smell doesn’t really bother me it smells like dog food.
