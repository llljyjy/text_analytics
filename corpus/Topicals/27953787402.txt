I am writing this review because I see SO MANY negative reviews under this product because of the smell alone but let me tell you this product is amazing, smell or no smell. At first it smells a bit like nair hair removal cream and then a bit like chicken afterwards but once it is on your face you cannot smell a thing and I feel like all of these reviews about the smell have you heating up for the worst but it is really not that strong. At first when I opened the tube I couldn’t even smell anything, it has a SLIGHT smell to it so if you are very sensitive to smells you may not like it but I think all the reviews are very misleading about the degree of smell it has. Overall this product is awesome, not irritating, feels great on the skin, and minimized the look of my pores after one day of using it. I love it and highly recommend! Don’t let the negative “smells terrible” comments hold you back! nan
