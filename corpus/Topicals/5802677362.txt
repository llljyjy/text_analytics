Okay, so I was kind of skeptical about this one. I also wanted to wait at least a month or so before I wrote a review. I’ve picked a designated area to apply this everyday  (for the past three to four weeks) and at first I didn’t notice anything. But recently I’ve noticed the spots in that area are definitely getting lighter and the texture of my skin in this particular area is smoother. Now, the smell! Omg it is pretty bad; smells like rotten eggs. However, I really don’t care about a smell if the product works. Be patient, stay consistent& hold your nose!
