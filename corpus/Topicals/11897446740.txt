The product applies well. I rub it in after I use a hydrating toner. I used it three times so far and I haven’t had any negative reactions. I use it at night, once or twice a week. It does give my face a glow the next day. I also use Biossance’s Vitamin C serum (which is great BTW!), and also helped fade and brighten my overall complexion. The smell is somewhat offensive but I can tolerate it. Surprisingly, I don’t notice it after a while. Remember to wash your hands after using it or you will smell it forever!!! I am hoping it will reduce my milia and the few stubborn acne scars I have from a breakout I had months ago. My issue is with the packaging. The product keeps coming out even when I don’t put pressure on the tube and was holding it upright. I have to close the tube while little bit of the product is still coming out. Is it possible to have a different packaging? Does anyone have tips for handling the product? nan
