I just love this serum. I was unsure about it when I ordered it based on other reviews and because I had been using other products with niacinamide and tranexamic acid for a while, without seeing many results. I am so glad I tried it anyway! My skin on my cheeks has had significant red and brown acne scarring for quite some time, with large pores and sensitive skin. I’ve been really self-conscious about it and have been considering laser treatment. This serum seems to have made a huge difference in the time that I’ve been using it over the past few weeks. My cheeks are even and actually glowing now? Who would have thought. I’m looking at cancelling my laser appointment and waiting to see if the results hold up. I’m so pleased with this product.I also don’t think the smell is that bad, at all. I braced myself when I opened the tube, thinking it would be horrific based on other comments, but it was .. fine? I definitely have used other products that I thought were smellier. I actually considered taking a rapid test because I thought maybe there was something wrong with my smell, but I think it just doesn’t bother me as much. Even if it did, the results that it’s given me so far would be worth plugging my nose! I'm obsessed
