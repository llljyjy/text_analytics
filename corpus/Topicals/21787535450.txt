This has worked WONDERS for my skin. For starters, I would say that this works great on more fresh and newer hyperpigmentation. With any good and safe hyperpigmentation products, they’ll take up take 6 weeks or more to see results, and I’ve been using it consecutively for 7 months and boy I’ll tell ya. I use it alongside tretinoin which I’m sure helps. I honestly don’t care much for the smell, so I guess you could say I’ve got a tough nose. Overall great product that takes time to work. If your having issues, make sure you’re using an exfoliant on days off to help with the renewing of your skin. Smell doesn’t bother me
