The smell isn’t as bad as people say it is. Unless you are extremely sensitive to smells I suppose. The tube is cute, but you do have to be careful with it or to much will come out. To me that’s not a big deal though, as long you aren’t rough with it, it won’t leak in my experience. As for the results, I’ve always had acne. At 29 I still had hormonal acne. I now only wash my face, use this product then use lotion before bed. This got rid of my acne, except for those random period pimples now. And my scars started to fade within two weeks. My light “new” scars started to fade immediately and I was extremely impressed. My skin texture also just looks healthier after using this on a semi regular basis. Now I’m working on those pesky old scars from when I was a teenager and threw 3 pregnancies when I had severe acne. I’m going onto my second tube and hoping it keeps working, slowly but surely the deep dark scars are fading! nan
