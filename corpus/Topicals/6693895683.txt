Full 5 stars only because this product does what it’s supposed to do!! Only been using for a week… A WEEEK! My skin had been breaking out due to me mistreating my skin and this CLEARED my acne along with lighten my acne scars! Might I say it is not completely gone acne nor hyperpigmentation/scarring. BUT i can tell soon it’ll be long gone with this product! My acne keeps fading and hyperpigmentation/scarring. The results are scary good! Yes it does smell but if you don’t get bother by smells easily I say try it asap. But I would say I’m sure the reason the product works is because of the smell itself…the ingredients are important. Love that I can use this everyday (use as spot treatment also if you don’t want it everywhere) BYE BYE ACNE/hyperpigmentation
