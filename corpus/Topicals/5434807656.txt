Yes, it smells bad. The scent doesn’t last and this product is a medicine in my mind so I don’t mind it. A little goes a long way. My skin isn’t sensitive to it so I can use it twice a day. I haven’t noticed results yet but that could be my individual skin and melasma causes, and nothing to do with the product. Several dermatologists recommend it and the ingredients are all great and work together to treat pigmentation and discoloration. The only thing it doesn’t have is hydroquinone. No results yet but seems like a good product
