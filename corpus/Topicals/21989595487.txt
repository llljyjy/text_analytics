This is one of the only creams that has helped my hyperpigmentaion. The only time i have been able to clear my hyperpigmentaion in the past was with tretinoin. This doesnt work as fast, but i have been using it for less than 6 months now and have noticed a very large decrease in my scars. It does have niaciimide which gives me white heads, but it works so well to lighten my dark spots i dont mind. The smell is not that good, but once you put it on you cant really smell it anymore so it doesnt matter too much. Will definitely be buying again. Only issue is the tube is very unforgiving and product tends to spill out and gather around the top which is kind of annoying because of how expensive the product is you end up wasting a bit of it. Only otc way to lighten my hyperpigmentaion
