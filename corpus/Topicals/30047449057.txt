ok ok. even though some reviews say it’s not good doesn’t mean it won’t work for you, so hear me out. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. ever since i was 11 my skin would break out, to the point where it became pretty severe. Recently my skins been getting more clear because of going to a simple skincare routine. All I have mostly is dark spots from where the bad pimples were. it took me years and years to find something good, and it’s worth it. smell doesn’t bother me, but overall the serum is amazing. the picture on the on the left is before which was 8/19, and the right picture is 9/15. literally amazing, doing it’s job.
