I’ve been using this for about 6 weeks and it’s definitely helped lighten my acne scars. I’ve noticed I’ve been breaking out less as well. The smell is very intense at first, but I don’t care since the products WORKS! Now that I’m used to the smell it doesn’t bother me at all. I’ll definitely keep using it. Smelly, but WORKS!
