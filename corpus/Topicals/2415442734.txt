Bought the mini to try out as a spot treatment and was over all pleased. The combo of ingredients really help with the inflammation I get around my neck and jawline my old-lady chin hairs (bleck). I doubt that this is the miracle cure for all your discoloration woes, but the mini option makes it worth a try. Definitely becoming a part of my routine...Can’t give it full marks because it’s definitely not for the scent sensitive. I’m OK with it as the smell reminds me of topical creams used for my childhood scrapes. Stinky but it works! (For me at least)
