I am a skin care junkie and was looking for something new to address discoloration. I grew up in SW Florida, so plenty of freckes and sun damage. I must say this is a fantastic product, it has tons of great ingredients (Tranexamic Acid, licorice, Niacinamide, and Azelaic Acid) - all that address discoloration and Azelaic acid helps to prevent future sun damage. I use it twice per day, in the AM, after my vitamin C serum and before sunscreen, and in the PM, after retin A and before my moisturizer. In less than two weeks, I’ve already seen great results. For best results, you MUST use an SPF every day, or the dark spots will return.I would have given it four stars but as other reviewers have mentioned, it stinks. The closest comparison I can think of is the old-fashioned perm solution, it has that kind of smell. It dissipates after a few minutes, but it’s pretty stinky. Great product
