As a woc, I struggle terribly from post acne scarring that lingers for months but in the short time Iâ€™ve been using this product (about 2.5 weeks) I definitely  notice a difference. Although this serum/cream is quite smelly when applied, its nothing unbearable in my opinion. The results definitely make overlooking the smell a lot easier, plus the smell only lasts a few moments then dissipates smelly but worth it
