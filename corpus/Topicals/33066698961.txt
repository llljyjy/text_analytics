I don’t always have break-outs, and this is not my day-to-day serum.  However, after I had a nasty break-out and a week of using this serum, the results were amazing.  I used it for three weeks after a break-out and it truly works.  Yeah, it smells bad but it’s a serum, so after you move on to moisturizer and sunscreen it goes away.  I will definitely keep some of this on hand for the next break-out. Excellent serum for acne
