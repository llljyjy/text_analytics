Listen, I don’t care about the smell. I care about results. Yes, it doesn’t smell pleasant, but I wasn’t concerned about that if the product delivers. Unfortunately, if you’re using this product to reduce acne scarring, it probably means you’re acne-prone, and coconut oil is one of the WORST ingredients to put on your face if you’re prone to breakouts. Super pore clogging, I gave this product multiple chances and each time it took my skin a month to bounce back from the acne that appeared the day after I used it. Not a very thoughtful formulation for the product’s target group. Breakout City
