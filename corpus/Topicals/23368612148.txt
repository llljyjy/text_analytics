I wish I read the reviews before buying it ! It smells awful, real awful fragrance - can’t sleep with this product on.Sticky after application. I applied and had to rinse it in 20 mins. Can’t take risk to break out coz of my bad choice of an overhyped product ( 2 stars coz I don’t know if it works - I will not use it beyond one use) nan
