So imma start with this I never leave a review but I have to say this cream must have the tears of baby Jesus in it. I never used something with such quick and outstanding results, I already know this is one skin care gem that I’ll have forever. For everyone wanting to know yes it stinks but after the first use, you get used to the smell. So just buy it, my acne clear up and darks spot are gone. This cream is also good for if you’re breaking out suddenly, just dab some on your face at night the next morning clear skin or the bumps go down significantly. Thank you to the person who made this you put your whole foot in this miracle serum!  I wish took something before and after pictures I didn’t think it would work so well! GET THE CREAM
