So far so good! I’m still too new to using this product to comment on long term changes in skin but so far I like it. My one complaint would be it does stink but not enough to turn me off from using it. Really reminds me of products with sulphur. I have never used a product with azelaic acid before so maybe that is the smell? I’m not sure. Another thing to note is this product is meant to be used once a week and then worked up to every night and it cannot be combined with other acids or retinol from my understanding so if you have those products in your skincare routine that you already love there will be a confliction. Stinky and not compatible with other ingredients
