Packaging on this is some of the worst I’ve ever come across. It wastes so much product every time and it makes me feel bad using it as it was so expensive. The smell is awful too but I can get past that, since I always prefer fragrance free skincare products. I think it’s too early to really tell how effective the actual formula is but I will say that the morning after using this I woke up with clear glassy skin! However if you’re on a budget, I strongly suspect that the inkey list’s tranexemic acid is a dupe for this. They have a very similar ingredient list and I’ve been using that for months and have noticed a huge improvement on my skin. nan
