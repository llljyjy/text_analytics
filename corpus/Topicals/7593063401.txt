This is my all time favorite skincare product. It’s the only thing that has helped with both my hyperpigmentation and occasional breakouts. It does smell bad, but it’s a skincare product and not a perfume, so I don’t think it is fair to rate it based on smell. After you rub it in, you can’t smell it anyway. The ingredients are really high quality. I usually use moisturizer afterwards, but I find that I don’t have to use it if I don’t want to when I use this product. It’s enough alone to make my skin feel soft and look glowy. I have noticed a significant reduction in hyperpigmentation ever since I started using this product and I get a lot of compliments on my skin now. I absolutely recommend giving this a try. Best product ever
