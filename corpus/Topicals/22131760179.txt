I have been dealing with post-breakout hyperpigmentation for YEARS and this product has done wonders to fade it and even out my skin tone! I use it at night in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and ceramide-rich moisturizer and think I’ve found the ideal routine for what my skin issues and goals are (I’m noticing more of a difference now than when I was doing a similar routine but with Differin adapalene gel in place of this product). The smell hasn’t been overbearing for me, and I am just so excited by the results I’ve experienced in the first month of using this. Highly highly recommend! nan
