Could not get past the smell. It smelled like putting liquid sulfur on my face or cat urine. It was really unpleasant experience. I don’t even know if this product works because I only tried it twice and it was a struggle for me to keep it on my skin. It lingered for hours too. Topicals should really work on this god awful smell. My boyfriend even smelled my face and said it was gross. I wish I found the receipt to return this product bc this product does not deserve my money— even if it’s $18 THE SMELL!
