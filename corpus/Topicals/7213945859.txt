Been using this product for about a month now and it helped with my redness but not much on the darkspots. The smell I was able to manage since I know a lot of people have been hating this product because of the smell. Looking at the ingredients there’s a lot of good stuff in there! In terms of a lot of acids, it also has hydrating ingredients so it wont dry out your skin. I also found that there is coconut oil in the ingredient list, which made me hesitate since coconut oil does flare up my acne... I would say it doesn’t do MUCH but anyone with sunspots, melasma, etc. This will be your ride or die product! Better with dry skin
