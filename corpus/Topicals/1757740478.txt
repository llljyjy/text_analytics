I’ve been using this for a month and can confirm: it works. Recently I had started to develop darker sun spots and freckles and I really didn’t like how it made my skin look, like somewhere between dull and ruddy. This serum cleared it all up and made my skin look basically brand new like when i was 17 again (I’m 30 but it’s still a good change). It also really improved my skins texture which I didn’t even realize was a problem until it was gone. Everytime I happen to touch my face I’m blown away by how soft it is now. Faded smells really bad but once you start seeing results you stop caring it’s just becomes worth it. Oh and I owe at least part of the success of this product to diligent suncare, sunscreen everyday and reapplied often and all that good stuff. It really truly makes a difference and this stinky stuff has won my heart. It works.
