This product works! It has helped to fade my hyperpigmentation significantly and smooth skin after about three weeks. I put on for a morning night routine. Let skin absorb cream for about 5 to 10 minutes. Important to remember to moisturize and put on sunscreen afterward. The cream goes on smoothans hasnâ€™t irritated my skin. Great Product to Fade Hyperpigmentation and Smooth
