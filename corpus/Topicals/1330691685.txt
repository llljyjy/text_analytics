I did not know how to fit this serum into my routine - wasn’t sure how it would mix with my other products. I have added this thicker serum with a sulfur (strong at first, doesn’t linger) scent to my nighttime routine every few nights and only layer a moisturizer on top. Immediately my skin looked brighter and still does as I continue to use the serum. I will repurchase. Couldn’t commit.
