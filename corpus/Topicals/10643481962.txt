I bought this based of Doctorly’s recommendation. Unfortunately, after one tube, I haven’t noticed any improvement in my hyper pigmentation. If this product had any effectiveness, I wouldn’t compliant about its cat food smell. Two stars for the affordability. Overall not worth the tolerance of the horrible odor. Apply Cat Food to Your Face
