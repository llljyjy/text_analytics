4 stars because it doesn’t dry and it smells like poison i did notice a slight difference after a couple of times using it nothing too noticeable yet though i’m excited to keep using it to notice a bigger difference i just don’t like that i can’t go to sleep with it on because it literally doesn’t try it just gets tacky and gets my pillow sticky :| and the smell doesn’t go away btw it lingers :|but i’m going to keep using it in hopes it works wonders just bc i saw a baby difference alreadywill update in a month or something yay and nay?
