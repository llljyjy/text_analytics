I was gifted this set in exchange for my honest review. As someone who loves the NUDESTIX line of makeup, I had really high hopes that this new skincare collection would perform just as well. Unfortunately all 3 products left me terribly disappointed (and one in particular has me raging). Let me break it down:Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer – while this product smells lovely and has a great creamy consistency, I did not find it particularly moisturizing. I have very dry skin, and it just felt like a heavy layer of balm that sat on the skin. I don’t mind it as a primer base for my foundation, but there’s other products that serve this purpose & perform much better. Citrus Clean Balm & Makeup Melt – Cleansing balms are one of my favourite formulations when it comes to removing makeup, so again I had high hopes for this one. While this does the job, the pain it causes it absolutely not worth it. It is very heavily scented & the citrus ingredients immediately stung my eyes as I attempted to remove my eye makeup. Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel – This product is just downright deceptive. It claims to peel off dead skin with its exfoliating powers, but this is not the case at all. The product itself has texture, and when manipulated with your fingers it will ‘ball up’, leading the user to think it’s a dead skin being sloughed off. I know this to be true, as I tried it on a particularly dry and flaky patch of skin and it did not even come close to scrubbing it off. The only thing this product has going for it is the fragrance.At least the pouch will get to be reused, but otherwise I’d recommend you skip this lineup entirely.
