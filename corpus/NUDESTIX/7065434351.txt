I usually don’t write review but this product was so disappointing I thought I’d warn others about it. I am South Asian with a medium skin tone yellow undertones. This product is so red/orange it looks like I have a sun burn. The colour/undertone difference was so obvious I had a line separating the colour of my face and neck. People with yellow under tones watch out, this product does not seem like it was made for POC in mind. One good point was the thin consistency compared to other mineral sunscreens. People with Yellow Undertones Beware
