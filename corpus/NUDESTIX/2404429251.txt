The sunscreen formula is light and not heavy or greasy. It’s very sheer and easy to use under products. However I’m between cool and warm and I received the warm colour. It was way too dark and did not look like a natural tan for me. Ended up giving it to a friend who loved it, so it was a good product overall. Maybe I could’ve tried the cool tone. Also it’s a tad pricy for sunscreen. Great texture, colour selection poor
