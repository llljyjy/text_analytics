I liked this product so far as I find it gives me a nice tint to my skin when I mix it with face cream. I did get a shade too dark but it gives me a nice glow for the summer time. Definitely will be purchasing this in the medium tint so I can wear for the colder mo the. Not greasy at all and did not make my skin break out nice tint
