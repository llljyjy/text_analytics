I received the Nudestix Citrus-C Mask and Daily Moisturizer for free from BzzAgent. I’ve been trying it for a couple weeks now and I’m happy with the product itself. I have been using it at night before bed as I am a moisture nut. It definitely has a stronger smell so those of you who like unscented products, it’s probably not for you. The consistency is gel-like and my skin absorbed it within minutes. I live in Calgary, our winters are very dry so this was a perfect layer of moisturizer needed to revive my skin.I would recommend it to those who like to combine their vitamin C drops with a cream instead of doing it separately. I’d probably purchase this product again once I finish it. Citrus Dream
