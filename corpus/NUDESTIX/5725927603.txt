I received this product complimentary of Bzzagent. I’ve had a love hate relationship with SPF products but this one is a game changer. It applies wonderfully, it’s non greasy, and it melts into your skin seamlessly for a natural dewy glow. It is amazing on its own or as a primer as it sits flawlessly under makeup. I’m in love with this product and will recommend it to everyone I know! I’ve already purchased a back up bottle when the sad day comes that I run out. IN LOVE!
