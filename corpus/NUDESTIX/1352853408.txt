I think this would be a great product for some, it just didn’t hit the mark for me. The makeup removing balm was nice and took away my makeup well, the issue for me was the strong smell. Any type of strong fragrance irritates my skin and it was especially strong in all of these products. If you don’t mind fragrance I think this balm is really nice. The same for the Peel and Lotion. The lotion is also very thick though. I definitely would not use it during the day but perhaps at a nightly mask once a week if you had very dry skin! Strong scent but good products!
