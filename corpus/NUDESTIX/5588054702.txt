I adore this magic in a bottle. I’ve been using for two weeks straight and not only is is protecting me from the sun, it has many nutrients that are good for the skin. I’m acne prone and oily and have not broken out once. I like there’s no scent as well. Glides onto the skin beautifully and works not only great as a moisturizer but great as a primer as well. Will for sure recommend and buy  again. Magic in a Bottle
