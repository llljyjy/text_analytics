I did not like this moisturizer because the fragrance was so overwhelming. The consistency was fine but the extreme fragrance was so off putting and made me concerned that it would trigger a breakout. it’s quite thin and feels pretty light-weight but you smell like a citrus fruit for a while which is not pleasant at all. I would not buy this again and i wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with skin issues or normal skin. It just seems like a trendy product to attract shopaholics. Not Impressed
