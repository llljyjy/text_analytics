I have Indian wheatish, sensitive skin, and this works like magic! It blends well, provides protection and gives my skin a nice balanced glow. No white cast either. I also feel my skin texture has improved since I started using product! Thanks also to the lovely store assistant at Sephora Culver Steps for their excellent recommendation! nan
