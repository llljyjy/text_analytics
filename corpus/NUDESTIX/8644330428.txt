I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and it’s great! It goes on easily, wears well, lasts all day, and has built in SPF. It’s lighter than a foundation but gives good coverage as well. I bought the warm shade and it was a bit dark for my wintertime complexion but it would be fine for someone with olive toned or more tanned skin. nan
