I’ve got mixed feelings about this kit, whileI think it’d be a good starter or travelkit - wouldn’t be my “go-to”. It comes with 3 products. The cleansing balm is okay for light makeup but for a solid cleanse, not the best option and a rather thick consistency which makes it hard to squeeze out. The detox peel I liked the smell but  once again, the consistency of it - not a fan and but would say does “brighten” your skin after user. The moisturizer is the only product I would consider purchasing again, a little goes a long way and keeps skin hydrated. nan
