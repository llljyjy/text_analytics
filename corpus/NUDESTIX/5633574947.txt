I love the packaging it came with, perfect for travelling. The cleansing balm works wonders with waterproof makeup. The peel leaves a slight stinging sensation which could be nerve wrecking to some but personally, im used to it and makes me feel like its working. The moisturizer has a light scent but slightly too heavy for me. nan
