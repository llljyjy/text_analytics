This product has some nice ingredients and vitamins C is an amazing addition to any skin care routine. Though normally, I prefer to include that separate from my moisturizer. It was fairly hydrating! Tried with two foundations though and it did pull with the more matte foundation, so just keep that in mind. I would say best for makeup free glow days! nan
