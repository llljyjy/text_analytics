I like how this tinted sunscreen from nudestix is super light weight - you don’t even feel it on your skin and hydrating too! My only con to this is the colour matching, I wish they have something in between cool and warm as I am a little too tanned for cool and not tanned enough for warm. When I put warm on, it does make me look a little tanner and I can’t apply the right amount of sunscreen on because it makes it look a little too dark for the rest of my body. can we have an in-between shade?
