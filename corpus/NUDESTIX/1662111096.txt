I received a sample of this product to try. I loved the smell and texture. It scent is light and fresh. This mask is easy to use and does not scratch the skin as it does not have any hard granules. My skin looked brighter after using it. I would suggest making sure you lean over a sink as the peeling action does cause it to get a bit messy, but it was so gentle on my skin. I would definitely recommend this product! Great peel thatâ€™s gentle on the skin !
