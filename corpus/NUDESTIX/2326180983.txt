All three of these products work well but are a little more fragranced than I usually like in my skin care. The makeup remover worked great, got off all my makeup without tugging at my skin, and washed off easily without leaving a greasy film on my skin. I really enjoyed the experience of using it. However, I will not repurchase because the fragrance was too strong for me. The micro peel was awesome! It gently exfoliated my skin without irritating it, felt great while using, and left my skin feeling soft and clean. The fragrance was strong as well but didnâ€™t bother me. I would definitely consider repurchasing the micro peel. The mask/moisturizer was super thick and emollient. But the best part was that it sunk into the skin easily and left my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy. A little too much fragrance for me as my skin still smelt citrusy a few hours later. All in all the products are really nice but the fragrance is a little overpowering for my tastes. Nice products but too much fragrance
