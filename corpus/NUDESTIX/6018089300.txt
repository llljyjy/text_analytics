I gotta agree with others. I found this to be heavy on my skin, which I’m not a fan of. I like things to be light on my skin, kinda like I didn’t put anything on to begin with. I found the scent to be strong and stuck around for quite some time. I feel it also left my skin kinda oily, which is a total flip for my skin as I’m usually more on the dry side. I did receive this for free and gave it more then 2 weeks before posting my review so I could give a honest review on it. I would not buy this again as overall, it’s not right for my skin Did not agree with my skin
