As far as moisturizers go, the NUDESKIN Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer is a strong contender as a daily staple in the beauty drawer. With a creamy, soft texture and a lack of oily residue, it works just as well under makeup as it does as a face mask for when you need a little extra hydration. It absorbs well into the skin without leaving behind grease. With a vegan-friendly ingredients, including turmeric and yuzu, I find it does a rather good job in increasing skin uniformity and decreasing redness where slight blemishes are concerned, helping to remove marks faster. There is a slight scent of yuzu, similar to a lemon smell, so those with scent sensitivities should take this into consideration.Overall, it was pleasant to wake up in the morning and feel my facial skin being incredibly silky. I appreciate that softness in skin texture, as it helps to plump up fine lines and gives a youthful appearance to the skin. nan
