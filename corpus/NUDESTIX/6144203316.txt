This little kit is perfect for going away. I really love the citrus scent of each of the products, makes me feel my skin is refreshed. The micro-peel leaves my face super soft without irritation. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the makeup melt balm was not the best around my eyes (I have very sensitive eyes) but for foundation it works really well. Great Scents
