This is a really nice exfoliating peel. This was my first time trying an exfoliant like this, and I really enjoyed it. It left my face feeing soft and hydrated, and my skin appeared brighter and more glowing. The product itself is a faint yellow gel consistency, but when applied to the face, massaging it in causes it to pill and peel off in little pieces, taking oil, dirt and dead skin with it. I suppose this is the deep exfoliating effect which was very cool to experience! Definitely recommend!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Nice Peeling Exfoliator
