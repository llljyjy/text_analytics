Pleasantly surprised by the effects of this sunscreen. I’ve been using it alongside my partner. We both enjoy that it is clear, non sticky, and absorbs into the skin fast. He’s been using it during his golfing outings and I have been using it on a daily basis under my makeup. I didn’t notice it disturbing my makeup, and I haven’t had any issues with sun burns. We’ve both been using it at the lakeside cabin while sun tanning, and again, it’s shown to effectively block harmful UV rays. It’s light and easy to put on and it didn’t cause any breakouts, which I sometimes have an issue with when using sunscreens. Great sunscreen!
