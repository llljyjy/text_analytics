I’ve been using it for a few days it’s a good spf, it applies easily and doesn’t leave a oily feeling. It feels like a gel moisturizer. I thought the tint was too warm for me first but after it was absorbed the tint goes away. It doesn’t have a scent, it didn’t break me out or affect my makeup routine. I would definitely buy this product again Good SPF + primer
