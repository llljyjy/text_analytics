I got sent this product as a demo and I have to say I’m fairly impressed the cleansing balm is better than the inkey lists’s oat balm and doesn’t leave my skin feeling like it’s got a layer of product on it. It took off every speck of makeup - and I did a full face just to try it! The exfoliating scrub is wonderful! If it’s truly my dead skin that it’s rubbing off than I am embarrassed! It left my skin feeling fresh and smooth. The only thing of the trio i’m not sold on is the moisture mask - there are better ones out there IMO. Over all, trio left my acne prone and dry skin happy and smooth, though the citrusy sent was a bit chemically for my tastes and the packaging doesn’t look as sleek as other products on my counter.
