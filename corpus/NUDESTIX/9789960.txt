This came in the mail as a free sample at the PERFECT time! It’s been snowing, cold and dry in Toronto and my skin was not happy with my current moisturizer. Enter this beauty! It’s rich and creamy but absorbs so quickly and doesn’t leave my face a sweaty mess. My skin is hydrated, and it doesn’t break me out. Its great in the day under makeup, or on it’s own and I like to put it on extra thick at night. Will definitely buy! Fantastic Hydration
