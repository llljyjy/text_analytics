I received this free product to try out through BzzAgent. It’s the Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil. I love how this product is a moisturizer with sunscreen and can also be a primer. The color of this Nudescreen matched my skintone perfectly, it blended up nicely. Perfect way to protect your skin from the sun with the SPF in it. I also found that it absorbed nicely, leaving my skin nice and hydrated, not leaving a sticky residue. It keeps my skin nicely hydrated all day, especially when I put makeup on. I found this product to be really great, I would highly recommend this product. A bonus of this product is that it’s clean & free of sulfates, parabans & fragrance, it’s cruelty free and vegan. Hydrated!!
