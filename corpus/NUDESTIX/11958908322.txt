I have combo skin erring more on the dry side and this tinted moisturizing is lightweight and absorbs very quickly into my skin. There is no white cast at all and doesnâ€™t leave my skin oily at the end of the day. It is very light coverage but you can layer it on without it feeling overwhelming, making it perfect for everyday wear as there is spf too. nan
