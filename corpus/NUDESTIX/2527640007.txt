I am a huge fan of Nudestix makeup so I was super excited to learn they were coming out with skincare products, but unfortunately this set missed the mark for me. I will start off by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by the scent of the products. I am not a fan of heavy artificial fragrance in skincare so I was happy to see that the products had a mild, more natural scent. I also love that the products are the perfect size for travel and the bag they come in is very high quality and re-useable. My favourite product of the trio is the moisturizer. It is very thick and hydrating, almost like a balm and my skin drank it up. I didn’t end up breaking out from any of these products either which is very important to me as I am prone to breakouts. Although I like the idea of a cleansing balm rather than a standard cleanser, it just didn’t deliver when it came to removing makeup. I tried it on both light and heavy makeup days and it was not great at breaking down my foundation, concealer and eye makeup. My least favourite product of the trio was the micro peel. It was very apparent that this product is a gimmick and instead of removing dead skin as the product claims to do, it was just product balling up when it was applied to my face. I didn’t notice any major positive changes in my skin after using these products for over a week. Overall this is a decent kit if you’re looking for something that won’t break you out and gets the job done but I think there are better kits out there. Not the worst but ..
