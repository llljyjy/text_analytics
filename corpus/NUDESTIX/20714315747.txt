Such a lovely cream! The scent is so unique, but very pretty and it doesn’t linger. It doesn’t burn or sting. I only wear it at night, so can’t comment on wearing it under makeup. But I can say that when I slather this on at night, my skin is so soft and dewy when I cleanse in the morning. I have noticed some redness has gone down, especially around my nose. The only reason why I give it 4 stars not 5 is the price. I received this from Bzz Agent to try free and as much as I like it, it’s just too expensive to repurchase. Great night cream
