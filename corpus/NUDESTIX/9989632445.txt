I was sent this product to demo. I liked the smells! The packaging was super cute. I didn’t like the videos on how to use the products. The moisturizer was nice, as was the exfoliator. I liked how the exfoliator transformed as you used it. I was not a fan of the balm. I found it really hard to melt in, and it didn’t remove my waterproof drugstore mascara. nan
