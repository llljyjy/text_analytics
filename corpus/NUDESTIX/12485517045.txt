I loved the citrus clean balm - even though it comes out solid, it melts so quickly in your hands and does a great job removing makeup. The best product in this trio though is definitely the lemon-aid detox & glow micro peel. Itâ€™s super effective but not harsh on the skin at all. I would definitely purchase the micro peel again! nan
