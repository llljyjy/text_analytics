I received this product for testing purposes and what really caught my attention was that it has SPF in it since I’m not a fan of heavy foundation in humid weather but still have the option to use this with it if I need to. Since I have been liking a more natural glowing look lately, this product is perfect for me, it gives a glow and a nice base, nothing thick or buildable but more of a brushed dewy skin type look, and I’m really loving it. a hot summer days bff
