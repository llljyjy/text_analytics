I liked that the product is free of parabens, phthalates, sulfates SLS & SLES. Compared to other moisturizers it it is a bit more on the tacky side. It is moisturizing and my skin does feel brighter. It worked well as a makeup primer under my pressed mineral powder foundation. The scent is nice and light and not overpowering. Overall it was a decent moisturizer, the only con is that the texture is slightly tacky. nan
