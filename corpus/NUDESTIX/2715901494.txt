I was gifted this in exchange for a review - and was SO excited to try it! Citrus Clean balm - I don’t prefer makeup “melt“ products but this was a decent one. As someone who has sensitive eyes, the fragrance was an issue, and I would not use regularly.Citrus C Mask and Daily Moisturizer - Loved it so much, made my skin soft and the smell was pleasant (and I say that as someone rather sensitive to smells).Lemon aid detox and glow micropeel - surprisingly loved this product, though was a bit harsh on my combination skin.Would overall recommend as someone who has combination, sometimes sensitive skin. The moisturizer I will be purchasing. Pretty Good!
