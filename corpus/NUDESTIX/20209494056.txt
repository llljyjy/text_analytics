I’ve been using this product for about a week now and I’ve noticed a difference in my skin! My skin appears to have a nice glow and it is incredibly smooth! The scent is not overwhelming at all which I was previously concerned about! It’s a bit pricey but we’ll worth it considering it can be used as a mask or lotion! Will definitely be buying this product in the future and would recommend to others! It’s also a bit thick in consistency so a little goes a long way! nan
