I’m usually not a fan of scented products but this one has a slight scent that is not too strong, and I do like the refreshing scent. I applied it on dry skin, it didn’t say to dampen skin or wet my face. If you haven’t used a micr-peeling product before, I suggest to apply over a sink because as you massage your skin with the product, it turns into what looks like a your skin peeling but it’s the product exfoliating and cleaning your skin. I would use this maybe 2/3 times a week because I have combination to sensitive skin. I like how the packaging is recyclable, and it a good value for the size compared to other products. nan
