In my opinion this isn’t worth it’s price. I got it free so I can say that it was nice! But I wouldn’t pay the extra money for it. The makeup remover is good, but I find oil does the job just as well. The peel just feels like it’s peeling itself if you know what I mean. Not super impressed by the peel. The moisturizer is not as thick as I like but it’s not bad. It’s a good moisturizer. The bag is very cute too, I love that these come in a case!! Overall, I would recommend it only if you have lots of money to spend and want to try something new. meh.
