I was excited to try this, but got disappointed once I used it. first and foremost, the shade didn’t match me, it was so dark it wasn’t even close to matching my skin.I have oily skin, and I’ve done a pretty good job of toning down the oil. but when I put this on, my nose and my forehead would noticeably oily instantly. I did try wearing it for the full day, and I just didn’t like how I looked with it and how it reacted with my skin. nan
