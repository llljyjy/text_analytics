I was reading the previous reviews about having an orange/red tints and I decided to give this product a try anyways. At first when you apply it, it does appear orange/red tint but give it a couple minutes and it will sink into your skin and gives you a natural finish look. This works well on my medium warm skin tone. The formula is also not greasy at all for a sunscreen and gives you a nice glow but not over the top. I love it! not greasy,  no red tint. love it!
