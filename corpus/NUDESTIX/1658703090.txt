If you love a good lemon scent, a gentle scrub and something that gives you an instant “oomph“, this is a great product to use. It is gentle enough to be used 3-4 times a week. I appreciate the fact that they claim to be using biodegradable materials for the packaging so that it is more environmentally friendly. I will be using this again! When life gives you lemons, use lemon-aid
