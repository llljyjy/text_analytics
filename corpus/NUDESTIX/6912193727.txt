I really appreciate brands coming out with more SPF products as it is so important to the health our skin and body overall! I would say this is a pretty good tinted spf if you are sure that you have chosen in the correct shade. It lasts well throughout the day, and I reapply as needed. I hope they do come out with more shades to suit a larger range of skin tones in the future. I also will warn anyone who uses this that the product will transfer if you wear a mask. Overall, I would recommend it to a friend or family member! Nice tinted SPF option
