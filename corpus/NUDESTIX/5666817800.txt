I really like this moisturizer, it has now become a staple in my daily skin care routine. I can greatly feel a difference in my skin and appearance on the day(s) when I don’t have this moisturizer on. It really helps my dry skin, especially now in the winter with all the dry air. I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin and to anyone looking for a “younger-looking” skin. nan
