I used Nudestix warm tone a few times and I truly like it. I am a big fan of clean, cruelty free products and this cream is for sure my new favourite.It gives my skin good hydration and absorbs pretty quickly. Itâ€™s a lightweight & oil free cream. I was able to apply it very quickly and easily on my face. It has green algae extract and purple tea extract which keeps my skin moisturized for longer and also keeps it soft and glowy. It also contains passion flower extract which helps to protect skin from adverse effects of UVA and UVB as well as blue light. I would surely recommend this product and will certainly buy it again.
