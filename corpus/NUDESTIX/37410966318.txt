I received this product for free for an honest review. The packaging with the pump & cap makes this product quite enjoyable to use, and overall it’s a pretty solid formula with no white cast (I do have a lighter skin tone). I also don’t have any issues with the scent compared to other mineral sunscreens I’ve tried. I think it works fine as a sunscreen and primer, and would likely work far better on dry/combo skin types, but that’s about where it stops for me. I don’t love how it feels on application, it’s just a little too greasy on my oily skin type without being moisturizing even as the day goes on, and I just don’t find myself reaching for this product automatically even though it might cut down on the number of products I’d need to use. nan
