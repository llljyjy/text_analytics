I really enjoyed this product I have been on the hunt for something to bring my skin out of it’s dull Winter funk and in to Springtime fresh. I’ve found it, this is it.This peel is so easy to use and a quick  step to insert in to you skincare routine. I added this to my night time routine 3 times a week and I am super pleased with the results. I had a few dry patches from the Winter around my cheekbone area. I found that after just ONE use, this peel helped to soften those patches and I felt like my moisturizer penetrated more than normal. My skin was so soft and supple. I can’t wait to see what my results will look like with extended use.Compared to other peels I’ve tried, I like that this one is quick to use and deliver real optimal results. Another nice feature is the fresh scent. Very pleasant to the senses and not overwhelming at all.I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future and will be recommending it to friends, family and colleagues. Smooth, Supple Skin
