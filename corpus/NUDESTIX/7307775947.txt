I love the light lemony scent of the Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro Peel!  Compared to other brands of peels I have tried, the NUDESTIX lemon detox peel is not as invasive. It has a thin, liquid texture and it is easy to use. Simply apply a thin layer on the face, lightly rub for 1-2 minutes to form little balls, scrub and rinse with warm water. It was very gentle and gave my skin a nice soft feeling!  I absolutely love this peel. I would highly recommend this product. nan
