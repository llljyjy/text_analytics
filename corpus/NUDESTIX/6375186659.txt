I have really dry reactive and sensitive skin with rosacea and I had no reaction to this cream which is rare and nice! The smell is pleasant like light citrus. I loved it as a night mask it really hydrated my skin and left it soft and smooth for the morning. I removed a star because it was a little too heavy on my skin as a morning cream I personally prefer gel creams with hyaluronic acid for daytime skincare. For the price you get a great amount of products because a little can go a long way if you apply thin layer for hydration and even if you use it as a mask you only need two pea size amount for your whole face. My face is a trainwreck in winter time and so far it helped me out. Great cream for harsh winter
