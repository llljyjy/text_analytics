I really like this product. It’s all in one with primer, tinted moisturizer, and SPF. This is exactly the kind of product I’m looking for on the days I want a little more than going barefaced. However, the shade selection is disappointing. I want a tint to help hide imperfections and normally when a product only has a couple shades, they have minimal tint and work for most people. This was unfortunately way too dark for me. I’m hoping I’ll be able to use it in summer because I did really like the formula but until they come out with more shades, I’m limited to when I can use it. nan
