I wore my Nudescreen alone with just a few dots of concealer on my spots and under eyes during a day in the sun. It gave me a nice glow all day. And the best part - great sun protection for my pale and sensitive skin! I have also used it under makeup and it works great that way too. I would definitely recommend it to a friend! I received this product as a gift through BzzAgent. Great with or without makeup!
