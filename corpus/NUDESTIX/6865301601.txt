I received this product to test. The pros: The product smells amazing! I love the scent and really wakes me up after I put it on. The yuzu really comes through. The product also very moisturizing. I have dry skin and it does work well. The con: I found the texture of the product to be really greasy. Once I had it on, it looked oily and did not sink into the skin as well as I had hoped. I like a dewy skin but when i tried to use it under make up it just made my skin too shiny and looked oily. It actually was starting to break up my make up even though it was recommended to be used under make up. My suggestion, this product should be used on it own and given time to sink into the skin properly before doing anything else. If not it just becomes too shiny. Smells Great but feels greasy
