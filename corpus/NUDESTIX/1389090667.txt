This 3 piece set is amazing! First off all 3 pieces have a very fresh, citrusy scent that I love. You start with the Citrus Clean Balm and Make-up melt. It effectively cleansed my skin removing all traces of makeup including stubborn eye makeup. There was no residue left after rinsing and all traces of the balm and makeup rinsed away easily. My skin was left feeling cleansed, hydrated and really soft. It was not tight or dry and and appeared brightened. Step 2 is the Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro Peel. This is great as a deep pore cleanser, exfoliate and skin brightener. It gently removes dead skin and impurities leaving you with clean glowing skin. The product is not harsh at all so I did not experience any reactions or redness from using this. Step 3 is the Citrus-C Mask & Daily moisturizer. I have been using this during the winter months and it’s amazing. Super hydrating and gives my skin an instant glow. During the winter I usually have to double up with moisturizer applications or add a serum as my skin gets extra dry and itchy. I have not had to do that with this. It has worked wonders for me and I’ve had zero issue with clogged pores or breakouts while using this. Absolute must for clean and glowing skin!
