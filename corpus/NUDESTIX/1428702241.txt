I originally purchased this in the tinted version “warm”. I have a medium skin tone and from the pictures this seemed the best choice for me. Wrong. Its red. So. Red. Even when I rubbed it in it still looks… almost dirty? I purchased the tint free version to mix the 2 together to tone down the “tint”. If you’re unsure, go with the tint free. I’m hoping in the summer when I am more tanned I can utilize the tinted one more. go for the tint free version
