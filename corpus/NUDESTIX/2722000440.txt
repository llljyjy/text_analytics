I have somewhat dry-normal skin type. I usually prefer very mildly scented and hydrating moisturizers for my skin. Firstly, I was really interested in the ingredients of this product as Vitamin C and turmeric are known for their brightening properties. The first time I applied this moisturizer, I did notice an instant glow. The moisturizer is on the thicker side, a little goes a long way! When you apply it your skin may appear oily at first but its gets absorbed and gives you a nice plump moisturized glow. I also tried It as an evening moisturizing mask and my skin looked soothed and rested the next day. I noticed it made my makeup last all day as well and just realized it is also a makeup primer! It also has a very soft and pleasant citrusy scent. I definitely see myself purchasing  this product again. You will not regret buying this product. Smooth and Citrusy
