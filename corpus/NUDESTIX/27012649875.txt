I have sensitive combo acne prone skin. What I liked about this sunscreen was that it didn’t give me any breakouts which is a huge plus. It’s a nice thick sunscreen that applies well and is fully transparent, no white cast (as you can see in the picture) ! It also leaves a nice glowy finish. I removed it one star because I think that this sunscreen might be a little heavy for oily/combo skin but I do think it would be amazing for dry skin since it’s on the thicker side and is moisturizing. Good but might be more suitable for dry skin
