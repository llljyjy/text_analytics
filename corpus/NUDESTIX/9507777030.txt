I received this product and I knew I would love it right away! It is very hydrating which is great if you want to use it as a primer! The ingredients are antioxidants and anti inflammatory which actually helped calm down my acne! It has a bit of a sunscreen smell but it goes away within 5 minutes. This sunscreen did not irritate my eyes or made them water which is very important to me! I would recommend this to people with sensitive skin, dry or combination acne prone skin! great ingredients and no white cast
