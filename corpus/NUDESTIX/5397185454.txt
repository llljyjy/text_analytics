This sunscreen is probably great if you have dry skin but as someone with oily skin I should have known that “dewy” would make my face look straight up wet. If it gets in your eyes there is a slight burn and there is definitely a slight white cast to begin with, I am very fair to begin with so I don’t know if it would completely go away on someone who is not as pale as me. I can say that it didn’t make me break out though. nan
