I absolutely love this moisturizer and finally have the glowing skin I’ve been trying to achieve for years! I have dry, sensitive and have struggled to find a moisturizer that helps with dry skin without breaking me out in whiteheads. I used this moisturizer twice a day in conjunction with salicylic acid cleaner from The Inkey List and noticed smoother, brighter and more even skin within a couple of days. And no more whiteheads or dry skin patches! After a few weeks it has made my skin sooo supple and it looks the best it ever has in my life. I wear makeup daily and use it as a moisturizing primer which makes my makeup settle very nicely. I personally love it’s thick consistency and slightly lemony smell. I’ve tried moisturizers from Cerave, The Ordinary, First Aid Beauty, Tatch, Glow Recipe and Tarte unsuccessfully. I did receive this product free in return for my honest opinion which I’m super thankful for because I’m not sure I would have tried it otherwise due to the price unless I received a free sample down the line or something. That being said I will definitely repurchase for life because I have been hunting for a moisturizing this amazing for a long time so I find it worth the price. A little does go along way as I’d say I’ve only used about 1/4 of it in a month. I would definitely recommend this product to others, especially if you have dry, sensitive skin.
