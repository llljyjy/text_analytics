I didn’t mind this product- but I mainly used it as a cleanser - I didn’t find that it really do anything to my skin. It didn’t feel like it was cleaning my skin, just rubbing flakes of goop around my face for 2 minutes- no tingles, redness, nothing that gave the effect that it was cleaning ‘deeply’.Made my skin soft, that’s about it. meh
