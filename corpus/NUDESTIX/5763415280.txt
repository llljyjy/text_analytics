I’ve been using my set for about two weeks now. I am a big fan on the cleansing balm and the citrus mask. They smell great and leave my skin feeling clean and hydrated. The only product I’m not huge on is the exfoliator as I don’t feel like it does much. In all, it’s a good little set to have on hand. Good Travel Set!
