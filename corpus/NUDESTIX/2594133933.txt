As far as skincare goes, these are decent products. I quite enjoyed the cleansing balm, it was gentle yet effective. It would be better if it was in a different package as it is quite difficult to squeeze such a thick product out of a tube. The peel is just okay, it does leave your skin smooth and soft, but there are better products out there. I did like the moisturizer a fair amount, but if you have oily skin lie me this is more of a night time moisturizer as you will be a bit shiny in the day. One more thing to note is that these products are quite heavily scented, especially the cleansing balm. So if fragrance is not your thing, maybe skip these guys. Overall they are just decent products. Overall Decent Products
