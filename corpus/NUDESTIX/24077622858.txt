This product is more effective when used as a night sleeping mask since it gets absorbed by skin overnight thus making it soft and glowing.I used this as a primer for which it preps my skin into a smooth base. Overall, it has good benefits but the only con is its price.I would get a similar product at drugstore which provides similar effects for less bucks.But for people who believe in branded products and vegan ingredients, I guess this would suit you.. A good sleep mask for refreshed skin
