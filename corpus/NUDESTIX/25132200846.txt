This moisturizer appears thick at first but goes on in a smooth thin layer - perfect for my daily use and to build as a mask at night for glowy, soft skin in the morning. I can’t recommend this product enough as it really helped hydrate my dry, winter skin all day without any greasy feel or breakouts! Honestly, this could really work with any skin type. I love that it has a brightening effect on my skin as well. The scent is amazing, almost citrusy and a bit spicy but disappears very quickly so it’s also great for those who like non scented products. A little goes a long way, so this product will last quite a while! A little goes a long way!
