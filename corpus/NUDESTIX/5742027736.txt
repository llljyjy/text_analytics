I was sent this in exchange for my honest review. First impressions the packaging is very cute and perfect for a to go or travel kit. They all have very nice scents and each one being different makes for a fun experience. Let’s start with the cleanser, this was probably my favourite in this kit because a little bit goes a very long way and works at getting my foundation and eye makeup off. Now for the micro peel, I wasn’t a huge fan of this because it doesn’t apply super nicely, it pills a lot and isn’t very smooth, I wouldn’t say it properly exfoliates skin either, more so just a little mask and peel effect. Now for the moisturizer, it isn’t very thick so it’s nice if you want a light barrier during the day time but I wouldn’t suggest it if you have highly dry skin. Pretty basic moisturizer. As for the kit I love the ideas however it’s nothing extra special. Pretty sub par. Good
