I have really mixed feelings about this set. The balm was nice in that it removed makeup well, but since I’ve never used a cleanser balm better (normally use my Foreo luna with a liquid/foam cleanser), it took a bit of work to massage the balm in. The peel was decent in exfoliating my skin, but it pilled quite a bit during the process and was messier compared to other exfoliators and scrubs. The moisturizer was my least favourite. The moisturizer is really thick in consistency, to the point that I found it tacky and greasy, even for my dry skin. All 3 products have a nice scent. Although I do prefer all my products to have a milder scent or be scent-free. I honestly don’t see myself purchasing this kit or any of the products separately as they don’t positively stand out against the current skincare products I currently use. Cute set, but nothing outstanding
