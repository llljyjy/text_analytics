This is the first time I’ve ever tried skincare from Nudestix! The travel bag this set comes with is super adorable and sturdy. I would say there’s about 6-10 decent sized uses per product and the first thing I noticed was the sweet and fresh scent of the products. First the Citrus Clean Balm & Makeup Melt, I felt like I had to use slightly more product than a normal balm/melt because it wasn’t as slick and oily but it still took my makeup off effectively! The Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel did leave my skin feeling smoother but I really disliked the fake pilling effect to simulate ’dead skin’ being removed from the face. I just find it to be a gimmick and the product felt effective without that feature. Lastly, the Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer was nice but nothing special. The scent is a bit too strong while applying to the face, especially for anyone with sensitivity to fragrance but it does dissipate after a while and the product soaked into my skin fairly quickly and it felt soft for the rest of the night. It’s a cute set but I don’t think I’ll be purchasing it any time soon. Cute travel set but no holy grails here!
