My skin is pretty dry in the winter so I was pretty excited to try this product. Packing was great and the smell of the product was very pleasant, however I was a little skeptic all considering I have sensitive skin and unfortunately, this product didn’t work for me. Despite the pleasant smell and creamy consistency after using this for just over a week, my skin couldn’t take it anymore. My chin and cheeks got very oily causing acne to form. After a while I stopped applying the product for a few days and my skin cleared up. Hopefully this works for someone else, but unfortunately not for me :( Great smelling product, but not for me
