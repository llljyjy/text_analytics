This is honestly the most unpleasant face product I have ever used. It pills on your face immediately on contact. I don’t know how you’re supposed to “apply as a mask all over skin“ as it forms gross giant balls on your face within 2 swipes. It smells like lemon meringue pie, but it’s just a weird and fairly unpleasant ordeal. It is also very messy as the gunky build-up gets all over your hands and face and falls all over. I can’t tell much of an exfoliating or clearing effect after the three times I’ve forced myself to use this. Thank god it was a free sample. Gross Pilling
