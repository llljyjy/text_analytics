I really enjoyed using this product. First things first, I was very appreciative to receive such an expensive sample as I do not make much money as a college student and was immediately excited to try using this product. I feel as though this left my skin feeling completely refreshed and rid of any dirt or bacteria on my face. My favourite part of this product is the smell. Even when opening the product I was very excited seeing the cute packaging and scent. Fruit citrus scents are my favourite type of scent. Fruity smell, cute peel mask!!
