The packaging is very cute, and the products are a great size for travel. It’s pretty compact so you can easily throw this into a carry-on for a quick trip. The balm worked very well to remove my make up and it didn’t leave my skin too greasy. I liked the moisturizer and my skin felt hydrated but there are other more budget friendly options out there. While I enjoyed the scent, it is very heavily scented and will not be good for people who are sensitive to strong scents or for people with sensitive skin in general (it will be very irritating).I received this product to test and provide my honest feedback. Great for Travel
