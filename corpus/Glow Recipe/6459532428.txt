I really like this SPF cream. First of all it doesn’t smell ’perfumey’ - it might have a hint of suntan lotion smell, but it’s really faint. Second this cream is NOT GREASY and disappears fast.this sunscreen is a lifesaver. Does not clog pores, does not make you breakout, doesn’t create redness, it’s super lightweight! nan
