I have been using this product and I love it! Do you suffer from tired and puffy under eyes? Well look no further, this will help with both of those things! I tend to get puffy eyes in the morning. I have been applying this when I first wake up and let it sit on my face for like 30 minutes before applying my make up. I definitely recommend. Amazing!
