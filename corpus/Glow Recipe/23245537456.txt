I received this in my Trendmood Box. I like the moisturizer but it’s not anything super innovative. I like to wear this during the day, because it wears beautifully not only by itself, but also underneath makeup. She’s lightweight and light moisturizing. I have dry skin skin, so I need something heavier at night. I love this and the package. You. NEED. This. Now.
