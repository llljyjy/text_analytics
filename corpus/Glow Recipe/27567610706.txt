I  initially got this In an Ipsy box and liked it so much I bought the full size from Sephora. I have seen complaints about stickiness and pilling but I think the trick to this product is in how much you apply and how you apply it. I had this problem too until I realized I was using too much. I started just using one pump and dabbing with fingers on to dry/dull spots of my face like cheeks, forehead, and chin. less product leaves no sticky residue and dabbing the product helps absorption to stop pilling. i use it over hyaluronic acid serum and under my moisturizer. Amazing for dry/dull skin.
