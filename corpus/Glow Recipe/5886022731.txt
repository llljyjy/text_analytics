Talk about glow! I’m always looking for a good treatment or exfoliating product. I’ve been using this 1-2x weekly and am really enjoying the results. It sinks into the skin well and doesn’t feel sticky like some other overnight treatments. When I waste up I notice a soft glow and even look to my skin. I don’t enjoy heavily fragrances products before bed so I really enjoy that this is unscented! I can’t wait to see the results over time. nan
