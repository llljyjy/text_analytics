Okay so hear me out… I also experienced the piling at first BUT after some trial and error I love this. It’s really nice and cooling and I like that it’s SPF 50. What made the biggest difference for me was squeezing the sunscreen out on my hands and then applying it to my face. I have only experienced the piling when I applied it directly to my face nan
