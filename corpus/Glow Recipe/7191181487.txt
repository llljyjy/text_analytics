This cute little strawberry is a great way to add a chemical exfoliant into a routine - a step which has done wonders for my oily, acne prone skin. This is a great combination of AHA and BHA, and the packaging is adorable and also very functional. The product is gentle and easy to apply. My only gripe is that the scent is a bit more synthetic than the other Glow Recipe products I’ve tried, and has a bit of a plastic smell. It’s very faint though, and dissipates almost immediately. Cute and effective!
