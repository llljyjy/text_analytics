I wanted to like this, as I like other Glow products. But it wasn’t that hydrating (try Milk’s lush balm). And more annoyingly, the packaging is so wasteful that easily one third of the balm is left when you roll ion the dispenser to the max leaving a ton of product to waste. The worst I have seen in a lip balm ever. Disappointed. Mediocre performance, bad packaging
