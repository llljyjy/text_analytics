I really don’t understand all the hype surrounding this product. The “glow” is VERY subtle and only lasts for about 5-10 minutes. The formula does sit well on my sensitive skin, but it’s sticky and caused several break outs! Dry patches on my face were not hydrated by the drops at all. The packaging of the product is very pretty and the drops smells yummy, but these drops have been way too overhyped- I would save your money here, really guys! Way too overhyped
