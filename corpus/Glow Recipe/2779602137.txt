This little eye cream from Glow Recipe is sooo cute! I was expecting a pot, but I love the packaging which is instead like a serum pump. The dispenser is tiny, perfect for just the right amount for both eyes. It could have been my imagination, because if there is a scent it is very light, but I felt like I smelled a hint of guava, almost like a Starburst scent. The texture of this eye cream is so delicious, a very milky cream, that absorbs immediately. Perfect for day or night, even for me that I usually do not like eye creams for fat because I get oily there, I would wear this for day under makeup. It leaves a very smooth, hydrated prime for makeup to go on top of. Itâ€™s also the perfect compact size for travel, and the packaging is the typical fun, bright style of Glow Recipe. I think anyone would love this eye cream, regardless of skin type or texture! Milky, light eye cream
