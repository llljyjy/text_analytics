This one of my newest FAVORITE serums for blackheads and oil production! It makes my skin look dewy and makes my skin feel supple and soft! My skin looks more hydrated and moisturized after applying this product. The product texture is like a thicker type of serum rather than watery. It layers well with my other products like moisturizer and spf. I will definitely incorporate this serum into my skincare routine. My skin definitely feels hydrated after use. This serum is different from other acids I have used due the the texture and level of BHA and AHA. I will definitely track my before and after results! BEST BHA AND AHA SERUM I HAVE EVER TRIED
