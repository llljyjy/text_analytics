The pictures are a before and after, with just 7 (!!!) days of use (unedited with LED lighting). I was so surprised about how effective this product is at healing the dark spots left from pimples. I have Raynaud’s and part of that affects healing time; my skin would normally heal this much after 3-4 weeks. I only apply this product one time per day, at night after cleansing. I can already tell that this is going to be one of my holy grail skincare products! The consistency is nice and the pump gives a great amount without it being too much, it is scented like most of Glow Recipe’s products, but I personally don’t mind the scent and my sensitive skin does not react to it. If you’ve been contemplating this product, I’d highly recommend trying it out. Officially a Holy Grail Product For Me
