After reading reviews of many moisturizers, I decided to go with this one! Iâ€™m OBSESSED!!! I have normal to dry skin and where I live the winters are so harsh I need something that will keep my skin hydrated! This Moisturizer is by far the best one I have used! A little goes a long way. I love that it is environmentally friendly with being able to buy the refill pods. After I tried this moisturizer I also bought the toner and I love that just as much!!! ADD IT TO YOUR BASKET!!!!
