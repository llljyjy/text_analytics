This mask got an upgrade! I prefer this to the old watermelon mask- it’s not sticky and doesn’t pill like the original formula- which were two reasons why I disliked that one. I love the addition of AHAs in the new formula to hydrate and exfoliate the skin overnight. My skin feels soft and rejuvenated when I wake up in the morning. nan
