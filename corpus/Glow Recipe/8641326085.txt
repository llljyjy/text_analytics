I got a trial size of this moisturizer and I hated it at first it made certain areas of my face flaky day one of use. As I got deeper into the bottle I fell in love with it. I don’t know if it is because I was using too little but it became a life saver even in these cold Canadian winter days. I haven’t seen a crazy plumping effect like all those other reviews are saying. It honestly just feels like a basic moisturizer with a slight dew to it. There really isn’t much more to it than this. I have been switching moisturizers lately and I feel like this one is the one for me. I’m probably going to switch moisturizers in a few months anyways lol. Also it is worth noting that I have sensitive skin and this worked for me. However, if you lean towards hypoallergenic products be careful! There is fragrance in this product it is not too strong which I like but that is something that Is worth knowing. I think those other reviews are so suspicious how did they all receive a gift card and decide to get this product? Something isn’t right Suspicious Reviews
