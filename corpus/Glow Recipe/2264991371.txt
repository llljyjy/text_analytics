I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. This is the 2nd time I use glow recipe products and I like it alot. I have combination skin. My skin is always dry during the colder months. This moisturizer truly left my skin hydrated a subtle. It left my skin glowing and it was not heavy at all. I was so content and I love that you can refill that pod which I will be doing. I will be using this product every single day as part of my skincare routine.
