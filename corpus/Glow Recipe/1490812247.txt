Wow! I have been a dedicated Clinique cleansing foam user for my daily double cleanse up until recently when a trip to a dermatologist a few months ago screwed up my skin to no end. After several months, I happened upon a sample of this product and gave it a whirl. After one use my skin was smoother, glowing and felt squeaky clean without any associated dryness. My skin just continued to heal each day I used this in my double cleanse. My fine lines have lessened and my skin is smooth while the breakouts have calmed. No allergic reaction or irritation either! The oils used here are low on the comedogenic rating too. It’s worth giving this balm a try if you’ve been struggling with your breakouts like I have. Changed my skin!
