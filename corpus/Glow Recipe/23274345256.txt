Meh. I have combo skin (the skin type the packaging recommends to use) so I had high hopes for this, but it leaves my oily areas extremely shiny and gross feeling. On the plus side, it didn’t irritate my skin and had a mild but pleasant scent. I think this would be okay for someone with dry, dull skin, but it just doesn’t work for me, so I’ll be returning it. nan
