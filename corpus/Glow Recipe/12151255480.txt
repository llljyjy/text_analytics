I had so much hope for this sunscreen, I love the texture, how light weight, and how the product feels because it reminds me a bit of an over favorite sunscreen which was discontinued years ago. But as a person who has facial hair I find it very hard to find sunscreens that work with my beard/ facial hair. On days and weeks where I’m not clean shaven, pilling happens, which I absolutely hate when I look for in a sunscreen. But on the couple days my face is cleanly shaven the product applies and sinks in well to the skin without pilling. I gave it 3 stars cause it’s great without facial hair, but not so great when I have it. Male with Facial hair opinion
