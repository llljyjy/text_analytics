The Guava Eye Cream is packed full of ingredients to brighten, hydrate, and reduce puffiness around the eye area. It has a very lightweight gel texture and is synthetic fragrance-free so there is no noticeable scent or any irritation. It absorbs nicely and wears well underneath makeup. The formula feels soothing and refreshing on the eyes. I love the adorable glass packaging and convenient pump dispenser as well. nan
