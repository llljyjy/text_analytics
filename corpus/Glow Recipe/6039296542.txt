So incredibly disappointed. I absolutely love Glow Recipe and have all of their products. I was so excited to try the new sunscreen, but was super sad that no matter what I tried it kept pilling upon application. I applied with skincare products under, allowed more time for products to dry and also tried with nothing underneath and every time I was left with little strings or balls all over my face. I unfortunately returned today. super disappointed:/
