Love this sunscreen moisturizer!! packaging is 10/10, it definitely feels more hydrating than the average sunscreen. My skin feels nice and soft after using. Smells great. I have sensitive skin and had no issues or irritation. Also, normally most sunscreen don’t work well with my makeup routine, it’ll usually comw off really easily but my makeup looked even better with this underneath it, it was so smooth and lasted all day long. Only sunscreen I have ever 100% loved!!
