I have been loving this spf. It calms the redness on my skin. It doesn’t sit on top of my face like other spfs do. The smell isn’t strong. It goes on so smooth and really sinks in. There’s no pilling. It feels so nice and I really see a difference in my skin since using this for a couple months. A little goes a long way. I have one complaint. Sometimes it makes my eyes burn a little bit. I haven’t found an spf that doesn’t burn my eyes sometimes. REALLY LIKE IT!
