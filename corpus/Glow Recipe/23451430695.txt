Glow Recipe never fails to impress me. This is going to be my another staple in routine. Itâ€™s the first aha product that does now irritate or dries out my skin. It works complete well for dry and sensitive skin. It is hydrating and gives a beautiful healthy glow. My skin feels so soft after the use. Impressive!
