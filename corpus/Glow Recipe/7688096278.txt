I love the updated version! The added hydration benefits are amazing. My skin just soaks this up. The consistency is the same as the original mask but I like this one so much better and the scent isn’t as strong. If you’re not a fan of heavy night time sleeping masks, this AHA Glow Treatment is for you! much better than the original
