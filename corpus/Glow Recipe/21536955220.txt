Finally - a face cream that doesn’t make react to my sensitive eyes and feels wonderful. For years I’ve struggled to find a face cream that doesn’t make my eyes burn all day - they are so sensitive it’s ridiculous. I’m clearly very sensitive to something commonly used in skin care products that are not clean and green.  My skin feels hydrated, happy and I have a healthy glow! At first I was putting too much on and it was pilling, so I lightened up on the amount and it’s perfect now. I’m in love with this company! Perfect for sensitive skin and eyes.
