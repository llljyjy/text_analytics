I LOVE this toner! I ordered the mini size to try it out and quickly discovered how much I adore it, and before even finishing the mini bottle, I ordered the full sized one- and I’m on my third bottle now! I find that a lot of toners make my skin sting, but I also have learned that I am developing sensitive skin as I’m aging. But NOT this one! This toner has almost a liquid jelly like consistency- not watery like all of the other toners I’ve tried. It feels super soothing on my skin and doesn’t make it feel dried out or tight, rather, I feel like I could even ditch moisturizer if I needed to. I apply it with my hands night and day. This has helped me clear my acne and soothe and refresh my skin. As far as minimizing pores, I haven’t noticed that AS much, but it definitely keeps my oil at bay! The smell is really nice, too, not super overwhelming or “sweet“, I definitely enjoy it, but if you don’t like scents, I would probably give a pass on this one. But if you can overlook the smell, this is an amazing toner. It sits really well under moisturizer and foundation. I switch products frequently, as I almost never find a product that stands out to me, but THIS is a must have in my skin care regimen and I plan to repurchase every time I run out. LOVE this toner! I'm on my 3rd bottle!
