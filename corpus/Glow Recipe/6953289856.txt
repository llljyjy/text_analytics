This eye cream has the cutest little packaging with a nice pump. There is not much of a scent at all which I really appreciate. It goes on nice and cooling and has a slight tackiness which grips onto makeup well. It soaks in quickly and goes not makeup my concealer crease. It has a light pink tint that minimizes the appearance of dark circles and really brightens! Overtime the vitamin c will also help with that. There is also niacidimide, peptides and caffeine for depuffing. Overall this is a great day time concealer! Works great!
