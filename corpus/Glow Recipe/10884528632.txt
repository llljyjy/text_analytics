This is such an amazing eye cream! I have been using this cream for over 3 weeks now and I have certainly noticed a big difference with the hydration and brightness of my undereyes. I have incredibly dry undereyes and this cream has not irritated them once! It’s thick enough to hydrate but doesn’t sit on top of the skin - inside it sinks in and brightens as well. Additionally it’s so amazing under makeup and my concealer sits beautifully. Definitely pick this up! A must have!
