This cleanser is so creamy and hydrating! It’s very different from Glow Recipe’s other cleanser, so I love both of them in very different ways. I definitely recommend this cleanser for those who want a more thorough and hydrating second cleanse. If I were to alternate, I would say Blueberry cleanser in the morning and avocado cleanser at night. A new fave cleanser!
