Unfortunately, I’m going to have to return this. I had high hopes for this eye cream, but it doesn’t do anything for my under eyes. I liked the consitency/thickness of the cream - and a little goes a long way, but I have major issues finding an eye cream that doesn’t irritate my eyes. Seems as though every eye cream I purchase has to go back. So back to the drawing board for me. Only Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream works at this point. The quest for the perfect eye cream continues...
