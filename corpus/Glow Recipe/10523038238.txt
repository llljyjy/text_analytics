Wow! Skin is super smooth! It can be a little drying so plan to double up on moisturizer the next morning. My only issue- the mini size is so small!!! And for that price? Ugh! More expensive than the OG watermelon mask. Not sure if itâ€™s 100% worth the price. really great treatment BUT super small size ugh
