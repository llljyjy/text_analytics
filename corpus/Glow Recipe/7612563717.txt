I am enjoying this very much.  This blend of sunscreens is not breaking me out the way most single formulas do.  I find it absorbs well with a little bit of patience.  I have only had a pilling issue once, and then it was only bc I had applied too much.  I applied this after my serums and in place of my moisturizer and it does a good job at both protecting me from sun and dryness.  I would definitely buy this again. Nice.
