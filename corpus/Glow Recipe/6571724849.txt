Nice for a day around the house with no other makeup on but doesn’t play well with my other beauty products or skincare regimen. Gives you a nice glowy finish and smells really good! However, it’s Shockingly priced (as most sunscreens in North America are, unfortunately..) and there is just better products out there for half the price. I would not repurchase. nan
