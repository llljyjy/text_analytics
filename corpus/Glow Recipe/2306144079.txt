If you love a glowy look, you’ll love this sunscreen! It has a lightweight texture that initially sits on top of the skin but it sinks in after a few minutes and feels weightless. I really like the light watermelon scent and found it gentle on my skin. I didn’t have issues with pilling unless I used a very thick moisturizer underneath (and didn’t give it time to sink in). A little pricey but the glow is so pretty! nan
