I was excited to have the opportunity to try this new launch of the new Watermelon Glow that replaced the old nught mask. Now I hadent had the pleasure to try the OG Mask that everyone loves so i cannot give you a comparison between the two. But with that said I can give you my thoughts on this gem. For the small amount of time I have used it I have loved it. It absorbs beautifully and works so well into my routine. It doesnt reallt smell like Watermelon like i wish it would but thats fine. The nights i use it i wake up with a beautiful glow! It really does boost your glow over night. As far as the other great benefits i will have to do an update review on the long term use of it. I love that the consistency is a little on the gel side, to me it helps thr product to go further, with only needing a little bit for your application. The jar us of course glass so it is easily recycled or re-purpused(like a propagating jar) but it is also made of recycled glass! Love that! So for my short term thoughs this is a great addition to any routine. As far as long term results, time will tell. Great Night Mask
