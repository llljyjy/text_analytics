So far, I love this stuff. I did not receive this product for free. I bought it on my own at the Sephora sale, so I hope my review helps a little bit. I have really acne prone skin that gets pretty dry. This does not dry me out. It actually gives me a little bit of moisture. Also, I have been using it at night with my watermelon dew drops, and I wake up with super smooth skin. So far, I have not gotten any new breakouts. I hope to see more progress as I continue to use this. I do wish it came with a little bit more product for the price, though. I would recommend this. Also, I don’t know if retexturizing serums like this can help with skin tags, but I’m going to see if this will help those. Super smooth skin
