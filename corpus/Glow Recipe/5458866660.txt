This changed the game for me. My t-zone is on the oily side and tends to be very textured without regular exfoliating, but I wanted something gentler than my AHA toner for everyday. This was exactly what I was looking for and is perfect to get me through the week until I use my stronger exfoliants. It isn’t sticky, it doesn’t dry out my skin at all, and it noticeably evens out the texture of my skin. It also over time (I’ve used it for months now) has helped slowly fade some residual acne scaring I had. I also love that I don’t need to use it with a cotton pad (I just use clean hands) which has helped me cut back on the waste in my routine. If I had to suggest one improvement on that front I’d maybe like a dropper or a pump just because the open top can get a tad messy, but it’s easy to look past. This is my favourite part of my skincare routine and I notice a huge difference if I go even a day without using it. Great for gently evening out texture!!
