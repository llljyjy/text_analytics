I really love this product honestly. I bought it on a whim and I have dry skin, this doesnâ€™t make my skin tight at all. Make sure to have a mist or slight dampness to skin before applying and then it dries super quick and applyMoisturizer over. Definitely like it and use it daily :)  price point is great Love it and bought on a whim
