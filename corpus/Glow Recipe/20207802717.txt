I splurged and bought this. I LOVE IT. I’ve been using it for almost a month now and use a pea amount .  it has really brightened my eyes and I use it day and night. just make sure you let it soak in for at least 3 minutes before moving on with your skin care. will buy again. minus a star because I don’t know when it’s empty. for reference I’m a white 17 year old A MUST HAVE FOR DARK EYES
