New fave night mask! This super lightweight mask made my skin feel so hydrated and glowy. The texture is a lot more watery compared to other night masks I have tried however the moisturizing power of this mask is next level! The scent is very light not very noticeable. I used this as my last step for my pm routine and my skin felt amazing in the morning. I definitely feel like my makeup looked better the days after I use this mask too. Highly recommend! New fave night mask!
