This is amazing. I always thought retinol, ahas and vitamin c were all I needed but I decided to try this as I was still having texture. I thought is was just an overpriced pretty toner but no… it has made my skin so smooth hydrated glow and poreless. Besides tretinoin, if I could only keep one product it would be this. But twice a day is too much you will get little bumps, I’d recommend using this in the PM and not in the sun during the day. WOW
