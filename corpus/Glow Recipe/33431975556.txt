It did not disappoint! I was so excited about this product launch because the Guava Vitamin C Dark Spot serum is one of my favorite skincare products, so it makes sense I would love the eye cream version. This eye cream has a delicate texture and a barely noticeable scent (yay for that). When I apply it to my under-eye area or has this cooling effect that goes away quickly.It leaves my skin hydrated and fresh looking for hours, and it doesn’t fight with my makeup. It’s a new favorite! New favorite!
