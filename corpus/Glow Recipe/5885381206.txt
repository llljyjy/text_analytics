It’s okay. Didn’t break out my combo acne prone skin, but my skin doesn’t look any different. I would use this in the morning and it gave a decent amount of moisture and didn’t mess up makeup on top. I was looking for overall brightness, and helping with some acne dark spots. I am almost finished with the bottle and didn’t notice a difference in my skin. The pump doesn’t get all of the product out so for the rest of the time I have it I’m taking the top off and trying to get it out that way. Won’t be repurchasing. Not worth the price tag
