This is another fantastic launch from Glow Recipe! It sinks in quickly so it’s perfect on those mornings where I’m in a rush and don’t have much time to allow my skincare to sink in before I need to start applying my makeup. It’s best for me in the mornings but I do also use it at night with an additional eye mask since my under eyes get pretty dry. Perfect for makeup prep!
