The first night I used this, I felt a very slight tingle/burn, which honestly just tells me it’s working. I continued to use it and didn’t feel that feeling again, but my skin has improved. I can see smoother, more hydrated skin. It also feels plumper, which I’m surprised because the product itself is so thin. I was gifted this product. Does what it says!
