I had been using a liquid exfoliator for a few years and wasn’t a fan of how harsh it was tho I knew that I needed that step in my skincare since all acne breakouts had stopped after using an aha/bha product. I got the 14 day trial of this and replaced the liquid exfoliator with this serum and WOW!! This does the exact same job (maybe even better) and isn’t harsh on my sensitive skin. I love the strawberry smell but I know there are ppl out there that don’t like that. I personally think it’s really nice and refreshing. If toners and liquid exfoliators are too harsh for you but you still need something in your routine to do the job, I think you should definitely try this. This will be a permanent step in my routine from now on. Perfect gentle exfoliation that smells amazing
