I have been using Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pore-Tight Toner for a couple of weeks and I feel like my skin looks a little brighter after use. I enjoy the smell, but wish it didn’t have added fragrance. It’s the last ingredient listed, so it doesn’t appear to contain a lot so I still feelComfortable using. I don’t notice my pores looking smaller, but will continue to use. I like that despite having acids for exfoliating, it doesn’t make my skin drier than it already is. nan
