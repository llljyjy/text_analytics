I love this product so much! I got a trial size and love the feeling on my skin. It feels so plumped and hydrated the next day! Big improvement on skin texture too. My only issue, while the jar is super pretty, I would have preferred to have this product in a pump bottle. The texture is a runny serum, and I find it annoying to grap with my fingers or a spatula. It kind of ruins the experience for me. But itâ€™s a solid product that anyone could benefit from. I had no sensitivity issues while using my trial size. Great product, wrong packaging
