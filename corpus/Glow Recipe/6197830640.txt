I wanted to love this product so much. I had friends show me their amazing results and timelines with this progress and noticed such amazing changes for them. Being hopeful, I bought it for myself and I know I have sensitive skin and deal with a 2 week adjustment period for any new skin care but… this one just isn’t for me. After 4 weeks of trying, my skins been in the worst shape of its life and there’s no sign of that changing any time soon. I have pimples EVERYWHERE on my face and I never get breakouts like this or even pimples that often.The reason I left it with 3 stars is because I do know it’s an amazing product, I’ve seen it work wonders on my friends skin and to be honest, I do notice a difference in my pores but for me, it’s not worth it with the breakout I’ve been having. If you have sensitive skin, maybe not the best product for you, but if you don’t, give this a try! It’ll work wonders! Good product but not for me…
