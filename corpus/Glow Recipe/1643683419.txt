I used to be a Glow Recipe junkie, I’m talking I owned everything they sold and immediately bought every new release from them. Then I realized there were better options out there and cheaper comparable (and sometimes better) alternatives…..but this? It’s special special. I mean I have used Ordinary and Inkey’s Niacinamide and both do what they should skincare wise, they are both missing what this does to your skin. I swear it’s one of 3 skincare items I will NEVER stop using daily. It leaves your skin dewy without being oily, and this is coming from an oily girl. Is the price a little steep? Yes, but it’s their only product I can honestly say is 100% worth it. nan
