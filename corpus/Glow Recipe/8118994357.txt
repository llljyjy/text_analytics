I love the gel consistency of this eye cream it makes it glide on so perfectly. I apply this after toning with my pore tight toner. My eyes are instantly hydrated after applying it’s literally like a glass of water for your eyes! I’ve noticed after using it for 2 weeks my under eyes have a much brighter appearance. I love using it first thing in the morning and after it’s had time to absorb in I’ll go for a light makeup look. I highly recommend if you want to look like you’re glowing from within! nan
