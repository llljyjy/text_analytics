My skin is combination-oily and products with BHA + AHA definitely do wonders for my skin when congested so no surprise that this product has climb its way to the top of my must haves. I love how hydrated my skin feels after using, and that it is not harsh. I noticed after using my skin had a more glow and vibrant appearance that I am definitely here for. I also love the light strawberry scent, its not over powering but very pleasant. nan
