I’ve been really blessed throughout my life to have clear skin, so acne and blemishes have never been an issue for me.  I do however struggle with really bad dry skin, so I’m always on the lookout for hydrating skincare products that soothe it and smooth over the rough patches. This serum is amazing at doing just that! I have noticed an insanedifference in how smooth and hydrated my skin feels since I started using it, and it’s even helped to reduce some of the fine lines on my face (an added bonus for me!). Not to mention it smells AMAZING! You need to try this serum right now! nan
