The texture feels more like a gel than cream to me, which helps my eye area feel hydrated.  For the past 2 weeks of using this product, I’ve noticed a huge difference in brightness. Compared to other eye creams that I’ve tried, this one doesn’t seem as thick or watery. More of an in between, which is like a breath of fresh air, something that’s been needed! When it comes to pairing with my concealer there is no piling either, or dryness. I will continue using this daily as it is now a staple in my regime. nan
