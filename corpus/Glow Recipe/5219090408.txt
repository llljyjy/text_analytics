I really love this product! My skin loves BHA and AHA, so I had a feeling I would like the results. I wasnâ€™t expecting the light scent (which I adore by the way), nor was I expecting to love the texture - light gel texture that leaves the skin moisturized without feeling sticky. I can definitely see myself repurchasing this one! Works well with makeup, and gentle enough that I can use it everyday. Love! love this!
