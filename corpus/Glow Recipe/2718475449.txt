I love this toner! It’s super smooth and makes my skin feel amazing. I will say, there is a strong watermelon scent so if you are sensitive to smells, I would choose a different toner. The texture is the slightest bit sticky and gooey, but I love that feeling because it actually sticks to your face and doesn’t make it feel wet. It makes your skin feel super smooth! My pores are noticeably smaller after only a few uses nan
