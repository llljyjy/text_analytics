I used this last night and woke up this morning with clear and hydrated skin. My skin feels smooth and looks a little bit brighter. The product is light but not super watery and absorbs quickly, without disturbing the other skincare products I use. Compared to other AHAs I’ve used this one is really gentle. I will probably use it a few times a week as it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Love it! nan
