Where do I even start... for starters, it’s like a serum, face mask and a moisturizer all in one. It’s a gel like texture and when it goes on it’s very “wet“ but give it 3-5 minutes and it dries completely so you don’t have to worry about it getting all over your pillow. It’s GREAT for dry skin. It feels super moisturizing and you’d never know it’s actually secretly exfoliating over night, purely because there’s no visible flaking or peeling.... but I wake up with my skin feeling SO fresh, 20x softer and glowy AF, so obviously it’s doing something. I like to try multiple products and as a result don’t have a huge “holy grail“ collection but you best believe this is one that is ABSOLUTELY in it. Like brb, going to buy this for all of my friends b/c I don’t think there’s a better way for me to show my love. The ONLY callout I have is you’ll need a face mask spatula to stir it up properly before using. #1 favourite face product
