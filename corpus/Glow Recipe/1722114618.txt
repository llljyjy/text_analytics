I really like this spf.  It doesnâ€™t make me look oily or matte.  I do sometimes mix this with my morning moisturizer so it would spread evenly.  You do have to reapply in order to have the effect of barrier from the sun.  Little goes a long way.  This tiny bottle can last me 2-3 months using it everyday. no white cast
