I have really enjoyed using Glow Recipe’s Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream. It contains 3% Niacinamide, 10% encapsulated vitamin c complex, guava fruit extract, and peptides with green caffeine to visibly fade discoloration in your eye area, and brighten and de puff for a more firm appearance. I don’t get a lot of sleep lately being 9 months pregnant and having a toddler who wakes me throughout the night so my dark circles are very prominent at the moment. The formula is lightweight and wears well under my eye makeup. The eye area does feel firmer and looks brighter after application but I still have pretty dark eye bags when not using.
