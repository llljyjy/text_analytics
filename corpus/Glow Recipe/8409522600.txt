I first purchased the original Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Sleeping Mask a couple years ago and LOVED how hydrated my under eyes felt, and noticed a visible difference in the fine lines starting to form around my eyes. I literally saw it reverse the lines starting to appear! When I finished it I tried going back to Sephora to repurchase and found out Glow Recipe no longer makes it and only had this eye cream available so I thought it’d be the same formula. Unfortunately I’ve been using this cream for over half a year now and it seems to not be as moisturizing. I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my fine eyes, and every time I apply it, it seems to pull at my skin instead of gliding like it used to. I’m not sure what they changed in the ingredients/formulation from the eye sleeping mask to the eye cream but please bring it back! This new formula is not nearly as good as before. The old formula also came with a small spatula to scoop the product out and this one doesn’t. Luckily I saved the spatula from the original so I’m still using that. I really like Glow Recipe formulas so I’m not sure why they decided to change this one :/ For the price, I would expect it to have the same quality and effectiveness as the original formula. When I’m done with this product I won’t be repurchasing due to price and ineffectiveness. Prefer old formula!
