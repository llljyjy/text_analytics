I really enjoyed using glowrecipe broad spectrum spf 50 lotion.  It is so good.  Yo get glowy, hydrated and protected skin, It blends so easily into the skin  and no white cast.  Works well on mature skin and it gives it that hydration boost.it can be worn alone or under makeup.  Has great ingredients too!  Ive been using this product daily & you can see it on my bare skin on instagram. Love it ! Yes to glowy hydrated skin
