This eye cream is so good. I love the little component that it comes in, it looks good on my vanity. This eye cream has a light creamy like texture. It also is pink in color with a pearlescent hue. I noticed when I applied the eye cream for the first time my under eye was instantly brighter. The cream helps to hydrate my under-eye so well. I also want to mention that I apply this before applying makeup and I have no issues, it layers well. A little goes a long way. I use a half-pump for both under-eye areas. I find myself mainly using this as a morning eye cream as it layers so well under other products and adds that brightening effect. Glow Recipe does it again
