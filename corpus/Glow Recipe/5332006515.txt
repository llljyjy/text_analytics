I always wanted to try from glow recipe and luckily I got that chance to try their sunscreen. It’s just wow I haven’t tried anything like it. The sunscreen feels so light not like those available in market more like glowy hydrating moisturizer but in sunscreen. I highly recommend to try this. I absolutely love it!! A Must have
