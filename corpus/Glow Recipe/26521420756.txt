This stuff is amazing! One of my absolute favorite products to use. I have very dry skin and ever since I started using this, the avocado cream, and the plum plump moisturizer, my skin has felt so good and soft, I’ve had no dryness! Yes, these few drops can make your skin feel a little sticky, but I feel it helps make up stay on even better because of that and if you do it at night, you wake up the next day and it’s not sticky like that. To each their own, I don’t mind it, it’s not overly sticky. I love this stuff… I’m super glowy!
