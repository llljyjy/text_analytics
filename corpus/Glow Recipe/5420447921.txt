I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  This is a great cleanser for those that have sensitive skin. It does foam up a little bit after applying but was easy to wash off. It didnâ€™t leave my skin dry or irritated after use. My face felt clean and ready for my normal skincare application. I love that this comes in a travel size so I can take it on trips. nan
