I love a leave-on overnight mask and this one from Glow Recipe is very nice! It has a viscous, syrupy consistency that glides on easily and dries down nicely (unlike other overnight masks that remain sticky). After the first use, my skin felt noticeably smoother and less irritated. I struggle with acne and the spots I had became a bit less red/inflamed. I appreciate that, despite being an exfoliating mask, this product did not damage my skin barrier. nan
