this balm is so good! i’ve tried clinique, and it was average. this one is like the perfect middle ground between green clean and clinique, with a beautiful sorbet texture. it has the ability to remove heavy makeup, but is nourishing enough for daily use. i took one star off because i  don’t love the smell like most people do, but it does not irritate my eyes! beautiful, effective cleansing balm!
