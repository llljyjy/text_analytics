Oddly enough, this moisturizing spray dries out my skin so much I have to stop use and lather aquaphor to stop the dryness. I was thinking maybe its allergies and stop using but the moment I stopped using the ezcema flare up (I’ve never had eczema before) stopped. I waited a few weeks and tried again and once again my skin immediately starts to feel extremely dry and cracks. I’ve tried other Glow Recipe products and found them hydrating but this is a no from me dawg. Smells refreshing, dries out skin.
