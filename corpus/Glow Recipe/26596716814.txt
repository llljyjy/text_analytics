This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried! Absolutely amazing! The whipped, bouncy gel cream texture is gorgeous and sinks right into the skin, and as is typical of Glow Recipe it gives a gorgeous, yet natural, glow to the skin. I was at first hesitant upon hearing “gel-cream”, as that is often a key word for oily skin and supremely lightweight formulas, but this is a true gel cream, not a barely there gel. It is perfect for my combination skin. It does have fragrance, so if you have a fragrance sensitivity/allergy, I would avoid, but if you are someone who is just not a big fan of fragrance in beauty products, I would totally recommend. I personally don’t like fragrance, but this one is barely there. It’s hard to describe, but I would say it smells subtly light and sweet, with the barest hint of plum, plus it fades quickly. Not as strong as that of the watermelon glow toner (although I actually love that fragrance as well). Only problem is it DOES NOT FILL UP THE PACKAGING! It’s great that Glow Recipe does refills for their products, but I honestly think it’s just a tactic to trick consumers into thinking they’re getting more product for the price, because the refill pod is significantly smaller than the glass jar. I would still fully recommend though, it’s worth all the hype! Amazing! refill pod smaller than jar though
