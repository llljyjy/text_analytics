I spend on big ticket items here for moisturizer and wanted to at least give this a try. As soon as a smelled the watermelon I said- I’m gonna be paying for this. Used it once- still breaking out weeks later in areas that aren’t even problem areas. It did not give a dewy finish or glow at all. It does not absorb into the skin like the higher end products us older women are accustomed to. It just sits on top and gives a… weird residue. By far the worst product I’ve ever tried. I’ll stick to my high end night cream and my daily use of that drugstore brand recommended by dermatologists everywhere. Don’t even attempt it. Not for 30’s and up or acne prone skin
