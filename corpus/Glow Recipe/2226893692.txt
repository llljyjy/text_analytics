Ok but for real let’s talk about this product. First and foremost the smell is chefs kiss. It’s a dewy texture when you apply it to the skin and it makes it nice and tacky. I follow it up with my favorite moisturizer and I’m good to go. Highly recommend this as an addition to your night time routine. nan
