Glow recipe never disappoints but This serum/lotion type textured eye cream is so hydrating. My eyes looked brighter & felt hydrated for sure and I’ve been using this for quiet some time. Using this under my makeup worked well also and it never made my under eye cakey so it’s a perfect add on to your skincare routine. There’s no burning the under eye from this product so that’s also amazing. I use it morning & night in my skincare routine so I’m a happy camper. I received this glow recipe eye serum in return for my honest review. nan
