I’ve been such a sunscreen junkie after battling acne for so many years, I have to give this one a try because I love the brand and I’m into glowy skin, I don’t wear makeup everyday, let me first say that the smell is amazing, it doesn’t have that typical sunscreen scent! Smells like watermelon !!! It is very lightweight and applies easily, doesn’t leave any white residue and this is a plus ! Most of the time I wear moisturizer and sunscreen and I have got compliments on my glowy skin ! Absolutely in love with this ! My new go to sunscreen
