I recently discovered the magic of Glow Recipe and this face wash is no exception. My skin feels so soft and hydrated. It has a jelly-like consistency and I was surprised at how much it lathers when I activate it in my hands. Very gentle and not drying (for me). My skin just feels clean after I wash - not dry and tight. I follow with the products from the Fruit Babies collection and the skin is SKINNING! The Skin is SKINNING!
