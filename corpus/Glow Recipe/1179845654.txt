I bought this for my face but decided to try it on my KP on my upper arms. WOW! It works like nothing else, and I’ve tried everything else with zero results. It worked to reduce the little bumps and smooth out my skin’s texture. I treat morning and night followed by the watermelon body cream. This is a winning combination for me. GR should market for this purpose. It also works great on my face. I no longer have visible pores on my chin or nose and my blackheads have completely disappeared! My skin looks like glass. Never stop making this stuff! Works for KP!
