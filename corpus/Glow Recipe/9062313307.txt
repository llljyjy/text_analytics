Would give 0 stars if I could… had high hopes based on online reviews, YouTube, and tik tok. I bought the sephoras favorites mini sunscreens and this came in the package. I was so excited to try and so disappointed lol. First layer was okay, no pilling and a slight glow. However, I felt like I hadn’t applied enough so I went in for a little more… and what a disaster omg. It basically rolls off the skin lol. Like whole big chunks were just rolling off my skin. Couldn’t imagine having to apply a second later in a few hours while I’m at work. Felt like a feverish dream- I’ve never experienced anything that dramatic before lol! So don’t recommend unless you want it to roll off your skin every time you accidentally touch your face the worst pilling I have ever experienced
