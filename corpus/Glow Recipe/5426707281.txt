Got this product as a sample size through Sephora and could just tell my skin took to it so well right away. I have rosacea and niacinimide is a really great ingredient for me but this formula comes on super smooth/not sticky. Really recommend - makes your skin look like glass and helps ease any irritation. Highly recommend
