I complimentary received watermelon night treatment from Glow recipe and im obsessed with it . I apply it for a night and in the morning my skin was glowing! The gel texture makes it easy to apply, leaving my skin super hydrated, bouncy, smoother and glowy! It doesnâ€™t have strong scent which I LOVE! I definitely recommend to try it! im in love
