Iâ€™ve been in the hyaluronic acid game for a while now, but have found my skin starting to pill recently with the La Roche-Posay serum. I decided to try this out thanks to all the hype on tik tok and I absolutely love it. My face feels plump and clean, and very dewy. It does have a somewhat sticky feel before it sets in which I personally like as a makeup primer. Every morning I wash my face, use 2 pumps of this, and then put my sunscreen on. Will become my new staple product! My new staple product!
