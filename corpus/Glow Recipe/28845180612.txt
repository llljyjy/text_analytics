I really wanted to like this product, but I feel like I have to use so much of it to cover my face and neck. For a moisturizer this expensive, I would expect a little to go a longer way. I also really don’t love the smell, it smells like a cheap product intended for children. It’s fine, but I will definitely not be rebuying. Disappointed
