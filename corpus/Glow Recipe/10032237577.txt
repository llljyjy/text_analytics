Iâ€™ve been using this strawberry smooth serum for about two weeks and I really like it.  It has a cream  like consistency and is quickly absorbed into the skin. Upon application i immediately feel my skin gets soft which is extremely impressive and it pairs nicely with other serums as well as my everyday moisturizer nan
