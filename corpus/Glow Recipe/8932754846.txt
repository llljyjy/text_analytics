To start I have combo skin that is sensitive so when covid hit I dropped makeup but also dropped skin care and it showed so when the masks came off I realized my skin needed some help lol I saw that this brand was getting really good reviews and I liked the sound of the ingredients so I gave it a try and in just a couple of weeks the dullness in my face was gone and I look so glowy and alive love this brand can’t wait to try more products can’t recommend more Love love love
