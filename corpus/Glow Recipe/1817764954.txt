This makes my skin feels so soft, hydrated, fresh in the mornings. I used over other two serums - It layers great with these other two products.  I apply this 2-3 times a week. The smell is great, not strong at all. The consistency is very uniqueâ€¦ like a gel but lighter. I definitely recommend it. Amazing overnight treatment!
