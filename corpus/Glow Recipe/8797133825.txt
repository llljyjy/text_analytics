As a huge fan of glow recipe, I was so excited they launched this new formula of the sleeping mask! The first night I tried it my skin was a little red and more oily than it usually is in the morning. The second morning however I could tell my skin was a bit smoother and hydrated/plump. (there wasn’t any redness as well!) I can’t wait to continue using this and see more improvement in my skin :) Amazing!
