I got this as a sample and was immediately impressed with how hydrating this toner was. After more and more use I saw a noticeable difference in my pores. I’ve now been using it for over a year. It’s become a favorite product. In my experience, if you are not consistent with its use daily, blackheads will come back so be sure to stay on top of your routine. Amazing results if you use it consistently
