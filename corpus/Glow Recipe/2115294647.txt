I really liked this lotion a lot. Smell is lovely and light, feels very moisturizing but my skin didn’t love all the acids. The center of my face, nose, checks all turn red and felt like they were mildly sunburnt. I don’t consider my skin to be sensitive. Looking to find a similar texture and smell without all the acids. A lovely lotion, but made my checks red
