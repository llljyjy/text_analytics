I am in love with the cream. I received the small size in a travel pack and didn’t use it until I went on vacation. After a couple days I couldn’t believe how great my eyes looked. I forgot I was using something new. When I got home I looked in my lighted magnified mirror and it was shocking how much change I had in two weeks. It takes months of regular use to see change with cosmetic grade products- right? No. I purchased the full size and I use it day and night. It works perfectly under makeup. My eyes are firmer and less lined than they have been in 10 or more years. People use HG a lot, but this truly is my eye care HG. Keep in mind I’m 52 and used no filter in my photos. found my saving Grace
