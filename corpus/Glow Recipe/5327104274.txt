I was hesitant to try this product as a lot of sunscreens under makeup do not mix. However, I can say wearing this sunscreen under foundation and concealer did not cause any difference in the appearance of my makeup which I absolutely love! The watermelon smell is divine. I would definitely repurchase! nan
