I donâ€™t consider myself to have sensitive skin, but this product caused me to have one of the worst breakouts. There is so much fragrance in it, that even with double cleansing it still clogged my pores. It removes makeup, but there are better options out there for the same or cheaper price. Too Much Fragrance!
