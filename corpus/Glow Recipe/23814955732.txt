I love this!!! My skin is tricky as it is acne prone, sensitive and  dry.  I’m also in my 30s and dealing with signs of aging.  It’s hard to find something to help with breakouts that doesn’t dry me out, and this has worked wonderfully.  I only use it at night, and I alternate as I don’t want to use acids every day to avoid over exfoliation. My skin is definitely looking clearer and smoother.  I also love the smell and texture, and I really look forward to using it.  It’s pricey but worth it to me!!! I am always looking up reviews for products before buying but have been lazy about writing them myself, but this inspired me.  Definitely a repurchase for me. Works for my dry, sensitive, acne-prone 30s skin!
