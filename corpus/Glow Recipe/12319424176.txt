I really enjoy this product! I have combination skin, i use it like3 times a week at night and it just gives my skin the perfecthydration and moisture. This product claims that it helps withpores but i’m not too sure it’s actually helping my pores. Theymight have minimized a little but nothing too crazy. It doesn’tbreak me out and i mostly buy it because i love the moistureit gives my skin. Yes it’s pricey but i only buy it when it’s onsale. Also the smell is amazing. nan
