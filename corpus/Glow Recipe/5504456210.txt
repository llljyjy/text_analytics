If you have sensitive skin this product is for you. It’s the most gentle AHA I’ve ever tried. It doesn’t give me a tingle like most AHA products do, it absorbs and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling.  I use this at night and my skin feels smooth and slightly bright. It has a slight scent to it.  I would have liked if it came with a pump dispenser rather than a jar. Gentle AHA
