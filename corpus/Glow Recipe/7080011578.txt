I love chemical exfoliators and Glow Recipe so I was pumped when I was gifted this by them. Overall, it seemed like a more gentle version of an AHA exfoliator than compared to other brands I’ve tried. It left my face feeling moisturized and slightly tingly after application, then in the morning when I woke up it felt pretty normal. I’m definitely going to keep using this product and recommend it to others. nan
