I love everything about this serum. My skin can handle a lot, but it is clear when a product agrees with it. This product has a thicker milky texture that goes on so nicely and sinks into the skin. My complexion looks so healthy and brightened right after application and also the next day. It can be used day and night, but I prefer products like this to work at nighttime. However, I like how my skin looks so much that I might have to try it during the daytime too. I will say that it is smaller than expected but you only need a small amount anyway. The scent is very light and itâ€™s not quite strawberry, more like strawberry chapstick but pleasant. effective and cute
