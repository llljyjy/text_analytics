When I tell you I’ve tried EVERYTHING for my dry, acne prone skin I mean it. I was an ulta employee for a long time and I feel as though I tried everything there was on the market. This changed my skin after only a week of using it so far. My skin is hydrated, not a single pimple and glowing. It’s a gel consistency and melts into the skin without being sticky but it still leaves you with a beautiful glow and a hydration literally unlike anything I’ve ever used before. I work in an extremely dry air office and when I apply in the morning I’m moisturized until I leave 10 hours later. I use this with the watermelon dew drops and plum plumping drops mixed together before I apply and my skin has never looked or felt better. Thank you glow recipe bc I will never be able to live without this moisturizer!! nan
