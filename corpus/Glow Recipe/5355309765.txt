I thought it was a wash off mask but it’s actually a sleeping mask with 2.5% pH-balanced AHA complex (a blend of glycolic and lactic acid)Having sensitive skin, I’ve kind of come to enjoy it like a wash off mask a few times a week though! Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box with your skincare. There’s almost multiple uses for everything! Anyway, it’s good stuff. Try it as a mask too!
