I LOVE this product. It has really been a game changer when it comes to texture and tiny blackheads/congested pores across my cheeks. It worked quickly and efficiently, and has a beautiful texture. The smell is also not sickly sweet-in my opinion. Fragrance doesn’t irritate my skin but does give me headaches sometimes and this product did not do that. My only complaint is the packaging. I feel like I still have a good two weeks worth of product left but my pump is having a really hard time getting it out. I really don’t want to unscrew and pour it but I definitely think I will have to. If this could be fixed it would easily be five stars. Absolutely holy grail for me, even with the annoyance of the pump. Perfect Product, Packaging Needs Update
