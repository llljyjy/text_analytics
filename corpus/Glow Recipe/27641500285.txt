this cream is one of the only ones that make me feel hydrated afterward and not that my skin feels tight. I like the texture and the idea of the pump and the smell makes you feel like it’s summer! The product’s packaging is so aesthetic and cute, but when the product is nearing its end, it’s something else. Given the shape of the pot and the pump does not go to the bottom, it’s another story to have the cream taken in the product. You see that you can no longer take out any product but that there are plenty left, then for the price you want to have the full product that you paid for at like $50 ca for 60 ml it’s like $1.2 the ml. But despite that, I love it nan
