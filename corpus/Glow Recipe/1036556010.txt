This new cleanser felt wonderful on my skin, especially since the weather has been so cold. It makes the perfect amount of foam, washes away easily and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight. Like the other avocado products, it has a mild and gentle scent. It paired great with my papaya cleansing balm and removed all of my makeup. This is a luxurious feeling cleanser and I highly recommend it. Another winner from Glow Recipe! Great cleanser for the winter
