I love Glow Recipe products but this one kinda let me down. It sets really quickly and when it’s set, it starts to pill when disturbed. I’ve got a work around with sectioning my face to apply but it’s finicky where the sections meet and it wants to peel again :( It’s got such a high spf and I want to love it because I love this brand but it’s lack luster. Don’t think I’ll buy again. I’ve also tried, after adding in sections, let it set and pill as it needs to, then follow up with the Clinique Hydrating Jelly to kinda melt it down and spread it without further pilling. I don’t know what this does to possible thinning of product though so...idk. Also, I don’t wear foundation so the slight cast it leaves and peeled spots are noticeable if I don’t follow up with the jelly. My skin is mostly normal to combo, T-zone and all that, and I have a fair complexion. Glow Recipe WHHYYYYYY??!! :,(
