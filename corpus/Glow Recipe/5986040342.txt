I have oily skin just to preface this review. I have spent the past 3 days attempting to get this sunscreen to work for me and it pills TERRIBLY. I am not sure if my cerave moisturizer is the issue so today, I made sure to wait at least 20 minutes after moisturizing to apply this sunscreen. I checked my face prior to jumping on a work call and thank goodness I did. I had streaks in certain areas where the product failed to absorb and I was pilling particularly bad in the area of my mouth, nose and chin. Reading other reviews, it appears that my issue is very common. This also does have a decently strong sunscreen scent (if you are bothered by such a smell) despite some watermelon undertones (typical Glow Recipe scent). I find that this does leave a white cast for quite some time so if you are darker or worried about a cast, I would not recommend this item.I am really sad as I was hoping to be able to use this on the go. For almost $50CAD, it is very pricy to be having this many issues. As I hate returning items I will keep it and use it for when I’m WFH and sitting by a window. But I definitely would not be using this for a night/day out or an event. Not sure there is anything for me to do to salvage this. I note some have made recommendations but for this price point, you shouldn’t be required to use Harry Potter level magic to make something work. White cast, pills terribly; not recommended for $.
