I FREAKING LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Grateful I received this as a gift as I don’t think I would’ve purchased it at first. I was scared the watermelon scent might be too harsh for my skin but to my surprise there’s barely a scent. Legit next day of application, my skin felt so so so soft. I was SHOOK. this product is truly amazing. I use it as last step after moisturizer. Amazin
