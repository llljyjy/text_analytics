I have been using this in my nighttime routine for about one week now. I like it. The smell is fruity - I don’t mind since It doesn’t linger. I have noticed a difference in my skin for the better. I try and concentrate this serum on my T-zone, where I have problems, and I have noticed that my pores are looking reduced. Seems like a nice clean serum to try. I would recommend to my friends. Good stuff
