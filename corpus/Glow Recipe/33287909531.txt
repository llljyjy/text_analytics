I’ve been using this for a bit and it’s very hydrating, my skin is brighter and plumper, it works well for my dry sensitive skin and I use this in the winter the only problem I find is that the consistency of this moisturizer is lightweight and maybe not give you the moisturized feeling you want but besides that, it’s great 100% do try! Good but more towards Combo Skin Types.
