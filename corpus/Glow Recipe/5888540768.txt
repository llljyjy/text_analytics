First off the packaging is super cute and the smell is pretty unique to this product. However, I did not see many long term effects from using this. The texture is really nice and it absorbs well into the skin, but I don’t think it’s worth spending $40 regularly. It’s a nice little pick me up though if you’re wanting to try something new! decent serum
