When my skin is really irritated I like to use the Avocado Cerimide Recovery Serum. SO, I was excited to try this new cleanser, because I recently started using a derm grade retinoid that had my skin feeling rather sensitive. It is almost like a cream cleanser, but it lathers nicely and leaves skin feeling clean and moisturized when you rinse. My face definitely felt nourished with regular use. Only downside was the scent. I wouldn’t say the product is scented, but it does smell a bit unpleasant. I have a crazy strong sense of smell though, most people probably wouldn’t notice anything.
