Okay so first off, Glow Recipe does the best job at making the cutest packaging!! The bottle looks like a little strawberry which is obviously so fitting. Secondly, my skin feels AMAZING after using this! I have really sensitive skin so I have to be really careful with acids, but this one doesnâ€™t make my face burn or give me dry patches like a lot of them do. Highly recommend!! Strawberry Dream!!
