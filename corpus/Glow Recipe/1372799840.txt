I bought this in January and am just now getting to the end of it with 3-4x a week use, so this can last for a while for the price. I’m not sure if it’s because I applied it to my entire face and this is better as a spot treatment, but I really only noticed it making my skin look nice and bright immediately after applying. I haven’t had any actual long term noticable effects from using this unfortunately. It feels nice to put on but other than that I’m not really sold on purchasing this again. :-( nan
