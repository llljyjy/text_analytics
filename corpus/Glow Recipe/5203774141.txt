I wanted to love this product so bad. I’ve given it so many chances and it’s very inconsistent. Pros: blends in easily, minimal white cast, delicious scent & leaves a nice dew. Cons: it pills most of the time :/ sometimes I’m lucky and can avoid the pulling but the inconsistency of this makes it hard to consider it a “holy grail” spf nan
