Impulse purchase since it was in a goody container by checkout. I would recommend use before bed. The mist is super fine and refreshing. I have combination skin and have used on top of makeup. After 2 hours I get a lot of t-zone & chin oil action when using this on top of makeup. I use Fenty’s primer and Makeup Forever Blurring Powder Foundation. I’ve always stayed pretty matte when using other sprays, this one just doesn’t work. Great for Night Time Moisture
