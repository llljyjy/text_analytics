I have been searching for a face lotion that works well with my skin for ever! I have yet to find one that doesn’t make me break out, make me feel greasy, that I can apply under make up and my T zone will not become shiny/Oily! also I can apply at night and day. Until NOW! I’m so excited its affordable and even in a  mini size, I only need a tiny amount a little goes a long way. I have combo skin but have major issues with using a moisturizer that helps with my dry winter skin & does not make me look like a slimy oily slug...  in addition the scent is clean Light & fresh not too much and not unpleasant. It hydrates & plumps up my skin and helps with my eye area, making me look 10 years younger 16 again!  I have little to no wrinkles tbh but I’m proactive and wanna plump my eye lids & and below my brow areas & I noticed a big  difference I didn’t even know I needed.  The hyaluronic acid is a PLUS!  but in entirety I love everything about this face moisturizer! I’ve been searching for so long for one that has everything needed  in one! & I’ve met my match. I plan on purchasing the Large/ Reg size. I still have the full sample, I mean a little goes a long way! I love that sephora allows you to pick 2 samples with each purchace this is saving me so much money on makeup I purchase and don’t like and am stuck with such a waste of money time and product. I HIGHLY recommend this product! I tried another brand sample of lotion & it smells like a foot lotion ! lol and it makes me greasy that costs $90 this is $30-40 product Its very inexpensive for what your getting even a mini will give you plenty of product if my sample I’ve been telling everyone about it! give it a shot if it doesnt work I’ll buy it off you! lol ! This is my clean fresh face with just the moisturizer.  ignore my brows ughh! I got a sample, & fell IN LOVE!
