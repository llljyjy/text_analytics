I wanted to love this SPF because I love so many of Glow Recipe’s other products, but ugh this just pills too much on my skin, it’s crazy! I even wait for my moisturizer (I use the Banana cream one from Glow Recipe which I LOVE) to set in, but still so much pilling! Won’t be purchasing again. Pills so much!!!
