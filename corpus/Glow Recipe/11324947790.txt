Ive tried a ton of vitamin C serums, but Ive always had a couple issues. First of all, they all smell horrible, which isnt very appealing to have on your face, and I find that they usually really irritate my skin. I love all the glow recipe products ive tried, so I figured id give this one a go. I love it! Its not irritating (I use about it every other day), and it doesnâ€™t have that usual weird smell associated with vitamin C. Will definitely be repurchasing. Awesome product
