WOW.  I surprisingly have normal skin in the winter & this sunscreen provided the perfect amount of hydration. My skin feels light & has a natural sheen once I apply this. I love a lightweight sunscreen & this is a lightweight, liquid. I simply blend in with my fingers after my skincare routine for a lightweight, non greasy finish. No scent which is a huge bonus! nan
