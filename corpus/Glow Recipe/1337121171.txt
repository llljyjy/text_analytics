Is not easy to find a good  50 SPF sunscreen that doesnâ€™t give me a thick white layer. This one is so good with   very lightweight  formula and  mixed in skincare ingredients.  Number one thing is that there is zero white cast, it literally melts into the skin. It has a visible glow and my skin feels very soft immediately after applying it on.  I wore it under my make up without  caking  and my makeup blends great on top.  Taking one star for the smell, the smell is very strong and not my personal favorite. I will love it without a scent.  It also comes in the cutest pink packaging that is pretty and easy to handle. Excellent formula
