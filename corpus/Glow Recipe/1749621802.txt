When I tell you guys I was so excited to try this NEW Watermelon Glow AHA Night Mask by Glow Recipe! This is actually my first time trying anything by this company and I have to say I was impressed. The packaging was adorable and the product itself gave my skin a ton of moisture in the night while I slept, AND my skin actually appeared to be more smooth in the AM. I’m a fan. Also, if you have sensitive skin….no fear! This is not heavily scented and did not irritate my skin AT ALL! LOVE!!!
