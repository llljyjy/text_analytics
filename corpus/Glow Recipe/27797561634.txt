Love this toner!!! It make my skin glow and smooth, however I have a dry combination sensitive skin so I canâ€™t use it everyday cos it gonna make my dry area too dry. I use it 2 to 3 times a weeks and focus on the oily and pore area. I recognize that whenever I use it, I always wake up with glow skin. Definitely a must in your skincare!
