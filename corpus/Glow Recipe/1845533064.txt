I have been so excited to try this new sleeping mask since i I heard about it and am enjoying this one! Though I’ll miss the watermelon original sleeping mask.. this one is another great one but Glow Recipe! I’ll packaging is very similar to the original and does have a very light scent of watermelon. I do think the original had a much stronger scent. I do find that when you apply this you do not smell the scent of watermelon at all. So great for those who are sensitive to any smells. Very lightweight and a little goes a long way. I always have issues with pilling when using sleeping masks and this barely pilled.. it did still pill a little and I only used a toner, serum, and an eye cream for my pm routine. I’d still recommend if you are looking for a hydrating and plump sleeping mask to the skin! It gives a radiant glow and is still a great one with minimal pilling. nan
