This moisturizer is amazing!! I’ve been wanting an spf from glow recipe ever since I started using their products a year ago. This one is so much nicer than all of the other spf moisturizers I’ve tried! This one smells amazing (light watermelon scent), leaves no white cast, and actually moisturizes my skin! Other spf moisturizers I’ve used leave my skin feeling parched throughout the day. I have combination skin that leans towards dry and this is my new favorite daytime moisturizer.
