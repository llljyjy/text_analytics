After reading all of the polarizing reviews I decided to try it myself. I needed a sunscreen for some other GR products I bought. I put on their toner and the dew drops. Let it soak in for 15-20 minutes and then applied the sunscreen. It still pilled up on me even after following all of the instructions. It also made my face burn a bit. It’s just dumb for a brand to make a sunscreen that doesn’t even work over their own products. Returned it and bought Supergoop unseen spf. Hopefully that will work better for me. Followed all instructions and it still pilled.
