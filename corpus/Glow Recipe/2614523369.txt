I am so happy with this purchase!Was in between the Milk spray (which leaves a film) and Supergoop spray but it smells like straight up hairspray.I love the scent, I’ve applied as a primer and finishing after make up. I live by the beach and it’s quite windy as well as sunny so this has been my ally! Did I mention it smells delicious? Watermelon Ally!
