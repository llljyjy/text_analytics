Let me just start off by saying that I do have eczema, so I have absolutely no oils in my skin anywhere from head to toe. The first time that I used this cleanser, the smell was absolutely terrible. The smell reminds me of a kitchen cleanser like Ajax or Comet. It does not lather as much as the Blueberry Bounce, which is fine.
