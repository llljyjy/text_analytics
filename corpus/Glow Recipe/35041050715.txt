I love vitamin C. Its part of my skincare routine since ages. What I like about this product? its feels amazing on the skin after aplying it, also it smells amazing. Ive been using it for a few weeks and i see changes specially on brightening. Remember to wear sun protection specially with vitamin C. Worth the try. really good!
