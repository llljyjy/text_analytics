Amazing ! I bought this as just to exfoliate two times a week . I have sensitive skin with a little texture . It just happens i had tried a silicone patch with my actives 3 days before I received this , that resulted in a huge pimple on my forehead .uggh . I do not usually get breakouts . Let me tell you . I used this with the plump plump serum and I kid you not it was gone within two days as i used it as a targeted treatment. I canâ€™t wait to see what this does the rest of my skin as i continue to use this . The smell was devine ! Strawberries ! I hope they add more products to this line . Amazing .
