This product is a nice, light lotion texture that comes in a compact, hand-held packaging; this makes it really easy to grip and travel with - great for on the go or to just throw in your bag and not take up much space. It immediately gives your skin this beautiful glow and makes it feels super supple and hydrated. Amazing for dry skin and also has a nice light scent. My only cons are that it pills if you don’t let it dry properly, so definitely not one for the impatient gals out there but they do advise that it’ll do this if you don’t wait for it to dry properly. It is also pricey for 1.6 oz of SPF considering you have to apply so much more of this than your moisturizer (it is understandable though compared to the price of all of the other SPF’s on the market). I do feel like you can use this in place of your moisturizer though, so it kind of kills two birds with one stone! It sat really nicely under my makeup all day. Glowy and hydrating
