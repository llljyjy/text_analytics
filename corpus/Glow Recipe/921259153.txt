This instantly helped with my hormonal breakouts!!! For some reason, nothing was working for me but this did!! I have dry/mature skin, and my focus is always on anti-aging, hyperpigmentation, hydrating, moisturizing, and acne. I still have to deal with it at 47 years old while fighting my dry skin. There was no scent, the texture was a lightweight gel that glided on easily, and it immediately made my skin appear smoother. It DID NOT make my skin feel irritated, dry, sticky, or heavy on my face while it was absorbed into my skin. I wish I had taken pictures but didnâ€™t know that I would get such fast results the next morning. My breakouts were reduced to half the size. I used it the next night, and they are now healed. This will be on my HOLY GRAIL list. My skin feels so soft, and I love how hydrating it is. It also layers well with all my products and makeup. Do I recommend this? 100% YES!! Hydrated and Healed my skin
