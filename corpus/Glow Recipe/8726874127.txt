This goes on really smooth and sinks right into the skin - it can feel a little drying so make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer! I’ve had this just under a week and I can already see a reduction in the redness and scaring on my face. The only issue I’ve had is slight pilling of my foundation when used with this item - still working out how to make it not do this - so far just part of my night routine, but still working amazing. Bonus: smells like fresh strawberries (: Very Nice!
