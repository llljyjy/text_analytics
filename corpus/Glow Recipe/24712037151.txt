I was very excited for this product as I was seing it a lot on instagram and youtube. but now I understand its because of the packaging, its cute and all but not a real effective product.Pros:-smells good and cute packaging-not super expensiveCons:-saw 0 changes in my skin-like watery, dries super fastI feel its more of a “teenager“ product than an effective serum. its ok... not the worst but I think you could buy better overrated
