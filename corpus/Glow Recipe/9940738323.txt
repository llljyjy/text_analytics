This product is just average. It smells nice & definitely plumps my skin, but I donâ€™t feel like it hydrates my skin for an extended period of time. I find myself using more product than I would normally use just to feel satisfied with the hydration of my skin. Also, beware of air bubbles! When I took off the inner protective lid, an air bubble popped and revealed the jar was only 3/4 full. See attached photo. Overall, if you have combo skin this might work for you, but personally I prefer other moisturizers for my drier skin. nan
