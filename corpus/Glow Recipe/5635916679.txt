I REALLY wanted to love this product. BUT… it made my redness worse almost instantly. My face is super sensitive and red and I have recently finally got the redness to reduce a ton. Well hoping for even better progress with this product and all I got out of it was disappointment. The first time I put it on my face I noticed some slight burning on my upper cheek area. I didn’t think anything of it and just finished my nightly routine. The next morning I woke up and my skin looked great. But the next day after that, I woke up and my entire face was SOOO red. Sadly I will be returning this product and will not continue to purchase. had high hopes BUT..
