I applied skincare and used the sunscreen last. I didn’t rub it into my face because it will pill immediately. I pat it into my face. I didn’t wear any makeup. I wore a KF94 face mask and pilling occurred everywhere where the mask was in contact with my face. Just white buildup everywhere. Disgusting! Terrible pilling! Don’t buy it!!
