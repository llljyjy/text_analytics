This is my first Glow Recipe product and it definitely is convincing me to try them all! This night treatment is so thin yet moisturizing, it’s like applying a thin jelly to the face that soaks in immediately and leaves you with hydrated glowy skin the next day! I love how easy and simple this is to use compared to other treatments as I don’t have to wash it off and it does all the work while I’m sleeping, it’s definitely a win! Ummm YES!
