I have sensitive eyes and this cleansing balm doesn’t bother my eyes at all.  In fact it’s the best one I’ve tried for removing every trace of my waterproof mascara. I let it sit on my face a few minutes to let the papaya enzymes do their thing and my makeup melts away.  Will repurchase for sure. No film or sting to eyes!
