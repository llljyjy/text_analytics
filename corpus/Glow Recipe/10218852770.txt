Prior to the release of the Watermelon Glow SPF, I was using Glow Recipe for all my skincare routine except my sunscreen. I was always holding out hope they may create one so I could start using a full Glow Recipe skincare routine and they finally did!!! :D I have really sensitive skin so finding products that don’t cause irritation and actually work for my skin is super tough. I love this SPF because it feels lightweight, looks glowy on the skin, and leaves me skin feeling hydrated. Glow Recipe’s watermelon products are my favorite so I love how the SPF contains watermelon. I definitely would recommend adding the Watermelon Glow SPF to your skincare routine! Awesome Sensitive Skin SPF
