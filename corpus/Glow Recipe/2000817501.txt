I love glow recipe so I was sold the minute I saw it was getting a facelift! Same beautiful sorbet/water texture on the skin that your face instantly drinks up. I love how hydrated my skin feels after applying no tightness what so ever, it doesnâ€™t cake up either when applied with other products which is a plus. I love4 how my skin looker the morning after. It looks refreshed and hydrated even youthful I would say. I will contribute repurchasing as this is a complete must especially for those days when you feel your skin needs a moisturize repair! A must!
