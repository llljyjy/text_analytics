The new Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream from Glow Recipe has a silky texture that’s both lightweight and luxurious leaving the underage area feeling immediately hydrated. Doesn’t migrate into the eyes causing irritation which is a HUGE problem for me. Absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. Also layers well under makeup and actually helps my concealer apply better with less caking. My dull underage area is visibly brighter after using the past week and creepiness is greatly reduced. I love using this in he morning since it instantly makes my eyes look and feel brighter! Bright Eyes!
