Iâ€™m obsessed with niacinamide and love watermelon, so this sunscreen is my dream come true. It has a subtle watermelon scent that I love and the texture is lightweight and it quickly absorbed without the terrible white cast and greasy sensation, in fact it gives me a beautiful healthy glow and my face looks hydrated. New favorite!
