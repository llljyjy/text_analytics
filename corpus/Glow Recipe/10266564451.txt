I was sent this product to try and so far I enjoy it. I have tried and or own almost every glow recipe product. Some of my staples include the watermelon moisturizer, plum plump cream,  and the strawberry serum. This product is thick and creamy, absorbs quickly, and seems to illuminate the eye area right away. Gives a bit of a healthy glow. Works well under concealer, didn’t notice any extra creasing, seemed to plump the area. Didn’t seem to notice a strong smell, I do tho enjoy the light natural scent of the fruits glow recipe uses as part of the experience. Will continue to use. So far so good
