I thought the other reviews about breakouts were wrong so I didn’t listen to them and I bought it. But they were right. This product smells fine and has a good consistency, it doesn’t pill. However, it was just horrible and I don’t understand the good reviews. I have mild-medium acne and this did nothing but make my acne worse!!! I thought it was purging so I kept using it and it wasn’t. This really doesn’t do anything it’s probably just for people with clear normal skin who get one pimple. Other than that is you have acne prone skin please don’t waste you’re money. DONT WASTE YOURE MONEY
