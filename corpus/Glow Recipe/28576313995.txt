Love Glow Recipe! I have been using this eye cream in the mornings for the last 2 weeks. I love the creamy texture as it hydrates my under eyes really well. I am an upcoming mom who has sleeping problems, however, I noticed the skin around my eyes are less puffy and less dark after every usage. I also use a metal cooling applicator bc it just feels good. I have a mini fridge which is where I store this for extra cooling sensation! The only thing is I which it is creamy enough for me to be used at night (love a balmy eye cream at night for my dry skin). Great AM eye cream!
