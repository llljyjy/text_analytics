Actually obsessed! Had been using popular/pricey lip masks and balms but my lips were still peeling to the point it was painful, I tried this and woke up to perfect plump lips. I could do without the color stain, which leaves a hot pink tinge if my lips are dry but it’s not too bad and for the results I’m willing to overlook that. There is slight grit but it goes away after a minute or so and I actually like the feeling. Definitely recommend if you’re struggling with dry/cracked lip skin. Holy Grail
