There’s a few things that just didn’t work for me in this product, As a Licensed Esthetician, I did not get the benefits of what this product claims to do, I did not get the results I expected I only achieved glowing skin, and hydration, other than that the purpose of what vitamin c serum should do did not happen my dark spots did not brighten, and the bottle simply doesn’t have enough product, I have used different vitamin c serums and this is the quickest I’ve ever ran out of product, with that being said I do not feel this is worth the price, because it doesn’t do what it claims to. Just not a good serum for me.
