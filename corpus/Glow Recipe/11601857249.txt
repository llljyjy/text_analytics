When I initially tried this I thought it was ok as I did notice my skin get brighter during my shirt use of this product. The shirt use was from the fact that the pump on this thing sucks. I never left the lid off of this and always put it back on as soon as I was done because I believe Vitamin C doesn’t react well exposed to a lot of open air, but this thing refuses to come out of the pump. This also had quite a heavy smell for me and my skin sometimes didn’t react too kindly to it. Didn’t do much for my scarring either. nan
