I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review, and of course I had to go with the Glow Recipe plum plump hyaluronic acid cream, and man did it not dissapoint!! I’m not sure if it was the the different blends of hyaluronic acids, but it left my skin feeling so hydrated, plumped, and dewy without leaving any tacky/sticky feeling behind like some moisturizers do. I mean my skin literally absorbed this within seconds, and I love how light weight it is. It literally feels like I’m wearing nothing on my face.  It’s such a versatile moisturizer suited for everyone’s skin type and that’s what I truly love about this one. Glow recipe you did it again! This is a holy grail product that I will continue to use even after I run out. 10/10! A HOLY GRAIL MOISTURIZER!!!
