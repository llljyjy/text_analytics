I love the texture of this night treatment.  It’s quite thin & slippery compared to other overnight treatments and it sinks into my skin right away without leaving any greasy or tacky residue to get on my pillows. It leaves me skin looking fresh and supple when I wake up in the morning.  It looks brighter and feels very hydrated. I use this about 3 to 4 times a week since my skin is used to AHAs. I put on all of my regular skincare products like toner,  eye cream,  targeted treatments and then layer this over the top and it works well that way without any pilling or weirdness.  I’d highly recommend this if you’re needing to liven up dull skin & pack in the hydration. Helps dullness & super hydrating
