If you have rough, dry, red, acne prone skin stop what youâ€™re doing and buy this now. My redness has decreased substantially after starting this product and it has helped dry up my current blemishes as well. Love layering this on, I can tell it calms my skin fairly quickly! Very happy with this product and I can tell it will be a staple in my winter skincare routine as well. YUP
