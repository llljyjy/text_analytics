New favorite toner! I didn’t think it was possible to achieve such healthy skin, but here we are. I’ve been so happy with how this toner has been making my pores look - reduced in size, less noticeable. I have also been experiencing fewer breakouts and way smoother, glowier skin. The springy, stretchy texture is lovely and feels more substantial than other watery toners I use. Plus, the bottle is so wonderfully aesthetic. Obsessed! New favorite toner!
