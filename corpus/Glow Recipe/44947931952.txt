I have oily skin that is prone to sensitivity, redness, and dry patches in the winter, and this cleanser definitely gave me a nice boost of nourishment. It has a richer and creamier texture than the blueberry gel cleanser, however it’s a thinner cream consistency, which made it easy to work with and spread, not feeling heavy but still providing a norishing boost. The richness came from the formula, not a heavy texture.After washing my face, my skin didnt get the dry ‘hurry up and put the next product on me’ feeling before I could get to my toner. This cleanser definitely gives an extra moisture retention/soothing boost, and I would definitely reccommend it for anyone with dry skin or anyone who wants that extra boost of nourishment through the cold dry winter months! A boost of nourishment for any skin type
