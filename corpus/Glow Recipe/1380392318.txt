49 year old skin trying to find something magical. I have dry, sensitive, semi blotchy skin. Have fine lines. Live in a Canadian climate. Fair skin. Blond and Blue. Tried it all. Always hopeful. Found this product pretty hydrating and on irritating which is a good start 2 weeks in. Is it turning back the hands of time? Maybe a little. I have a Clinique & Belif background.  I would buy this again. But. The packaging is ridiculous and excessive.  The glass jar is 10xs thr size of the product and the weight is alot fo travel. Massive heavy glass jar. Why? Stop that. 49 year old skin thinks it's a 4/5.
