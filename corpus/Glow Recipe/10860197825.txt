Glow recipe keeps on impressing me!I’ve gone through so many hydronic serums , from budget friendly ordinary to pricey caudalie , to help my dry skin; yet even after putting the serum I’d still feel that tightness on my face,infact I didn’t even feel any hydrating as I was putting on those products.But glow recipe - it really works! For one, it has a very viscous consistency (which someone below pointed as a negative point) - for me this works great because it goes on nice and smooth (like a light oil) on the face, rather than drying up even as you are applying it (like other brands).Second - maybe because if it’s consistency,  the face feels so so soft and hydrated after applying, that many times I don’t even apply moisturizer after I put it on.. In terms of it being sticky or not after application - tad bit, but not much actually. For those of you who use watermelon dew drops - those go tend to make your face sticky after - so you do need to top that off with a moisturizer. This one comparably has negligible sticky post application feel.As for the glow - yep your face looks great after putting it on, definitely had a glow. nan
