I really wanted to like this, on paper it seemed like everything I wanted all in one product, I should’ve known it was too good to be true. It didn’t work at all and I gave it a long time and kept trying to make it work with different routines but this did not work for me, it made me breakout like crazy every time I used it. Every single time… I thought it would pass if I gave it time but no and that’s all it did for me, I didn’t notice any benefit at all. Also the smell is a little  strong like a strawberry cough medicine which I can be ok with if it only didn’t make me breakout so bad every time I used it The only thing it did for me is making me breakout
