I have happily gone through multiple jars of Farmacy Green Clean and really had no complaints with that product, but I was getting interested in Glow Recipe and this cleansing balm was a few dollars cheaper for the same amount, so I decided to try it. The texture really is sorbet-like, it melts into a very soft dry oil, the scent is light and fruity as expected, and I swear it makes the makeup disappear off my face before I even emulsify it. I don’t really use longwear or waterproof makeup at the moment so I can’t speak to that, but it works really well for light makeup and just when I want my face to feel really clean and soft honestly... It just works and feels good. Actually, 1 note: I prefer using the little spatula rather than digging into the product with my fingers, and this does not come with a spatula. I almost forgot, since I just saved the one from my last Farmacy jar, but if you also prefer not to use your fingers, bring your own spatula! best cleansing balm?
