I adore their watermelon line. To add this AHA overnight Mask to their line up is amazing. I prefer this over a Niacinamide mask. Although this still has that ingredient but further down the list. I love the watermelon scent as well. My skin is smooth in a matter of days. Had no skin irritation either. nan
