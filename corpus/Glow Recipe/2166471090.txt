So so disappointed in this product!! I love Glow Recipe and really wanted to love this. It was way too expensive for the size, especially since it pills! I have never experienced this before… the product pills and you end up with pilling after maybe 20-30 minutes of application. I wouldn’t mind spending this much on a product from a company I like if it is truly luxurious and doesn’t pill. It doesn’t feel nice when dried.. it almost made me feel a little dry. I will revisit if they reformulate this product in the future. But right now it is a major meh! Shocked
