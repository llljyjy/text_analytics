I wanted to love this. I’m a big fan of most glow recipe products and I actually use the niacinamide dew drops almost every day so I had high hopes for this product. It’s just not great when used as a combined moisturizer/sunscreen. I’ve found that if I layer the sunscreen on top of a base layer of the dew drops and the plum moisturizer I get an okay finish which will carry me through until I finish this bottle. Even then my makeup sits weird on top of it and it doesn’t seem to play well with primers so it only really works for no makeup days. I won’t repurchase unless they revise the formula. really disappointed
