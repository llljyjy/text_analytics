This time I received this toner free as a trial size with an order and I have previously bought the mini size in the past.  I love the scent which is watermelon-y.  The texture is interesting, almost like a gel.  I like how it absorbs and it tightens up the skin but does not dry it out.  I feel that it has made a different in my black heads and pore size (decreased both).  I recommend this toner and would buy again! Love this toner!
