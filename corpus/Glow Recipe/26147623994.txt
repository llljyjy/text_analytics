so I did what you’re not supposed to do and started a whooole new skin care routine at the same time, BUT this is by far my favourite product out of the whole bunch!!! It smells soo, so good but it fades after a few minutes so it’s not perfumey at all! I have also never had a product absorb into my skin so well this stuff is smooth, lightweight and not at all irritating! The only reason i’m giving it 4 stars for now is because, like I said, I started all new products so I can’t say for sure how much this product is making a difference (besides making me happy when I use it), but it’s literally only been 2 full days (4 face washes) and already my skin looks so much healthier, glowy, way less irritated, and clear!! (my acne right now is like a 14 year old at peak of puberty so that’s saying a lot) so once it’s been a little longer and I see bigger changes i’m sure i’ll update to 5 stars! this genuinely makes me happy
