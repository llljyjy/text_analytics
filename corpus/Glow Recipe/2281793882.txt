The texture of this product is really lightweight and watery. It sinks into the skin really nicely. It helped with smoothing a couple of my active breakouts, but so far it’s not blowing my mind. I think it does work though! I don’t like the scent at all. It’s so sweet; it reminds me of a Lip Smacker. I wish it was far less scented, but the good thing is that it does dissipate rather quickly. nan
