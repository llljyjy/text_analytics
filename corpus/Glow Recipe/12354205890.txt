Super gentle, definitely gives my skin the plump bouncy hydrated feel. After the shower or washing my face when my skin is still a bit damp is the best time to apply this for maximum effect. Sadly this didn’t play super well with a few of my other serums unless I waited a few minutes for it to fully dry down which I didn’t always have time for. The bottle is also quite small for the price, so even though I love this and glow recipe in general, this isn’t my favourite. I might give this another try in the future but for my needs now this one wasn’t it. I think this would be great for beginners who are starting out with just one or two serums, and want something that works with visible results, this is definitely worth the try. nan
