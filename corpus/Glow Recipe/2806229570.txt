During the pandemic I began to get cystic acne. I have oily combo skin and I felt like any moisturizer I used just added to my breakouts. I was skeptical to try this because it’s thicker than the Pink Juice moisturizer (I used to use that daily and nightly prior to this). I l went to my local store and had a sample that I rubbed into the top of hands and was shocked at how smooth it was and how well it soaked into the skin. I bought it and fell in love. I personally just use it at night and stick to the Pink Juice for the day. I love how you can re-use the tub and just buy the pod to refill it. There’s not too much fragrance and it keeps my skin moisturized and I haven’t had any breakouts. I really love Glow Recipe! I’ve tried so many different brands that are at a higher price point and broke out so bad. A little goes a long way and the price isn’t bad at all. Love it ❤️ nan
