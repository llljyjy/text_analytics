I spend my life trying to find the best daily sunscreen. I will not be repurchasing because of how badly it pills, particularly when applying it after moisturizer. Pros: Good scent (very sweet smelling, not chemically smelling), 50 spf, matte on the face. Cons: Pilling, some white cast that requires a lot of rubbing in. Pills :/
