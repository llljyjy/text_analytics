I love glow recipe but this is a huge miss. This sunscreen pills up on itself dramatically. I’ve used a variety of base skincare products, including only Glow Recipe, and it pills the same every time. It does eventually blend out once you wipe away all the pilling but I don’t think you should have to work that hard for a sunscreen. These are my results using the recommended amount of sunscreen (two fingers length for the face, one finger length for the neck). It does leave a really natural glow to the skin, but there’s plenty of sunscreens that will work as well for a cheaper price. I recommend trying out some other Korean and Japanese sunscreens! It’s usually a better bang for your buck too. pass
