I was so excited to try this new night treatment, I have only used it for a few days because I have oily skin and I feel that this treatment works better on dry skin but anyway I love the results because after leaving the treatment overnight, in the morning my skin looks radiant and feels smooth and hydrated! love the texture is so light and is almost liquid which makes it easily absorbed into the skin! Smooth
