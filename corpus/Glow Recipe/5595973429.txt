Good way to get acquainted with niacinamide in your skincare routine. Niacinamide pairs well with almost every skin care product (except vitamin c) so i love to use this morning and night it makes my skin look so glowy and even color, less redness. It will make your skin a bit sticky at first and if you struggle with texture just set it with a powder in the textured areas. You can also use half a drop of this as a highlighter in specific areas. Also smells so yummy. love this shiz Good info to niacinamide
