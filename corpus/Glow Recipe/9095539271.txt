I have very dry skin and I was hoping that this would serve as a one step moisturizer underneath my sunscreen and foundation. It’s just not enough moisture for me. I have weird skin: it’s very dry but also acne prone. The good news is that it didn’t cause breakouts and probably prevented breakouts but this is not a one and done Acid + moisturizer that I hoped it would be, especially if I’m using a drier SPF like clean screen. It’s better under murad sunscreen (which usually pills like crazy but works great with this product). Not enough moisture for very dry skin
