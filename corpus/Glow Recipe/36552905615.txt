I love the watermelon scent. Feels lightweight. After applying, it feels sticky until skin absorbs it. I love it because itâ€™s oil free, although, I still get oily in my t zone. I bought the sample size to test it on my acne prone skin. I think it helped my skin calmed down a little bit. Packaging is gorgeous. nan
