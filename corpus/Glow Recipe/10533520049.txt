Love this sunscreen, it does have a slight sunscreen odor but not nearly as bad as typical facial sunscreens and has a nice watermelon scent (light). Best of all it’s thin almost gel like texture goes on so well and layers nicely under makeup or in its own. I’m always so bad about using niacimide so it’s great that it’s in here to help fade spots over time. Helps keep my skin hydrated and slightly dewy without being shiny. Great sunscreen
