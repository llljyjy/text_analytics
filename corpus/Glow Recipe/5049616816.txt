I received this as a rewards item.  I didn’t expect too much but I was very surprised.  After the first use I noticed a difference.   I’m 52, Mexican and my eyes aren’t too bad but I have dark circles under my eyes and some wrinkles.   I noticed the circles were lighter and wrinkles less visible after the first use. Definitely hydrating.  I’ve used it a few times, about once a week and will definitely be purchasing. Happily surprised
