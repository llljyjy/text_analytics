I love this treatment! I’ve seen results from the first time I used it.  After using it 2-3 times a week I’ve seen my skin getting more even, brighter, and softer than ever! My makeup applies easily and I no longer struggle with dry spots on my face. I recommend this treatment if you’re the type that wants a mask that works while you sleep! 10/10
