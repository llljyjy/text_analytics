I bought this a few months ago and used it occasionally to get the nice glow, but I recently ran out of my usual moisturizer so I started using this one daily. It’s been about two weeks and throughout these last two weeks my skin has broke out and I have more redness and bumps all over my face. I do really like the gel like moisturizer and how glowing it makes my face but I am disappointed that it’s breaking out my skin. Skin Broke Out
