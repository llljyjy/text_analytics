I really wanted to love this product because of the actives in it with a higher SPF, but it pilled no matter what I tried. I found it worked better when shaken really well (as per directions), but I still didn’t care for the texture and pilling under makeup. 3 starts because it may work for those who don’t wear makeup, you just have to really work it into your skin. nan
