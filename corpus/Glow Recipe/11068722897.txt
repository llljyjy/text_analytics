a simple, effective and luxurious product. it is simply a lip balm, but it does take the experience to the next level. the packaging is very cute, although a bit bulky compared to other lip balms. the other unique features are very on brand for glow recipe with the watermelon scent and slight popsicle tint it gives to the lips, making it effortless for a laid back look. it’s truly everything you could ask for, but definitely not an essential. it would make the perfect gift to a friend or relative who regularly uses chapstick. I received mine in an ipsy box, so I was not aware of the price till I looked it up. life’s little luxuries
