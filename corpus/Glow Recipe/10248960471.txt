LOVE. IT. the scent is delicate and hasn’t caused any issues with my skin (which is very sensitive). Definitely have noticed an improvement in dark spots, and it layers well with other products and makeup on top. For the consistency, ability to layer, and efficacy, it’s well worth the price tag. Just bought my 2nd bottle and will be buying again after that runs out! Worth the $$
