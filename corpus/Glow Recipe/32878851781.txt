I absolutely love this moisturizer! It makes my skin feels so soft, clean, and healthy. I would give it 5 stars, my only reason for not is because the amount of product you receive is not what you think based on the packaging. The container is much larger than the actual amount of product inside. It’s almost deceiving which was really disappointing to see how little product you get for the price. But overall, I love the way my skin feels after using :) definitely recommend this product, but just letting you know it’s not as much inside as you’d think. nan
