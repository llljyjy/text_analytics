I have been using this serum for the past week.  I use under my moisturizer and find it works well with any moisturizer I use.  It is a gel consistency and after applying it my skin feels very hydrated.  It has a very slight strawberry smell but that does not last long.  I have been using this morning and night and really enjoying it. Great everyday Serum
