I’ve been looking for a new serum for a while and was excited about this one. First off, $40 for the amount of product you get is insanity. I get that glass packaging can be more expensive than plastic, but is it enough to crank up the price to $40?Secondly, do NOT use this as directed! I’ve never been one to have super sensitive skin or skin that’s easily irritated by skincare, but using this product as directed in my routine left my skin red, sensitive, and waxy-feeling… basically overexfoliated. I’m not sure if it’s really doing anything for me, either… I do often get hormonal breakouts but the nature of my recent bout of acne isn’t normal for me so I’m a little suspicious.As for the pilling, I have also noticed really bad pilling under my SPF moisturizer in the morning (but none under my gel moisturizer at night). I’ll try the advice of other reviews and wait a few minutes before moisturizing next time I use it.Besides that, it smells really light and fresh and the packaging being a little strawberry is adorable!Routine:- YTTP Superfood cleanser (cycle out with cerave benzoyl peroxide cleanser on heavy acne days)- strawberry serum day and night, layer under YTTP Vit C & Caffeine serum in the morning—still perfecting this step, it seems- murad pore and oil control moisturizer with SPF (Clinique gel moisturizer at night) beware overexfoliation
