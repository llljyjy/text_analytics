Fresh clean scent of watermelon. Texture is thicker than the toners Iâ€™ve used in the past but works well at leaving my skin feeling hydrated. My pores seem to be less noticeable without my skin feeling too tight. The texture is more like a serum and feels a little sticky but does not finish too sticky on my skin. Cute, clean and simply packaging. nan
