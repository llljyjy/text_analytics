This serum is truly my holy grail!! It really does make my skin less red and at first, I thought it wasnâ€™t working until I stopped using it for a day and noticed how red my skin was compared to when I did use it. I suffer from acne rosacea and this has helped me so much.I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me and it has a nice soft fragrance! 10/10 recommend!! Holy Grail!
