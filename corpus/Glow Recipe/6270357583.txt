I would say this is a very gentle overnight treatment compared to what I am used to. Seems like a non-intimidating way to get into resurfacing. On the flip side I also feel like I can slather it on without a lot of other steps and still feel like Iâ€™m doing something to my skin! Scent is lovely but definitely present, if you try to avoid those types of things. nan
