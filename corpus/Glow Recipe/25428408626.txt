I was so excited for this product to help fade my dark spots and hyperpigmentation, although after using it consistently for awhile it didn’t do anything for it. It definitely made my skin glowy in the morning, I applied one squirt in the morning and 2 at night. If you are looking for that no makeup glowy look I recommend this but it’s overpriced in my opinion. did nothing for dark spots but overall it was good
