Loving this new serum! It has both hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid in it so I am really excited about that. The serum comes in the cutest strawberry bottle which I think is adorable. Not only is the packaging adorable but the formula does what itâ€™s supposed to do. My skin looks and feels smoother. It also layers nicely with my moisturizer. Great Serum!
