Oh my! The packaging, baby pink color and consistency of the AHA night treatment is wonderful! It is surprisingly runny and lightweight and unlike any other treatment I’ve tried in the past.It does feel slightly tacky at first which I personally don’t mind since it’s an overnight treatment. A lot of exfoliants are too strong for my dry skin but this one is very gently and does not irritate my skin at all. I love waking up with smooth, soft, and hydrated skin! nan
