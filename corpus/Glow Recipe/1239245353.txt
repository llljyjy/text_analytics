If I hadn’t seen this product highly recommended on a YouTube dermatology video, I would have never tried it. I needed something for my own skin for uneven texture and dark spots. After hearing rave reviews, I purchased it. Wow! It’s so soft and smooth with a light fruity scent that goes away shortly. My skin is feeling softer and smoother already. I am very happy to recommend this product. Love it and it’s quite effective! Recommended by Dermatologist YouTubers
