First of all, how cute is the packaging?! Definitely reminds me of the original guava serum. I haven’t tried that one so I can’t exactly compare the two. However, this eye cream is very creamy and easy to apply. It is super hydrating. A little goes a long way. Unfortunately I haven’t used this enough to see improvement in brightening and dark spots. nan
