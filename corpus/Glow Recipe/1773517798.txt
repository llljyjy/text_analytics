I’ve been testing out the new serum for the past nearly 3 weeks and I’m kinda still on the fence. I have combo skin and our weather has been a tad crazy and all over the place. Well for the first 7-8 days I would have issues with the serum peel up on me if I’d apply a cream based moisturizer. I had to be very careful even what makeup products to use otherwise would layer right. I finally started using a gel base moisturizer and haven’t had issues since. I sadly don’t own Glow Recipe moisturizer any longer because I almost feel it would work best with its own branded products layered up. Overall now the past 10 days I could see that my skin definitely looks more hydrated and plump. It was helpful at calming my acne. I appreciate how it’s not irritating to the my skin. I need to continue using longer and testing with other moisturizers and makeup. Because I’m still concerned about layering with makeup I need my skincare routine to help my beauty routine not cause issues. . I hadn’t used much the past week to test the layering now with my recent moisturizer change. Plumping… But Issues layering other skincare
