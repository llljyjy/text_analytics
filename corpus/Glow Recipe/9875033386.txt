Super disappointed—Honestly I rarely drop this much on a single product but I was having cystic acne and the redness was giving me SUCH anxiety that I went for it, and I wouldn’t purchase this again. There was no noticeable difference for me and if I used it prior to makeup it caused it to crack instantly. super disappointed
