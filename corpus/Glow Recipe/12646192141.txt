To start I’ve used this product for about 2 months now with fairly consistent use every night. I’m skeptical of most eye creams in general but I liked the ingredients in this so I wanted to give it a go. I have pretty deep lines under my eyes with dark circle issues and what I would call “chicken skin“ in the lines. This eye cream is very moisturizing and is non-irritating but that’s about where the praise stops. I haven’t really seen any sort of change to my eyes whatsoever. There’s no real brightening taking place and I haven’t noticed any particular depuffing effects either.Also like several other folks have said, the pump is sort of funky. It will go through periods of not producing any product and I’ll have a moment of “it’s empty already?“ but once I slap it on the counter a few times it manages to produce again. Eh..
