I’ve tried many other toners and this is by far the best toner Ive used. It’s been almost a year since I started using Glow recipe toner and it’s been my go to toner. I did tried another toner for a bit and well it didn’t leave my skin feeling like Glow toner leaves it feeling. This product leaves your skin feeling Soft, tight and it’s goes on light no sticky feeling no shinny look. I love it and after a year of using this product I can write an honest review. My skins best friend.
