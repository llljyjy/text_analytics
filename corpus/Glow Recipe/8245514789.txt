i really enjoy this product. it makes my skin extremely glowy (in a good way) and makes a really good serum or primer. the only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is because of the very heavy watermelon scent. it’s a pleasant scent but i just get a little skeptical with fragrance and my sensitive skin. it doesn’t irritate it though. would recommend!
