I have used this product twice now & I haven’t noticed too much of a difference but my skin does feel really soft and hydrated after using it. I love how it doesn’t feel sticky after applying it and it sets in after putting it on. This product really reminds me of the watermelon sleep mask and I love that mask! nan
