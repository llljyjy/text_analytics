I was excited to try this because of the reviews of the product and reviews of glow recipe but I am not a fan of this sunscreen. I have dry skin and this makes my skin feel sticky and it looks greasy. I don’t like the dewy look and I hate how I can tell that it’s on my face. It’s especially bad on the neck. My neck feels sticky all day after applying this. I have to use powder over top and it doesn’t reduce any redness it actually makes it slightly worse. I only gave it 2 stars because it smells yummy. Not a fan, there are better sunscreens out there
