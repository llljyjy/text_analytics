I’ll start with the packaging because Glow recipe always has amazing packaging! It’s a nice sturdy glass that looks like a strawberry, what’s not to love! It’s $40 for 30ml so in the mid price range, if you can afford it, I think it’s worth it. It smooths texture, clears breakouts, and refines the pores while gently calming! It’s powerful, but gentle enough for daily use. It delivers a gorgeous natural glow to the skin and is nondrying, plus it’s fit for all skin types. nan
