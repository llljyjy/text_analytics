I’m a big fan of the watermelon line of Glow Recipe products, and find they all work well on my skin. My previous sunscreen ran out the day this went live, so I took it as a sign and blind bought it - no regrets. This is a fantastic sunscreen that sits beautifully on the skin. I find it amplifies the dewy skin care products I use underneath it without adding an unreasonable level of shine, and the formula works well with my oily/combo skin on all areas of my face. It is scented, but my skin can handle fragrance well (and I like the watermelon fragrance in the Glow Recipe products), so that’s not a concern for me personally. Only small complaint is I wonder how quickly I’ll burn through the product applying at an amount that truly gives me full sun protection, but that could just be me being used to over-applying sunscreen. Highly recommend! Perfect sunscreen!
