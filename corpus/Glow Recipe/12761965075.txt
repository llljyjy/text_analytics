I have reactive skin and can sometimes have trouble using AHA/BHA serums due to irritation, but this one was so gentle that it barely felt like am using an exfoliating serum. It has adjusted pretty great in my pm routine and has a lovely lightweight jelly like texture that absorbs instantly and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky feeling. My skin feels hydrated immediately after and I wake up with a refined texture and smooth skin. Has a mild strawberry scent making it enjoyable to use. Has been helping a lot to keep blemishes under control and heal active acne in a gentle way. nan
