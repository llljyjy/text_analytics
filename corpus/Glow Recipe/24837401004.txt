I have been using this product on some areas of my face that have redness, and I’ve noticed results (not to mention it smells great!). But compared to other ceramide/barrier repair products, I don’t think it works well enough considering how much it costs. If you use this on your whole face you’ll finish the bottle quite quickly. Overall it’s a good product, but I’m not sure if I would repurchase. Effective but expensive
