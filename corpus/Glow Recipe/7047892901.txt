I have extremely dry skin and hyperpigmentation. Although I donâ€™t necessarily notice a difference on how my skin looks but I do notice that my skin FEELS way more hydrated than when I use any other face lotion or product. I use it as a primer and apply it after face lotion and before applying my foundation. My skin feels really hydrated and not at all oily. I would definitely recommend this product!!! love it!!!! great hydration, not at all oily
