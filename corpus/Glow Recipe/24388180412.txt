well hello there ! as a person who just has no luck with under eye creams i feel blessedddd my absolute favorite brand knocked this out the park i can’t believe the difference in such a sort time it’s so cooling and really relaxes the puffiness i have in the am . my makeup is smooth on top and the power never gets flaky im so happy with the extensions of the guava line it’s smells and looks so pretty it’s giving bright under eyes !
