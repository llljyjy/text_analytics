I have never actually reordered a product from sephora before. Usually I try different brands but this time I have already gone through 2 bottles. This is an amazing gentle exfoliator. I have been using it 2\day with the Glow Receipe Watermelon Niacinamide drops. It has worked wonders for my skin. I used to break out on my chin but since I have been using this 2\day it has really cleared that problem up. The pores on my nose also appear smaller. This is definitely my favourite item from sephora. HOLY GRAIL
