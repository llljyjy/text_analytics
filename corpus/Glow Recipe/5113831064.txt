Wow! I absolutely love that this is  not just a sunscreen, It has moisturizers too! I like not having to suffocate my skin with so many products before even adding sunscreen. This is an amazing prep before makeup with its glowy  finish. Leaves skin moisturized and ready for a day with or without makeup, and protection from the sun! No white cast on my darker skin tone too, which is a huge plus Sunscreen powerhouse!
