I have fairly dry skin and needed something hydrating. This was recommended by a store associate but unfortunately it’s a no-go. This broke my skin out and even gave me a bit of a rash, and still wasn’t that hydrating. I still had some dryness with it. Do not buy if you have dry and sensitive skin, it only increases problems! A nightmare for dry skin :(
