I’ve used 2 jars of this eye cream and I love using it. I noticed my eye area became smoother shortly after using it regularly. I’ve had people tell me my eye area also looks less puffy as well. It has retinol but I’ve experienced no irritation. It’s an eye mask but I use it as my eye cream both in morning and night. If you’re looking for an eye cream that contains retinol, I definitely would recommend giving this a try! nan
