I have been using this for a month along with the plum plump moisturizer. It feels good. It works well with other products. I hardly smell plums. It plumps the skin. Does it DO anything? I don’t know. I can’t tell. It’s not worth $42, more like $25. I’m going to finish it up. Not sure if I’ll buy again. 37. Black. Female. Hmmmm
