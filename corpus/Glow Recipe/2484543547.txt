Nothing special about this. Glow recipe does a great job with advertising it’s products. A lot of the reviews I believe are incentivized. Best to read reviews and filter your search to “verified purchase” to get an actual honest review. I have used this til the pump can no longer pump out anymore product and saw NO DIFFERENCE in my face. I was hopeful after seeing Glow Recipe’s before and after photo at how well it brightened their model’s face. The texture and scent was pleasant. It didn’t bit cause me any piling after I applied moisturizer and sunscreen. I would not waste money on this product. Vitamin C has ingredients that needs to be stabilize and kept away from sunlight. This product container is see through so I’m not sure how potent the vitamin c is. Nothing Special…
