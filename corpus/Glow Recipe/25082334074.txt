The consistency is very creamy – not too light or too heavy. It doesn’t just dry on the skin or disappear – it keeps my eye area nicely moisturized. It feels very gentle and comfortable around my eyes. I love how it contains vitamin C and niacinamide – both powerful brightening ingridients without giving any irritation to my slightly sensitive eye area. I’m looking forward to seeing the long-term effect of this eye cream! It works very well under makeup or on its own. Beautiful texture with amazing active ingredients
