I’m not sure if it’s supposed to feel like this, but my face burned both times I tried this mask. I have very sensitive skin, so it’s likely just a me problem. I had to wash it off immediately, because the burning sensation was too strong. I can’t tell you if it worked or not for pore tightening. nan
