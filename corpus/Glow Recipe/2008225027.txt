I struggle with my skin issues: big pores, congestion, dryness and flaking, hormonal acne and overall texture. This product is great! Saw an immediate difference when using this under makeup and as a general part of my skincare routine. Highly recommend if you feel like youâ€™re missing something in your regiment. Helped with my texture concerns.
