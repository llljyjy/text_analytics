This formula is really nice. It’s thin and sinks into the skin quickly, leaving a nice, healthy glow behind - but the packaging… I am at a loss at why they decided this needed to come in a jar. It is way to thin - think a little thicker than the Dew Drops. This would have been so much better in a pump bottle - a serum dropper even! It truly makes no sense to have in a jar because you could literally turn the jar upside down and it would pour out. You have to dip your fingers in multiple times just to get any product, which means it’s getting way more contaminated than it needs to be. This is an occasion where the packaging really ruins the product. My husband, who loves Glow Recipe, won’t even use this because he can’t get any of the product out of the jar because again, it’s so thin, than it cannot be scooped out. This is truly such a bummer because this is one of the first Glow Recipe products that isn’t overly scented so I am actually able to use it (I have sensitive, acne prone skin, so while I enjoy their formulas I cannot use most of them because the fragrance breaks me out). I really hope they decide to change the packaging, because this packaging honestly makes it pretty in-useable. I don’t see anyone else complain about this, which is blowing my mind. It makes me wonder if I got a bad one or something. Im so confused. Why would they put this formula in a jar?
