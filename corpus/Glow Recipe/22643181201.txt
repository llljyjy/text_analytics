This stuff has really worked for me, Iâ€™ve been having a flare up caused by retinol. Affected areas were not healing, they just stayed red and inflamed. I put this on the first night, come morning my face is less red and the dry areas were sluffing off. No pain, finally getting my skin back. glow recipe watermelon moisturizer
