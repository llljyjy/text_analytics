my skin looks smooth and feels hydrated and clear. after applying and using this product for a while i have noticed that my skin is clearing up and i’m experiencing less break outs. the products soaks into your skin and doesn’t leave a residue or uncomfortable feeling. the product itself is smooth and thick but it is easy to spread and a little goes a long way. i use this product with other skin products and they go together well. i have not had issues with extreme dryness or irritation. i use this product every night after i shower, along with the rest of my skincare products. overall this product has been one of the best treatments for my acne and keeps my skin clear and hydrated. i love it!! clear skin!!
