I LOVE the feel of this sunscreen!! The first thing I noticed was how lightweight the formula was. My skin felt soooo plump and the sheen is subtle but stunning. Before applying to my face, I decided to test it on one hand. After a few minutes, there was a visible difference in how supple my skin looked versus the hand without. It also doesn’t feel greasy at all! The only downside is that I’m not crazy about the scent. It has that regular sunscreen smell with a *hint* of watermelon. I will definitely repurchase. My skin felt so good!!
