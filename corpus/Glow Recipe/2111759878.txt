I’ve been using this product for 3 weeks and I love its effects. It’s hydrating and gives me refreshed and bright look. It wears nicely under makeup too. As lot of the other comments point out, the pump dispenses too much  product. Using it with a lighter hand and pump only halfway gives me the right amount for my under eye. I am currently using this cream in the morning, and the avocado melt at night- they’re a great combo! Great morning eye cream!
