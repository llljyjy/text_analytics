Got rid of my burn scar see my lower chin, when I was a child I accidentally scolded my chin it’s fading. And this is embarrassing but I have darkness on my upper lip that looks like a 5’ock shadow that’s fading too. Also, I put some under my eyes not close close but near the black circles and those are fading now. Got as a sample and now buying the bottle! Pictures are about a week apart with same lighting. nan
