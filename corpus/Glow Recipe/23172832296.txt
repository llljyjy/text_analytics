I luv the consistency of this cleanser.  It isnâ€™t a typical face wash in the way it lathers. However it surpasses any of my previous cleansers capabilities. Makeup...gone. Dirt & oil...gone. If a 2 step cleansing is not in the cards for u, then this is for YOU! A 2 step cleansing is absolutely recommended,  but lets be real... sometimes, life calls and it isnt possible. My skin is immediately soft and nourished after using this cleanser. The cleanser has no harsh fragrances, and it works like a dream! AND... NO RESIDUE... NO DRYING OUT YOUR SKIN!! My skin feels INCREDIBLE! TY GR! ðŸ˜Š The GOAT of cleansers
