I’ve been loyal to Farmacy’s green clean for over a year now but wanted to try this out after reading the good reviews. In comparison, this doesn’t cause fuzzy eyesight like Farmacy’s does but this leaves more of a film on my skin and is harder to wash off. It also settles into my hairline much more. But I love how gentle yet powerful this formula is, a little goes a long way. pros and cons..
