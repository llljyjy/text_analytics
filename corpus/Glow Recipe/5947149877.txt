I was gifted this Glow Recipe Vitamin C eye gel and LOVE IT!! After using it for about 2 weeks I can confidently say I have seen a huge difference in how my eyes look in the morning. It does take about 5-10 mins to fully activate, but my dark circles are no longer as noticeable. My eyes look brighter and the gel feels so refreshing. I typically will let it sit before putting concealer on, but once applied there is no caking. Being a tired mama all the time this product is a moms MUST HAVE ITEM!!!! I have loved added this product to my daily skincare routine. nan
