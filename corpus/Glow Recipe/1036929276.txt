Loving this Watermelon Glow SPF 50! It’s lightweight and feels ahhh-mazing on the skin! It is formulated with not only niacinamide, but hyaluronic acid and aloe as well, which is a great combination. It blends easily and adds a nice soft glow to the skin. I also love the fact you can apply this around the eye area as it’s ophthalmologist tested. I also love this for the décolletage and will be 100% be using it in the summertime for that area! It gives such a gorgeous finish! Love this SPF 50!
