Returned this product after two uses. The fragrance was a like fake bubblegum, which ruined the product for me as I really need to fade some hyperpigmentation around my nose. It was quite sticky as well, but perhaps I didnâ€™t use it enough to figure out how much was perfect. Was also surprised by how small the bottle was when it arrived. Smells like kiddie makeup
