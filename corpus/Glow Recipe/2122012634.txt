The Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinimide Sunscreen SPF50 has been a new addition in my morning skincare routine. This SPF does provide a glow but it’s not overpowering or makes you look too oily. It’s easy to apply and does not leave a white cast on my melanated skin. My skin feels hydrated and super moisturized without feeling like it’s heavy on the skin. The texture is lightweight and it absorbs quick when applied on the skin. Looking forward to see how it helps with even out skin tone, which it claims. I also enjoy the smell! It’s not a strong fragrance but subtle and clean watermelon type. So far so good! Please make sure to rub it in gently (or tap it in) and wait before applying either makeup etc. I definitely recommend this product! great sunscreen with healthy glow!
