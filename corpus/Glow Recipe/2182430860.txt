What a huge disappointment for Glow Recipe. I have nearly all their products and had high hopes for this but it was a let down. I have to use literally like a quarter of the jar to have any sort of hydrated skin in the morning. I’m glad I purchased the smaller version to try it out. I’m now on the search for a really moisturizing night mask since winter is coming. I gave an extra star cause I love the way all their products smell. I never have any breakouts either and they have helped with my rosacea. Not hydrating enough
