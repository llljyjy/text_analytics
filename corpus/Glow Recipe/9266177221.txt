it’s an ok serum. i guess it hydrated yes. but it doesn’t sink in to my skin and it kind of just sits on top. i used to use the inkey list HA serum for $10 and that ones far superior. it sinks in and helped my skin texture and made my skin so soft and smooth. a much better serum than this one. the glow recipe serum i feel actually accentuated my texture more i hate it. the pump sucks too. i’m just tryna use it all up so i can go back to my inkey list HA serum. doesn’t sink in to your skin like other HA serums
