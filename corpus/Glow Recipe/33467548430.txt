I have used this every day for a month now, and I have no idea if it is doing anything for my skin, but I do know that I hate it. It feels like rubbing a slobbered on watermelon flavored jolly rancher all over you face. My skin will not absorb it. I am not using to much, I barely use a drop. If it was a serum, think 2 drops. But even still, it leaves my skin feeling sticky for HOURS. I will begrudgingly finish the bottle because I paid $34 for it, but I hate it. It is like rubbing a jolly rancher on your face.
