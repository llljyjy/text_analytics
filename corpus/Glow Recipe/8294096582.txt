The first product I bought from Glow Recipe was the watermelon glow toner, and it broke me out. I went to return it, and decided to exchange it for this serum instead. I was a little skeptic so, because I figured I had broken out from the toner due to the scent and was worried that since all GR products are scented they would all irritate my skins Thankfully I was wrong! This product cleared all the breakouts the toner has caused and has made me skin so clear (after only using it a week!) LOVE IT! nan
