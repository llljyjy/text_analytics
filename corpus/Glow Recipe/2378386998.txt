Great for my sensitive skin and does hydrate, but not to the extent I’d hoped. It hasn’t made me break out or irritated my rosacea, which is a win because a lot of products can irritate my skin, and it feels great on. It absorbs very quickly. It follows throw on feeling calming and soothing for my skin. But I haven’t yet noticed any reduction in redness after a month of use. Overall a great product and I do recommend it, I just wish the hydration effects lasted a little longer. Good for sensitive skin
