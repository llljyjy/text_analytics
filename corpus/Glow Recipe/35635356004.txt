I was given the opportunity to try a baby bit without any prior knowledge of what to expect from the  product. The positive: my skin texture is softer and less inflamed.  I’ve found myself using less concealer! It also lathers really well. The negative: really depends on your skin ph maybe? My skin is the type to smell sour when I put coconut oil on. While lathering my face, I noticed the same smell but less intense,  way more manageable especially since it rinses off. Also,  be patient when it comes to acne.  Mine was starting to go away when i switched cleansers, and then it flared back up a little bit for a few days. But now it’s all gone! Pleasantly surprised!
