I typically love Glow Recipe products, but this moisturizer is horrible. It literally makes me feel more dry after I use it. I get it’s oil-free but I don’t think that equates to no hydration? If your skin type is combination or even a little dry I’d stay as far away from this moisturizer. Maybe those with really, reallyOily skin will have better luck? I hate it.
