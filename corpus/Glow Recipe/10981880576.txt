For me it’s been about two years in counting and Glow Recipe finally launched their highly awaited Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50!!!!  Let me tell you this product is amazing! First off, the ingredient list is top off the line! And when applying the sunscreen it’s very hydrating, very blendable onto the skin, and it doesn’t leave a white cast at all. Sunscreen is a super important step in skincare and I will for sure be using this constantly in my routine. AMAZING!!
