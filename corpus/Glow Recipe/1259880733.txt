The product itself is not bad. I contemplated giving it a 4th star. It’s lightweight and maybe helps under eye area a bit. Also, I’m not allergic to it, as I am to many under eye products, so, yay. But the dispenser is ridiculous! Common sense tells you this won’t work out well once you get low. You can’t get product out with that pump. Give us a tube dispenser or put it in a pot, please!!!! Decent product, terrible pump design
