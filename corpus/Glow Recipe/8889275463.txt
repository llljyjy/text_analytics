I’m so happy they have came out with a sunscreen. It blends beautifully. It doesn’t have a strong scent, but a slight scent that is nice and not overwhelming. It’s a nice texture. It’s not to thick or thin. Only thing is I get stingy with my eyes as they are super sensitive. As with product. Please try for yourself sunscreen is important. Love the texture
