I have pretty dry skin and so I thought this product would give me hydration and a nice glow. It does not give me the hydration i need for my face. It’s a little too thin and goes away within 3 minutes. However, it did make my skin more glowy and smooth. I use it maybe like once or twice a week and after applying this I’ll go ahead and apply my nightly moisturizer because it is thicker. feels like a serum
