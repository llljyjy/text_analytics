I really enjoyed this new niacinamide / spf cream! It feels light, doesnt smell and its not greasy! I have sensitive skin and it didnt make me feel cakey or thick! Has a nice watermelon smell to it - the tube is light and easy to carry anywhere! Goes on smooth! Definitely recommend! Great SPF with Niacinamide
