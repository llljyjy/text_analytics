Serum has a light strawberry scent with a watery texture making it easy to apply on the skin.  I was having some minor bumps and was surprise after a couple of use my skin looks and feel smoother.  The BHA+AHA definitely help and I’m happy that my skin did not experience any irritation.  I’m glad to have this in my skincare routine. nan
