This sunscreen does not feel like normal sunscreens. It’s super light and blends into the skin seamlessly. It feels like like a moisturizer when you rub it in and gives you a natural glow as you wear it throughout the day. And the best thing is it doesn’t have that overpowering sunscreen smell, it has that classic watermelon smell we all love. I am excited to see how it wears through the next few weeks in terms of evening out my skin tone. 10/10 would recommend! Lightweight sunscreen for everyday use
