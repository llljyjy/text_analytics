I was a massive fan of the old watermelon sleep mask from glow recipe so I was both excited and nervous to see how the recipe was updated! It still smells great, but definitely much less scented and smells more natural. It acts as an AHA treatment, both smoothing and hydrating skin while you sleep. Waking up to supple and glowy skin in the morning. I’ve been using this product about twice a week and it’s been a really great addition to my routine. Different from the original, but a great product! Smooth and Supple
