Not for Me, take this review with a grain of salt.  I love the bottle, it looks so pretty on my counter.  I adore the scent, it’s very calming. I really appreciate this brand and the variety of products to tackle varying skin concerns.This is a great product if you have oilier skin or large pores.  I don’t have noticeable pores (generally) and my skin tends to be more on the dehydrated side.  I found the formula to be too thick and it really was not a great match for my skin type.  I think there are significantly better toners for moisture out there.  However someone with different skin goals than myself may really appreciate this brand. Nice Product, Not For My Skin Though
