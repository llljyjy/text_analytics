This is a nice overnight mask for use about 2-3x a week. I am a huge fan of products with AHAs, as they tend to keep my skin looking glowy and smooth, and help to reduce texture.  Whenever I use this my skin looks smooth and healthy in the morning. This product has a pretty loose jelly texture, which is kind of reminiscent of slime. I imagine some people will think this is fun, and others will find it a bit messy. Sadly, the fragrance in this is almost non existent, and it doesn’t smell as good as the other Watermelon products they have. I would way recommend the Glow Recipe Pore Tight Toner over this, as I think it’s easier to use and more convenient to incorporate into a routine. (It also smells divine.) I received this from Glow Recipe in exchange for honest review. Fine AHA Mask
