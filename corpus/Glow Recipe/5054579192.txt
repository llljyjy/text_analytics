I have been using this product for about three weeks now hoping my opinion on the product would improve with time. However, I am now certain I will not repurchase this item. Toners I have used in the past across different brands have always been a liquid. This product is more like a sticky serum which goes on nice at first put pills on my skin a few minutes after while applying makeup or lotion (I have normal/slightly oily skin). *Maybe* the bottle I received was no good but I am only giving two stars to this product and thatâ€™s solely for the scent - I love the smell of this product.
