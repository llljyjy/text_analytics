I love this cleanser! I got a mini size in one of the trial-kits and totally fell in love. I ran out and bought the full size as soon as I finished my mini. This cleanser lasts forever, and you don’t need to use much product to get a nice lather and wash. It doesn’t make my face tight or dry, and pairs beautifully with the rest of my routine. For reference, I live in a humid climate and have pretty normal skin. My new go-to!
