I already love all the products of the brand, but this new eye cream has my heart already. The package is great and very easy to handle + the cream reduced my dark circles and hydrates my skin at the same time! It also helps with my makeup (some other eye creams make my foundation/concealer to crack). I love it and recommend it! nan
