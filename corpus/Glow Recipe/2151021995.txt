after using up this whole bottle during travels, i don’t get the hype of this brand/product. I didn’t feel like it did anything to my face (so i guess it’s good that it didn’t damage it at least?), the bottle is glass so heavy to carry around (if it’s a mini chances are you’ll travel with it), and I found the spout imprecise to use since i couldn’t squeeze for more at a time. All in all it served its purpose during travels but I won’t terrorist in full size as it’s not worth it imo Glad I got the mini first
