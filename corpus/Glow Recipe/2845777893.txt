This product is great. I only use it as a serum and it’s definitivly hydrating and glowy. It’s expensive but I think it’s worth it. It’s really pleasant to apply, the light watermelon scent and the texture are great. The Skin Deep score is not excellent (4), but mostly because of the fragrance so it’s ok for me. Smells good and glowy skin
