I’ve found my new go-to SPF! I love this light formula, which leaves my skin dewy and hydrated but not greasy. The product melts into my skin quickly and gives it a little glow, which is perfect for no-makeup days. I also enjoy the very subtle fragrance which dissipates quickly. I’ve applied makeup on top without any issues. So excited to find this face sunscreen that ticks all the boxes! Light Formula, Dewy finish
