Let me preface this review by saying that I’m not someone who enjoys vitamin c eye creams usually. I can see the advantages of vitamin c but they always left my eyes feeling too dry or too irritated. However, this is the first vitamin c eye cream that I absolutely love! It’s hydrating. The skin around my eyes seems brighter. The best part of it is that my eyes don’t burn or feel irritated if I accidentally rub them and get some product in my eye. It’s perfect! This is the first glow recipe product I’ve loved this much. The best eye cream!
