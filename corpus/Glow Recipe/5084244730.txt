My favourite toner. It’s hydrating & helps keep my occasional acne at bay. The texture is one of the coolest parts — it’s like water but, a little thicker? Wash your face, pour into palms & then pat into your skin — the texture is nice & you won’t lose product. Absorbs nicely into skin. I normally don’t like products with fragrance but it’s mild & doesn’t bother my skin. Kind of expensive but its lasting a LONG time. I tried it in the mini set first and the other products were just OK, but I loved this one and bought a full size. This bottle is lasting a long time too! I’ve had it for almost 4 months and it still has about half left. I normally use it once a day along with the Inkey List’s niacinamide (plus HA) serum under moisturizer. Lovely gentle & hydrating toner
