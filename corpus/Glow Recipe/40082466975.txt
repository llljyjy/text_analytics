First of all let me start by saying I love that this eye cream comes in a pump form, I really donâ€™t like jar eye creams and usually forget to apply them if they are in that form. I loved how hydrating and brightening this eye cream was and I noticed I really did look more awake because of the vitamin c! New favorite!
