Initially i bought the travel size of this toner just to try it out. Well, I loved it so much that I just bought the full size bottle! This has a lovely sweet watermelon scent that I love (do note that it’s more of a candy watermelon scent, not like the fresh fruit) and it makes my skin feel very plump and juicy. Pores are not a top concern for me, so I can’t say I’ve really noticed a big difference in pore size/appearance, but I love how this feels on my skin and how it makes it feel so plump and moisturized. I do really like that it has some gentle chemical exfoliants, however for that reason I do not use it every single day or every time I wash my face. I bought the travel size about 4-5 months ago and still have about a third left, so a little really goes a long way, and I anticipate that the full size bottle will last me a very long time! smells great, plumps my skin, and lasts forever
