I’m very pleased about how moisturizing and smooth the application is. When applied at night, expect your under eyes to look and feel more awake. When applied in the morning, it’s a great base for your concealer as well as providing you great benefit from the ingredients throughout the day. I was expecting a very fragrant product, but surprisingly it isn’t. Comes in a small bottle, but thankfully a little goes a very long way! Hydrating AM & PM eye cream!
