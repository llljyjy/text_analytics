4/5 After trying this product I can honestly say my skin does feel softer to the touch and more hydrated. I use it after cleanser, toner, and serum. Then, right after applying the product I like to use the gua sha to massage my face. I think it’s a really good moisturizing essence if you need to keep your skin wet. The product itself stays moisturizing for a while since the consistency is thicker than an oil. The only con is the smell is a bit off-putting for me since I don’t like the smell of artificial strawberry. It has a sort of plastic-y scent mixed in too, but after a while you get used to it. It’s not a repulsive smell, just not something I prefer. With all things considered, I’ll definitely start incorporating this into my routine maybe once or twice a week! It works well and hasn’t broke me out. Perfect for gua sha - not so perfect smell
