I really like this product. It definitley isn’t something I couldn’t live without, but it’s so enjoyable to use! It really packs a punch with AHAs, 7 weights of HA, and the texture is like a goeey gel cream! I like to use it under my moisturizer (not sure that’s correct, but feels more right since it’s so thin in consistency) but I always wake up with better texture! Smooths Texture & Fun to Use!
