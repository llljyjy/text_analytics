I have had lingering effects of maskcne and am willing to try anything. I love the esthetic of this brand and the products scent. It doesn’t burn or irritate my skin. I do not have sensitive skin so I can’t comment on how it is if you don’t have resilient skin. I’ve been using it for a week and haven’t had any reactions and I’m excited to see results. nan
