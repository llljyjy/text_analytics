I had a big pimple on my forehead with some smaller ones. I used this and the next day, my pimple was still massive but it was a bit dried out. This unfortunately didn’t help flatten a current break out for me. However I do think it helped with pores, texture and post acne mark scarring. I don’t experience any burning or irritation that often happens with products targeted to reduce the appearance of acne/dark spots. It is a lightweight hydrating watery gel texture that sinks in. If you are looking for an alternative to the Ordinary AHA/BHA serum, then this is a good option. nan
