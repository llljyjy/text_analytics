Lovely moisturizer. My skin has been extra dry and dull lately with my tretinoin combined with the cold winter months. Love the texture, very light gel-creme consistency. Soaks right in. My skin feels smooth and hydrated. Love the refillable pods. 1.7 ounces is more than you would get from other companies. The only drawback for me was the scent. Would buy again
