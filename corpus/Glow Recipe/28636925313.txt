This product works a lot better if you emulsify it in your palms A LOT before putting it on your face. But even then, the results are nothing to write home about. I have combo skin and this leaves the dry parts drier and the oily parts just slightly less oily. Itâ€™ll be good for right after a workout but not much else. I bought the mini size so at least I got a really nice travel pump bottle out of it! Just okay
