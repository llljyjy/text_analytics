I absolutely love this Glow Recipe overnight mask and it has quickly become my favorite and I’ve got to say I’m obsessed! I apply it at night as the last step of my skincare routine before bed, go to sleep, and wake up with super soft, glowing and hydrated skin! The formula is very lightweight and a little goes a long way and glided right on. I’m super impressed with this product and feel the formula is gentle yet very effective. The results are impressive in it has helped with brightening, deep hydration, and exfoliation to name a few. I’ve got to say the biggest difference is on how smooth my skin feels, like a babys bottom! This is a must have! Oh so smooth and bright skin
