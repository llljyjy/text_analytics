I bought this mask on a whim, but I just tried it for the first time and I had no idea it was a physical exfoliant. The exfoliating pieces are way too abrasive for my liking. I felt like I was scratching my skin while I was removing the mask. I wish the description would have been a bit more clear, as I donâ€™t automatically think physical exfoliant when I hear clay mask. Abrasive and overpriced
