I am excited to try the new Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream! It has no scent, which is fine. It has a light texture. Iâ€™m used to thicker cream eye formulas, and this was a more liquid cream formula. I appreciate that it has a powerhouse of ingredients including Guava, Niacinamide, Vitamin C complex, Hyaluronic acid, Peptides and Green Caffeine. It felt like it was a tightening feeling, after I applied it. I can see this working over time with such fantastic ingredients. I appreciate that this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. This product works for all skin types and addresses dryness, dark circles and puffiness. Would recommend! Love this!
