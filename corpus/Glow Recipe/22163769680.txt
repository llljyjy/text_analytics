I love Glow Recipe and use almost all their serums daily so was excited to try this one. Never have I regretted trying to work something new into my routine more. I broke out so badly all over my face and especially on my chin and it dried my skin out so badly. I thought it was purging at first but it just kept getting worse and worse and not any better. I stopped using it a week ago and my skin is still recovering. I even only used it twice a week and very sparingly and it still wreaked havoc. Normally I have clear skin with an occasional spot on my chin and never anything like this. I definitely wouldnâ€™t recommend this to anyone. A nightmare for my skin
