I can see a bit of a difference in the way my eyes looks since starting to use this new Guava Vitamin C Eye gel cream. Formulated for use on the whole eye area with 10% encapsulated vitamin C complex is gentle enough on my sensitive skin. One of my main concerns are the bags I have under my eyes and so far it seems this gel eye cream has tightened the area reducing it a bit. So far, so good, I will continue to use for optimal results Bright Eyes
