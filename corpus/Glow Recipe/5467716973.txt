I have been looking for a great salicylic acid product for a long time and this one is the one for me! It does the job of retexturizing and clarifying without stripping the skin or causing any discomfort. It is gentle, hydrating, and has honestly helped my skin with breakouts. My face feels so smooth after using this product. Gentle and does the job!
