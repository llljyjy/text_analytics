I have been on the hunt for a good sunscreen to apply over makeup and i remember when this launched there were so many influencers saying you can apply it over top of your makeup with a sponge… well i tried that and it was a mistake. thankfully it was the end of my day and i was sitting in the sun with my room mates with nowhere left to go for the day. it was oily and pilled more than any other sunscreen i’ve used. it also pills so much when you layer it with your other skincare. i like that it doesn’t have a very strong scent to it, and if you skip all other skincare steps in the morning and you have zero intention of putting makeup on and if you’re pale like me then it’s good but if you have darker skin than a white girl who doesn’t go outside, it’s going to leave a white cast. i stan glow recipe but this is not it. Pills a LOT
