First and foremost, I love the texture of this sunscreen! I have oily and acne-prone skin so was worried it would be thick and greasy like other sunscreens I’ve tried but it is not. It is very lightweight and absorbs nicely into the skin. After application, your skin is left with a beautiful glow! Not too greasy or heavy-feeling on the skin either, just looks really dewy and makes my skin feel moisturized. I’ve used this sunscreen under makeup and I have not experienced any pilling or other adverse affects. Also, it has not seemed to clog my pores which is incredible but I make sure to thoroughly remove it at the end of the day. A great daily sunscreen that is perfect to protect your skin in the summer and all year round! Great Under Makeup
