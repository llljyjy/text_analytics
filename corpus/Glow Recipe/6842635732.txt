I love this stuff. It’s super moisturizing without being oily. You immediately will have a glow to your skin. I got this as a free sample and immediately purchased my own. I got the refill because it didn’t make much sense to me to purchase it just for the packaging. I have containers that match my vanity aesthetic so I saved a few bucks by getting the refill. Highly recommend, I use it on its own as a moisturizer at night or under my makeup before my primer. It works great with both wears. nan
