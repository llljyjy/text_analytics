I love the Glow Recipe Strawberry Serum. Itâ€™s light enough to not make your face feel caked with the product but moisturizing enough to make your skin feel healthy and refreshed. I usually use it after a cleanser and layer it with a moisturizer. I really like the product, the packaging is amazing and its super cute. Overally really great serum! Amazing Product!
