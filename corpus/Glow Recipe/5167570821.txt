I was super excited to try this sunscreen because I love the mix between chemical and physical filters. The product was creamy in texture and melted quickly onto my skin with no white cast with a slight watermelon smell. After 20 minutes, the finish was glowy but not dewy, perfect for my oily skin. After different modes of application, I found using fewer skincare products underneath and allowing each layer in my skincare routine to adequately dry reduced any possibility of pilling. Overall, I give it a 4/5. I would like it to feel less heavy on my skin and absorb quicker. nan
