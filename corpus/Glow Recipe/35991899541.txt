This is an amazing vitamin c serum! It’s not a sticky consistency and applies very easily! It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling and looking hydrated! It absorbs well and brightens. It’s also perfect for layering under the rest of skincare routine. Also love the fruity scent!! Hydrates & Brightens!
