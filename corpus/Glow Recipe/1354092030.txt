Laughably overpriced LMAO But is it cute?  Is it fun? Is it enjoyable lip balm?  Yes it is.  Bottom line: it wears off super fast.  You can find a drug store lip balm that is just as cute/fun/enjoyable that actually works and costs less than half.  But it won’t be from ✨glow recipe✨ or ✨Sephora✨and that’s the difference.  If you have the money and like the brand name - go for it, you’ll like it. It’s Fun
