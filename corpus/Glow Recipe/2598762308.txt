When I first used this, I don’t think I used it correctly, because it didn’t lather up well. But after the second attempt, this is so good!! I’ve used this alone and as a second cleanser with the blueberry bounce and my skin loooooves it. I’ve definitely noticed that my skin seems to stay hydrated longer and not as red. Definitely worth adding into your routine nan
