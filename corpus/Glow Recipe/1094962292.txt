I normally react to and break out from chemical sunscreens on my face. I have to be diligent about taking this one off (if I just use micellar water, it’s not enough, for instance) but as long as I do, it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. In that regard it’s the best chemical sunscreen for the face that I’ve ever used.I do think this could possibly give a white cast, but I’m so pale that tinted sunscreens are often visibly dark on me, so you can’t really tell on my skin. It gives a beautiful glow but doesn’t slide around like crazy either. I do find that it sometimes pills when combined with some of my other products, but it’s a small price to pay for a sunscreen with a formula that wears so elegantly. It has replaced all my other facial sunscreens. Pleasantly Surprised
