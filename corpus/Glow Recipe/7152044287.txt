I am a huge fan of glow recipe skincare i have tried literally everything from their brand and their watermelon range is among mu top favorite. When this released I was so excited to try this since my skin has become so dull these days. I use it in my nighttime regimen and next morning my skin is so bright and fresh been getting compliments on how my skin looks fresh the next day. Favorite nighttime treatment
