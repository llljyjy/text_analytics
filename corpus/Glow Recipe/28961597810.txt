I love Glow Recipe products! I have hormonal acne so go from one breakout cycle to the next every month & with work stress, my breakouts are now a lot worse! I have been using this serum for the past week now and really like how it feels against my skin without making it feel clogged.  Absolutely loved the gel-like consistency and the mild scent! Doesnt cause that tingling sensation which freaks me out from some products as I go wondering am I making my breakout worse after applying this!I havenâ€™t been disappointed by any Glow Recipe product so far! Currently using their Avocado Ceramide serum to soothe my skin barrier. I have high hopes for this one from what I am seeing! Would recommend! nan
