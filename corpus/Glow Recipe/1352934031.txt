Glow recipe guava vitamin c bright eye gel creamI was excited to test out this new eye gel cream because I already love some of the products in the line. From the name you can tell it has a nice light weight gel texture, it glides into the skin. Feels very cool and lightweight. It includes 10% encapsulated Vitamin c, giving a slow release so you can reap in the benefits. I have been using the product in the morning and at night and no distribution to my makeup and or other skincare products. My eye area feels more hydrated and brighter. Love this gel eye cream
