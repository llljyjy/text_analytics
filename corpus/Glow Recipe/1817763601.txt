I have been searching for a great PM mask and I have found it! I absolutely adored the texture! It is creamy and smooth, it soaks into the skin with a barely-there finish. It felt kind of whimsical on the skin and also intensely moisturizing. I actually found that the AHA was gentle and effective. I attempted to try to not layer too many products with it and used at the end of my skincare routine at night. Also, it has the most beautiful fragrance, that doesnâ€™t overpower the cream or the product. My skin is in absolute bliss with this cream. Beautiful night cream!
