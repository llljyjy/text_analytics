I have very dry skin and had already heard about the pilling issue with this one. As a stay at home mom I donâ€™t wear makeup daily so for me this worked ok with no other niacinamide containing products used beforehand. There was minor pilling but nothing like the pics others have shown. It does feel really nice going onto the skin. Better for dry skin but will still pill a little
