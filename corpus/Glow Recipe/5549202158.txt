I’m a daily sunscreen user. I was SO excited to hear Glow Recipe was launching a sunscreen since I use the Watermelon Serum + Toner daily, I couldn’t wait to incorporate the sunscreen as well. Right off the bat my skin felt very hydrated and smooth after applying the sunscreen. My skin felt hydrated throughout the day and I had peace of mind knowing my skin was protected from the sun and UV rays. Of course with everything Glow Recipe, followed a beautiful glow on the skin. It’s really like nothing else on the market and I’ve tried almost all high end sunscreens out. Super easy to blend into the skin and doesn’t pill with other skincare products layered. It’s very lightweight on the skin while still hydrating but no greasy feeling. THE BEST
