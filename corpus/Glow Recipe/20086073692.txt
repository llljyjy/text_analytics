This was a little too much for my personal skin. Had torinse off as soon as I put it on. I wasn’t really a fan of the physical exfoliation part of the mask, and it also took some time and work to rinse which was a little annoying. I can see how someone without sensitive skin would thoroughly enjoy this, but I think I’ll stick with the toner and moisturizer.If you have any suggestions for other moisturizers or anti-aging products please advise. nan
