Growing up I had eczema, and though its gone away for the most part, my skin is still dry and extremely sensitive (and acne prone to being an average teenager). Like can’t wear real foundation because I get rashes type of sensitive. I have had trouble with numerous moisturizers in the past, as they all had the promise of hydration for dry skin, but no promise of being gentle on easily agitated skin. I have always had to be hyper conscious of not putting too much so my skin would not be overwhelmed, leaving my skin too dry. With the glow recipe Plum Plump Moisturizer, I have been able to triple layer without worry of both pilling and rashes/breakouts. I do think there could be improvements on pricing to make it more accessible to others with the same skin problems I face, but for the amount it is the same price as other Sephora moisturizers. Overall, it is amazing product that I will definitely be returning to. 5 stars from me ⭐️ Super Sensitive Skin Friendly!
