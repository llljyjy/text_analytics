I love how easily this product sinks into my skin, it’s really nice to use. However, it’s a little strong for me to use every day, I just don’t need that much exfoliation. Instead, it’s great to use a few days in a row to get rid of a breakout quickly. Overall, very happy with it! Nice for Once in a While
