I don’t have acne prone skin so I wasn’t sure what to expect when I tried this serum for the first time. I applied it to damp skin and topped it with my usual moisturizer. The first thing I noticed was how delicious it smells! It smells like ripe, juicy strawberries. It does fade away right after applying it, so if you’re sensitive to fragrances this shouldn’t bother you. I finished my routine and went about my day. I happened to catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror a few hours later, and wow did my skin look good! It made my skin look so smooth and my texture faded away. Seriously, my skin looked like it had a filter on it. I have dry skin and this doesn’t make it feel dry at all.  In fact, it feels hydrated and looks luminous. I’m thrilled with this serum and will definitely continue to use it! My skin looks phenomenal!
