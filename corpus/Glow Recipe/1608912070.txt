This product was amazing!  My skin feels great in the morning when I wake up, soft and recharged looking!   It has a nice light scent, which I already loved, being that I use their toner as well.  This product just sets the morning stage, for me to follow it up with the toner.  They’re great products, and really do work well!  I’ve become a big fan!!  Not to mention, their packaging and jars are glass and so beautiful!! Love!
