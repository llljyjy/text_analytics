I love the packaging and the pinkish watery, serum like mask in the square glass jar.. It spread easily and nicely without sticky feeling.. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly.. It makes my dry skin hydrated, moisturized and nourished.. It also makes my skin soft and plumper.. Makes my skin plumper and glowing!
