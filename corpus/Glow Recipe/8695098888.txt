I have grown a huge liking to the “Glow Recipe” brand and I was trying to find a new cleanser to use and I have found something I’m going keep in my skincare routine. I like how you don’t have to use a lot of just one pump and it lasts a while. Another good thing is the scent it’s not an overwhelming smell just a nice easy going smell. Of course I love how clean and “GLOWY” my face looks afterwards. I’m already on my second bottle and can’t wait to keep using it ! My-Go-To Cleanser !
