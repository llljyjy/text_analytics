After first use I was not impressed, I didn’t find it very cleansing and I put it aside for just travel use. Well I ran out of my way normal cleanser and I started using this blueberry stuff after my oil cleanse and WELL let me tell you my mind has changed, my skin has cleared and it’s soft and smooth. I am not a huge fan of scented but it’s very light and does not seem to bother me even tho I do have sensitive skin. I am not giving 5 starts because of the price and because it does not do a good job cleans ingredients make up it has to be used as a second cleanse after an oil. love it
