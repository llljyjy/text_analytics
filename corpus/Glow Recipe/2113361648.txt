The product texture is a lightweight cream.My under eye area feels hydrated & looks more radiant after I apply. This layers well with many skincare products I’ve tried & it also does great under makeup. I’m going to incorporate this into my daily skincare routine. It’s different from some eye creams I’ve  tried because it absorbs nicely, layers with other skincare products well and doesn’t ball up under my concealers. BEAUTIFUL
