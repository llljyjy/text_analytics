I bought this product because I wanted to add a vitamin c into my routine in order to even out my skin tone. I had tried another vitamin c before, but unfortunately, that one irritated my skin. To its credit, this product did not irritate my skin at all and actually gave it a nice glow. However, even after using this product for several months, it did not even out my skin tone at all, nor did it help fade any of my acne scars. Doesn't help even out skin tone
