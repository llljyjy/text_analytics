Love the glow I get from this in the morning. It brightens and hydrates well. I usually don’t go for overnight treatments but I really enjoyed this one. I use it as a last step on my skincare routine and when I’m lazy enough sometimes the only step. Makes my skin feel smoother and plumper. Never misses
