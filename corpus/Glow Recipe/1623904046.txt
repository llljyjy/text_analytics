A little overhyped. It’s not bad but it’s more of a primer for makeup than anything else. I have dry sensitive skin so I was looking for something a little different. If you have normal skin it might work for you. It’s a decent product but just didn’t work for me the way I wanted. It's Okay, but not Great
