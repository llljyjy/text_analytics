I absolutely love this product so much, I use it at night only or simply as a spot treatment if my face is particularly dry. I normally have very oily skin, especially in the summertime, so I know my usage will change as the weather does. With face masks, I have been breaking out more than ever and my skin is also much drier, especially around my mouth. Because of this, I have to balance using the toner with moisturizing products. But it does exactly as stated, my skin texture has dramatically improved and I could not be happier. The first night I got it, I had so many pimples and so I put on the toner at night and when I woke up, all the redness/irritation had subsided. The healing process for my breakouts has decreased by about half I would say. A must-have item if you break out regularly! Perfect for breakouts
