I got to test this serum for two weeks and love it so much! The smell is very light as well as the texture. It isn’t sticky and worked well under my makeup and played well with my other skincare products like my sunscreen. After consistent use my skin felt smoother, glowy and some of my acne was reduced. I also have oily skin and it didn’t make me oily or dry me out like other exfoliaters do. Overall love this as a part of my every day routine, Glow Recipe always gets it right with these serums! Amazing Product
