Firstly, the packaging is really cute. I am pleasantly surprised how satisfying the texture of this eye cream is. It’s very moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. It blends effortlessly into the skin. I like that it doesn’t have a strong fragrance since it is going in a sensitive area of the face. I haven’t applied this product under make up yet because I wear it at night but I’ve had no issues using this along with my other skincare products. nan
