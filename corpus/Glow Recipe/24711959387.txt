Glow recipe is by far one of my favorite brands on the market today! This Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment is incredible! I apply a generous amount at night before going to bed and let it dry down. In the morning I wake up and do my routine as normal starting with washing my face and then I add my moisturizer after. My face feels so soft and the dryness I can tell is going away day by day. Even my dark spots have become noticeably lighter! I love this mask! Another amazing glow recipe product!
