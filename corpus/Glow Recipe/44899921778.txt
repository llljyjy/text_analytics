Big fan of Glow Recipe products, some are great and some not so much, but this cleanser is remarkable. After a few days, I could see positive changes to my skin. In the end of a week, saw much improvement in texture and moisture. My skin felt more plump and so smooth in the morning. I did use the watermelon night mask after the cleanse. A Must try!
