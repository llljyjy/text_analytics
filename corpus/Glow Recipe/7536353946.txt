I really wanted to love this product. I like other products from Glow Recipe, but this sunscreen pills!! I read reviews before I bought it, and hoped using it with other Glow Recipe products would help with the pilling- it did not. I tried using it alone, applying it on a freshly washed face with no other products and it still pilled. This was the first “expensive,” sunscreen I have purchased and I was not very impressed. I returned it today. It smells nice though! Not worth it. This product pills!
