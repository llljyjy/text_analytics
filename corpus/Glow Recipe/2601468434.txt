It has a really nice, lightweight consistency & I love the smell! Smells only a little bit like sunscreen, the watermelon scent is present but not overpowering. I also like that it has niacinamide, just like the few drops, then I can have the benefit of that ingredient even when I donâ€™t feel like using the dew drops. nan
