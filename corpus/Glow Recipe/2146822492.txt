I’ve been a Sephora customer for 10 years and never written a review, but I was so happy with this product that I just had to post it. I was in the process of returning “Supergoop“ glow, since it turned my skin yellow (I have insanely pale, neutral skin), when I saw this and immediately grabbed it because I love most Glow recipe products. I love how this feels, and as someone with dry skin I just need to put this on in the morning, no other moisturizer. This reminds me of the feeling of asian sunscreens with it’s milky texture but even higher quality- just feels kind of luxurious. I’ve tried almost every suncreen that exists and spent a fortune, and I’m so grateful my search is over. This is the Sunscreen I've been Waiting For
