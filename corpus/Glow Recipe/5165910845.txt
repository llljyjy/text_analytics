I have dry skin so I like my spf has some moisturizer in it, I don’t mind it’s oily. However, this product is not just oily! It’s super sticky, like oily sticky, but sticky in bad way, it can’t let foundation sticks on your skin, instead it let your foundation set on the sunscreen badly’ I tried so many foundation but none can work with this sunscreen! Also it’s peeling soooooo bad! peeling as a joke
