My first thoughts were ohhh an avocado cleanser! I was very excited to try, I feel that it didn’t really have an avocado smell, but it did feel nice to wear all around the face, not drying at all and very rich with moisturizer, will say it’s definitely better than the blueberry cleanser only because that one can tend to dry my face up. This cleanser works so well that I could literally replace all my cleansers for this one. But I don’t waste lol so when I’m done this avocado cleanser I’ll definitely stick too. ;) THE BEST CLEANSER EVER
