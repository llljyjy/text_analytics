I was honestly a little hesitant to buy this because of how trendy and cute their marketing/ packaging is, but it was a great reminder to not judge a book by its cover! I added this into my morning routine about 4 months ago and I have seen a stunning difference in my skin! It is glowy and bouncy now. I showed my sister a before and after and her jaw visibly dropped. To be fair, I do no suffer from a lot of dark spots so I cannot comment on that. I got this because Vit-C is supposed to help with texture and Iâ€™ve seen improvement in texture but the glowing skin is what will keep me coming back! Love this!
