This serum is very gentle compared to other AHA serum I typically use. The first morning after I tried this I noticed a difference in my skin but following that morning I haven’t noticed any visible change. My overall skin texture has improved but I’ve noticed small bumps showing up in places I don’t typically break out. I enjoy using this with other glow recipe products, their line really pairs well together.  I think if you’re someone who needs a gentle bha/aha you’ll like this because there’s no stinging or u comfortable feeling but if you need a strong exfoliant this won’t be what you’re looking for. Very gentle
