I’ve been wanting this product for so long. I decided to finish up my Niacinamide & Zinc from The Ordinary before purchasing, and wow there is quite a difference! I also must note that I saw on Tiktok that this product also somewhat doubles as a primer. I was shocked to find out that it’s true. Applying before moisturizer and sunscreen, I have noticed that my foundation looks so natural on my face with this product. It’s light, you only need one pump, and it smells amazing. Have noticed an acne reduction with this product too. I can’t say enough good things about it. If you’re like me and have been wanting it, just get it!! You Need This. Just Buy It!!
