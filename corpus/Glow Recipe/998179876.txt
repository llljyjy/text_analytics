I was a big fan of the original glow recipe overnight mask so I was really looking forward to trying this one. I like the jelly like consistency. At first it feels a little sticky on the skin, but then it soaks in and sort of dries down and becomes quite comfortable. In the morning my skin feels super soft and looks great. I haven’t been using it long enough to notice any improvement of hyper pigmentation, but so far I really like the results. The only downside, (and it’s not even that big of a deal) I wish it had the same yummy watermelon scent as the previous formula. But I understand some people are sensitive to fragrances so that’s ok! Great texture
