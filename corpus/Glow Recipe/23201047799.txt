HG!! I use this as the second step in a double cleanse after a cleansing oil. Gently cleans without making my combo dry skin taut or uncomfortable. A little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts a long time. Added bonus: the delicious fresh blueberry pie aroma. LOVE it! Gentle, effective + the delicious blueberry aroma
