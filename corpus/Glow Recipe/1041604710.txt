I put this on before bedtime if I want to look my best the next morning. I think of it as an overnight eye mask, best not used every night. I’ve used this for one year, starting with 2 samples which made it clear the price tag was alright. It got rid of the new bag under my eye, the doctor said it was from loss of volume in my face...part of aging. He said the only way he’d recommend to deal with that is a fat transfer. Avocado melt also eliminated any recurring milia. Reliable Product
