So great for getting ALL your makeup off! I use this when I put on a full face of makeup and it gets every single ounce of it off. It’s a very soft and buttery feeling formula and then I use a microfiber towel wet to wipe it off. It’s a staple for my full makeup days and I definitely recommend it. Gets ALL the makeup off.
