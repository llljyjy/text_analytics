I was so excited to try this product! I have oily skin which leads to occasional breakouts and the appearance of blackheads. I love how this product is good for all of those things while being gentle on my skin. The scent is great - light and fruity. It’s gel like consistency is easy to put on and absorbs well. I can’t wait to continue the use of this product and see how my skin improves. Overall my skin looks healthy and hydrated. :) nan
