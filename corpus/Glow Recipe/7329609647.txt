I was sent a sample of this to try out by glow recipe in exchange for reviews and a coupon.  It’s not game changing for me at least. I feel like my skin was smoother with the plum moisturizer so I wouldn’t buy this product. It doesn’t have that typical watermelon scent, and the texture is runny leaving your skin tacky for a couple minutes. It definitely feels moisturizing after you put it on and the tackiness wears off. In the morning my face felt like usual so no change there. Granted they wanted a review after a week so I really didn’t notice any difference, maybe after longer use. If you have dry skin then I think it’s worth a try. Nothing revolutionary
