The scent smells so delicious and refreshing! I’ve been applying this treatment for a few days and I’m really enjoying it! Right out of the pink, beautiful glass bottle, I apply this creamy textured seamlessly absorbing treatment at the end of my skincare regimen. This treatment absorbs quickly and does an incredible job at hydrating, soothing, and brightening my oily/combination skin. I have noticed a significant difference in my skin as soon as I apply it and it is even smoother than before when I wake up in the morning. With consistent use my skin now appears brighter, more even skin tone, while reducing redness. It does not pill at all with other products. My complexion looks better than ever before. I plan on using this nightly and purchasing this product in the future and recommend you give it a try! The Holy Grail Treatment Mask!
