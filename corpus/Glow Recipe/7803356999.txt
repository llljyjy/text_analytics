This stuff really works and I saw a noticeable difference in my pore size within a few hours of using this. It doesn’t burn or sting and it doesn’t really have a lot of fragrance to it either just a very very light strawberry scent.  I had some dry patches on my face and again within a few hours they started flaking away. This product does pill a little bit when I combine it with my moisturizer. Not sure what ingredients are causing that, but if I don’t use that moisturizer (elf happy hydration cream) then its fine. I’ll continue to use it I really like it. Noticeable difference!
