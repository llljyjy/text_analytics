If you want a moisturizer that is nourishing to the core yet lightweight and breathable, look no further than this one, folks. This cream envelops your skin in a blanket of hydration and plumps up your skin, while not feeling heavy or suffocating. It spreads and absorbs effortlessly and the texture is a dream, leaving the skin with a healthy dew and a soft touch. The hydration this moisturizer gives also lasts all day. The scent of this product kind of smells like you walked into a candle aisle at the store but very, very mild. It doesnâ€™t linger. And finally, that packaging? Come on now. Highly, highly recommend this one! Best of both worlds
