I was lucky enough to have been picked to try the product out before the launch. I did not receive it until about a week ago. After using it for a week, I can see it is really moisturizing. I didnâ€™t really like to put makeup under my eyes, in fear it would highlight out my fine lines. This fixed the problem. My eyes look perky and awake. The brownish color under the eye looks less too. nan
