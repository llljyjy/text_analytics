So, in all honesty I was not necessarily the biggest fan of the original version of this sleeping mask! To me it was just like a basic gel like moisturizer… But I feel like this version is way more exciting! I have sensitive skin so at first I was kind of freaked out when I saw that this product includes acids in it, but I’m not gonna lie the actual formula is extremely gentle even if he use it every night! Honestly, if you have dry skin this is probably the most perfect and amazing moisturizer for you! nan
