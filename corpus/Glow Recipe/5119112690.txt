I received a sample size with a recent order. I was excited to try this sunscreen and it’s a total miss. It felt, heavy, sticky, tacky, and took about half the day to sink into my skin. When it finally absorbed it did leave my face very soft but this is a no-go. For the price point I will stick with the Lancome UV Defense Aquagel which is  hands down one of the best SPFs I’ve ever tried. Sticky and Tacky, Doesn't Absorb
