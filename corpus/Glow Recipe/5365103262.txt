Nice thick consistency and once warmed in fingers a little and tapped in under eyes melts into skin. I have super sensitive eyes and this is the first retinol that doesn’t irritate them (I use every other night). Just finishing my first jar and not sure how dramatic the results but also haven’t noticed anything negative so happily moving onto my second soon. Jar is tiny but lasts a really long time. Also the little scoop it comes with is the cutest!  Be sure to save when you order a new one to use with other product jars nan
