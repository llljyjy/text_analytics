I have used this overnight mask for couple of nights. I find it gentle on my combo skin as it didnot cause any breakouts. My skin feels soft any I donâ€™t feel any dryness or dry flakes on my skin. Over all I feel even sensitive skin would love this. I loved the gel texture which gets absorbed onto the skin quickly and makes skin very moisturized. nan
