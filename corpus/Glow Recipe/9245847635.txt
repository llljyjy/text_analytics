performance | full star | def does everything it says it’s going to do and more! Smooths, brightens, hydrates, firms and gentle enough for super sensitive skin. Love using as a wash off mask and sleeping masktexture | full star | this is literally one of my fave textures for a skincare product. The gooey, serum-like gel feels absolutely amazing if kept in the fridge too. Doesn’t pill or flake when used as a sleeping mask scent | full star | although GR does add the small amount of fragrance, it’s never overpowering or irritating packaging | full star | the CUTEST, aesthetically pleasing while taking sustainability into account, love the smaller jar too so it fits better on the shelf ingredients | full star | super clean ingredientsvalue | .85 star | the previous formulation was in a bigger jar for the same price. $40 is super fair for me for a face mask, but might not be in everyone’s price range great for sensitive skin
