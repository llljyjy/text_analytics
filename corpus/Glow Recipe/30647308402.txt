As much as I wanted to like this product, it’s just not good. I love Glow Recipe and i’ve tried this product many other ways but each time it was the same outcome- bad. No matter how you apply it or what base you use under it, this product has a lot of white cast and it piles up all over the face. You can see small white buildup all over your face throughout the whole day. Do not recommend
