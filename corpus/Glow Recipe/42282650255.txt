This is a great product that has made a huge difference in terms of dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness around my eyes! I use this under and around my eyes during the day and use the avocado night eye cream at night and absolutely love them both. I love the texture - it is cooling and silky and absorbs quickly without feeling sticky or heavy, and it smells great! So soft and easy to use! Great results!
