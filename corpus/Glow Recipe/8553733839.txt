Took one star off bc of the price point, 58$ (Canadian) is A LOT to pay for— I would expect that there would be a lot more product for the price you pay.  buuuut…I LOVE this product. I struggle with dry, oily (more on the dry side), sensitive skin. Under my nose, under my chin, and around my lips are always red and dry. I didn’t notice a huge difference after one use but I’m noticing a difference now that I’m half way done the bottle. My redness has gone down A LOT and my skin isn’t as dry and sensitive. Absolutely love this product and is a staple in my skin care routine (I use at night , maybe sometimes in the morning) . Buying my second bottle right now! A new holy grail product
