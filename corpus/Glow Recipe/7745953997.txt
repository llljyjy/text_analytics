This is my first time using this brand and I am really impressed. I didn’t know what to expect from this sunscreen, at such great price tag, but the quality is there. For reference, y have normal to dry aging skin.PROS:- Lightweight texture: it was easy to spread but it took a while to get absorbed by the skin.- It doesn’t leave a greasy feeling (even applying the recommended amount), although it can feel heavier on oily skin.- It worked well under my makeup but I needed to apply a matte sunscreen to compensate the glowy finish from the sunscreen.- No white cast: it has a combination of chemical and physical sunscreen, and it doesn’t leave you with any white cast.- It has niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and aloe as ingredients. - It has a slight watermelon scent, very pleasant in my opinion, but that can be irritating for those with perfume sensitivities- Clean+Planet Positive at SephoraCONS:- I don’t think this is good for oily skin, unless you apply a very thin layer that will not provide the advertised SPF protection.- It is a little pricey.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador This is quite good!
