This is a repurchase. I absolutely loved the first bottle, the scent was stronger and the formula had a thicker consistency. The second bottle I received feels diluted. This item has become increasingly popular so it wouldn’t surprise me if the company had cut corners. So disappointing. I’ll have find a replacement. Formula Change?
