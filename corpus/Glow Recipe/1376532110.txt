This is my least favorite Glow Recipe product. I love the blueberry bouncer cleanser & watermelon glow toner-they leave my skin smooth and bright. I got the mini version that came in a gift set with the toner & glow serum. I am glad I didn’t pay full price for this. I wanted to love this mask but I don’t think it does much. When used as part of my nighttime routine it was unremarkable, I didn’t notice a difference, my pores looked the same, skin wasn’t smoother, didn’t plump the few fine lines on my forehead. This morning I decided to try use it before putting on my makeup. I cleansed with blueberry bounce cleanser first then put this on for 5 minutes, rinsed and used toner & moisturizer. When I applied foundation, it went on drier and a little patchy but by the time I was done  my complexion looked brighter and more awake yet my foundation looked a little dry. So I don’t really recommend using this before applying makeup. If it hadn’t made my skin look dry, I would recommend it & would buy the full size version immediately just because of the brightening affect. There are better 5 minute masks that actually plump & smooth your skin AND are great for using before you do your makeup. It’s a dud
