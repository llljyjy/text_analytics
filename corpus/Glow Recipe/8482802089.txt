I purchased this as a fun splurge item on the Sephora sale. I was looking for some kind of face mist just to freshen up while I work from home and don’t wear make up often. The smell is amazing and they aren’t kidding when they say it’s a ultra-fine mist!I find I need to hold it really close to my face, unlike other face mists as it doesn’t spray very far. I also thought the bottle was smaller than it looked online.Overall will likely keep this on my splurge favourites! nan
