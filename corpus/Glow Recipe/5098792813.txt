I was excited to try this product because I use the matching serum and I love it. This sunscreen smells good  goes on smoothly. I have brown skin so I noticed a white cast when I first applied it but after blending, it disappeared. I like how the product penetrates into the skin leaving me with a nice and healthy glow. Love this and the serum
