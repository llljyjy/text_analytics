I love this serum!! I’ve been seeing results from only using twice a week. The consistency is typical glow recipe- a light gel serum, absorbs quickly snd leaves a slight dewy finish. Smells amazing like strawberries. Side note- I hate fragrance in most skincare products but this scent is soft and light snd doesn’t bother me at all. The packaging is so cute and makes me happy to look at. It’s a gentle formula my skin looks amazing since adding it into my routine. Big yes from me! nan
