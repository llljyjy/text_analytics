Hi, hello! Big fan of Glow Recipe over here! I’ve been using their products for a good year an a half and have absolutely enjoyed and loved my results. HOWEVER, this was a complete miss! Does not work well over any of the other Glow Recipe products I like to use (toner, plum plump serum, and switch off between all three moistures they have) this sunscreen totally PILLS like crazy! Did a full 9 days of trial and error testing what might work underneath- using different brands and even day 9 trying it with nothing underneath. Still pilled. I thought this would be similar to my beloved “beet the shield” spf that was unfortunately discontinued,  but omg no no no. I’m actually bummed writing this review- I do love my Glow Recipe, but wow this was a total miss! Really hope they can come up with something better! Just felt this was too expensive for what a total disappointment it turned out being. It’s gonna be a NO For me dog.
