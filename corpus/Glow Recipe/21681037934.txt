Glowrecipe has been a hit or miss for my skin lately. Im excited and happy to report that this was a hit! I’ve been fighting some prominent sebaceous filaments in my nose and not even my pc bha liquid did the job. I’ve been applying this serum before I go to bed and noticed improvement after 4 days! Definitely reccomend. Makes my skin feel hydrated and defiantly helps with oil control. Such a good mix
