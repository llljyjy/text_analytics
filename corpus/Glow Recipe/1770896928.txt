First and foremost, the packaging on this product is absolutely adorable. The product itself feels refreshing and doesn’t make my skin feel tight. It layers well with other products and I didn’t have any pilling issues. So far, I’ve noticed a reduction in my oiliness. I’m excited to see what continued use will do for my skin! Nice addition to an evening routine!
