I haven’t tried the first version of this so I can’t compare them, but I’ve been really pleased with this one! Normally I’m a bit scared of overnight AHA masks because glycolic acid is great but sometimes too strong for my skin. I did find this to be much gentler than some other masks I’ve tried (which make my skin sensitive and raw-feeling the next day), & I like that it really sinks in rather than sitting on top of the skin which can feel sticky on my pillow. I used this as a last step after cleansing and toning, skipping my normal night cream, and woke up with very plump and hydrated skin - no greasy residue, no stickiness. It’s a perfect night treatment for summer! One thing I was surprised by was that this does not smell much like watermelon - I have the Pink Juice moisturizer & I love the smell, but I couldn’t detect it much in this. Overall, I’d recommend this for any skin type! Plumped skin & did not irritate!
