I’ve been using it for a while and on the first try I squeezed a lot so it started to peel but on next use I used a pea size for cheeks, chin and forehead and it blended better. No peopling. Reapplied after 2hrs since I was in the sun a lot if not I’m good for the day. Overall, it’s been good. Gentle & Stays Put
