This serum has a nice and subtle smell of strawberries. After using one pump on my face at night for about two weeks, I noticed a reduction in redness and my pores appeared much less visible. My skin instantly felt more plump and hydrated after each use. The serum does feel a bit sticky at first, but once it absorbs into your skin, it feels very natural. It was easy to incorporate this product into my nighttime routine and my boyfriend also really enjoyed using this product. Overall, I highly recommend this product if you are worried about redness and reducing pores. Great for reducing redness and pores
