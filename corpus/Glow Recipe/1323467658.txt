I’ve literally been looking for an everyday lip something! I’ve tried everything these last 2 years from high end luxury brand lip sticks (Sisley, Gucci, YSL, Pat M.) to lip balms, chapsticks, overnight lip cremes, Vaseline, to just the lipstick from the local your local retailer shop. Nothing was a love! My lips have been dry and somehow I eat my lipsticks/gloss; they disappear! Not this one. The color is so pretty and hydrating. Even after a couple hours there still a tint of color on my lips. I seriously want to stock up in case they ever run out or change the formula. I was wondering why it was a little more expensive- it’s worth every penny! Please don’t stop! Perfect!! I’ve been looking for you!
