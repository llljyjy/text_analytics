I waited a few weeks to give a full review and I really love this moisturizer. I use it with the plum plump serum and I really feel like that has helped get rid of the Winter dry spots on my face. The texture is weird but awesome. It looks like it is going to be thin and oily, but it spreads really nicely without having to pack it on. A little bit goes a long way and I can see this container lasting me a few months. I have sensitive skin and usually new products will break me out at first, but this did not. Will absolutely be purchasing again! YES!
