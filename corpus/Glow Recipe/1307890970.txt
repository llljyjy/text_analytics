I normally use the moisturizer from watermelon glow recipe and I picked this up along with the toner. I applied all three last night. Toner first, then dew drops , then the moisturizer on top. I woke up this morning with a brand new face. I could not believe how good it looked! Ever since I had a baby my face has changed, so now I feel so much more confident about not wearing makeup! I came back to buy the normal size products! Something that ACTUALLY works !
