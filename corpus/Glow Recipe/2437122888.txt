I was very meh about this product at first. Didn’t love the scent or that it does have some physical exfoliant in it and wasn’t really sure if I noticed that much of a difference in my skin. But after a couple tries I’m obsessed.  I reach for it more than all my other clay masks bc it doesn’t leave my face so tight and dry. And I actually have come to enjoy the little exfoliant when washing off. Of course being super gentle. I pair this with FAB Ginger Tumeric Vit C mask after and my skin is refreshed and glowy. It’s my favorite combo to get my face rejuvenated after working 12 hours with a mask or just when it’s looking a little dull. Just repurchased my second jar!! nan
