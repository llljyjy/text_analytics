Very cute packaging, as all of their products have a fun, colorful aesthetic. Has a nice, smooth texture and not sticky or tacky. Used consistently everyday until a full bottle was complete but did not see any results from this product. Was looking for an overall glow like I’ve received from other vitamin C serums, but this product probably just isn’t for me Okay, not spectacular
