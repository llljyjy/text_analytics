I have been using the new Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment every night and I have been getting so many compliments on how radiant and clear my skin looks! I apply the night treatment as the last step to my skincare routine and I have been waking up with plump, clear, healthy skin every day! I love using gentle exfoliant treatments overnight because I can see the difference in my skin in the morning and I have very sensitive skin so finding an exfoliant that doesn’t irritate my skin has been a struggle but I am so happy I have finally found a product that works for me! My skin is more hydrated, former and smoother since I’ve started using this night treatment! nan
