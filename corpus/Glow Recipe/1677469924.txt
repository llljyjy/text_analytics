I bought this about 6 months ago and can say now that ive been using it every day since that it really is a versatile product to add to your skincare and makeup routine. It has a very silky texture which feels great on your skin and a super delicate watermelon scent. I’ve incorporated it into my skincare routine after i moisturize my face. I also use it as a primer sometimes but my favorite way to use it is by adding it to my foundation or if i wanna go light with my makeup, i add it to my tinted moisturizer. It always gives me the perfect glowy, dewy look without making my skin look or feel like it’s oily. I’ve even added some to my clear lipgloss and it looks great on my lips! I’ve never been happier with a product that can be used in so many different ways and not only would i recommend this to everyone, I just ordered more! It's Glow Time!
