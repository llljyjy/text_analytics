So silky and smooth! Not sticky or greasy after it’s set up, and layers over other products fairly well. It’s a little tingly and feels cooling on the face and I love it. I don’t feel like I look greasy, even over my acne/ oily areas, it doesn’t even burn my acne spots! The glow this gives just looks like healthy happy skin, and I think this’ll be my favourite sunscreen for years to come!!It does ball up when you try rub it in, but I usually blend in my SPF with my fingertips, I just thought I’d test it to see if that’s why people were having issues. New favourite SPF! (Blend, don’t rub)
