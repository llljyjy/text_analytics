I’ve fallen for Glow Recipe products so I was ecstatic to get my hands on this new serum. First things first, the packaging never misses! I’ve been using this serum three times a week since for about three weeks and so far I’m loving it. My skin had been smoother and less congested without any irritation that I can get with similar products. My only gripe is that the texture is slightly tacky after drying so I only use this at night. So far so good and I foresee myself purchasing in the future. Perfect For Texture and Acne
