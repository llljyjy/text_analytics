I can only use a little bit or else it pills on my skin. Takes too long to absorb/dry before being able to apply makeup. Disappointing amount of product compared to the size of the jar. I won’t be purchasing this again but I’m a big fan of other Glow Recipe products. I like the watermelon pink juice moisturizer much better nothing special
