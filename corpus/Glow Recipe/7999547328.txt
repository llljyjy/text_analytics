It used to be my go-to but for some reason my skin HATES it now… It has been making my skin red and irritated on and off for months because of the fragrance. Honestly, unless your skin requires daily exfoliation — which is rarely the case, I wouldn’t recommend it. Plus, it doesn’t do much to maintain smooth texture or even skin tone, so it’s not that worth it in my opinion. nan
