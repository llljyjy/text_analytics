I really wanted to love this product but after a month of use I’m giving up. It pills badly every time I use it regardless of if I’m using it alone or with other products. It also burns more than other chemical/mineral mixed sunscreens or just chemical sunscreens I’ve used before. The burning hasn’t gone away after extended use either. I love the glow I get when I use this but it’s definitely not worth the hassle. Great glow but too much pilling
