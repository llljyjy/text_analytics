I have been using it regularly and have mixed thoughts.  It is very moisturizing but is very sticky at the same time. Acts as a very good base for makeup. But the stickiness remains on hands. After a full day, the skin becomes dry and itchy. But then thatâ€™s how aloe is. On the plus side, the product works as it says. Good for sensitive skin and the packaging is very creative! Good and bad.
