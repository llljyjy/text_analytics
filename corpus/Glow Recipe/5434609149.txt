I’ve been using this product for a little under two weeks, and so far I’m loving it! It isn’t at all sticky, and dries fast upon applying so adding it to my night routine has been pretty easy. I’ve been using it every other day and I feel like my skin looks a lot less dull and I’m excited to continue to see results! nan
