This is THE best cleansing balm I’ve tried. For my extremely dry skin, I found it to be hydrating and not drying! I don’t wear a ton of makeup and no eye make up considering I have lash extensions but it takes off my foundation perfectly!! It’s not meant to be a one time cleanser, which is why people find it leaves their skin oily or with a thin film. I follow it up with my Herbivore cleanser and my skin feels so clean!! Make sure to read how to use it properly!! Amazing when you use it right!
