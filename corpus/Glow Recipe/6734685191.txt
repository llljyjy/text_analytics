I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! it’s little bit more expensive than the one I was using before but totally worth it! My pores and skin have noticeably changed and looks so smooth and clear, and even better with makeup. It has a light refreshing scent which is a plus. Definitely will be repurchasing! AMAZING TONER!!!
