New favorite night treatment! Omg this feels absolutely amazing on my skin, i love how its still got the iconic scent but less fragrant than the sleeping mask which is great for people who are sensitive to fragrance. This leaves my skin feeling super soft, smoother and im definitely starting to see why people love this brand. New fave!
