I have combination skin (though I lean towards more oily skin especially in the summer) so I always stayed away from serums unless I was having a dry spell. I also am very acne prone and I am constantly using toners and exfoliators. This serum works AMAZING when I have pimples (due to the hot weather). They disappear in less than 2 days! I love using it with other glow recipe products like the pore tight toner, the watermelon moisturizer (great for oily skin!)  and the sleeping mask! I highly recommend! AMAZING FOR ACNE
