I didn’t mind using this product, but it’s pretty average to me unfortunately! It has a fun bouncy texture, not much scent, and seems to slightly reduce texture overnight. I don’t see much of a hydrating effect and it was a bit irritating on my sensitive skin. Overall, I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin. I didn’t find the results really wowed me in comparison to other exfoliants either. I much prefer their exfoliating toner!. nan
