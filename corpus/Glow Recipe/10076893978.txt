At first, my choice was between Laneige and this one. I have a very oily, acne prone skin, and I was not sure about this one. But the finish it gives, just wow. Glowy, not too oily. You just need a little bit of the product, not too much and my skin was hydrated and the glowy finish is visible after 2 weeks of using the product! nan
