I received glow recipe Strawberry smoothie BHA plus AHA salicylic serum. The night before using the glow recipe serum my skin was freshly broken out due to my upcoming period. I had a lot of redness going on in my skin was dehydrated per usual. Upon the next day waking up my skin was significantly Soffer my breakouts were Seriously subsided and my acne was almost nonexistent! I was not expecting such a result in one day..After applying the serum my skin was soothed and it gave a cooling/tingling sensation. My skin looked super glossy which I liked. This serum layers extremely well with other products and I will seriously utilize this into my skin care routine my skin is very smooth and hydrated and this is one of the most luxurious acid treatments Iâ€™ve ever used. I highly recommend using this product. I am a fan of glow recipe and always recommend using their products. Wow.. just incredible
