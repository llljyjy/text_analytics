I have been waiting for a sunscreen from glow recipe, and this one is outstanding. I love that it is a blend of mineral and chemical sunscreens which provide the best protection from both areas. The sunscreen is lightly scented with a fruity fresh smell, and spreads easily. Upon application there is no white cast left on my face, and after a few minutes it absorbs with no oiliness. I love the fact that it has hyaluronic acid and niacinamide which contribute to more even tone skin. This also functions to hydrate skin without greasiness. I also love the glow afterwards that the sunscreen gives, so your skin looks felt very refreshed and healthy. Make up applies easily on top and the sunscreen wears well throughout the day. Great Glow!
