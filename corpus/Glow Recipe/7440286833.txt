I really like how lightweight this product is. It feels like I have nothing on and keeps me dewy and moisturized throughout the day. There’s also no white cast when you put it on. My only problem with this product is the smell. Does it smell great? Yes. But do we really need fragrance in our sunscreen? Not really. The fragrance just doesn’t add anything to the product; in fact, it takes away from some of the other great ingredients. I have seen other reviews that say the sunscreen burned their eyes but this did not happen for me. I applied a generous amount and it also did not peel for me. Overall, I do quite like this product and will continue to use it. nan
