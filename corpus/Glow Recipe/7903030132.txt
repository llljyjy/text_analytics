This is nice but quite different to the discontinued product. The old formula was much more hydrating, in my experience. This is still really nice though! I used this at night and woke up to softer skin. The fragrance is there but not obnoxious. I have pretty sensitive skin and this hasnâ€™t caused a reaction so far which is a big plus. Hello Glow!
