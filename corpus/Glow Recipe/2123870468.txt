The texture felt pretty okay and I didn’t have a pilling issue like some people were saying but I don’t really wear foundation or anything overtop so that could be why. I did however have tingly irritated skin due to the menthone (a constituent of peppermint and a skin irritant —natural isn’t always better) I guess I didn’t read the list carefully enough. I don’t see much point in sensitizing my skin while trying to protect it so I’ll defintely be returning and sticking with a gentle fragrance/irritant free sunscreen. Glow Recipe always seems to have appealing products but I wish they made their skincare without the perfumes and skin irritants otherwise their stuff would be quite nice. Irritated Skin
