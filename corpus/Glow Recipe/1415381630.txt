I love this night treatment from Glow Recipe! It has AHA so it keeps my skin really soft and clear. It has a jelly like texture and feels nice going on my skin. I use it in place of my night moisturizer 2-3 times a week and when I wake up my skin is literally glowing! The pink bottle is super cute too and I love the smell! Leaves skin soft and smooth
