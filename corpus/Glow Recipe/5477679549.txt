for my scent sensitive ladies, i personally got this product because i hate the smell of typical sunscreens and i thought this would smell like watermelons (like their niacinamide dew drops). but it smells like an ordinary generic sunscreen. i also felt it was heavy and sticky on the skin even when i applied a very small amount. i don’t think it’s worth the price personally so i will be returning :/ calling all scent sensitive gals
