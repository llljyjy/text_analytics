I have incredibly sensitive dry skin and was looking for an affordable dupe to Tatcha’s dewy skin moisturizer. After reviewing the Watermelon Toner from GLOW, I was really on the fence but listened to my friend. A little goes a long way with this product, and I even apply it to my neck and chest (if low cut shirt.) I see an instant difference in my skin and have been thoroughly pleased. My skin has had 0 bad reactions and it sits weightless. I am not a skin care fanatic, and really trust in personal testimonies. This was the first product I bought blindly and can see why it has such great reviews. For extra plumpness, I put it on my lips before adding my Carmex lip balm. I love it and my skin’s texture has drastically changed. Dupe for Tatcha
