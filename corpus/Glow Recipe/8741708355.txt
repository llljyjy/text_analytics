This is a nice lightweight serum! It has a subtle strawberry scent, which smells slightly artificial to me. This serum is packed with lots of great ingredients! After using this for two weeks I saw improvements in my skin texture and it helped give me a brighter looking complexion. It was quick to absorb and didn’t feel sticky. I did experience some piling when I applied this over other skincare, but it worked a lot better when applied before my other products. I can’t say this helped minimize my breakouts any, but it’s a gentle serum that helps with texture and dullness. nan
