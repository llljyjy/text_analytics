I’m in disbelief of these reviews tbh? I used a TINY sample that I got with an order, and the amount just in that tiny tiny bottle was enough usages to ruin my skin barrier. Are you people using this everyday??? I used this once a day for a week and now it hurts to put on cerave lotion if that tells you anything. If you have even remotely dry skin I would sprint in the other direction. The smell is perfect if you are a preteen and the year is like 1995 but other than that, it’s a miss for me. It's a no from me, dawg
