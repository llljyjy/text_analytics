I really like leave on masks because I find that I’m too lazy to use wash off masks. Really love the packaging, smell, and texture of this mask. It was really enjoyable to apply and it layered well with my other skincare products as well. I also appreciate that my skin wasn’t reactive to this leave on mask either. My skin the next morning did look less dry than usual as well as slightly more glowy. nan
