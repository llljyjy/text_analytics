I have combination/oily skin, and it gives me that tight/drying feeling after washing. Also, the gel consistency doesn’t really lather up and it glides right off my Foreo Luna when I place it under running water. Still looking for a good face wash with pump. Will not be repurchasing as it hasn’t done anything for my skin, even though it is pretty to have on my bathroom counter. Average Wash - Not Worth the Price
