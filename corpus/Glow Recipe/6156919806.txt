This product is great! But you have to be in a particular climate or have a particular skin type in order for this not to peel off. I was on vacation when I tried this and climate was dry cool and so was my skin during this time (I’m combo oily normally) and this product peeled so bad! (I even tried it without moisturizer underneath) I was about to give up on this product but decided to try it once again back home, which is a more hot humid weather & to my surprise it did NOT peel! I tried several days after too just to make sure it was the weather and skin change that cause the peeling, and it was. Hope this helps people since I did notice a lot of reviews on it peeling. But other than that, it’s a cool dewy spf. Beware
