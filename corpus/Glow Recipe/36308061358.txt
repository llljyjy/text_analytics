This was actually my first Glow Recipe product and I must say, I’m impressed. I can’t go based off the previous formula, just what I know now. This product has a watery but thick consistency, which is bizarre. When I first used it, it felt soothing and it irritate my skin, despite having AHAs. I felt hydrated after putting it on and it sinks right into the skin. In the morning, I looked glowy and I felt hydrated. I used it alone and with skincare products and it worked extremely well both ways. I feel that my skin feel more hydrated and brighter as well! An amazing experience
