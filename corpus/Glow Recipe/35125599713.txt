This really gets the dead skin, so it works better if you apply then leave it alone for a minute then wipe it away, if you don’t you’ll get the Elmer’s glue like pilling mentioned in other reviews. Makes skin suuuuuper smooth and nice but I personally wouldn’t use it every day, I alternate between this and my regular Clinique. nan
