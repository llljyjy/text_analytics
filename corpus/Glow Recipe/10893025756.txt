This Product worked wonders for my combination, breakout prone skin. I had been left with many dark spots from past acne marks, and luckily for me the product helped minimize them within 2 weeks!! Reason for 3 stars is the pump does become faulty.. Its hit or miss I had to exchange mine because the pump stopped working. Lastly the price for the amount of product using it twice a day isnâ€™t very reasonable. If your okay with repurchasing frequency (more than once a month) its 100% a go for you! Product 10/10, Price and Design 5/10 Perfect Remedy for New/Old Dark Spots
