Really wanted to love this and had such high hopes from all the raving reviews but it broke me out really bad in white pustules <12hrs after use. Tried to give it a few days but my skin kept getting worse - discontinued used and my skin is perfect again. Culprit seems to be related to them using carrageenan as an ingredient - what a shame. Uses acne causing ingredient - carrageenan :(
