I wanted to love this sunscreen so badly. I love the subtle but not overpowering smell, and the glow when you first put it on is stunning. I also didnâ€™t have any issues with pilling. However, over the course of the day, the sunscreen turned my skin orange. I stopped wearing foundation and any other skin-related makeup so I know it was the sunscreen. This may not be an issue if you have a darker skin tone, but I am very pale and it made me look like I had a botched spray tan. Pale Girls Beware
