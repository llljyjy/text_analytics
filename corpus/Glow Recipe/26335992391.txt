I really wanted to like this product, unfortunately it did pill no matter how I prepped before putting it on, irritating to my eyes, left a slight but noticeable white cast, and left my face dry. It does smell slightly like watermelon and the packaging isnâ€™t as small as you think so it does somewhat last you. Really wanted to like it but not for me:( nan
