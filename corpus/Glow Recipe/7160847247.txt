This product feels like a cross between a moisturizer and a primer. It definitely makes me skin look slightly dewy, and it feels nice and refreshing to use. I don’t wear it daily but when I do wear it, I either put it on as the last step in my skincare routine in the AM, or as a primer under makeup. I don’t really notice any different with my skin, besides a slight glow/shine from the product, so am only giving 4 stars nan
