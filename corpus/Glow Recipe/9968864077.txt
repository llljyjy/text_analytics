I really like this cleanser it’s creamy and foams easy while it cleanses my skin. This cleanser really helped my skin this winter this cold weather left my face dry and flaky but with this cleanser my face feels soft and hydrated and I don’t have any dry flakes. Definitely recommend. Good cleanser for dry winter skin
