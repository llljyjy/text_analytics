I love Glow Recipe and I love AHA treatments, so this is a match made in heaven products! Super cute packaging as always. The products itself felt great applying to the skin, smelled delicious but not over powering, sunk in quickly and easily into the skin. It played well over my other skincare too! No irritation upon wearing it. And the next morning my skin is so hydrating, smooth and looks really good. A solid gentle overnight treatment to make your skin look “that good”. LOVE everything Glow Recipe! An Awesome Overnight Skin Treat
