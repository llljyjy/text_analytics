I am such a big fan of GlowRecipe and this serum definitely exceeded my expectations!  I have just started Tretnion a little over a month ago so, I definitely have more sensitive skin than before and  Strawberry Smooth doesn’t irritate my skin at all!!  I saw some skin texture improvement after my first use and I’m so excited to see more & more difference in my skin after prolonged use!  Strawberry Smooth is also very soothing (unlike other exfoliants) when applied to my skin thanks to Allantoin & Bisabolol! Strawberry Smooth, Smoothes & Soothes
