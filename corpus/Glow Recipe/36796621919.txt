have been enjoying it thus far, feels somewhat tight and sticky on the face and def need moisturizer after, however it adds a very natural and subtle glow to the face! did not break or irritate my insanely sensitive and acne prone skin!did not see major results so far but effects of niacinamide can take up to 12 weeks to notice and i have only been using it for about 3 weeks!still recommend this product worth giving a try
