This gel cream feels really good on the skin it’s really like if you leave it in the fridge it’s really cooling it’s really smooth and of course it does claim what it says it’s Dewey it’s soft and most importantly my skin feels really healthy it looks really healthy I apply it only in the night time so whenever I wake up I wash my face and I do my skin care. It does have a little light smell to it which I am not bothered by it I love whenever products actually have a scent or smell to it because it makes me really comfortable using products like that. My face does feel way different looks way different than what I used to before I do definitely recommend this product to you Cream gel
