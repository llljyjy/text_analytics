This product removes all types of makeup really well. It was not irritating to my sensitive skin. But the residue it leaves behind is a no go for me. You have to intensely rise your face and then use another product to get rid of this. I also noticed that the rest of my products are not as effective since using the cleanser. It has to be because of the residue. It’s creating a barrier that stops other products from getting to my skin.I don’t want a layer of whatever this leaves behind to make me think that my skin is baby soft. Will not be buying again. That residue on the skin… deal breaker
