I’ve had this bottle for a year now and use it daily and it still hasn’t finished so the price point is definitely fair. I was recommended this product by my esthetician so I picked it up. I use this every morning and the watermelon sleeping mask every night. I’ve had far better results with the sleeping mask—I’m not sure why but this serum tends to stay on my skin leaving a tacky film and redness with more visibly open pores around my t-zone rather than sinking into my skin. I tend to go in with my gua sha afterwards to help cool my skin and see if it will sink the serum in but I haven’t noticed a big difference at all. I have rosacea and my skin naturally tends to be oily, with hyperpigmentation and texture being my core concerns but normally with my regular skin routine (especially with the sleeping mask) my skin tends to be dewy, supple, even and smooth. I don’t see how this serum really benefited my skin but once the bottle finishes, I won’t be repurchasing as I can’t tell a difference but tend to actually go in with a skin tint after a few other steps just to combat the redness. I think this would be good for other people, but for some reason it didn’t work my skin that well. nan
