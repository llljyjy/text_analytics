After using this product twice a day for a week I am really happy with the results. The guava vitamin c bright-eye gel cream is really smooth and does not cause any irritation. My skin is very sensitive and I did not have any issues. I sometimes have puffy eyes in the morning and within 5-10 mins of putting this eye cream on my eyes were visibly less puffy. The area around my eye was also brighter since the dark circles were less prevalent. I have tried other more expensive eye creams that promised the same results but did not deliver. I am looking forward to buying the full sized bottle and continuing to use this wonderful product! Wonderful eye cream
