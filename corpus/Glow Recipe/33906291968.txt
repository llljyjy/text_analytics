The first night I used this cleanser I was not overly impressed but I realized I may not have used enough product. The second night, I used a little more and was much happier with the outcome. I was pleased that it removed my waterproof eye makeup (I recommend gently rubbing this area with cleanser for best result) and it did not make my skin feel stripped or dry. After using my skin felt soft and nourished. I will note that this cleanser does not foam up, so if you are someone who likes a foaming cleanser, this may not be the product for you. It is a cream cleanser and I would recommend using in winter when your skin is drier or if you regularly have drier skin. Great for Drier Skin
