I came into the store to buy a glow recipe banana soufflé moisture cream, and found out that they stopped making them. I was so disappointed. That was one of the best creams I have ever had, and for the first time in like forever I found my cream. I asked which cream would be similar to the other one, and they recommended this moisturizer. I bought it and gave it a try. I was really disappointed, I had a really bad breakout. Not recommending. Bring back the old moisturizer. Please! They’re selling them on Amazon, but it’s twice the price due to the shortage. Is there anyway we can bring the old recipe back? I am willing to pay $40 for the old recipe but not this one. It’s not worth it. Causes a really bad breakout
