If you have truly dry skin that has trouble producing oil, I would not recommend this. The added vitamin C is Known to be drying which defeats the hydration aspect of the serum. I also notice this doesn’t sink in. It leaves a tacky residue that can collect dirt. I started noticing small bumps on my forehead & I’m not acne prone. I hate having to wait for this to sink in before moisturizer, only for my skin to feel dry once it does. This serum wants to be too many things at once, & it’s pretty mediocre as a result. Mediocre Hydration
