The packaging is cute, but there are a plethora of niacinamide products out there that are just as, if not more, effective than this pricey serum. There’s nothing new, or innovative, about this product. It’s inspired by K-beauty but produced in the US, which means it doesn’t follow Korean FDA standards; it’s basically an American product marketed as Korean beauty, when it’s really not. Overrated and overpriced
