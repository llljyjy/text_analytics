I was a bit skeptical about using this product since a SPF product and I am of melanin complexion. It is, however, my first Glow Recipe product and I was excited about that. This product did have my skin feeling moisturized and soft the entire day. I didn’t have any issues with feeling greasy and it didn’t leave a white cast like most sunscreens do on my skintone. However, it did get caught in my eyebrows and would show up there. The texture was nice and smooth and I didn’t have problem with blending it into my skin. But it does have a watermelon scent if you are too keen on that. It didn’t bother me, but it did throw me off at first. I have not seen any real changes in my skin or the texture. But I have been using it everyday since receiving it. I can say that I like it. Hopefully, they’ll come out with an unscented one though. nan
