The packaging looks similar to the watermelon line from Glow Recipe. The sunscreen feels lightweight and it doesn’t leave a white cast even though this one is a hybrid sunscreen. However, I experienced pilling while I’m trying to blend it on my skin and that to me feels like a waste of product. I never experienced any skin irritation so I’m kinda disappointed because this could be a great sunscreen. A bit disappointed
