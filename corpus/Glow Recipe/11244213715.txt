I love the watermelon moisturizer and Niacinamide drops from Glow Recipe so I decided to try this serum, but it didn’t work for me in the 2 months I used it.It creates a cooling sensation and makes mymakes my skin FEEL nice, but the redness on my face becomes way more noticeable after application :(I wish it worked for the redness, but it’s not bad as a moisturizer (see picture: glowy skin but sadly way more noticeable redness) Makes my skin MORE red?!
