I really can’t say enough good things about this product and brand as a whole. There has yet to be one product I don’t like from them this included. It is very hydrating but not sticky or oily or greasy. It is almost kind of cooling on the skin. I use a lot of skincare on my face and makeup etc and it is so soothing at the end of the day to finish with this. Definitely will repurchase, great price and I love its refillable GET YOUR CARD OUT NOW :)
