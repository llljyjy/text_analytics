This Product is so nice!!! It makes my skin feel so soft while also being protected! The only thing that I don’t like is it leaves a slight white cast , not a lot tho!! Easily blend-able. I wore this under makeup and it made my makeup go on so much smoother. It does a great job with keeping me hydrated! I love how it makes my skin glow, I got so many compliments when I didn’t wear makeup . The texture is very smooth and not bumpy like others I have tried. I would say it is lightweight, but it’s also greasy as well. nan
