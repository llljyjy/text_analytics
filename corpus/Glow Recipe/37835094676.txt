I was pleasantly surprised by this product. After having used about 4-5 other best selling exfoliants, this product is the only one which did not irritate my skin. Even though it is pricier than other products, a little bit goes a long way. I apply it on slightly damp skin right out of the shower and it sinks into my skin immediately. It does NOT feel tacky or sticky but instead it feels refreshing. I read a lot of mixed reviews about this product regarding its efficacy but this worked wonders for my skin within a couple of days. The scent is mild and even though I would have preferred it to be unscented, I actually donâ€™t mind it considering how well it works. It is gentle enough to be used every day. MIRACLE PRODUCT
