I was super excited for this sunscreen especially because I had never used one with niacinamide. I was also excited because I love watermelon scent. While it does have a slight Jolly Rancher watermelon scent, it doesnâ€™t last long and eventually fades to a regular generic sunscreen scent.  Also, I only used a little bit of product but experienced some product pilling. I tried using the product in different ways such as by itself as well as exfoliating skin first l but there was still pilling. nan
