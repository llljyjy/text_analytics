This moisturizer is the best thing I’ve purchased at Sephora so far. It I can put it on at night and trust that the next morning my skin will be smooth and soft. A bit pricy but I’m telling you it’s 100% worth it. The packaging is ADORABLE, the smell of plums is very nice but not too strong. I have combination skin and this product works wonders! Always leaves a nice glow too ;) nan
