I was alittle scared getting this sunscreen at first. DUE too seeing all the reviews how it pills and stings around the eyes, butt to my surprise it does not pill on me personally or sting, granted it does give me a very very little ting around my eyes and mouth area butt!! Everything else is good no cast or anything and didnâ€™t even pill or ball up in my facial hair!! Would purchase again nice product. Nice sunscreen :)
