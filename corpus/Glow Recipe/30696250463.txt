Okay I’m a huge sucker for packaging and glow recipe has perfected the cute packaging and aesthetic. BUT  not just that they have perfected their products. I was super excited to try this when I hear they were coming out with a serum to help with acne. The texture is great and feels amazing on my skin. Super excited to use this all summer and keep my skin healthy. I will definitely be adding this to my skin routine. Very impressed with how it’s helped my skin and it feels amazing on. Texture is great and so is smell. Thank you glow recipe!!!! you need it.
