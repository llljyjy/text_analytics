Please understand that I will absolutely roast a product for being trash. I do not care if they sent it for me; my skin is my bread and butter. She likes ’em rich and thick and I am not about to play around. With that being said... I am geeked about this product. It goes on like a hydrating serum; really love how gentle and nourishing it feels, especially for being an exfoliant. I really only think it’s comparable to Farmacy’s Honeymoon Glow. I have sensitive and dry skin, so I really hesitate with exfoliants of all kinds; many of them are too harsh or abrasive and can exacerbate my hyperpigmentation or damage my moisture barrier. Tacky enough to layer well with my toners and moisturizers. Huge win. My only critique is that I don’t feel like it does much for texture. It’s too gentle to do anything for the congestion I have on my nose. So very good for the 2x exfoliating or exfoliating in harsher climates. Love! like a little exfoliating kiss
