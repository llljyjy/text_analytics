The most interesting thing about this product is the texture. It is kind of sticky but when it dries on the skin you don’t feel a thing.  It really feels nice on the skin, very hydrating and plump. I use it after I clean my face and before my moisturizer. I don’t see a lot of improvement on my pores, but I still enjoy using it. I love the smell as well, is a soft watermelon scent. Good product
