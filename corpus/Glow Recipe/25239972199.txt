I have been using this product for about two weeks and I’m loving it now, but I’ve learned that there are some tricks to making it work well!The first time I used this sunscreen, I tried to use it like I would any other sunscreen: I grabbed a huge gob of it and tried to rub it in on top of my moisturizer until it looked clear. That turned out to be a bad idea, the product pilled everywhere and I think most of it ended up off of my face rather than on my face. I was convinced I hated it despite my love of the other products in the glow recipe watermelon line.On day two, I tried to allow my moisturizer (a thin lotion) a little time to sink in and dry before applying the sunscreen. That helped, but I still got some pilling.After a couple of weeks of troubleshooting, I’ve learned to follow these steps:1. Use a thick moisturizer that evens the skin surface. I’ve been using the Rich B**** moisturizer from Freck for this, but I’m sure the gel formula of the pink juice from glow recipe would also work!2. Apply the full amount of sunscreen you need and spread it across your face, then stop touching it. Don’t rub until it looks clear. It will look clear as it soaks in. This step helps to get an even coat and eliminate pulling!3. Leave the sunscreen undisturbed on your face for at least 30 minutes before applying any makeup over it to avoid pilling.I know that these steps sound tedious, but they are so worth it! My skin was having a really dry seasonal transition this year, and it has been looking so glowy and fresh since using this product! Read this for tips on making this product work!
