This product surprised me in a good way! I’m used to clear cleansers that lather up a lot, and this product is not that at first glance. It looks like a lotion, but once you add enough water, it lathers up quite nicely for a gentle wash. It took off every bit of makeup I had on without leaving any traces. Skin didn’t feel tight afterwards either. It felt clean and refreshed! Surprised Me!
