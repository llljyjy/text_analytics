Was excited and grateful to receive a sample of this in my latest order and had high hopes since I’ve heard a lot of buzz about Glow Recipe in general.  Unfortunately the texture is too sticky for my liking and doesn’t feel like the tacky-ness ever goes down.  The same “glowy” effect can be achieved much more affordably by using any moisturizing serum or lotion or a facial oil. The fragrance is pleasant, but I would not spend this type of money on a product that has fragrance in it as this ingredient can cause skin irritation, breakouts, and possibility of developing allergy to fragrance in skin care products down the line. Very Tacky and Sticky Consistency
