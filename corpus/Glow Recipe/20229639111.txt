BEST coloured lip balm I have ever tried. The product feels incredibly smooth and luxurious on my lips and has a beautiful pink shade. The Colour is so saturated, it leaves a subtle stain on my lips after I wear it for a couple hours and wipe it off. Unlike other coloured lip balms Iâ€™ve tried, it actually conditions my lips. I will absolutely be repurchasing! Favourite Coloured Lip Balm!
