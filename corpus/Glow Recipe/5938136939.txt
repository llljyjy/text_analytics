The formula is amazing and the products does a fantastic job with removing the makeup and grime from the day without stripping my skin which is amazing as I have dry sensitive skin. I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of the smell at first but adjusted after a couple of uses. Would definitely recommend! Great cleanser - removes makeup without an issue!
