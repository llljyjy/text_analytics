if social media convinced you to check this out - just pass. here’s my honest take after finishing my bottle:great hydrating primer for dry skin. gives you a subtle glow which fades in a few hours. no long-term benefits outside of reduced oil production. Those who claimed reduced fine lines/brightening effects used other products alongside this like AHA/BHA at night (check their other product reviews). This product by itself is not life changing, however, gives you a glow when used. that’s all. Now sephora collection ultra glow serum gives me the exact same result for half the price so do the math :) not worth the hype
