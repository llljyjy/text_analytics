This product is a gentle, effective cleanser. I agree with what others have said about it not lathering well. I noticed that it works much better when my face is already wet, and it works best when applied twice in cases where I was removing makeup. It was not harsh and left my skin nourished. I am a die hard fan of the Glow Recipe Blueberry cleanser, but I would definitely consider adding it to the mix in my routine. nan
