This is amazing for sensitive skin. My face has been so angry and red from wearing a face mask so often and I tried so many different things to get the skin on my cheeks to not hurt. This serum helped my skin heal in just a week. Now I am using it every day to reduce the redness in my face and it just seems to keep my sensitive skin happier. I wish the bottle was a little larger, I go through it pretty fast, even just using 2 pumps a day, but it is entirely worth the price. nan
