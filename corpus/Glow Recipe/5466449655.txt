I was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because of the handful of negative reviews. I have learnt my lesson, give it a try myself. I am happy that I went ahead and got it. After 1 use, I felt a difference that lasted til way after lunch the next day. So, I work from home and decided that I’ll try the serum and this moisturizer at night and keep it on for as long as I could. I washed my face and patted a bit of the water off. I used 1 pump of the serum and pat it all over my damp face. I let it dry while I put on my eye cream etc. Once dried, I tried this Glow recipe plum moisturizer as well and I definitely saw and felt a big difference in the mirror. I’ve been looking for a face routine that gave me a wow factor and I think I might have just found it! Pair it with the serum!!
