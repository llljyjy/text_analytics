I have been using this mask for a week and I am totally in love! The texture is a watery gel that is easy to spread and once it dries on the face it doesnâ€™t clump. No strong scent either. This mask leaves my skin feeling supple when applied, and when I rinse it off the next morning, my skin feels smooth, hydrated and glowing. The mask will also last a long time with this size of the jar so I think it is worth the price. Best for dull skin
