I have hyper, hypersensitive and combination oily skin that is allergic to every skincare product that comes near it. Somehow this product makes my skin happy. It has made a noticeable difference in the moisture barrier, which I notice considerably upon applying foundation (it just goes on so smooth). It also evened out my skin tone. Please never let this be discontinued like everything else I love. For the love of god please never discontinue
