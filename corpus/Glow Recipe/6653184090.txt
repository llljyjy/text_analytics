I really like this product. I had been looking for a face sunscreen for awhile and I had a LOT of criteria--had to be cruelty-free, not contain any silicone (my skin just CAN’T with silicone), can’t be tinted, couldn’t be too thick. This one ticked off all the boxes so I gave it a try and I love it--it’s light and sinks into the skin really well.I haven’t had any of the pilling or sticky issues some of the other reviewers have had--quite the opposite, really. This blended into my skin beautifully. I had read the reviews and considering I have a pretty intense skin care regime in the morning with a few layers of products (toner, serum, booster, moisturizer) I didn’t have high hopes because almost everything pills on me--but this didn’t. It also wasn’t sticky at all on me.I rubbed it on my hands first and then patted it onto my face so maybe that made a difference, but overall, I like it. light,cruelty-free, and I had no issues with pills
