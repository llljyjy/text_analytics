I’ve been using this face wash for about 3 years now. It smells amazing and it really clears up my skin! I switch up my face wash every once in a while bc this one doesn’t last me as long as I’d like and it’s more on the expensive side, but whenever I use it again, my skin starts to clear up! My skin loves this product!!
