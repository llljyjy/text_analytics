I love Glow Recipe products so I jumped at the chance to purchase this new product! I love sunscreen and am always looking for the best new one to use in this hot Florida sunshine- sadly, this is not it! This sunscreen is terrible. It does have that great Watermelon Glow Recipe smell, but that’s where the good things about it end. I use Glow Recipe products only- so the serum and moisturize- and this Sunscreen pilled terribly on top of them. I had white peeling sunscreen all over my face- it was terrible. I have never had this happen before with my usual sunscreen that I wear on top of their serum and moisturizer every day! I have never taken a product back to Sephora but I am seriously considering doing that this sunscreen is THAT bad. I couldn’t even imagine trying to layer makeup on top of this. Buyer beware , if you are looking to wear sunscreen and NOTHING else on your face maybe this is for you, otherwise there are WAY better sunscreens out there. Pilling like crazy
