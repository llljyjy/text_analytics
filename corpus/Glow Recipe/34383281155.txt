I have oily/combo skin so I am always really hesitant to try any SPF or product that tells me it will give me a glow, because for me it usually looks super oily. But this is not the case at all for this Glow Recipe SPF! Since it has niacinamide it helps control oil, and the other key ingredients help give a really natural and yummy glow. I also am breakout prone and Ive been using it for two weeks and no breakouts! I am so tickled with this product and love it!! SO GOOD!!
