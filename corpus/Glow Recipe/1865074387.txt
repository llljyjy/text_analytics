When I heard that glow recipe was coming out with a new product I was so excited. I’ve been using glow recipe for quite a while now. I started using this product & I love that it feels so lightweight. I love that when I wake up in the morning my skin looks super glowy & hydrated. I’ve used my overnight products before & this one of my favorites. This one is definitely going on my favorites list. A must for dry skin
