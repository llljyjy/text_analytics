Yesss an AHA with ferments and niacinamide? You bet it will brighten your skin and make it all glowy and smooth. It’s gently scented and absorbs into skin easily. I just wish the texture wasn’t sooo goopy and is easier to use. Woke up with smooth and glowy skin as it says I will on the lid. Like it! nan
