Too expensive. There are better SPFs out there. This was a real disappointment because I like the Glow Recipe brand. This SPF is so thick, sticky, and piles up. Itâ€™s not even glowy at all.  If you want to feel your face sticky the whole day, then this is truly the sunscreen for you. A disappointing SPF
