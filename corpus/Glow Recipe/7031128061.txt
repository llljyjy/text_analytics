This new Strawberry Smooth serum from Glow Recipe is absolutely amazing! I’m already in love with the dew drops and the salicylic acid serum feels really good on the skin but it’s super gentle. I’ve been having a lot of hormonal breakouts around my chin and this is helped clear them up quite a bit. With many salicylic acid serums, I have to use them sparingly because I can be sensitive. But I had no issues at all with this one. And it smells like strawberries! Glow Recipe does it again! Another HIT from Glow Recipe!
