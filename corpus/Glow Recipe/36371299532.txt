This has an initial great, light taste of watermelon but it fades really quickly. It does a great job at smoothing, but the moisturizing effects don’t last very long and I need to reapply often. The color is light (in a nice way - I don’t wear any makeup so prefer something ’natural’). Sometimes the little crystals stay stuck on your lips which is a bit weird. Overall it’s nice but could use some improvements. Nice color, smoothes lips, but doesn't last long
