Wow! The glow recipe sunscreen is truly something else. It soaks right in and leaves this beautiful glow. The texture is really light and smells the very faintest of watermelon. I really love how it does not leave any sort of film after it soaks in. Itâ€™s definitely a must have for summer this year! I love this sunscreen!
