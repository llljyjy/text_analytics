I really really wanted to love this. I purchased it with the plum plumping serum (which I like and have purchased before) but my skin for whatever reason did not like it at all and I ended up returning it. I’m not going to give this a totally horrible rating because I still think it’s a great product for others with different skin types (I’m combination with acne prone tendencies). It’s very light weight and smells nice. Only one thing to note, I wore it under makeup (both moisturizer and foundation  are water based) and it broke my makeup up mid day. Just something to consider. Back to Tatcha I go! Reeeallly wanted to love this
