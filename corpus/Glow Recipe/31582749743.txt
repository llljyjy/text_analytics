Great great great ingredients, they implemented the benefits of strawberry to the skin while still using it as a smell to add to the product. i wouldn’t even call this a fragrance in the product because they use strawberry water in the blend. which naturally has enzymes which helps reduce oil. while the succinic acid hydrates, soothes, and decongests the skin. while the BHA and AHA in the back runs which helps with blemishes and dead skin cells which helps smooths the look and fine lines on your skin. just get it you’ll have better looking skin in a week minimum. What do you expect
