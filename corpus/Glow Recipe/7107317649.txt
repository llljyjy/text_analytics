Beautiful texture! I am absolutely in love with how this serum smells and feels on the skin. It smells like sweet fruity candy and although it has some chemical exfoliants it didn’t sting my sensitive skin at all. It really sank beautifully into the skin and I absolutely love that it didn’t pill or sit weird under makeup or sunscreen. Gorgeous product for sensitive skin. Gorgeous texture!
