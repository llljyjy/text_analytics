Really great SPF option from Glow Recipe! I was impressed with how light-weight this felt. Blended in easily and absorbed nicely into the skin as well, leaving behind a really pleasant glow without looking or feeling greasy. Skin feels hydrated and smooth! Can’t say yet if there’s a clear skincare benefit but I think all the dewy queens would love this! Great SPF Option for the Dewy Queens
