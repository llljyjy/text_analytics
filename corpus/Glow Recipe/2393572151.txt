I have been using glow recipeâ€™s guava gel eye cream since few days ago and I noticed prominent difference on my under eye area. I have sensitive under eyes but this gel is so hydrating and not sticky, it absorbs quickly, leaving skin plump. Just few days of using it and I am already a fan of this product. It sits very well under the makeup and makeup applies smoothly over it. I am so happy!!! My under eyes are the happiest
