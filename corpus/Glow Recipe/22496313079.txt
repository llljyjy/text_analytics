I’m a big fan of Glow Recipe and this guava vitamin C bright eye gel cream has all the bells and whistles your under eyes need.  A little goes a long way the scent is very light, the texture of the gel melts quickly to brighten under your eyes. I’ve been using this for awhile now and have seen the dark circles lighten over time as I continue to use. Must have for tired eyes
