I received a sample from Glow Recipe in exchange for an honest review about their product.  I find the Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser to be hydrating, soothing, and it left my skin glowing.  I use many Glow Recipe products and this one will be added to my routine, as well.  I enjoyed the lotion-to-foamy lather effect this product had and the fact that it didn’t strip my face dry made this product a good one for me.  I prefer the blueberry bounces’ scent much better but it would not be the deciding factor for my purchasing this product. Another Hit made by Glow Recipe!!
