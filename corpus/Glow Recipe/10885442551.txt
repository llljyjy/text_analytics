Everything about it makes me feel joy :) starting from the container with its pink colour, to its mild lovely scent and lastly but defiantly not least is its feeling on my skin. I have a combo skin, and in many times I only use that toner instead of the whole skin routine to give my skin a break and still be moisturised. nan
