I had such high hopes for this product.  It really does perform well and feels good on my skin. However, there is a strong mildew smell to it.  It lingers the whole time I’m wearing it. I ended up having to wash it off during the night.  I’m not sure if I got a bad batch or what but very disappointing. Mildew smell
