This is my first time trying product with AHA. I was little concerned that it could be little harsh on my skin but itâ€™s not. I apply it twice a week as my pm skincare moisturizer. It is not tacky and the texture is smooth. It is very hydrating and I notice my skin feeling smoother and clearer when I wake up. nan
