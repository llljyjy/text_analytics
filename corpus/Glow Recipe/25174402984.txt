When I first saw this product, I was so excited to get my hands on it ! I have always enjoyed how hydrating and refreshing Glow products are. I was a little apprehensive of the product at first, as the texture seemed off and it had no scent. However the product applies smoothly and flawlessly to the face and creates a slight, refreshing tingly feel. I woke up with even smoother and brighter skin. My skin looked and felt more plump as well! I canâ€™t wait to keep using this product and see even more results. Love !
