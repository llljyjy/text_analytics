I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest review. The texture of the formula is silky and hydrating. Applying it feels wonderfully hydrating. I’m not sure I see a huge difference in my overall brightness of my skin yet, but I will continue to rotate it into my skincare routine. My skin does feel soft in the morning and overall smoother when I wake up. I really love over night masks so I’m happy to add this one to my roster. I apply it at the end of my evening skincare routine before going to bed and it layers seamlessly. The packaging is absolutely beautiful, but I do think the consistency of the formula would have better lent it’s to a pump bottle as opposed to the jar. So Hydrating!
