i’m only giving this 2 stars because it smells good. this sunscreen pills like crazy!! wether it’s over bare face or layered on other products, it pills. i mean once you rub off all the pilling, it looks glowy, but that’s just not enough to consider ever buying this again. avoid if you can! PILLS SO BAD
