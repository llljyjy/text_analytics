I love the way this cleanser felt, it starts as a luxurious cream that slowly transitions to a light foam. Scent was barely there and not at all noticable, not that i would have minded. I love how my face did not feel tight and raw after using it. My skin feels so much smoother, this is the perfect cleanser for the cold winter months. Best cleanser hands down
