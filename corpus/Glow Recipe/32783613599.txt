Listen, I get it. $40 moisturizer is insane. Trust me when I say I’ve tried tons and tons of brands. I’m drawn to kbeauty for sure, and this brand is by far the best I’ve tried. My skin is finally cleared up, acne is gone. I’m primarily using this brand, with the Inkey List Salicylic Acid dash wash and Super Goop sunscreen. I attribute my skin clearing up to this brand as I’ve used the face wash and sunscreen combo with other brands too and haven’t seen such results.I like this cleanser, I do. It smells nice and is very gentle. However, as a solo cleanser this leaves a lot to be desired.It says it can be used as a makeup remover- I won’t be trying this as Clinique has the market cornered on the best makeup remover.I’m primarily using Inkey List Salicylic acid cleanser- every time I’ve tried to swap I break out. I use this Glow Recipe in the morning because it’s so gentle.Is it worth the price tag? No, not for me. So many other brands have amazing face washes that cost a fraction of this price. nan
