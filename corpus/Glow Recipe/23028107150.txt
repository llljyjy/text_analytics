I was a fan of the original GR watermelon sleep mask, so I was excited to try the new improved watermelon sleep mask. It smells lovely. It applies nicely. My skin looks much more refreshed the day after using. I like that it’s thicker than the old mask!  I use every 3 days. I’m really loving the new improved mask. Love!
