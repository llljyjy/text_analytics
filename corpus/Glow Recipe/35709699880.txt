I really wanted to like this product.  But with all the hype I dont feel its anything special. I USE  a department store face SPF that I prefer. I dont see this one becoming my go to at all. It always leaves my face feeling tacky. I  personally donâ€™t always wear a full dace of makeup so Its NOT for me.  I do think it has a nice smell. I do not foresee myself purchasing it again. Money not well spent!
