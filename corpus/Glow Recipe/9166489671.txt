Great if you’re not a makeup wearer! Under makeup this product pills sooo terribly - and it made all my makeup look dryer and cakey - even tinted moisturizers!! I tried over my skincare, under my skincare - and nothing worked. My skincare routine is primarily glow recipe so I was super disappointed this wouldn’t work under any makeup. If you’re not a makeup wearer at all, this is a lovely product! Doesn’t pill with sunscreen, but beware it will pill even under concealer. Great option for no makeup.
