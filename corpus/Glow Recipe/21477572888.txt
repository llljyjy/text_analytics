I received the Glow Recipe Vitamin C Eye Cream in exchange for an honest review. I’ve tried a handful of Glow Recipe products and this one seems quite similar to their other products in terms of package aesthetic, texture, and scent. I’ve used it daily in the AM prior to makeup application and have had no issues. It has a really pleasant and light scent and adds the right amount of moisture to my under eyes. I havent seen nor did I expect a drastic difference in my under eye brightness but I’m hopeful that after longer use the vitamin C will begin to prove effective. This is also definitely a splurge type of eye cream. nan
