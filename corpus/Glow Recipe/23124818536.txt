my forehead was breaking out the worst it’s ever been. all i’d been using was a face wash, and moisturizer. i decided to go back to using this toner after trying it out for a couple weeks a long time ago, and put just a little bit in my hands and patted it into my face in the morning right after washing my face, and right after night showers. i didn’t put a lot just to be careful. the pictures are 3 days apart, jan 1, and jan 4. the results were crazy. not sure if it was just because of this product, but either way, i’m happy how it turned out. absolutely insane
