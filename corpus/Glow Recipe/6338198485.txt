This is a really nice product overall - I love the rich texture that can be used all around the eye. It’s surprisingly hard to find an eye cream designed to be used on the eyelid in addition to the under eye area! I haven’t noticed a different in eye brightness, unfortunately, but it is a really soothing and nourishing eye cream nonetheless. nan
