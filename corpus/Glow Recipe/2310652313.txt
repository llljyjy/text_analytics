I am literally obsessed with all Glow Recipe products and this one is no different. I have tried many, many under eye solutions and this one delivers. The texture is gel-like and absorbs very quickly. It also layers well if you want to do a retinol or anything under it. The area under my eyes instantly felt hydrated, and when I woke up the next day appeared brighter. I tend to use this product as a nighttime eye mask of sorts - I love how my under eyes look waking up with it. It also works well on the lid and the area beneath the brow. Not the biggest sized product, but a little goes a long way. And just like all Glow Recipe, the packaging is GORGEOUS and sustainable! Glow Does It Again
