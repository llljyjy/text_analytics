I had the privilege to test this product out and make a review upon my findings. First off I love Glow Recipe and have gotten items there that I have been happy with and would most definitely repurchase, however not this one. It smells luscious and absorbs instantly but it dried my skin out and I experienced a small amount of burning. I certainly feel that it would work for the right skin type but on my mature, getting drier as I age skin, it wasnâ€™t a hit. I would not want someone to solely base their decision of purchasing this because of my experience; as with everything the majority of the reviews tell more about a product and I am sure my experience will be in the minority.  Thank you Glow Recipe and I will continue to support and recommend your products. nan
