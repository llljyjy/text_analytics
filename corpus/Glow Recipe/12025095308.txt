First off: this is the best smelling face cream.  It’s what I imagine the sugar plum fairy uses at night.  This consistency is almost jelly-like and feels cooling and don’t in your skin.  I noticed it left my skin nice and dewy.  It works well enough on my winter skin, but because of the cooling effect I think this one will be a summer must have too! nan
