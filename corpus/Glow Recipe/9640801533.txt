I tried this and the plum plump serum at same time so not sure if this was only caused by just one of the products but I had one of the worst breakouts I’ve ever had. I have very dry skin especially in the winter but usually pretty clear skin. I rarely have acne and after using this and the serum I was COVERED in pimples. Adding these products was the only thing I changed in my skincare/makeup routine. It also didn’t really help my dry skin at all. The marketing of this company is top tier and definitely had me thinking I needed these products in their adorable pink packaging but it made me skin absolutely terrible. Caused a terrible breakout.
