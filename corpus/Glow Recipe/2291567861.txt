Glow Recipe has done it again! After using this just one time my skin looked more glowy the next day. I now use it 2-3 times per week and my skin looks brighter, smoother and more radiant! I typically use it as a last step after toner, serum and moisturizer and it layers so well.  Canâ€™t wait to continue to see results! So impressed!!
