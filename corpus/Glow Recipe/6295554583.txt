I’ve been using glow recipe products for more than 2 years now, so I trust the brand enough to know their products are worth it! I love the fact that the guava eye cream helps slowly brighten the skin around the eyes without burning or irritation. I also like that it helps the skin around my eyes match my skin tone and not look ghostly around the eyes (some vitamin c products don’t work well on black skin). Great eye cream!
