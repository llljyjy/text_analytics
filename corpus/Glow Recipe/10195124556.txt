I love this vit c serum! :) i am using this serum as a stepping stone to build up tolerance as I have sensitive skin. (This serum has about 11% vit c and im trying to build up to 15%-20% for max anti-aging effects lol) Nonetheless, this serum makes my skin so glowy and soft!! This serum makes me want to try the whole Glow Recipe line. Love Love Love!! glowy and soft skin, would repurchase
