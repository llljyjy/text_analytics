This serum is a nice, more gentle exfoliating serum that most people could easily incorporate into their nighttime skin care routine. My skin feels & looks smooth while using this. While itâ€™s on the gentle side of chemical exfoliants, I would still recommend slowly adding it to your routine (1x per week to start) to see how your skin reacts to it. nan
