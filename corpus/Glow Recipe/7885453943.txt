This has become my absolute favorite setting spray. The spray bottle dispenses product beautifully and does not leave any noticeable droplets on the face. It is a very dewy formula so it probably won’t be the best for those who have really oily skin. A little goes a long way but it makes the skin look very glowey and moisturized. FYI, it does have a strong watermelon scent which doesn’t smell very good in my opinion but the smell disappears within the first few minutes. Holy grail setting spray
