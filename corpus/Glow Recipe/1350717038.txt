I’ve only used this a couple of times, but I love Glow Recipe and couldn’t wait to test it out. So far so good! It feels nice on my skin. I have dry skin, so I was a little worried about the AHA being too strong for it. But it’s gentle enough to use for me. I like it a lot and can’t wait to see results over time! So far so good!
