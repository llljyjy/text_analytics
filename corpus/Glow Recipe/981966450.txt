I purchased the full size after trying the samples for 14 days. I love Salicylic Acid, but I stopped using this because I find that it’s not compatible with the oil-based products that I use, and tends to pill. It did clear some blackheads and clogged pores initially, then became less effective. Also I’m not sure how I feel about the fragrance, I may be sensitive; but the smell does dissipate shortly after the product is applied. I’ve added it to the pile of gimmicky Glow Recipe products I don’t really use. It’s Okay
