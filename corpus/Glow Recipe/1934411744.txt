This serum has been great so far, I have pretty reactive/sensitive skin and usually can instantly tell if I’m going to have a bad reaction, but luckily that didn’t happen with this serum and it left my skin feeling smooth/soft.  I haven’t had any active acne in awhile (knock on wood) so hopefully this will help keep them at bay.  I am more excited to see that it is helping to lighten my acne scars.  This is my first glow recipe product and needless to say I am now more interested in trying other products :) Great so far on my sensitive skin!
