I’ve been using this product for two weeks and have been really enjoying it. The scent is subtle and it is not sticky. I struggle with breakouts and uneven skin. After using this, I notice that my breakouts decrease in size and my skin feels smoother the next day. I am lazy when it comes to adding more steps into my skincare routine so I’m glad this helps my acne and skin texture, all with just one serum. nan
