This was a nice, gently exfoliating hydrating toner. You do have to follow the directions on this - pat into the skin, and pat on any other products you are using on top. If you rub, this will cause pilling/balling up. I have this issue with many Glow Recipe products unfortunately. It does plump the skin and give it a nice glow, and I do enjoy using it quite a bit. I have to use it a bit longer to notice any pore tightening effects but Iâ€™m hopeful. I only use this at night, and pair with sunscreen during the day. I would not recommend using this under makeup because of the pilling issue. Hydrating toner that gives a glow
