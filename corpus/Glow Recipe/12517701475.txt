The NEW Watermelon Glow AHA night treatment is formulated with 2.5% AHA, 7 weights of hyaluronic acid, Niacinamide, and quinoa peptide. When used 2-3x per week it will exfoliate, brighten, firm, and plump the skin. All while maintaining the skins moisture barrier. It’s has a wonderful soft jelly gooey texture that instantly plumps the skin. I wake up to soft, smooth, and hydrated skin. Plus it smells like watermelon candy so what’s not to love!
