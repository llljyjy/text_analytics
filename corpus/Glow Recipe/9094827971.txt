This would be good or even great if it didn’t pill. i know how to do skincare and i know it’s not a me problem. its starts to pill/crust off throughout the day. at first i liked it bc it didn’t do that right away and there weren’t little balls of ss on my hand, but it you looks closely it pulls terribly pills and crusts off
