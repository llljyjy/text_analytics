I am so disappointed. I wanted to love this. Scented products don’t bother me and I love Glow Recipe’s entire watermelon line, so I was so excited to get this and sure I’d love it (I even tossed the box right away). It does have that watermelon scent but it also smells like drugstore sunscreen. Not necessarily a bad thing but just an observation. The real problem here is the pilling. I cannot get this stuff to lay down smooth on me if my life depended on it. I’ve tried everything. I will be returning it unfortunately. pills pills pills
