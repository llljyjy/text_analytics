This doesnâ€™t seem to work for everyone but works very well for me. I have tried other BHA toners, but this one seems to work best for my combination, early 30s skin. I have huge pores on my nose due to years of very oily skin and consistent blackheads. This has made a very noticeable difference on my nose and pores. For the rest of my face, it gives me a very radiant glass skin look. A must have for me. No more nose strips
