This night treatment has been great for my skin. I apply it at night and leave it on and I wake up with my skin looking so Glowy and feeling hydrated. I have super dry skin so this has helped so much!! It also has helped eliminate some texture I had and minimize my pores. I was gifted this by Glow recipe, but my opinion stays the same!! nan
