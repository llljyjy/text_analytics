I’m not a mist person so I didn’t expect to love this product but I really didn’t feel like it did anything. It feels nice for about a minute and then had no noticeable effect whatsoever. It’s also pretty irritating to have to shake it before every use since it separates quickly while sitting. If you’re looking for hydration or brightening I’d really recommend just using a serum instead. nan
