I really like this product as opposed to other sunscreens. Do I think I would spend more than $15 on a sunscreen that is so little? No. My skin did feel really good though & the sunscreen smelt great. It didn’t give that white/chalky overlay that most sunscreens do, which is nice. I had my mother try it & she loved the smell but did say it was a little bit heavy on her skin. We both loved the look that it gave us- SO glowy, but not in a greasy way. The texture was kind of like most other sunscreens, but I feel like this one was a little “thicker,“ not necessarily thicker, but I feel like I needed more of this sunscreen to apply to my whole face rather than other brands. If you want a little more boujee/nicer sunscreen, I definitely recommend this. nan
