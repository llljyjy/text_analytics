I really enjoy a hybrid sunscreen (chemical & mineral) and the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow SPF 50 was no exception.  Blends nicely, has a hint of a watermelon scent, leaves a glowy finish & I did not experience any pilling.  I wore this under my Merit Minimalist Stick & set it with Saie Airset to keep some of the glow.  Because it is such a dewy finish, I definitely think this would be nice for dry to normal skin.  May be a bit too much, if youâ€™re really oily.  And I recommend using a setting powder as well. A great hybrid spf for normal to dry skin type
