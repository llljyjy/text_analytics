You know what, this is pretty solid. I generally prefer to know the concentration of the active ingredients, though, which we do not know in this product (how much of the “clarity acid complex“ is BHA?). My skin definitely feels soft the next morning after using this. I go back and forth how I feel about the scent. It smells like strawberries, but a little sour (which is typical for AHA/acid products to smell a little sour, like the Good Genes Lactic Acid). I like the inclusion of hyaluronic acid in this serum, too, so it’s a one-and-done type deal. pretty solid with some caveats
