Glow Recipe sent me the Watermelon Glow SPF 50 as a gift for my honest review. I use a sunscreen every morning. It doesn’t matter if I’m leaving the house or staying in. I always put it on. I’ve tried numerous sunscreens and this one by far is my favorite. I love how it goes on; so smooth. It doesn’t leave a white cast and is super blendable. The glow it gives is amazing! I also love that the scent is super light and not overbearing. This product is reef-safe, a mineral + chemical spf, so it does have zinc oxide in it.  I’m actually amazed at how blendable it is and how it doesn’t leave a white cast for the 12.1% zinc oxide it contains. Glow Recipe,  you did good! Best SPF I’ve used yet
