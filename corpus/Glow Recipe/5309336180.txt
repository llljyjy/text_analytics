This was my first time trying something from Glow Recipe. The first thing I noticed is that the box it came in had instructions inside on how to recycle the package! The box is paper/cardboard and the serum is in a recyclable glass jar. So I need to mention- the jar is SO freakin’ cute!!! It looks like a little strawberry!!! As for the product itself, I struggle with hormonal acne and I started using this a week before my period. As I’m going through it, I have definitely noticed less acne on my face so yay! I recommend waiting like 5 minutes before layering with other products, this went nicely under my makeup. nan
