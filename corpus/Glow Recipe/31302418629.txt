I use this every morning after the Hyaluronic acid serum because my skin is so dry. I’m not too sure if this is for people with super dry skin. My skin feels very tacky and not as moisturized as I feel it should be. I’m still debating on going back to this when I run out. Might try something different but I do love the glow recipe products! I would recommend if you have slightly dry or oily skin. nan
