I don’t typically incorporate AHAs into my routine that often because I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this product 2-3 times per week. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks so much better and my texture has improved. The fragrance is very subtle and isn’t overwhelming and I haven’t experienced any irritation yet. I’ve also noticed that my discoloration and dark marks have improved. My Skin Looks So Much Better
