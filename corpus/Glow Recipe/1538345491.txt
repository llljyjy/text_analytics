I wish I could love this, glow recipe is my favorite skincare brand. But it does not work on top of their other products. when I use a glow recipe serum and moisturizer, let them dry down, and try to use this, it just pulls up and takes off my other products. I also feel like it doesnâ€™t work as well as a usual spf 50.. Wanted to love
