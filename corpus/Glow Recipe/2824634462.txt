I thought this Sunscreen was okay. I definitely couldn’t do 3 fingers of product because I think it’s too thick. It ended up bunching up and peeling off towards the permitted of my face. It felt icky. I ended up putting very little on my face so that it doesn’t peel but honestly I don’t feel protected. It did end up having a nice finish though when I put little on. Peels off a bit. Not the best.
