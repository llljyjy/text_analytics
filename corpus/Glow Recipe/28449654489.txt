I am obsessed with Glow Recipe products and this new product does not disappoint. From their sustainable glass packaging to the thoughtful design( it looks like a strawberry) I really canâ€™t enough. I also appreciate that they use all of the strawberry to minimize food waste. Its amazing! Now about the actual Serum... The serum itself is not sticky and gel like which I love because I live in a humid area.  The serum quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it hydrated. nan
