I really wanted to love this product, as I do love most of Glow Recipe’s skincare items. The packaging is super cute. However, you only get 1 oz of product for $40 and unfortunately I saw little to no results. It feels good on the face (a little sticky) but over time I saw no change in my skin texture. I prefer Paula’s Choice exfoliant that has similar ingredients and is more affordable! Just my opinion. Unfortunately it was a miss for me...
