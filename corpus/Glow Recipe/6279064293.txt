This brightened and hydrated my skin without any irritation. It has a subtle watermelon scent and a nice gel texture. I love how it feels on my skin. It absorbs nicely. Slightly tacky at first but after being fully absorbed it feels nice. I use at night and wash off in the morning. My skin feels plump and looks radiant. Packaging is so cute and sturdy! Love this !
