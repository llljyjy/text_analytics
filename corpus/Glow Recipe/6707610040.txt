I have super dry winter skin, so this is not enough. I won’t give it 1 star or anything because I’ll for sure be using this during the summer. it does make my skin super oily since I tried to use more than recommended, but also leaves it dry somehow so when my skin is not as dry I’m hoping it’ll be perfect for summer. I love the packaging idea, it is a small amount of product but you’re only supposed to use a dime size amount so if used properly it will last you a long time. also I have a few products from this company and I love the other products and the watermelon smell is the best, but putting this on top just gives you a weird muddled smell of both . Not meant for dry-er skin
