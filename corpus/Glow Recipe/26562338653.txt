I really wanted to love this product, but after a week of using it i noticed unusual breakouts and i noticed that the product didnt really absorb into my skin much; it left it feeling sticky and like there was a film over my skin. Very fragrance heavy too; I wiuld not recommend to people who have sensitive and acne prone skin. Heavy Fragrance, Left a Film on my skin
