I’ve been using this new eye cream for a couple of weeks and like it very much so far!  It is creamy, very moisturizing, and gentle.  I haven’t noticed lessening of my fine lines but I know that the effects of vitamin C take awhile to show up. I are hopeful that continuing use will show results! Lovely eye cream!
