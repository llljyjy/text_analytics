I’ve only tried a couple of acid treatments previously - so this is still fairly new to me. I have fairly sensitive skin - not super sensitive, but enough that I do patch test because odd things will wreck my skin. Once this passed the patch test - I went ahead and used it all over the face and it was amazing. This is a light gel like texture with a light, pleasing strawberry scent. It almost reminds me of a lighter version of the V05 strawberry shampoo I used as a kid (back in the 80s and early 90s) After a few uses, my skin is looking a bit clearer and I’m requiring less intense moisturizers to hydrate my skin. It’s also working well with my normal skin care routine (Colourpop Am to the PM Cleanser and The Ordinary Moisturizer primarily) and works well with everything. My Skin Loves This
