Overall, I think the sunscreen is light-to-medium in terms of thickness on my face and it does have a bit of a sunscreen smell to it. I don’t smell any watermelon, but the sunscreen smell isn’t too overpowering. Heads up, make sure to pat it into your skin AFTER your skin care routine is done! That will help it not look so white on your skin and reduce it from mixing with your skin care nan
