I normally never write reviews, but this has changed the game. I’ve had bad acne for years and the only other exfoliant that’s helped is Paula’s choice bha. That said, it was easy to go overboard with that exfoliant and wreck my skin barrier if used too frequently. I can use glow recipe’s bha+aha serum nightly and not have any issues! It’s cleared my acne quite a bit and helped improved my texture after using for about a month so far. Must buy!! 11/10 absolutely incredible!!
