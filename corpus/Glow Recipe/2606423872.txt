This is the third cleanse balm I have used and I just ordered it to try something new. I had high hopes but I am not a fan at all. It doesnâ€™t melt into the skin the way the other balms do and it seems that I need to use more product. I will use the rest of the container but I will not repurchase. Big fan of the Drunk Elephant cleansing balm and will be going back to that. nan
