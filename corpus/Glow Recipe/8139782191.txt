I got this about a week ago on a whim. I have combination skin - more on the dry side. I also suffer from raging hormonal acne (aka 1 week of the month my face is a cystic pimple mess even though i’m on birth control) My cheek pores are also very large and i often get blackheads. In the week i’ve been using this i’ve had surprisingly really good results. My cheek pores have noticeably shrunken, my hormonal acne has definitely calmed down and my skin just looks healthier in general.The only comment I have is I find that this serum stings, it doesn’t bother me but I know others may be more sensitive so something to keep in mind. It goes away after 5-10 min. Happy (so far)
