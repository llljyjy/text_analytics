This cream is my new favorite . I do have high pigmented dark circle under my eyes and after using this cream I had noticed a positive change. My eyes does not look so exhausted anymore. I absolutely love the fact that I do not feel discomfort or any irritation after applying the cream under my eyes. The cream does not leave an oily feeling but it does hydrates pretty good. I found the packaging and bottle to be so cute. Great gift for anyone It is good
