I cannot tell you how long I’ve been wanting glow recipe to put out a strawberry scented product! Thankfully it’s something I really need in my routine. You can use it twice a day so it’s gentle. I have rosacea and haven’t had any irritation from it so far. I’ll be honest and say that I’ve not been using it that long but I have noticed fewer breakouts while using it. I still have texture but it’ll take a while for that to go away. If Sephora will let me update this - I will. As always the packaging is beautiful nan
