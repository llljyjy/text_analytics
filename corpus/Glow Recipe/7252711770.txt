I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’m so happy to add to my Glow Recipe collection. I absolutely love their products and this does not disappoint, so much that I look forward to this step in my skincare routine. It smells so good and it always stayscool, which gives a soothing effect on skin especially in the morning.A little definitely goes a long way and it absorbs easy on skin. It’s been great for my winter skin. And what I love the most is that it’s refillable! That is such a game changer and I hope more of their products go that route as well. Such a delight to use every day
