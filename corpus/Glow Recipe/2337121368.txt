I have been on the hunt for sunscreen that would not make my face oily and is easy to apply. I think I found it.Since I use retinol at night, wearing sunscreen during the day is super important on my fair skin. I love Glow recipe products and this new sunscreen is everything! I love the fact that it is SPF50 and combines niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. I feel protected all day! nan
