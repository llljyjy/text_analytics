For my acne-prone skin, incorporating acid into my skincare regimen is a must. The fact that this is in a gel form makes it feel lightweight on my skin and it’s wonderful for layering products as well. So far, it has performed wonderfully on my skin (no new pimples) and it is not irritating to me, which I appreciate. I’m looking forward to seeing the effects over time. nan
