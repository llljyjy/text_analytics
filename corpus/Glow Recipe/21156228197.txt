I liked the consistency of the mask and the fact that it contains only 2.5% AHA. I’m trying to avoid strong chemical exfoliation so this is great to have! It also feels super moisturizing so I skip my moisturizers the nights I use it. The watermelon scent is subtle (almost not there?) so that’s nice too. My skin feels slightly smoother the next day. I wish there was more product though because it might take a lot of uses for this to give some incredible results. i like it!
