I really do love this product. When I smelled it at first I was hesitant because I thought the scent would irritate my skin but itâ€™s become a staple for me! Last time I tried niacinamide I broke out horribly but I have had no issues with this! I typically use it as a primer and my makeup lays beautifully every time. love!!!
