Truly the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. The white cast is very noticeable. The pilling is the number one issue for me. I pat it in gently and yet it is still pilling. The only upside of this product is the ingredients & the glow but thatâ€™s easy to find elsewhere. Awful , I do not recommend! pilling
