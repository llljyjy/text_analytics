Amazing product, I’m not surprised ! I received this new Glow Recipe Product complimentary from Glow Recipe for my honest review. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now & im quite happy with it. Smells so light and beautiful, has a gel like consistency, easy to rub in. It does pill just a bit if you use too much, so be careful you don’t use too much. Just one small pump is more than enough for the whole face. It’s makes my skin feel soft & glowy! I look forward to seeing the long term affects of this beautiful serum! Love it just don’t use too much
