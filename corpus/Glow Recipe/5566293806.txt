Already repurchased as I can’t be without it in my routine! I love this product. I had been using a salicylic acid-based toner for a while as I always have a few small pimples on my chin and under my nose, and am prone to blackheads on and around my nose. I have dry skin and so I often find most toners dry me out, and I tend to find toning an annoying step. I got this with the hope I’d still get the benefit of salicylic but in something easier to use, and this definitely lives up to that. I often use it twice a day (under sunscreen during the day) and I have found that it keeps my blackheads at bay, stops pimples I get from being very big or serious, and helps to heal pimples quickly. I’ve gone through one bottle so I can confidently say that I’d recommend it! Gentle enough to use on my dry skin but effective enough to do it’s job! Gentle but Effective
