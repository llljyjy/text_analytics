Sometimes when I’m lazy I use this as my only cleaner instead of the first step in my double cleanse and it really does the job. It smells great, too! My only complaint is it’s pricey but it also incentivizes me to use it so you win some you lose some. Seems very gentle and doesn’t sting my eyes. nan
