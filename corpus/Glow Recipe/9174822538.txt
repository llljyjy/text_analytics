Giving 4 stars bc it is smaller than I expected compared to their other products. BUT I do LOVE this , I’ve been waiting for an spf I can use forever. I do not find this product pills . I use a  toner ,Hyaluronic acid, vitamin c , moisturizer , eye cream and then this spf and I find they all blend together very well. It’s a very light cream it doesn’t leave a white cast , it smells just like your typical spf with a hint of watermelon I’m obsessed. Please keep this product forever. Note : I have not tested it for sunburns as it is not the sunny where I live lately. love it
