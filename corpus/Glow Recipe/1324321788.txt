I bought this serum on a whim and I ended up loving it. The morning after I used it the first time, my skin was glowing and super soft. It got rid of all the texture I had due to dead skin cells building up. I liked it so much I used it 3 days in a row but I think that was probably too much so now I use it every other night and it’s been amazing. I find it is keeping most pimples away and if any pop up, it doesn’t stay for long. I was afraid the brand was hyped up before but now I’m going to be trying a few other of their products! Love!
