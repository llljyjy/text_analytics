This eye cream is nice. I canâ€™t say that I have seen life-changing results as others claim, but it did seem to brighten up my eye area and is moisturizing. My boyfriend has more wrinkles around his eyes, and I tried it on him and saw immediate results. However, I am disappointed that the bottle is empty after using barely 1 pump per day for 6 weeks. The bottle definitely looks like it contains more than it really does. I tried using half-pumps to make it last longer since 1 pump seemed a bit much, and still went through the bottle in 6 weeks. Nice eye cream, but less product than expected
