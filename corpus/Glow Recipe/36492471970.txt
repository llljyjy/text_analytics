I was so excited to try this product and it did not disappoint! The texture is so smooth and the smell is to die for. I typically have sensitive skin and products with fragrance tend to irritate my skin, but after about a weeks use of this product, it has only done great things for my skin! After applying this, my skin feels smooth and looks super glowy. It keeps my skin feeling refreshed. I am excited to continue to incorporate this product into my routine! I love this stuff!!
