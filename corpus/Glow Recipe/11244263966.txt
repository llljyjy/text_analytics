Wow! I can’t begin to express my gratitude to glow recipe for creating such an amazing product. As someone who suffers from dark spots due to acne and hyperpigmentation, nothing has worked until I started using glow recipe’s vitamin c serum. As long as you have a solid skincare routine with products that target dark spots and hyperpigmentation, this should work for you as well. I have EXTREMELY dry skin so I double moisturize to combat that. I’m currently using tatcha’s rice wash cleanser, paula’s choice (on days where I don’t wear makeup and don’t double cleanse/exfoliate with peace out blemish balm), glow recipe vitamin c serum, and skin fix+ moisturizer along with cerave moisturizing cream. The bumps on my face have disappeared, I see less and less redness on my cheek area AND my acne scars are fading. Like any other product, it’s not going to work unless you have other products to help combat your concerns. It’s definitely on the pricey side but I feel it’ll go a long way. I saw major improvement after 3-4 days of use. I usually do one pump and it’s enough to cover my entire face. I also chose this one because it’s a whole lot cheaper than some of the other brands on Sephora. I definitely recommend giving this a try! A FOREVER STAPLE IN MY SKINCARE ROUTINE
