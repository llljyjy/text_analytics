Wake up to brighter, smoother skin with this night treatment! I use this alone and over other skincare; I find it works better without moisturizer, but that’s just personal preference. For my oily skin, this is more than enough to seal in my skin’s moisturizer. Teensy but sticky upon application but dries down quickly. Effective but very gentle; I use this in-between retinol nights and experienced no irritation. Effective and gentle!
