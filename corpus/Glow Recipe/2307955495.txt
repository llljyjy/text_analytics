Love from the first try!!! Evens out the skin tone, soothes, hydrated and plumped the skin. I truly enjoy this beautifully packaged mask, itâ€™s pretty and pink too. Texture is a dream, so smooth and creamy looking. Absorbing is quick, not too sticky overnight and replaced my cream for now. I use it as a last step in my nighttime skincare routine. Dreamy Mask
