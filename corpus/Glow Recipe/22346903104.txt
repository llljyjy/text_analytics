This sunscreen is literal perfection and the fact that it doesn’t leave a white cast is just cherry on top fora WOC like myself. It’s very light weight and absorbs within couple of minutes and leave a very natural dewy finish. I’ve been trying it out for 2weeks now and no breakouts which is huge for my sensitive skin. I’m sold and highly recommend this sunscreen! Approved by a WOC with acne-prone skin
