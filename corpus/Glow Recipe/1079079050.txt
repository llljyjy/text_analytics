I was very kindly gifted for free by Glow Recipe their newly reformulated Overnight AHA mask! I was a bit nervous because I love the old version but wow did they pack this full of gentle but effective actives. My skin is dewy, plump, glowing, and very clear and smooth the next day. This is super lovely and canâ€™t wait to continue using in my routine! Love the new formula!
