I think the product itself is nice. I have no complaints. However, it doesnâ€™t get 5 starts because the packaging is purposely misleading. basically, from the bottom of the label down, the packaging is solid plastic, so... the product is more like 3/4 of the bottle. is does have a tacky feel, but most of these serums do. That is not a complaint from me. I wish the pump got ALL the product out. It does not. So really, i have a serious issue with this packaging. Serious problems with packaging.
