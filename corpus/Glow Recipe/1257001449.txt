If only all moisturizers came with SPF 50! I adore this product and all its ingredients… niacinamide evens out my skin tone while HA hydrates and plumps. Not heavy or greasy. This is similar to Dermalogica Dynamic skin recovery but almost half the price. I have not tried under makeup yet so I’m not sure how well it would fit into your full makeup routine but this is a must for summer days out by the pool. nan
