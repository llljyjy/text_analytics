This product exceeded my expectations. I usually use a wet face cloth to remove my makeup. You don’t need a lot of product for it to do its job and it takes seconds to begin working. It smells yummy but isn’t overpowering. I have sensitive skin and this was gentle while removing all of my makeup. Will repurchase again and again :) Absolute need!!!!
