Glow Recipe really never disappoints. Everything from the packaging to the formula is absolutely perfect! The texture is very unique and unlike any other night treatments I’ve ever tried. It’s a lightweight, gel like consistency. It absorbs very nicely and doesn’t leave any sticky residue on my skin. It literally sinks into my face and feels softer, smoother and it’s very comfortable on my skin. nan
