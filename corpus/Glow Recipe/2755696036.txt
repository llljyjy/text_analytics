A really great, very moisturizing eye cream that Iâ€™ve seen some improvement with! The downside: this bottle is not the right shape for the cream. Only a few weeks into it and I need to move the pump around or try to scoop some out (barely possible) because the pump stops sucking up the thick texture. Reallyyyy unfortunate. Good formula, incompatible bottle
