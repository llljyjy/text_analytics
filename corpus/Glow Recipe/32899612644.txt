I got these glow drops after looking online for something that would help kind of brighten/glow up my skin. It smells strongly of watermelon, but I personally don’t mind it!It’s a liquid serum, but when you apply onto your face it has a very tacky feeling. Some other serums might have a more watery consistency, but if you are fine with the tackiness this is perfectly fine!I read many reviews that people will put it in their primer for makeup, but I personally put it on as the last step of my morning skincare routine right before I put on a moisturizer and sunscreen. Very nice but tacky
