I can truly say I love the way it this product makes my skin look so soft and glowing. The texture of the product is a little bit lighter than the regular sunscreen feel, but it goes on so nice and smooth. I love how glowy my skin gets when I use this, but I noticed it works better when I donâ€™t put makeup on top. The fragrance is a very light watermelon scent. Also the packaging is super cute for a bottle for sunscreen. Love this product, but with no makeup
