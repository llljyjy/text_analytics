Here’s the problem. It’s a great product that I believe has actually reduced some redness I have BUT it’s so hard to get past the price tag for such little product. Plus the pump is garbage but in the end I would recommend the product regardless. If you’re worried about the price tag find a product with ceramides in it and try that first. Great BUT…
