I love this toner, I originally bought the “mini size” to test it out and I came back for the full size as soon as I ran out, It’s perfect because I can use it in the morning or at night and it absorbs into the skin nicely. I’d recommend applying it with your hands because it does soak up pretty fast into a cotton round/ cotton ball and you’ll be wasting product. Definitely Worth it!
