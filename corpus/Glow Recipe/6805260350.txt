I really wanted to love this product, I was so excited for the launch! The packaging is adorable, I love the thick consistency of the cream and it seems super hydrating. Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to it and my under eye immediately swelled up on one side. I’m not typically sensitive to skincare products with Vitamin C so I didn’t think to do a test patch, but would recommend testing this before immediately going in under your eyes. nan
