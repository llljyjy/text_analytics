When I woke up after using this nighttime treatment my skin looked amazing! It was soft, hydrated, smoother, and just looked better overall. From the first night I saw results and that is amazing. I was not expecting that. I use this as a over night mask and as a wash off mask for a quick skin pick up for date night night. The texture is so soft and dreamy it makes it very relaxing to apply. MUST HAVE NIGHT TREATMENT!
