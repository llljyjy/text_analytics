I really wanted to like it. I love the glowy look and thought a little pore minimizing wouldn’t hurt, but I felt like this made my skin feel dry, especially when taking it off. I guess I just need that little bit of oil that my skin provides and this keeps it from coming out (which is kinda the purpose of the product ig). I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad product but I think my skin just doesn’t do well with niacinamide. But my friend who’s slightly oilier and acne prone loves it! Would I personally recommend? Meh, only if you have issues with oils and pores. nan
