With every freaking product containing niacinamide these days, I was a little nervous to try this because sometimes it can be irritating for my skin. First off, there’s barely a scent which I love. Second, it blends pretty well, not as easy as I expected going in but there’s no white cast or chalkiness on me. It leaves a beautiful glow and to address my first concern, makes my skin look GREAT. It evens out my complexion so well, takes away redness and makes me look awake. I rarely wear makeup these days and I deal with redness a lot, so a sunscreen that is calming in any way is ideal. My only complaint is that it feels kind of tacky to the touch and doesn’t really melt into the skin, but with how great it makes my skin appear, I can look past it. I also haven’t had issues with pilling but my morning skincare routine is very minimal. I took this pic to send to my friend to show her how even my complexion was lol. nan
