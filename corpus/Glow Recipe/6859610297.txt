I have a few other Glow Recipe products in my current skincare routine, and I’m excited for the Strawberry Smooth serum to become a part of that. It has a liquidy feel to it, without being sticky. It has a slight strawberry smell, which I love. My skin looks hydrated and glowy after using it, which is what I want for all my skincare. I also love that the brand strives for sustainability. Another GR product I’m happy to add to my routine
