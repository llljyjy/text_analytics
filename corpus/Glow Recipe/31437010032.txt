I really enjoyed the texture and how easily it foamed. It leaves a very nice and nourishing feeling on my face when other cleansers can make my face feel dry. The only thing that was slightly off-putting at first was the scent. Most Glow Recipe products have a lovely light smell, but I was not a huge fan of the scent. It wasn’t strong enough to not use the product, but it definitely took some getting used to. Overall, I enjoyed this product and the way it made my skin feel. It’s great for colder weather when my face is more dry! I like it!
