I absolutely love this vitamin c serum, I have tried several and I do not get the same kind of results I do with this one. I have a nervous habit of picking at the skin on my face which left me with a lot of dark spots and scarring. This serum has helped tremendously improve the appearance of my dark spots, and it also smells amazing. The only downside is that it is kind of expensive, and I find myself having to repurchase quite frequently, but I have not found another vit c serum that compares. nan
