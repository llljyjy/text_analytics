FINALLY an non exfoliating cleanser from GR!! Absolutely LOVE this cleanser! It’s creamy/foamy, doesn’t strip my skin & makes it feels nourish. It’s gentle, yet effective at removing the last of my makeup when I double cleanse with it. It’s worth it for everyone with sensitive skin, but all skin types in general. A MUST HAVE
