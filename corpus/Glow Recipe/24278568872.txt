I got this in the trendmood box and was waiting to finish my Tatcha Water Cream I had opened before I started this. I just was tired of the water cream not leaving my skin feeling as moisturized as I liked so I just now went ahead and opened this. Instantly this felt like heaven on my skin and I had to come leave a review. It feels so luxurious and smoothing instantly. Such an amazing feeling and experience that I will continue to use this and be happy to do my skincare now. I’m not getting paid to say this and obviously didn’t get this product free. I might even like this better than the dewy skin which is crazy to me. It even has a nice light scent. Instant love and you can feel the hylauronic acid working right away as far as plumping the skin. amazing!!
