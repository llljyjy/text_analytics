I love this Strawberry Serum and am so happy to have it in my hands. Glow Recipe is one of my favorite skincare brands. I’m so very excited they created this strawberry scent. It has a light scent that doesn’t linger and is amazing. I love how it makes my skin look and how it gently exfoliates. It doesn’t feel heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a soft and beautiful glow. My texture seems so much smoother while using this serum. This will DEFINITELY be another purchase when I run out! I love it! I love this serum!
