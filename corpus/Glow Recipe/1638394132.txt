I love the combination of vitamin c, niacinamide, peptides and caffeine in this. I’ve been using separate products to get this combo. I struggle dark with dark circles under my eyes and dry skin around my eyes as well. This eye cream is super hydrating and goes on smoothly before makeup. My eyes look less tired and my skin feels more plump. I’m hooked on this eye cream as it does so much at once! Effective Powerhouse of Ingredients
