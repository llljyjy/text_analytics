This new Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment is so good on my skin! I’ve been such a fan of Glow Recipe since their first launch so this product takes me back. The consistency of this product is quite runny and I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be like that. However, it feels so good on my skin. It makes my skin feel very hydrated and in the morning, my skin feels really smooth! I, of course, need to continue using this product to see longer lasting results. But for using it for about a week now, my skin has been loving it! My Skin Feels so SMOOTH
