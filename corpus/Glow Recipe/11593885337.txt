I’ve only used this a couple of times but really enjoy the sensory experience! The texture is jelly like but it glides on beautifully as the last step of my evening skincare routine. I love incorporating AHAs a couple evenings a week and I have like the glow I wake up with after using this! Four stars because I haven’t used it long enough to give it a full 5 just yet. So far so good!
