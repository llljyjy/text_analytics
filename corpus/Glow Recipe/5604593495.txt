I love this stuff. I honestly didn’t expect much… since I’ve never had much luck with a toner. But it’s moisturizing while also somehow making my skin look less textured throughout the day. I have clear, combination skin with big pores due to mild acne as a child. I love how it doesn’t feel sticky or drying. However, I don’t love the packaging. I only bought the mini so I don’t know if the larger size is the same. But it’s hard to get enough out at once. I will be buying the full size regardless, though. Love it! love it!!!
