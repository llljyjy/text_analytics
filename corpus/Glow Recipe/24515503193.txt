I just love glow recipe products and their new strawberry smooth BHA + AHA salicylic acid serum is absolutely perfect. It smells like strawberry’s and the consistency of the serum is so smooth that it gets absorbed quickly. I could see a glow on my face after each application and I really love how my skin feels like. Does it’s Job!
