I love this product so much. I love the glow recipes dew drops and am on my second bottle. This moisture paired with the dew drops gives you unreal all day glow. If you don’t want to Glow for the Gods use this moisturizer alone. It doesn’t have a strong scent. It doesn’t leave a white cast like some others. I love that this also has niacinmide so it gives you other skin benefits as well as protecting it! Love the scent and the protection
