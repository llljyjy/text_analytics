Product would be a solid 4 out of 5 if the cost was a few bucks cheaper or packaging was better. The watermelon version smells pleasant and gives lips a light pink tinge and some shine. I think it works pretty well for a casual look or warm weather. The balm is hydrating and feels nice when applied. Not sure Iâ€™ve noticed much of an exfoliating effect that it claims to have, but I mostly got it for moisturizing purposes. Would be nice to have an spf version. good but expensive
