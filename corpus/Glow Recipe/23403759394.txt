Disclaimer: I paid for this product. Scent: Scents tend to make me itchy but this scent was very mild- I just would like to know what ingredients entail “fragrance.”  It dissipates quickly. Pilling: I found that it pills mildly with products underneath that do not moisturize enough, could make flakes worse.Texture/Spread/Finish: It’s harder to spread if you have dryer skin or use products with cetyl alcohol (a wax alcohol). The dew barely lasted and my skin looked dry as the day went. Additionally the dew is best for smooth and young skin as it highlights wrinkles and texture. I wish that w/ dewy products, formulators took fine lines and skin texture into consideration. 30+ adults can be profitable clients too. Also, please consider men use skincare too.  Eyes: Unfortunately yes, it irritated my eyes often! I was surprised.  I found this product worked best with hydrated skin using humectant, Squalane (helps spreadability), moisturizer (lock it all in), and some sort of texture smoothing ingredient that wont pill. For the texturizer I use a cheap Cetaphil oil-free moisturizer with SPF 30. I find this makes me look smoother, glowy, and the effects last sooooo much longer!! It also spreads more effectively.  GR please take notice if this mix. Cost: OVER PRICED. Niacinamide is a cheap ingredient!! The dew is short and must re-apply. No sweat / water resistance claims so limited use. To make it work it requires more products so more costs. 1.7 Oz is too little SPF usage and price point. GR, .3 Oz would have still left you with a high profit margin! This should be at least 2.5 ounces.  What makes me want to wear sunscreen everyday? Not breaking my wallet every time I reapply. Ever consider that? I still recommend others give it a try though. Not enough.
