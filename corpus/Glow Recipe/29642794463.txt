Honestly I think you really have to know your skin and be committed to figuring out how products work best for yours.  I found that using this everyday was too much for my skin with my other products.  I’ve been using it for about a month now along with other glow recipe staples everyday and it’s been rough!BUT consistency is key! I had to play with it and try different things until I found where it fits best in my routine as far as how often. You’ve also gotta push through while making adjustments if you want improvement with your skin.   But seriously, consistency is key! You have to be committed to see results.
