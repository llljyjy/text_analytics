I ended up having to return this product after I realized you can’t get all the product out of the bottle. the product is more solid than a gel and after you use up everything around the tube it doesn’t just fill in the empty space. you have to scoop out the product with wands but it’s so hard cause the bottle is literally tiny. Really wish this came in a pot as the product is lovely. Feels great on skin, pairs well with other products, and doesn’t pill under makeup! Pass
