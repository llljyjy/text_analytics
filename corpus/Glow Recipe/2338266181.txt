Super cute packaging, as to be expected with Glow Recipe! This has a gel/serum consistency - not too watery and it glides nicely onto the skin. It doesn’t tingle or burn my sensitive skin. I apply it at night and the next morning, my skin is soft and small breakouts appear to be minimized! It seems a little gentler, perhaps less effective, than other acids I’ve used, but this could be a great day-to-day product! nan
