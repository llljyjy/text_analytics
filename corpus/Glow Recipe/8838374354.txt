I’m glad I waited a month before writing a review. I was in love for the first two weeks. The glow was definitely real. My pore size did seem smaller. BUT. After 2 weeks I started breaking out in areas I don’t normally break out. Thinking it could be purging I continued for another 2 weeks. Sadly my skin kept getting more dull and dry and irritated looking. Giving 2 stars because the texture and smell are so lovely, application is super easy and non-wasteful (don’t lose that white plug though if you plan on travelling with it!) and I recognize that everyone’s skin is different! For reference, I have medium-sensitive skin, occasional small breakouts and err on the dry side. nan
