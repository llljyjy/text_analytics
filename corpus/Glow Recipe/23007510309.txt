I love this product for daily SPF! It has a creamy, smooth texture, and glides on easily, without being tacky or sticky at all. It is lightweight, and not greasy like so many sun protectants can be. It wears well under makeup and gives a subtle glow without being heavy! Iâ€™ve attached a photo of it on my bare skin before applying makeup. Love it! Great for daily SPF!
