It felt gentle yet effective. My skin did not feel stripped, but still was very clean. It felt smooth and nourished after rinsing. The lather was minimal, but it still spread easily and was easy to massage into my skin. (I used at least a dime-sized amt each time - any less was not enough to spread all over, partly due to the absence of bubbles.) I liked that there was barely a scent. I also noted that my serums and moisturizer “stayed on“ much longer throughout the day after cleansing with this item. Great for dry winter months. Nourishing Cleanser
