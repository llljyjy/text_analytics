I havenâ€™t tried anything from Glow Recipe yet, but I think the brand is very innovative so I was excited to try this AHA night treatment. I like the ease of using this since you apply it as the final step in your nighttime routine and wake up with results. This is very lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin, with a very mild watermelon scent.  Similarly to SF Good Genes, I wake up with smoother and softer skin. Big fan of this! great AHA treatment
