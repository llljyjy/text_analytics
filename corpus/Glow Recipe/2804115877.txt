This is a really bittersweet review for me.. when I first applied it the first thing I loved was that there was no white cast and that it didn’t leave me looking like a shinnyghost, I am Mexican so anytime I put sunscreen on my face my bf tells me I look super greasy and pale… on the negative side I also struggled with the pilling. When I applied very little it really was not a problem but when I put the actual amount that should be worn it would pill on the edges of my face and end up in my hair.. the worse part for me is that it made my makeup look completely awful, it separated everything, so bad that I had to wash it all off twice trying to figure out what the heck was going on and ended up just putting on cerave’s mineral tinted sunscreen that I bought at target.. I’m not sure if that occurred because I was trying to put the milk makeup matte primer on top but which an oily complexion I need a matte base.. I have not decided if I will return it yet because if anything I can just use it on days that I am cleaning at home or whatever and not wearing makeup.. based on what I have experienced so far I don’t think I would buy it again unfortunately.. I really wanted to love this.. Separated all of my makeup… :/
