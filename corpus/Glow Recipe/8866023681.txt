I bought this with a gift card on a whim and I’m so happy I did! I have stubborn hormonal acne and after my skin purged (I hadn’t used AHAs in awhile) my skin is so smooth and clear. I alternate this every other say with encapsulated retinol  in between. I love it, I just wish there was a bigger bottle for the price. Amazing for Hormonal Acne!!
