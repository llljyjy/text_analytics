Another amazing Glow Recipe product! Been using it on my acne prone skin for some time now and really love how gentle yet effective it is!!! It’s not the most hydrating for me though but layered with other lightweight moisturizers like their Plum Cream it’s amazing. It also has a beautiful fruity scent that’s more similar to cherry to me. Overall I love it and it’s been helping get rid of my acne amazingly! nan
