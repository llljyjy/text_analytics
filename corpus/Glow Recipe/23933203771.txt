I love this product! First of all, it’s fragrance free! Yay!It feels nice on the skin: it is very refreshing and it has a cooling effect... I feel like it would be even better if you would keep it in the fridge. It’s also very soothing...It does help with the redness of my skin. As soon as it rub it in, I notice a difference. I don’t know if it will improve my redness in the long run, but it certainly has a temporary effect when you put it on. I have oily skin on my T-zone and this serum has NOT made it worse. It’s in fact very hydrating, so I was well surprised. Worth the price! Fave serum for red skin!
