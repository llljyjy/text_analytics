I have used many eye creams before but with this one, I felt instant relief from my tired, dull eyes! Working from home has caused a strain on my eyes, which also includes dark and puffy eye bags. I like this serum because it’s very light, yet absorbs well and quickly after applying. I was expecting a fruity guava smell, but i seem to like it better unscented, as it comes! The cherry on top is the bottle it comes in because it’s so unique and cute! Instant relief for my eyes!
