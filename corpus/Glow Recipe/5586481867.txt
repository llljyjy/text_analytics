Glow Recipe did it again by launching another amazing product that DOES work! I tried this product for two weeks and WOW! Super happy with how this serum helped clear my hormonal acne within the first week of the trial. The first 1-3 days of using it I purged a little, but nothing serious, just a few small pimples on my forehead and cheeks. I believe it was completely normal due to the fact it was a new serum and my skin (Combo/oily, sensitive & acne-prone) was getting used to the ingredients. In my second week, I saw how the acne around my face literally vanished and the oiliness on my T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) area was balanced and less oily than usual. I’m on my 3rd week now and I’m obsessed with how my skin got this glowy and healthy appearance. My favorite part about this serum is its amazing scent of strawberry puree! And the best thing is that it did not irritate my sensitive skin since day 1. This serum has become one of my top skincare products for routine :) Cleared my hormonal acne in 1 Week!
