I’ve tried this sunscreen many different ways in attempt to avoid pilling (letting my other products dry completely first, not rubbing the sunscreen between my fingers first, applying immediately after products), and nothing works. It literally pulls up into these massive chunks of white that fall all over my clothes and floor. I literally do not understand all the good reviews. This is quite literally the worst face SPF I’ve ever tried. I’d rather use body spray sunscreen from the drugstore on my face than this. Highly highly recommend buying something different. Pills SO bad
