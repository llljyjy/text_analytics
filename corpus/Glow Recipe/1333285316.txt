This was the first glow recipe product I tried, and I was pleasantly surprised. I felt like it did reduce my winter redness and gave my skin a nice dose of moisture without feeling greasy. I deducted one star because the bottle design has some flaws, leaving much product on the bottom without the pump being able to draw it up. nan
