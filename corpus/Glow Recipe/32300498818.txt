This is very exciting relaunch of cult favorite product! It dues have signature watermelon scent so this who didn’t like it will be happy. I did see fragrance as the last ingredient but couldn’t smell anything. They added so many great ingredients like niacinimide, quinoa peptide, 2,5% AHA complex. It feels so lightweight and has gel like texture, my skin absorbs it so quickly and feels very hydrated. I apply it as the last step of my nighttime routine 2-5 x week. If I do quick routine - cleanse, time and this mask I don’t feel enough hydration and face to apply oil on top. I love how refreshing this mask is,  next morning my skin looks plump, fresh, smooth and brighter. It applies well on top if other skincare products and doesn’t peel. Less fragrance
