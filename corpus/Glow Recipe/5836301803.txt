This is a very good exfoliating mask for dry sensitive skin, if used properly. I cannot really handle most chemical exfoliants but I have had no issues with this product so far. I wouldn’t use it more than 2x a week though, and I do apply a thicker moisturizer on top once the mask sinks in. My skin looks brighter overall and more even. I’m looking forward to seeing some improvement with my pores and blackheads. Great for sensitive skin
