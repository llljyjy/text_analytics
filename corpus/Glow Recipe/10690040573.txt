This is my new favorite night treatment. I am applying this treatment as the last step in my nightly skincare routine. I apply a thin layer onto my cleaned skin. The texture is so amazing. A smooth, silky lightweight texture that soothes and hydrates my skin instantly on application. I tap it into my skin and it absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling. It works perfectly for my combination to dry skin. I wake up with super soft, smooth, hydrated, and radiant glowing skin. My dry skin feels soothed, more supple and looks plump. This is a nice treatment to pamper my skin during the night. I highly recommend this beautiful treatment! Beautiful night treatment
