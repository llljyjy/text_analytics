This smells so wonderful and actually makes me WANT to use sunscreen, so that’s a big plus for me. It gives a really glowy finish too. That said, pilling IS A THING. I’m about halfway through the tube and after trial and error, this plays really well with the Glow Recipe watermelon juice gel moisturizer. It doesn’t play well with... literally any other moisturizer I’ve tried under it. It’s not a big deal on WFH days, quick errand trips, hanging out with good friends, etc., but I’d be a little self conscious about the potential pilling if I were going *out out*.  I’ve also noticed that using less product helps to avoid the pilling, but that not exactly what we want in a sunscreen! When I’m done with this tube I’m going to try something else, but honestly the fact that it smells so great (but doesn’t irritate my skin), looks and feels nice,  making me use it on a regular basis is worth a lot so I might come back to it later. Tricky to work with
