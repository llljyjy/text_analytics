This is a beautiful exfoliating serum with a mix of AHAs and BHAs, along with several moisturizing ingredients to help avoid irritation. It has a nice light strawberry scent. Iâ€™ve been really enjoying using this 2-3 times a week for some nice exfoliation, but would be hesitant to use it daily in place of something more soothing. Definitely a hit product! nan
