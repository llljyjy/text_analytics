If you like glowy skin, this is the sunscreen for you! This leaves the most beautiful hydrated glowy finish. It feels hydrating, spreads and absorbs easily, and leaves NO white cast! I did have minor pilling when worn underneath one of my foundations, but no pilling with another. This happens when layering products and it just depends on ingredients meshing or not. The watermelon scent is super refreshing. I also use this on my young daughter and she loves it! Glowy for days!
