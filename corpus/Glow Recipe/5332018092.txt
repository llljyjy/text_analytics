I revived this product for free from Glow Recipe. This serum actually really has become a staple in my night routine. The formula itself feels very lights and it is hydrating, almost like a gel formula which is something I’ve never tried in an smoothing serum. I don’t mind the slight strawberry scent it has and overall, it’s a very good serum! My breakouts visibly look better so I will definitely continue to use it in my routine. A great serum!!
