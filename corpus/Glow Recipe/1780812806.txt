I started using this product mini while away on vacation, and my skin really liked it - I had to buy the full size pot! The mini pot works, the large pot (while really pretty!) doesn’t really work…the jelly is quite runny, I think I would prefer a pump. I wake up with hydrated glowy skin, and any acne spots are minimized and soothed. Which I know sounds weird given this is an aha mask! It’s gentle yet effective. I would recommend this product to others - I’m a fan and will purchase again! Great product & looks pretty on my counter!
