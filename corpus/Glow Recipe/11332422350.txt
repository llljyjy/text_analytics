I am madly in love with this one!!! Is a very lightweight product and very hydrating! It gives you the most beautiful glow and your skin feels pretty healthy! I use it 3 times a week since is an exfoliant and I have to be careful not to damage my skin barrier since I am a little sensitive these days. In the morning my skin is feeling still hydrated and brighter! Love it! Incredible!
