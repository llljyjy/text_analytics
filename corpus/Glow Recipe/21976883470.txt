I thought I loved this when I first got it, but although I finished the bottle, I realized it wasn’t my favorite after a couple of uses. It pilled on my skin and burned my eyes every time I sweat. At one point I couldn’t use it on my face anymore. I ended up using it on my body because I didn’t want to waste it. Not repurchasing. There are better combination sunscreens out there. Eh, I don’t get the hype.
