I wanted to love this product so much, but after about 1.5/2 weeks of use I developed an absolutely terrible breakout. I’m talking deep, bumpy pimples that are borderline impossible not to notice even with a full face of makeup. I gave myself a week off from the dew drops, treated the breakout, and then started again (thinking the breakout was hormonal, even if it wasn’t a standard hormone breakout for me), and within 2 days the massive zits came roaring back. Will be returning. loved at first, then *terrible* break out
