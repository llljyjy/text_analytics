Overall this sunscreen is just average, nothing stood out minus the light cast that was left. The skin wasn’t anymore or less hydrated. Things to note: -No harsh smell-Not runny -shaking and properly preparing your skin helps with the product rolling-If you’re deeper in skin tone, there is a cast. Minimal but still there. It’s a white purple glow. Apply in layers -not great for applying over makeup nan
