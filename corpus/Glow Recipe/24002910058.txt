Love hate relationship. If you are sensitive to smell, stay away from this product, it broke me out in places I’ve never broken out from so it’s definitely not a purge from the BHA. HOWEVER, if you don’t have super sensitive skin like me and don’t easily break out, then I kind of suggest it cause it did make my skin glow albeit it being on the pricier side and having tiny red pimples from it. nan
