I love the lightweight texture of this eye cream. It’s hydrating without being heavy which I’ve found in most other I’ve tried. My under eyes aren’t extremely dry and if you use too much you can get milia which won’t be an issue with this one. It layers beautifully with other skincare and under makeup. I wear a full face everyday and it’s been great.  My eyes immediately look wide awake and I’ve noticed an immediate difference in how dark they used to look. I don’t experience puffiness so I cannot speak to if this depuffs or not but I much prefer this to their other eye cream. Give it a shot
