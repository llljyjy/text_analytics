I recently added this to my morning routine. It feels light but hydrated really nicely. It sinks in the skin quite quickly and leaves the area bright and moisturized. It has a light scent. It worked beautifully under makeup. I’ve only used it for a couple of days so I can’t say much about it brightening in the long run but I have high hopes. A great morning eye cream
