This is not moisturizing, I put this on after hydrating toner, essence, serums, eye cream, and my face feels dry in the morning. Plus itâ€™s supposed to be eco friendly packaging but the bottle itself is a large waste of plastic. It sort of spreads on like a serum, very light weight, but does nothing for moisture. No strong smell but sort of smells like fruit beer. Not moisturizing
