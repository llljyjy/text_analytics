I love this AHA night treatment. This product leaves my skin with the almost amazing glow in the morning. My skin looks refreshed and feels firm yet it leaves my skin hydrated as well. I use this as my last step after moisturizer as my final step in my evening routine and wake up with great results. The texture of the product is very nice it feels similar to a cooling gel. Also the scent is very faint but smells very spa like.  I would recommend this to anyone as a treatment for the skin. Glowing Smooth Skin
