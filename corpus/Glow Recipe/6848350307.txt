I really like this! Not an overwhelming smell, mostly just smells faintly of sunscreen. I even did exactly what you’re not supposed to do, just to test it out - applied it immediately after my skincare - and had very minimal pilling. Makeup applied beautifully over the top. So glowy and a really good texture, and I’ve only ever liked one other sunscreen under makeup - but this will be a staple in my routine now. I especially love that it’s SPF 50. the only spf 50 sunscreen I'll wear under makeup
