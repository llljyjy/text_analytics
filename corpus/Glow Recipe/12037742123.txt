I found a lot of cleansers would pull all of the moisture from my skin along with the dirt and makeup from the day, but after using this one - my skin feels super soft and clean without that tight, dry feeling. I also havenâ€™t experienced irritation or breakouts with this cleanser, like some cause for me. I definitely recommend! Great product for my sensitive combination skin!
