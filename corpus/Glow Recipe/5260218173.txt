I’m so excited to finally try Glow Recipe’s Watermelon AHA Night Treatment! Who doesn’t love when a product helps your skin overnight without having to do anything? I love the packaging, and I also enjoy that there is no tacky residue after application! I use this as my final Skincare step, as instructed. You can use it 2-3 times a week, or you can use nightly as a final Hydrating step! This 2.5% ph balanced AHA Complex left my skin feeling firmer and brighter after just a few uses. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming at all. I love that it includes Watermelon Enzymes & HA to help resurface, Soothe and hydrate. My favorite ingredient is Niacinamide, as I’m getting into my 40s! It really helps with the discoloration spots that I’ve accumulated over my younger years, before knowing how important taking care of your skin was! Thank you for creating such an amazing nighttime formula! Watermelon Heaven!
