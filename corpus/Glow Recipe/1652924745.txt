Just recently purchased this and I have to say that I’m absolutely in love with this cleanser. Within the first few I noticed that my skin was clearer and softer. I also noticed that any congestion that I had on my face was disappearing as well. It doesn’t dry your skin if you have combination/oily skin and I found that it actually helped with that. I use it with the toner and day lotion and my skin just looks so much better now. I absolutely love this skincare line. Worth Buying!
