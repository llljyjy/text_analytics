I have been a longtime user of the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Night mask regime.  Loved it until I met the new “kid on the block“.  The smell is a little more subtle.  The texture is a bit heavier.  The game changer for me was the hydration factor.  This new version added a wonderful level of moisture.  I have dry skin and this product has helped balance mine.  In the morning my skin looks refreshed, soft and cheery.  Will be purchasing this new version as soon as my current supply is gone. Watermelon Glow AHA Night cream
