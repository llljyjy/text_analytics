After having tried this amazing sunscreen by Glow Recipe, I recommend it for daily use.  It makes my skin feel smooth and refreshed for most of the day. It has a creamy light texture and rubs into my skin nicely without leaving a sticky or flakey residue. I enjoy the light smell and love that it provides an ample amount of sun protection (SPF 50). I will be using this product regularly. Great Sunscreen!
