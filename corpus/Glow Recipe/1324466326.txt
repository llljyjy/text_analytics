I’m afraid I have to add my voice to the folks who found this eye cream to be drying and increase wrinkles. I used it for a few weeks at night and unfortunately I noticed my under eye area was getting drier and more tired looking and more wrinkled looking — and it did give me one milia dot. All these symptoms improved with stopping the cream. Sensitive or even mildly dry skin folks, I would be a little bit wary. Maybe not for sensitive skin
