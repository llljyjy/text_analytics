i was so excited when glow recipe launched this new eye cream since i was already loving their guava vitamin c serum. of course since this is an eye cream, it’s consistency is much thicker than the serum. even though it’s thicker, it’s not too heavy for the skin underneath my eyes. after using for a couple days, i’ve noticed my eyes don’t look as tired anymore and must try!
