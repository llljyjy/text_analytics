I’m almost at the end of this product. It’s just okay. It’s not that moisturizing. I do make sure my skin is out of the shower damp & spray rose water over it first, like usual. If anything my skin is more dry. I have dry & sensitive skin. I’m 34, and just need more I suppose. I like the thicker formulas that really soak in. Also the first two times I used this, my face burned. I don’t know why as it never happened again. Won’t be repurchasing even tho the pod idea is nice. I prefer Saturday Skin’s Glacier Water much more. Off to go buy that one… not for me
