This product really helps with the purpose of makeup removal. No matter what type of makeup I am wearing it always works with getting the job done. It somewhat has a greasy like texture and when washing my face I noticed it takes a bit to get the product off. However I over all enjoy it and like the way my skin feels and looks after! nan
