Absolutely love this sunscreen!! I’m super super picky when it comes to sunscreen and this one is basically perfect! It’s thin, blends so easily, leaves no color/cast on the skin, doesn’t peel up with other makeup, and it gives me a little bit of a glow. Also, it doesn’t make me oily which I find to be so crazy because I’ve only found 2-3 sunscreens that do the same! If you have thought about trying and are on the fence, I would say go for it because there is a good possibility that this will be your new fav! I do wish a little bit more product came in the tube though! nan
