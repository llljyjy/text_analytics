I’ve heard wonderful things about Glow Recipe’s products but have not actually tried any until this one. I have been looking for an SPF to add to my routine now that it’s getting warmer where I live, and this was the perfect opportunity. At first, the product smelled amazing and fruity, not like your typical sunscreens usually do. I only dropped a small amount into my hands to see how it spread first, and it surprisingly lathered on my face SO well, I didn’t even need to use more. That alone makes me feel better about the size and price of the bottle, because I know it will last me a while. My skin felt soft, looked super glowy, and the texture of the product was just right - not too thick, and not too thin. It also didn’t leave a white residue which some sunscreens do. Overall I recommend!! Good SPF!
