It smells great. It’s lightweight and a little goes a long way. I just dab the product lightly and it’s enough to spread across half my face. The product alone isn’t enough to moisturize but I lock it in with a creamier lotion and it does wonders leaving my skin soft and glowing. A little goes a long way.
