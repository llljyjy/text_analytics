Love this stuff! I bought this product for the second time, and while I think it was reformulated, it still works really well and feels good on my skin. I have dry skin and I use it once a week or so to smooth out my skin texture, since I can get flakes or little bumps (not acne). I feel like it also brightens my skin a bit. The product texture is kind of like a gel and it dries down completely, not sticky at all. Doesnâ€™t dry out my skin either. The new formula has less fragrance, which is fine but I liked the original scent. I just wish the mini size also came with a spatula so it would be more sanitary. Works and feels good
