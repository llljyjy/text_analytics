This is definitely a great sunscreen! It feels not too heavy on my skin, which is awesome! It has a slight fragrance, but not too strong. I thought it would smell less like sunscreen, but it definitely does have that kind of scent. Because of some of the ingredients, like aloe, it feels great on my skin! great product that does its job!
