I am a huge fan of the entire Watermelon lineup from Glow Recipe and this new mask is no exception! It leaves my skin soft and smooth without being too harsh or irritating my sensitive skin.  Iâ€™ve used it for a couple of weeks now and my skin texture is already improving! I love it! Beautiful addition to the watermelon glow family!
