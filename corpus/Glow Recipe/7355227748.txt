Not someone to post a raw photo of myself but I have to show the results. The left is my congested, acne scarred skin. The right is my skin 2 months after consistently using the glow recipe toner and strawberry aha bha acid. I cannot believe this. I have been extremely self conscious and depressed about how my skin started looking after trying a million protects and I could not recommend this enough. completely life saver for skin
