I have normal skin with a few dryer areas. After my first application of this moisturizer, I instantly had soft, more supple, skin and I could actually feel it working on my driest spot. I loved the soft, dewy glow brought to my mature skin. Although some may deem this product pricey, only one pump is needed for the face. A little truly does go a long way. Because I am middle-aged, I may use a little more. And, I also use it on my neck and chest. I just love the glow! I am anxious to see the results over time and look forward to trying other products in the line. Believe the Hype!
