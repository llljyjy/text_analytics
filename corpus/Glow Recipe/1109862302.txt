I really like this serum. I use it as my first serum and love the texture. It spreads easily and it has a very faint nostalgic strawberry scent. Since using this product I havenâ€™t experienced any breakouts. I have combination skin and I need a hydrating serum and moisturizer after this product. This product is not drying it just does not provide enough hydration to my skin. No breakouts!
