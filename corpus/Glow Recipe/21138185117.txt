First off, I’m a huge fan of Glow Recipe. I tried the Glow Babies set and my skin looked amazing, so I was excited to try this one. The bottle is so stinkin’ cute. It’s a nice glass jar in the shape of a strawberry. The product itself a thin cream consistency and smells like strawberries. It goes on smooth and feels light and moisturizing. It is a bit tacky feeling once it’s spread on but my skin soaked it all up quickly and the tackiness didn’t last. It feels makes my dry skin feel very moisturized. I even tried skipping my moisturizer and I didn’t get too dry. I also noticed that I didn’t have to exfoliate as much when I was using it, too. It works really well and I’m going to be keeping it in my skincare routine. Another winner from Glow Recipe! Another winner from Glow Recipe!
