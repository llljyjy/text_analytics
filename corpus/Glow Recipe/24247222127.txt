The product is ok, but the packaging sucks. Even though it’s 3/4 full, I have a really hard time making the pump work. It seems to be too thick for the pump, just like the Watermelon Body Cream. It’s frustrating. It is a rich, moisturizing cream, if they could just improve the packaging (and ditch the pump), it’d be great. Disappointing packaging
