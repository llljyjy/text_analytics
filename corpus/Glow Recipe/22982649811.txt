I love glow recipe, all of their other products are amazing and I really wanted to love this product as well. I love the idea of a cross over between chemical and mineral sunscreen. I read the reviews before I purchased it and it did mention pilling but it was a risk I was willing to take in order to try it out. At first there was no pilling at all but after continuous use pilling would occur and it’s just so disappointing. If the pilling wasn’t happening I’d give this product 5 stars but it’s just a huge issue that happens every single time I use this product. nan
