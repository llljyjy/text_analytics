Since the first use I noticed that this is a gentle and  non-stripping cleanser, it leaves my skin feeling nourished and clean. It doesnÂ´t lather well on dry skin so applying it over damp skin makes all the difference. What I really like about this cleanser is that it helps improve my skin barrier health.
