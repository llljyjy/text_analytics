-lathers well -runny consistency -non scented -color green/ applies clear-non-toxic ingredients-feels amazing on the skin•I recommend this product as a cleanser…it’s refreshing and cleans your face takes off that nasty oily residue used it every morning after waking up, this product might be a little more drying for people who have very dry skin. I did notice it left my skin a little drier than usual. my skin is more of a mix so what I did after cleansing I went with the hyaluronic plum serumAnd that did the job.•I would NOT recommend this product if you plan on using it as a makeup remover I had to go in 3 times to remove most of the makeup. In my opinion it was a waste of product.Overall this product is great and I would recommend buying but not as a makeup remover, there are better products out there to fully remove your makeup without doing so much work.
