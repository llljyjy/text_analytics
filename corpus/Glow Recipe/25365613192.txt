So this product had my skin GLOWING when I woke up, I wasn’t to sure about it due to the smell But I went with my normal products I use every morning and night and applied a decent amount to my entire face last. The texture was nice, a little sticky when first applied but I soon forgot about it bc I used this right before bed. First thing when I woke up my skin felt hydrated And had a nice glow. I don’t think I’ve ever used  overnight treatments so this being my first time it was pleasant. Only thing I wasn’t to impressed with was the scent. I woods have preferred no scent or different scent. I have fairly sensitive skin and this hasn’t seemed to bother my skin which is a huge plus for me. Over time I have no doubt my skin will keep feeling smoother after each use and hopefully brighter too! Super cute packaging
