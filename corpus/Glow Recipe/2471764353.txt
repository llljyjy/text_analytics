This is the cutest eye cream bottle ever! Of course, it also works. The ingredients are great and help keep my eye areas moisturized and plump. It’s easy to get product out of the bottle with the pump without getting too much. It says to put it all around your eye areas including your eyelids- I would be careful with that because as hard as I try, it does get in my eye sometimes and it’s not comfortable. It doesn’t really sting but it makes your vision a little cloudy and you can feel it in your eye. It might be my clumsiness, but I’ll stick with using it on my undereyes only. Moisturized undereyes
