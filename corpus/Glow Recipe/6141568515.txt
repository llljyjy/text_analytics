I have combo skin and so I had mixed results from this product. I do think my facial redness and dryness was reduced from using this product. I felt like my skin definitely retained more moisture when I used this. However, it was too gentle and I broke out consistently while using this product-something that doesn’t happen when I use the blueberry cleanser. Overall a good option for specific skin issues but I probably won’t replace it for the blueberry cleanser. Good product but not for me
