I was on the search for a new sunscreen that didnâ€™t feel heavy and greasy, and I finally found it. I am so impressed with the formula of this sunscreen. The smell is not overpowering like others and it blends easily. I tried it with my makeup and it gives me such a beautiful glow and my skin looks and feels hydrated. It is now a permanent staple in my routine. Staple in my routine
