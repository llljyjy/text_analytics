Wow! This serum is a must try! For reference, I do have combo skin type and I wanna say that this is amazing especially if you have textured skin. Give it a continuous use and you will be amaze with the result! I noticed my skin being plump and my pores arenâ€™t that large that it is noticeable. Not to mention the Salicylic acid ingredients that are great for blemishes or if you have acne prone skin. This serum works wonder! MUST TRY!
