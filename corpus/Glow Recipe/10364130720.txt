Prior to purchasing this product, I was skeptical to see if I would love it just as much as others did; however, unfortunately, it was not the one for me. When I first used this serum, the very next day I woke up with redness and small teeny tiny white heads all over my face, plus a big pimple. I stopped using it for a few days and my skin returned to its normal state. I started using it again and it broke out all over again. I was extremely disappointed that this product did not for me. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money Terrible breakouts
