This has been the best SPF I’ve owned I wear it daily with or no makeup in the hot humid sunny weather I’m from the south. Once I apply this product it smells like a hint of watermelon and ofc that SPF smell however it goes away within seconds. I am olive toned so I will have a white/gray cast but it doesn’t last too long either once it sets in within minutes my face is clear as day. I have no issues with this at all. It does not rub off or peel off . I’m very athletic so I run outdoors a lot in and I can a-test it is sweat proof and will not burn if it gets into your eyes. It has helped from preventing dark spots and I have not experienced any breakouts either. It gets the job done on my training days and blends perfectly with my makeup on my full glam nights Glad I didn’t let the negative reviews scare me
