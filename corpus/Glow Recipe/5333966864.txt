Such a fantastic product, anything like I’ve ever tried! Flows very freely but is also jelly like all in the same. Has a light scent as well, very light. I have used this as an overnight mask that I washed off in the morning and I’ve also used it and not washed it off the next morning, either way still leaves my skin looking soft and feeling hydrated. It does take a bit to rub on but once it’s soaked in, you’ll feel the difference! Leaves my skin a little brighter and much more hydrated. Overall I enjoy and recommend! nan
