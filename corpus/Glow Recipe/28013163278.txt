Another winner from glow recipe! I have tried their previous avocado retinol eye cream in the past and really enjoyed it, but it didn’t do much for my dull and dark undereyes. This one is so much different, my eyes look noticeably brighter immediately after use, and the serum like texture absorbs into the eye area so quickly, my skin ‘drinks’ it up! It has a very light and pleasant scent, and doesn’t irritate my eyes even when they’re sore after removing makeup. I’m a big fan! Can’t wait to see my results as I continue using this. nan
