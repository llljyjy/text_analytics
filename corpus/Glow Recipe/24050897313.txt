I love Glow Recipe and specifically their watermelon line of products, but this sunscreen is not up to par. It pills! I’ve tried it a few different ways, waiting even more time between moisturizer and applying, using the method they use on their tik tok. It keeps pilling. It’s also extremely disappointing to see all of the reviews are incentivized and that some “influencers” have placed their handles around their reviews for attention. Only listen to the reviews that aren’t incentivized. You can totally skip this sunscreen, the pilling isn’t worth the price. SKIP IT
