I actually really like this sunscreen. I like how light weight it is on my skin. It doesnâ€™t feel greasy which is very important to me because I have oily skin. The package is sleek and chic and I love that I can slip it into my purse to reapply and bring around with me. I love glow recipe products so much and this one is now different. I love the formula too. Thin and light. nice and light
