I really wanted to love this toner after hearing such great things about it. However, it broke me out HORRIBLY. Within about 6-7 days of use, I got so many pimples under the skin and my poor skin was so irritated. The consistency was good, but Iâ€™m wondering if the fragrance is what broke me out. I went back to my other toner with no problems. nan
