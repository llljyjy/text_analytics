Love all the glow recipe products and was excited that the watermelon now has an AHA ingredient! Iâ€™ve used a full jar of the watermelon overnight mask before and love how hydrating it was. With the added AHA it leaves my skin feeling not only hydrated, but tight and with a clearer complexion. I have this on rotation with my evening skincare products! Hydrating and firming!
