I couldnt wait to try this product from Glow Recipe. After using it for some time now, I can say I’m very pleased with it and the results.  It has a lightweight and super creamy texture that feels amazing when I apply it. It great for the sensitive skin under my eyes and hasn’t caused any irritation at all. So far I’ve noticed my under eyes look brighter and less puffy. Also it keeps my under eyes very hydrated and smoother. It’s definitely a product I love and will continue to use. Love it!!
