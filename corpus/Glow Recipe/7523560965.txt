This new Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream from Glow Recipe is nothing like any other eye cream I’ve tried before.  Yeah, the packaging is cute and all but you will actually see and feel the difference almost immediately.  I didn’t notice any fragrance and that’s a plus because fragrance sometimes irritates my eyes.  It looks like a cream but goes on like a gel and is very lightweight and dries fast.  My dark circles were noticeably faded and all puffiness gone.  You can use this on your entire eye area which is why I’m loving it so much.  My upper lids get puffy too and this takes care of that no problem.  It gives a much needed shot of hydration too.  I was able to apply my makeup right after and it didn’t cause any creasing but actually blurred my fine lines a bit.  I actually skipped my eyeshadow primer because this kinda got the job done.  Definitely a keeper! Definitely A Keeper!
