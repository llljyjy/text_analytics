This is one of my favourite skincare products, it smells amazing and gives a beautiful dewy glow. I have really oily and acne prone skin and this is great for oil control evening out skin tone. I put it on just before moisturizer as it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky but I might be using too much. Glow recipe can have all of my money Obsessed
