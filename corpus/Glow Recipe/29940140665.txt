I loved the original (this reminded me i need to use mine up!) the smell is great, it applies smooth, and feels great. This new reformulation is just as good. I don’t apply at night as i find it too sticky but it makes me feel more vibrant after use. Not sure what changed but didn’t notice a serious difference in the new vs old ! nan
