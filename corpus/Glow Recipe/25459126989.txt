I received this in a sub box I purchased and I was so excited about giving it a try! So let me start by saying this, I love the GR line and I’ve only ever had one not so good experience with one product out of the whole line and have fallen in love with so many others their line however I wasn’t impressed by this product at all! That’s terribly unfortunate because I was in love with the thought of this product upon hearing about its release…I have sensitive dry skin and I noticed little to no difference in my skin and I have almost finished my jar. The other thing is that as I understand companies are trying to downsize their carbon footprint and make a lot of jars reusable however the pod is significantly smaller than what the jar is capable of holding its self meaning you essentially getting less product than you typically would and it seems to be a little pricier for such a reduced amount of product in my opinion. not for me unfortunately…
