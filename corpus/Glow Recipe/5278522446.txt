Definitely a favorite in my skincare routine currently. Before I was using a hyaluronic acid from glossier and wasn’t really impressed. I thought it was more so a trendy product until I found this one. I definitely like this one more and can actually see a difference in my skin. My skin looks dewy and I think this gives a more hydrated and plump effect. There’s not much of a smell and the bottle is nice except the pump isn’t my favorite. Overall will probably buy again once empty. Dewy, plump looking skin
