My honest opinion is that I love Glow Recipe however this didnâ€™t give me as much improvement as I had hoped. It did make my forehead feel smoother and it does sink into the skin beautifully, no stickiness afterwards but in other areas of my face it irritated my sensitive skin. Due to the irritation I will not be able to incorporate this into my skin routine but I would absolutely recommend this to others. nan
