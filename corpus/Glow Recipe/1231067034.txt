My go to cleanser is the Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser, I’ve been using it for the past 2 years. I was pleasantly surprised with the Avocado Cleanser. I’ve been using it for the last week and it feels very creamy and leaves my skin feeling super soft and my skin doesn’t fell tight after using it. Totally recommend
