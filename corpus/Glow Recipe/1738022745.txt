Compared to the original, this is thinner and not really hydrating. I honestly didn’t see any difference in my skin from using this, I felt like it was a bit irritating (probably fragrance) yet with not high enough percentage of actives to make a difference in my skin. Kind of like a “sleeping mask” instead of a serum that didn’t really exfoliate as well as my normal AHA, and also didn’t hydrate as well as the previous mask. I will also note this jar is smaller than the mask it’s replacing.  It contains peptides but it doesn’t specify the peptide type.  There are so many great products you can buy that actually exfoliate and get you glowing skin that aren’t pink and smell like watermelon. Pass on this. nan
