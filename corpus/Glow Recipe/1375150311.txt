I wanted to like this and I looked forward to trying it but it made my skin far worse than when I started. I got deep-rooted breakout and whiteheads right away that took a while to clear up. Once I stopped using this product, my skin went back to normal. I donâ€™t think my skin reacts well to salicylic acids made breakouts worse
