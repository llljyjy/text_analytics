I love this serum! I use it after my Paula’s Choice BHA exfoliant and before my moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and glowy! Only issue is that this can’t be worn under makeup (at least on me). Created some serious separation all over my face and I’ve been using my current foundation for years and never had this issue. I’ll continue to use and probably repurchase, but won’t use it under foundation. Amazing, just not under makeup
