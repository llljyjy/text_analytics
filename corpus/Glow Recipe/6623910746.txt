I really wanted to like this for the skin care benefits but I just can’t. I have combination skin & this just feels greasy on me. It is way to dewy. I have to use so much setting powder so that it doesn’t run it my eyes. It also pills like crazy. I have tried all different application techniques & it pills every time. This is not worth the price. nan
