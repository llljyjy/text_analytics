I use this as my first step in a double cleanse at the end of the day and I LOVE it. I love the sorbet texture, I love that it’s easy to smooth into my face. I love that it’s moisturizing and easily gets rid of my light makeup. It doesn’t fully rinse away but that’s consistent with other oil cleansers I’ve used, and my skin feels great after my second cleanse. I like this much better than the Farmacy. nan
