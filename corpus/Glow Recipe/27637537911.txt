Very glowy and hydrating finish! The formulation is a nice color of pink. Design wise, it is more of a rough texture design on the jar. There is quite a bit of product and I can see it lasting at least for a full month. The scent is not the same as the last product since it doesnâ€™t have much of a watermelon scent. Cute
