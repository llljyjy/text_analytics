After using this a few times a week for a few weeks, I’ve noticed that my skin definitely looks brighter.  It’s not too harsh.  My skin isn’t drier or stinging after using, which sometimes happens for me when I use exfoliants. It also doesn’t have any smell unlike the other watermelon products from glow recipe. I think this is better because I like my skincare unscented. Not too harsh and brighter skin
