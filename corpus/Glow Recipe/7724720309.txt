This new eye cream is the best that I have tried so far. I was so excited to get the chance to try it. It absorbed very well and helped a lot with brighten the under eye area.  I have a sensitive skin and this cream didn’t irritate my skin. Love using it in my morning and night skincare routine. It makes my under eye area looks so fresh in the morning. Love the ingredients and that’s why it is making it a great eye cream. Highly recommended. Love it and it does really work!
