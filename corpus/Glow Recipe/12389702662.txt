Glow Recipe is my favorite skincare brand, but unfortunately this is the first time I’ve been disappointed by them. Aside from pilling like crazy, the sunscreen sometimes burned a bit when I put it on, and I don’t even have sensitive skin! On top of that, it stings my eyes like crazy. I bought this for spring break and spent the whole time with red burning eyes. Really bummed out by this one as I was so excited for it to come out. pills and stings
