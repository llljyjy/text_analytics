This was a thick, non-greasy feeling cream and didn’t cause any irritation to my eye area. Wonderful for moisturization but did not see any improvements to dark circles/puffiness or just that tired-eye look in general. It’s a nice product, but in my opinion, you could get the same results with a cheaper cream from the drug store. nan
