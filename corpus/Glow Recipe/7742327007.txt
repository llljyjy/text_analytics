I feel like any review wonâ€™t do this mask justice. It is amazing. I am currently on my 2nd round of  Accutane used this to see how it would work out with my dry AF skin. It made my skin so soft and moisturized after just one use. I have now been using it every night right after a cleanser and I wake up with my skin still so soft and looking healthy. It has also really helped with my acne scars and discolouration. Would recommend this for anybody. Amazing.
