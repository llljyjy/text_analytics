This night treatment was so luxurious. The glass jar was heavy and seemed expensive. The formula was very jellylike, but also creamy. It felt like it sunk into my skin rather than sitting on top. After 10 minutes it dried down to a tacky finish. The smell was minimal, which I prefer for my facial skincare products. The next morning my face felt so fresh and hydrated. I have already recommended this product to my sister and a few friends. I would definitely repurchase this for myself or as a gift for someone else. So bright and hydrating!
