Before using Glow Recipe’s Overnight Treatment, J always noticed my skin would look so dull in the morning. After using it a few times, my skin looks fresh and awake in the morning - even before I start my morning routine! My skin already looks brighter and feels more smoother and hydrated. I will definitely be using this more and more throughout the week for sure! I like how it doesn’t feel like a coating or too stiff after you wash off the mask, but it feels like my skin but better. It’s amazing! Skin feels smoother!!
