i really like this product so far! i haven’t been using it long enough to notice a long term difference in my skin, but I do have extremely sensitive skin and I’ve had no reactions! i use this at nighttime and in the morning my skin feels very refreshed and looks glowy! overall I definitely recommend and can’t wait to see the results of using it after a long period of time! nan
