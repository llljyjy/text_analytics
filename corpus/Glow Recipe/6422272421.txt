This made my skin very hydrated and supple. The product does feel very lightweight. I love the glow that it gives the skin. It blends out really well. the texture is really smooth and kinda silky. Due to the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, I feel my face looks brighter and looks more hydrated. Definitely going to be a staple this summer! nan
