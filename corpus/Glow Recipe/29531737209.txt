I am loving this overnight mask! First off, the packing is always on point with Glow Recipe. The mask has a nice pleasant smell that doesn’t linger too long, which I like. My skin felt very hydrated immediately after using it the first night. It feels lightweight on my skin and didn’t cause any sort of irritation. In the morning my skin looks and feels brighter and smoother! Definitely continuing to add this in my night routine! Great Mask
