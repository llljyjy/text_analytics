This is my first time trying Glow Recipe and I loved everything about this product! It is a very lightweight sunscreen that feels light to the touch but leaves a glow on the skin. It is absorbed easily to the skin without leaving any greasy residue and does not leave any white cast like some other sunscreens. It provides spa 50 and has amazing ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and I love the light scent of watermelon - so yummy! This product was gifted but opinions are my own. nan
