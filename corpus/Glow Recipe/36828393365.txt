I’ve been struggling with finding a good moisturizer to use while transitioning from summer to winter, and this one has worked really well. I’d noticed my skin peeling in certain areas, but this product worked really well. Unfortunately, after using for about a week I noticed mold growing in multiple spots. I’ve been very careful about washing my hands before I use, so I don’t know what caused the issue. Thankfully I got the mini so not as much product was wasted. I don’t think I’ll buy again, but this is not a reflection of the brand (I love other products and use daily). Overall, I’d recommend the product, but the mold definitely is steering me away from repurchasing. Great moisturizer for fall, however mold growth
