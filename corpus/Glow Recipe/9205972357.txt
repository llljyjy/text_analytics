Purchased yesterday to try, so can’t really comment on how well it works just yet. Will update in another couple weeks BUT I found this super gentle on my skin. Used it last night & this morning. Most toners really irritate my skin & sting, this one didn’t cause any irritation & made my skin feel nice! Also, it smells absolutely amazing!! Smells amazing!
