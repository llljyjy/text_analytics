Pleasantly surprised at the scent of this sunscreen by Glow Recipe! It goes on smooth, leaves your skin glowing, and doesnâ€™t leave a white film after applying. I wore it for a 2 hour hike with no issues. It is very lightweight and did not seem greasy to me. I cannot wait to wear this more and put it to the test as summer days arrive. Great coverage & smell
