I have very regular skin not so dry not so oily, just in the middle, however I do not break out at all, this cream made me extremely oily on a daily basis and it caused me to break out on my forehead as if I had a rash which got worse over time, I think this could be a good moisturizer if you are washing your face twice a day and doing skin care twice a day but you don’t really want to be doing that, wouldn’t buy again. I definitely recommend testing it before buying it
