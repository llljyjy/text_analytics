I am in LOVE with Glow Recipe’s brand new Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50!!!Sunscreen is a must in my daily skincare routine, I am always looking for sunscreens that work not only on my face but also on my husband and son (and they are a tough crowd!).The hybrid mineral and chemical formula applies like moisturizer, blending smoothly into my face without pilling or leaving a white cast. It’s got the signature Watermelon Glow scent and packed with niacinamide to brighten & even skin tone, hyaluronic acid to hydrate, and aloe to soothe the skin. My son also noticed how easy Glow Recipe’s lightweight formula was to apply on his face before school unlike other pasty sunscreens while it blended easily into my husband’s bearded face. They were both pleased to go on about the day without greasy feeling skin.I love how Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50 gives my face a dewy glow.  Makeup applies well over this moisturizer-like sunscreen though I am just as happy to leave my bare sun protected face shine through.I’ll definitely be buying more when I run out, two thumbs up from me! SPF GLOW UP!
