I know that eye creams in general are known to be a bit gimmick-y but I liked this one. I found it to be super hydrating and soft and I would wake up the next day with really hydrated eyes. I found the container a bit difficult to use, even with the spoon applicator but it was really cute anyways. Nice, softening eye cream
