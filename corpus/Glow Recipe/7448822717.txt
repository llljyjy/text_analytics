I love glow recipe so, so much so when i saw they had a sunscreen, I bought it instantly! however, it definitely pills and doesn’t really work well under makeup at all even though it looks really pretty otherwise! the weird thing to me is that I’m even using other glow recipe stuff (like the dew drops) underneath, so I’m not sure why it pills with other glow recipe stuff. you’d think the products would work well together. I just wish the formula was better. I hope they fix it. I wish I liked it more :(
