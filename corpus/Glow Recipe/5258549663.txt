Dealing with a lot of mask-ne and just dull skin.  After a few nights I could already see how this balanced out my skin texture and I think overtime it’ll help even out and brighten up my skin even more. The scent wasn’t too strong in my opinion and it didn’t bother me. And the cute packaging! Definitely a plus! nan
