I absolutely love love love that glow recipe came out with a sunscreen especially because it has additional skincare benefits (like niacinamide). I love when something streamlines my life or is multi functional/beneficial. I appreciate that there’s no white cast. I was afraid of that. Also, its hydrating and non greasy. I have sensitive, combo, acne prone skin that’s super dry right now because it’s winter so this product’s non comedogenic properties are a win for me. I haven’t tried it under makeup yet though which I am a tad worried about because most hydrating sunscreens I’ve used in the past tend to pill under makeup or just not mix well Hopeful
