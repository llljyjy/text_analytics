This did not disappoint! This is such a beautiful chemical sunscreen that’s super lightweight yet hydrating. It feels like a glowy sunscreen serum, but it leaves my skin dewy and bouncy instead of greasy and slippery. I absolutely love the pink packaging and the sunscreen itself smells like watermelon jolly rancher. It doesn’t leave a white cast which is also another plus! I also love how it contains skin calming and brightening ingredients such as niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and aloe. Totally worth a try. Lightweight, Hydrating, and Skin-Loving
