I loved this at first, especially the color.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day my lips were peeling for the first time in a long time.  I thought at first this might be good as my lips needed to be exfoliated but it continued to happen. I tried it off and on with days in between and my lips continue to peel.  I would love if they would make this product with just the moisture and the tint. Lovely color but repeatedly made my lips peel
