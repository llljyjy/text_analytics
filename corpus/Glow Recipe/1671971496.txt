I love the silky smooth texture of this product, it exfoliates yet keeps my skin hydrated. It layers well with my toner and moisturizer. The difference between this product and other exfoliating acids Iâ€™ve used in the past is the smell, it smells so good but not overpowering. My skin looks refreshed and feels softer after using it for a week now. Will definitely be including it in my routine and highly recommend. Strawberry Goodness
