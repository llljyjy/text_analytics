I wanted to like this sunscreen so badly but it pills on my skin. even when I put it on my clean face after cleansing and no other products on top of it it starts to pill within a few hrs. there no way to wear it under makeup without you having incredibly visible large chunks of the product pilling off all over your face. Pills something awful.
