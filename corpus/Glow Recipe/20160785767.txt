It’s a decent cleanser and smells really good, but it tends to leave my normal skin pretty dry. I feel like it isn’t doing anything for my skin like other cleansers have. I recommend this for people with oily skin but other than that, I’m going to stick to Glossier’s milky jelly cleanser. A rare miss from Glow Recipe for me! Not for me
