Save yourself money and buy something cheaper that does the same thing. I feel like this brand is kinda gimmicky and it’s mostly the cute packaging. About the stickiness, it’s not really to me when used as directed. Make sure your face is damp or mist some water before applying and let it soak in. I hated the stickiness at first then read the instructions again lol the dampness helps. It smells good, but I didn’t really notice anything different in my skin after using all of the product. Better off buying something a lot less expensive that will do the exact same thing imo, that’s why I give it 3 stars. Meh
