This is my favorite product from this brand so far! The texture is so silky and smooth and it isnâ€™t overly scented. The best part though is how much it has helped me with breakouts and texture! I have been having hormonal ache for the past few months on my cheeks and jawline and this has noticeably helped to eliminate acne I currently have, as well as prevent any future breakouts from popping up. My pores also look smaller and overall my skin just looks healthier and glowing. Best glow recipe product hands down!
