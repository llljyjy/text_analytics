Their products are always a hit! I love the smell but itâ€™s very light and definitely smells like strawberries. This glided very smooth across my face. I have added this to my morning routine every other day. I may get up to daily but I was just checking it out first. This definitely brightens my skin and has smooth out so texture I have on my cheeks. nan
