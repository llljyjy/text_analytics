I’ve tried many overnight treatments and this is my favorite so far. I love the texture, it’s lightweight and not too thick or sticky like some other treatments I’ve used in the past. I used it as suggested, as the last step of my routine and in place of a moisturizer, but I think I would use it with a light moisturizer next time for a little extra hydration. I woke up the next morning with bright and smooth skin! Favorite overnight treatment!
