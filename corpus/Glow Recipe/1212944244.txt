Another winner from glow recipe! What’s not to love about this beauty? The packaging is ADORABLE, the serum itself has a fabulous texture and feels great on the skin, it’s gentle and non-irritating, and it leaves my skin feeling and looking soft, smooth, and radiant! I love how effortlessly this beauty has made its way into my routines, layering effortlessly with my other products and absorbing easily into the skin. This serum feels hydrating and leaves my skin feeling smooth and dewy. I like to layer it with plum plump for superior hydration, but it keeps my skin hydrated well on its own as well. Overall I’ve been thoroughly impressed with this serum. Obsessed!
