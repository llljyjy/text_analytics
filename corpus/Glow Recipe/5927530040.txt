I’m an oily skin gal. I used the avocado cleanser for a little over a week. It has a milky texture. Didn’t like the scent, but after rubbing the cleanser for a few seconds, the scent was tolerable. It made my pores appear larger during the day, including days I used it twice. I tried the watermelon clay mask to minimize my pores and feel less sticky/dewy, 1 day while testing the product. It left my skin smooth (less porous). At night, I had to use a quarter size + (after double cleansing w/ Papaya balm) to feel like it was doing something! I got minimal lather, too. It did clean, and I definitely recommend for those with irritated skin, very sensitive skin, or dry skin. I will stick with the blueberry cleanser. Because my skin is sensitive, I’ll have the Avocado cleanser on stand-by for my irritated, nighttime routine, days. For Irritated and Very Sensitive Skin (not oily)
