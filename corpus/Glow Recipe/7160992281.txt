So good! I was researching this product for a while and decided to pull the trigger during the sephora sale! So glad I did.  In conjunction with my BHA, retinol, HLA, and Kiels moiusturizer I’ve had great results.  My undereye discoloration is GONE and morning puffiness greatly diminished.  My skin feels moist, but not heavy and for an oily skin type this is huge.  My makeup lays beautifully even when I skip primer and again for an oily skin type this is a big deal. I definitely recommend if you’re in search of alleviating discolation and antiaging while not feeling like there’s a heavy blanket of moisture on your skin! Undereye discoloration GONE
