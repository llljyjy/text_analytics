I used my points to get a sample of this product. I’m happy with the results. I have quite textured skin, and I also get fungal acne on my forehead from hot yoga (fungal acne is all small, uniform bumps, mine are flesh toned and don’t get whiteheads). I am actually shocked at how well this works as a skin care product without even getting to the dewy side of things. The texture of my skin is much smoother and my forehead is the exceptionally smooth. The niacinamide in this product is really doing it’s job, and is helping to smooth out my texture. I won’t comment on the dewyness of the product because I’m using it primarily at night, and I don’t often wear makeup so I don’t really know if it adds dew. After 2 weeks of use, I have seen a very positive change in my skin and have not had any associated breakouts or skin issues. This is definitely going to be added to my daily skin care regime permanently, and as a person with ultra sensitive, dry, acne prone skin with r rosacea that is a powerful endorsement. nan
