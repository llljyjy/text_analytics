I’m already a fan of Glow Recipe and this product is another great example of how wonderful their skincare products are. I love the texture and how lightweight it is. It’s worked wonders for fading my acne scars and evening out my overall texture and hyper pigmentation. The smell is great and the pretty pink color is shelf worthy! Overall, it’s been really nice to use and I’ve seen great success so far. The packaging is gorgeous and gives a luxury feel to my skin care routine. Worth it !
