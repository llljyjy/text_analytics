This was a really nice, hydrating, medium-weight moisturizer - it always felt great going on - but it just didn’t agree with my skin. It didn’t cause me to break out in widespread cystic acne or anything dramatic like that; it’s more that when I stopped using it, my pores very mysteriously appeared much less congested. Like, the vibes I was getting from my skin were better - clearer! - when this wasn’t in my routine. I used the whole jar - which is super pretty, by the way - twice a day every day, and went through it in 3-ish months. The scent was fine, if not a little on the sweet side. I wish my face liked this more, honestly. The refill pods look so convenient. nan
