i loves glow recipe however i was very skeptical about this one since they had kinda the same sleeping mask, bigger size and thought they just changed the way they package the product which i feel like they did and just add one or two new ingredients, i prefer the watermelons sleeping mask since it was bigger size and cheaper than this AHA mask, is good it hydrates your skin but kinda miss the old version nan
