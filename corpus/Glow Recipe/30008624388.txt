I am obsessed with this! This is one of the best sleep masks I have ever tried! The texture is super runny and thin and feels very lightweight on the skin. It layered really well with the rest of mt night time routine products. I really love that it actually dries down too! Iâ€™ve tried other sleep masks thay stay tacky and sticky and rub off on my pillow, but not this one. It immediately made my skin feel glowy and hydrated. And the next morning, when I rinsed it off, my face was sooo smooth and soft. This is such a winner! AMAZING!!!
