I dont feel like I have been trying it long enough to give a full review.  However I do enjoy this product.  The scent is nice and feels very refreshing to the skin. My face does feel softer this week so I think trying this product is worth a shot. Love everything I’ve tried from Glow recipe so I’m not surprised I’m enjoying this one. Strawberries make you soft
