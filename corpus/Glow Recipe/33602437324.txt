LIFE SAVER for my dry and dull skinned people! Theres a few things you will notice in the first week of using this. -Pimples In the first week of using this products I gained several pimples, which as someone who usually has clear skin, this was rather frightening.Most of the pimples were in places I usually get them them, so i realized this was purging and not break outs. The purging lasted 3 ish weeks  -Less dullness, more healthy lookingI noticed my skin WAY more dewy, not in a greasy way but it made my skin look less dull and more healthy just in 3 days of usage, it looks better then I even thought was possible. -Holy hydration!Before using this, my skin was super dry, (a major con of canadian winters) but within the first 3 days my skin was way more hydrated then its ever been!Pros of Glow Recipe’s Dew drops-Helps with acne overtime-Makes your skin have a healthy glow-Keeps your skin super hydrated Cons of Glow Recipe’s Dew drops-Takes a long time to dry down (usually 10 minutes)-Gives you 2-6 weeks of purging depending on skinOverall Id rate it 4.8 Stars DRY DULL SKIN?
