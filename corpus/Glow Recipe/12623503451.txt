I thought all vitamin C serums would be pretty similar, but it turns out, not so much. Keep in mind I paired this with Glow Recipe Pink Juice Moisturizer and I ended up with excessive shiny-face and major pilling while trying to apply makeup. Saying goodbye to these two and going back to Summer Fridays CC Me Serum with Vitamin C and Summer Fridays Cloud Dew Moisturizer which never disappoint. nan
