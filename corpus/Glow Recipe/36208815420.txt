I think it is a pretty good cleanser, it doesnt quite remove my mascara well, but it leaves my skin feeling soft. The smell is nice and faint. The product is quite thick in consistency, and can be difficult to lather. I used it in the morning and night for 2 days and can already tell a difference! This is for someone who likes light cleansers that doesnâ€™t use makeup too often. Pretty Nice
