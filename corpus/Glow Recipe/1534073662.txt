I woke up this morning shocked on how my skin looked and felt! I have oily to combination skin so my skin is no stranger to texture and rough skin. I used this product with a BHA to see if my skin could handle it. I woke up to morning first to see my skin glowing! but as I was washing my face this morning I felt how smooth my skin was, as a oily girl this is rare for me because of how oily I get. My skin felt so amazing that to be honest I didn’t need any foundation or powder. I just wanted to let me skin breathe and stick to just skincare in the morning. I turned 30 this year and I decided to let go of the makeup and focus on my skin! I can’t wait to use this again later this week. This literally left my skin baby soft. This soft is amazing paired with other products! My skin is baby soft smooth!
