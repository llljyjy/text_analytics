Glow recipe products are always amazing but this serum really wowed me! First off, packaging is great. The scent of the serum is really light and fresh without being overpowering, but still was lovely. The texture was super smooth and it absorbed quickly into my skin. In the morning, my skin felt so so soft - will definitely repurpose this serum when itâ€™s all gone! nan
