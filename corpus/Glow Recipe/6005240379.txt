I like it but it’s hard for me to say I Love it and I really wanted to. I’ve been using it for about a month now and see no major difference. I’ll continue to use it until I run out and make a decision on rebuying or not. I’m also not a fan of the shape of the jar. If you’re using your finger, you really have to get in there to get some product on your finger. I ended up buying a specific tool to use instead of my finger. it’s OK
