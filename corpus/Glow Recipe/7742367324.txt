This works amazing to get my makeup off as a first step, followed by my usual face wash. Great in a double cleanse routine!!! It does smell a bit sweet but is not overly off putting. I would not use this as a stand alone cleanser, but for makeup wearers this is definitely a holy grail! Amazing makeup removal in a double cleanse routine
