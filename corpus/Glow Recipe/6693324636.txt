I really enjoy the new formula of this product. If you’re familiar with the old one it’s sort of like to a separate on itself this one is in much nicer consistency that doesn’t do that. Also love the addition of niacinamide. This leaves my skin feeling nice and supple and soft and I love the way that it smells. Nice change!
