I love this!  It is very refreshing to use for skin care and for make up application. To me this smells more like cucumber than watermelon, nonetheless I like the scent. It is very light and moisturizing on the skin and I like the way the missed disperses. I recommend keeping this in the fridge before use,it is so refreshing. nan
