I like that this has very little scent and reasonable texture and so far no breakouts or redness on my sensitive skin, only been using 3 days, maybe not very heavy, so might end up using a small bit more than some other moisturizers, no magic anti aging fix for me but not bad for everyday use under my makeup so far. Nice but no magic
