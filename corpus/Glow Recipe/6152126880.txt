It has a lightweight, slightly sticky texture that wears nicely under due to its tackiness. It’s gentle and doesn’t sting my eyes like a lot of vitamin c eye cream do.  My eyes look a lot more hydrated and plumped after using this. One thing I would change is the applicator straw, but it’s not a big deal so this serum is still 5 stars to me. Makes a difference!
