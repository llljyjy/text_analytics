I am so excited Glow Recipe has a product out that has 50 SPF in it! I love the sleek bottle design (with a cap that screws off) that makes it easy to travel with. There is a faint scent which is a mix between sunscreen and watermelon. This lotion absorbs QUICK which makes me feel like you have to apply a decent amount because it absorbs as you apply it. Itâ€™s a very lightweight lotion but also moderately moisturizing and non-greasy. Yay for 50 SPF!
