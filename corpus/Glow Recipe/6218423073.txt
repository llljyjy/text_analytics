I received this product as a sample. Usually, it takes me a while to love any new product. But this one, I fell in love with it the moment I tried it. This mask does everything it claims. With only one use I saw a huge difference in my pores also with my active acne. It didnâ€™t dry my skin out like any other clay mask. It left my skin soft and blurred and hydrated! Definitely will be buying it in the furture! Favorite Clay Mask!
