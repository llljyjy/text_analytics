I have been using this product for about a week now, and I must say that I’m really lovin it. This serum makes my skin look radiant and hydrated. My coworkers did notice a change in my skin too. It’s really light and goes really well with all my other skincare products. There’s no smell and it’s not sticky when applied. The pretty bottle it comes with is a plus! Hoping to achieve my glass skin goals with this! Loving it!
