In the morning I wake up with really puffy eyes so I need an eye cream that not only helps with my dark under eyes, but also with puffiness. This product does exactly what I need it to! It depuffs my eyes and brightens my under eyes. I love the lightweight gel texture because I have oily skin, so sometimes eye creams can be too heavy, but this is perfect. It also absorbs really nicely into the skin and a little bit goes a long way. nan
