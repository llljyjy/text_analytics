I got this as a sample offer and Much like a lot of other people, I was dissapointed to see that it was only half full at best. BUT, the product is amazing. I noticed a difference after just one use and now that I’ve been using it for a week (don’t need more than a rice grain amount per use) I can really see the difference. Even started applying it to my 11s. I think part of the reason is that it almost works like slugging to hold moisture in while it works its retinol magic. Just ordered the full size! LOVE -- but wish the sample was full
