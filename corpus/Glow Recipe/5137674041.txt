I love this product because it doesn’t trip up my dry, sensitive skin, and it plays nice with my makeup and other skincare products. I use this during the day after toner. I spray some Evian on my face and then apply two pumps—my skin looks SO hydrated and radiant afterwards. 10/10 would recommend! Holy Grail Product!
