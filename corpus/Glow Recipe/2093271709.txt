I’m not a fan of this product. I think if you are going to release a new sunscreen with so many on the market it has to be top notch. I have a deeper skin tone and the issue is the weird cast, and even when you blend it in it just gives your face a strange finish. And you really have to rub it in so it blends and then it pills. I’m sorry but I shouldn’t have to be messing around with different moistures and serums under to make this work. A sunscreen should be no fuss. I like the sun lotion from Dr. Jart the one with the blue cap. it’s twice as much product and a similar price. nan
