I use this every night and morning! My skin before had been irritated after hair removal in the morning because of my PCOS, and this has helped sooo much! And my pores in my T-zone are smaller, plus my skin isnâ€™t oily at the end of the day like it was before. I love this toner! love! it never stings!
