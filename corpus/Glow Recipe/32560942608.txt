Was hesitant because of the watermelon aspect. Felt like I was 11 again in my lip-smackers, bubblicious and bath & body works fake-watermelon everything era but surprisingly love this. Definite gel-based rather than cream so seems to sit on top of skin more than melting in, but it works for me as a daytime moisturizer under other stuff. Need more hydrating cream at night. So far so goodâ€¦we will see if my skin responds well. Not aggressively fake watermelon scent
