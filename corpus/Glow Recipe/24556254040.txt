I love the way this makes my skin feel. It feels so nice immediately after & the next morning, it feels so smooth and hydrated. I will definitely be using a lot! I’m glad that the smell isn’t too crazy to give me a headache, because that often happens with sweet smelling products, but this one is in the clear. I do feel some a difference using this product vs other treatments. Some just feel sticky & tacky. I don’t necessarily think I would spend $40 on this product, but I would recommend this to many people! nan
