I absolutely love the Strawberry Smooth Serum! I’ve been struggling with breakouts lately, and this serum has been a godsend. The texture is light and smooth, and it sinks easily into the skin without being sticky. It’s gentle yet effective. After only 1 day of use my breakout was already calming down. And that smell?! HEAVENLY. I really love using it under the Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream. Such a wonderful combo for my combination skin. nan
