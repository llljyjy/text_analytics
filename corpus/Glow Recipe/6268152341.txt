This super cute little bottle houses a classic sunscreen with a fun twist. The texture is the more “classic” sunscreen feel. It’s an opaque cream with a medium weight consistency. I love the smell of it and the fun twist of having niacinimide! I think this will have positive long term results on my complexion and I like that it doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. nan
