Is this made of gold?? Why is it so unbelievably expensive? That being said, I bought this because of redness and sensitivity due to a very damaged skin barrier. I suppose it worked really well and left my skin with a smooth and radiant glow, and soothed my redness and sensitivity. I even got compliments on how my skin looked. However, I will not repurchase unless my skin barrier somehow gets really damaged again because of the exorbitant price. It worked really really well, but I am subtracting a star because of price. How do you expect everyday folk to afford this is beyond me! Oh, it helps if you use a toner under this as it makes for a really smooth blanket the serum can glide on.  I would recommend this product if youâ€™re dealing with redness, sensitivity or a damaged skin barrier. Works well, waay too expensive.
