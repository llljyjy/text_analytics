this is my holy grail moisturizer and iâ€™m on my third bottle now, its so lightweight for my oily skin and its got amazing packaging and a sweet fragrance that goes away once you apply it. it keeps your skin looking dewy and soft even after it settles into your skin, my skin really likes it too. best moisturizer ever
