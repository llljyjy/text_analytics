So far I really love this product! I usually do not like scented products at all, but for some reason I really don’t mind Glow Recipe’s scents and they don’t irritate my skin. I love Niacinimide in my skincare, it has literally saved my skin in the past so I always look for it in new products. I’ve been seeing a lot of Tik Tok reviews that the product pills, but I haven’t had that problem as I use a small amount at a time to build up. I think it also just depends on what products you use underneath! The brand really did a great job with this product, as usual. Also, the packaging is so cute! Killed it again! nan
