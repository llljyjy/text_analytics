Nice product, but it tends to not break up when applying on skin. After you apply all over your face,you will need a small amount of water for it emulsify. This doesn’t rinse off..you will need to wipe off with a washcloth. I notice this doesn’t take off eye makeup that easily, but is gentle on the eyes. Nice product
