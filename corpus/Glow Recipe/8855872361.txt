I have been using this every day and night, as instructed, for 14 days. It helped clear up my acne a little and helped with scaring. My pores look about the same in my opinion. The texture of the product is nice and melts into my skin quite nicely. I’m not a huge fan of the smell, but it does go away really quickly. For comparison I have the watermelon face mask and that product smells much better than this one. This toner has been the best toners I have tried so far though! I didn’t break me out or feel strange on my face. nan
