I love this serum so much. It really made a difference on my face! however, according to the instructions, it says to apply daily during the AM and PM. I did this at first which I had no problem doing but over time, my face started to burn around the cheek area every time I apply it and become bright red/inflamed. Considering this is a chemical acid hence Salicylic Acid, I have changed my usage with this product and it still works great. I recommend using this serum 2-3 times per week, not everyday especially if you have sensitive skin and a weak skin barrier. SENSITIVE SKIN USERS! PLEASE READ!
