I like this cream, I noticed my skin looked much brighter after a couple of days of using it. However, the container makes it so that a lot of the cream goes to waste. The pump stopped filling with cream after less than a month of using it and I thought I had finished it. I took the pump off and found that it had not finished but the pump/straw wasnâ€™t able to catch the sides of the bottle. Very poor design for a luxury product. Good cream, poor container.
