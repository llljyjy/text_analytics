Iâ€™m a sucker for products with AHA since my skin tends to get textured spots on the days I work. The product itself is a light gel that absorbs nicely into the skin. For me I like to mist my face with plain rose water then apply the mask (dime size only). If I do more than it becomes a little sticky. Took about 15 min to fully absorb into the skin and I was ready for bed. In the morning my skin had a lovely glow, almost as if I had highlighter on ! You have to try this !! Get glowing
