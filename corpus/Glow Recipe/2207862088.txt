I always use moisturizers and spf because I can never find a moisturizers that has spf that doesn’t leave me greasy or with a white cast. This moisturizer completely changed the game by being moisturizing but not greasy AND provides spf without the white cast. If you’re on the market for a 2 in 1 product to make your morning routine a little shorter, I highly recommend. 2 in 1, with the both products being amazing!
