I’ve been using this night treatment for the past days and I’m in love already, i use it as the last step of my night routine, and it’s helped so much with my texture and the overall smoothness of my face, it’s so easy to apply and my face feels so soft and moisturized in the morning, it’s been an amazing addition to my skin care routine and I would highly recommend it a must for my skincare routine
