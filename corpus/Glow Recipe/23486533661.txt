I was so excited for this. What a huge disappointment. The pilling is so much worse than you could imagine. I’ve seen others say it soaked into their skin with no cast, I wasn’t so lucky. Between the pilling and the horrible white cast it leaves on my Med/Tan skin tone, it’s unmanageable. What a disappointment!
