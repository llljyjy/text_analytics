Not at all a fan. I was super excited to try this product, since I’ve enjoyed every glow recipe product I’ve tried, but it just pills terribly. At first I thought maybe it just pilled because of the serum I use. Removed it: still pills. Then I thought okay maybe it pills because of my makeup. I removed my makeup and and only used the sunscreen and…it pills. I would not recommend this to anyone. Pills terribly
