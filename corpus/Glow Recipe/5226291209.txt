For those of us with oily skin, finding a product that actually works like it says it will is very difficult. For me it’s taken time, money and A LOT of duds. This product however, is a GODSEND! I use it in conjunction with a few other products, and my skin is as soft as a baby’s bottom. There’s no greasy residue, no weird pilling, just fabulous skin! Thank you so much Glow Recipe, you finally hit the nail on the head! If you have truly oily skin or acne, you just HAVE to try this! Other products that I use in my regimen:* Cleanse with Origins Checks and Balances* AmorePacific Vintage Single Extract essence* Apply serum with this product - Strawberry Smooth* Finish with Origins Original Skin Matte moisturizer. Oily Skin or acne? Not anymore!
