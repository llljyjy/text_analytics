I’m in love this moisturizer it’s become my go to! It’s super hydrating which I need especially during these cold winter months! It leaves my skin feeling super soft and supple and looking dewy without leaving it feeling greasy and oily. I love that it also meshes well with my foundation and keeps my skin glowing and hydrated all day! My new favorite moisturizer!
