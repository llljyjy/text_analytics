It’s just okay. For the price, I should be noticing more of a difference. I actually love the gel-to-foam consistency, but I didn’t feel like it cleansed like it should. When paired with other products from this brand, I think it does help with the texture of my skin-it feels softer, more even, and small bumps go away-but, that could just be a result of the other products. This cleanser feels nice on my skin, it smells nice, and has an enticing name-but it needs to do more to justify the price tag. Don’t think I’d buy again because I didn’t notice any outstanding results after 2 weeks of using.  For reference, I have been using this while staying in a cold, dry area Just okay
