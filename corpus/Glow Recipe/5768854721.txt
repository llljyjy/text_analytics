Like others have said, I wanted to love this but it pilled like crazy even on it own without other products layered. I rarely return products but I did take this back. People suggest all sorts of tricks to work with it but I feel for the price point I shouldn’t have to put in extra effort to avoid pilling. Don’t waste your time with this one!
