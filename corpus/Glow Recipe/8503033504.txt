I got a sample of this with a purchase and I wanted to love this because I love so many Glow Recipe products but unfortunately this didnâ€™t do it for me. Yes, my skin felt immediately hydrated afterwards and it did leave my skin glowing which I loved. A little goes a long way which is also nice in terms of value. However, it also left my skin feeling sticky! And when I say sticky, not like lightly tacky that goes away after applying the rest of my skincare (I can handle that). This was sticky that lasted all day even after finishing the rest of my skincare routine. Literally more than 12 hours later and still sticky so this is not a product I would purchase or recommend.
