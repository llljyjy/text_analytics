This is so nice. Iâ€™ve been using this at night as my last step in my night time routine. I do everything as normal. Cleanse, moisturize, and then I use this as my last step. In the morning I cleanse again and use my normal skin care products. I would say I have normal to dry skin and THIS makes my skin so soft, dewy, and glowy in the morning!!! nan
