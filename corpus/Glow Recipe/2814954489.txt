After using the Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser for 2 weeks, I’m thrilled with the results. On day 1, it soothed my skin while it cleanses. On day 3, I came down with a head cold and the avocado cleanser kept my  skin from becoming dry or irritated. My skin looked great all throughout the head cold, which is incredible!! The second week has been just as good! My skin is calm, clear, and moisturized. I’m thrilled with the results and will keep using the avocado cleanser! Loving the results!
