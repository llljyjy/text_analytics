Growing up using sunscreen wasnâ€™t a huge deal so getting the hang of using it everyday has been sort of a struggle. I could never find one that I loved until now. This product left my skin feeling so smooth and soft. This product is lightweight doesnt leave ur skin feeling greasy and easy to blend. Just make sure u pat it in, do not rub or it will start to peel.  I love that it contains several other ingredients that will improve the look of my skin over time. The packaging is beautiful. Such a cute glow baby pink in a unique shaped bottle. Overall I love this product I think its genius and will remain in my daily skin care routine. Must have product
