This product is pleasant to use and works. The smell is nice, and it does a good job breaking down make up.However, once I use it up, I likely won’t buy it again. I find that it’s harder to wash off with just water than other oil cleansers I’ve used. Even though I use it in a double cleansing regimen, this is challenging in the eye area as I use oil cleanser to break down eye make up but don’t use my other cleanser in my eye area.Also, it doesn’t spread as much as other oil cleansers, so I give myself using more. Smells Good and Gets the Job Done
