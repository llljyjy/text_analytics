I really wish this eye cream came in a tube or tub with a lid - having a pump package on it just seems SO wasteful! On the plus side, this cream provides the hydration without being too thick. I pair it with some reusable eye masks and love how smooth and soft my under eyes feel / look! This is a great option for those prone to dehydration and darkness under the eyes Questionable packaging
