This is such a beautiful and wonderful product! It has a glass container that remind me of rose quartz. I have incorporated this over-night moisturizer to my daily night-time routine. I have been using it every night for about 2 weeks now! Works well layered with any of my other night time products! It feels really nice when Iâ€™m applying it on before bed. It makes my skin feel much smoother and glowy! The formula has a very dewy and pink appearance. It has a very light delicious watermelon scent that is almost not noticeable, which is great for sensitive skin. It leaves my skin super hydrated and bouncy the next morning. With consistency, I have been noticing positive differences with the appearance of my skin. So hydrating and beautiful!
