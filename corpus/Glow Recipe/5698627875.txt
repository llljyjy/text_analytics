Placed an order and got the trial size so I have been able to use the little sample for almost 3 weeks. I stick to drugstore/Cerave moisturizer because I have acne prone skin and moisturizers tend to break me out and I like to keep it simple when it comes to this step since I already have essences and serums that do the heavy lifting. Well this moisturizer definitely impressed me and it has been added to my wishlist for future purchase. I have oily/combo skin that can get just a little dry in the winter so this gel-cream consistency has really worked for me both day and night. I also don’t think this will be a problem during the summer time because it is light but nourishing. It goes on with a nice healthy glow but this does go away after a few seconds. My sample didn’t have any scent but I do see that it has a bunch of extracts and parfum on the ingredients list so the fact that some reviews have said it smells good makes me a little wary as I don’t use skincare with fragrance. One more thing, it hasn’t done anything for me other than moisturize me so I wouldn’t pay full price, there isn’t anything too special about it but during a sale, I’ll make sure to grab it! Nice
