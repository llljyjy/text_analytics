I received this product as a sample and was instantly obsessed. I don’t usually like scented products, but the scent is lovely! I have extremely dry skin, and woke up with dewey skin after applying this at night. It’s lightweight yet deeply moisturizing. It doesn’t feel greasy, and it doesn’t pill on top on my Vitamin C serums or hyaluronic acid, or under my SPF and squalane oil. Probably the best moisturizer I have discovered yet. WOWOWOW
