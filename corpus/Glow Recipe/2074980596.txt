I have dry skin and I like a product that gives me some glow. This is quite a glowy sunscreen, so I would avoid it if you aren’t into that. The consistency is not too thick and it is easy to spread out. It has a slight oily feel but it absorbs after about 30 minutes or so. I appreciate the high value of SPF. Although I like it, I can see how it wouldn’t be for everyone, so for that reason, I wouldn’t recommend it. Oh and the reviews about pilling - if I use it on top of a light moisturizer its fine but it pills up over hyaluronic acid serum. Pretty good for dry skin
