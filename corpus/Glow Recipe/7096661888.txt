This toner has been my go-to for awhile now! I love the viscous consistency that dries down quickly, leaving me with bouncy, glowy skin and the perfect base to follow up with serum and moisturizer. I noticed how the appearance of the pores on my nose changed too! The watermelon scent provides an extremely sensorial skincare experience, which makes my routine so much fun. Highly recommend! nan
