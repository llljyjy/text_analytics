I really loved how this feels on my under eye area. I’ve only been using it for a week, so I can’t say whether it actually helps with darkness and such but the over all feel of it and the fact that it’s a small pea size that goes a long way, it’s a A+ in my book! The scent isn’t heavy and it’s really subtle. The packaging is perfect as well! Definitely recommend! Great eye cream!
