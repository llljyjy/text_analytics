This is such a cute eye cream but it’s so expensive for the size! It is tiny! Also, I do like some of the packaging but don’t care for the lines on each side of the eye cream. The eye cream doesn’t have any smell which is disappointing. It is moisturizing but is more of a gel consistency than a cream. nan
