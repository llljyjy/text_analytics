I am absolutely in love with this product. I’m reaching my 30’s and I always felt like Glow Recipe was more targeted towards the younger adults. So when I tried this product, I was skeptical… but it proved me wrong immediately. I applied it in the evening after my glycolic acid toner from The Ordinary and WOW. My skin was plump and hydrated. Woke up with a glowwww the next morning. Recently got their Watermelon Toner too & this moisturizer perfectly compliments it. oily but dehydrated girlies will love this
