So I love Glow Recipe products so I was very excited when they launched this, and I want to love it so badly, but it’s a really difficult product to work with. it’s difficult just to apply this product without having it pill, and it’s been basically impossible to wear this under makeup because it just pills and makes my dry skin more dry. Also, I’m Italian so I’m white but I have olive skin, and ive had an issue with this leaving a white cast over my skin when it’s pilling bad. I love how glowy it makes my skin, but it’s just really hard to work with, and I honestly wouldn’t recommend it. I love Glow Recipe, but this is a pass.
