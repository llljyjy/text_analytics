I’m surprised at how much I like this! I have dry and sensitive skin but large pores (yes, all skin types can have large pores and/or acne, not just oily) that get easily clogged, but I hesitate to use even gentle chemical exfoliants these days because I spent years overexfoliating my already parched and exhausted skin. Additionally whenever I use a clay mask my skin ALWAYS ends up feeling super dry/tight and uncomfortable after, and my skin never feels better off for using it. So the idea of a hydrating clay mask was super enticing to me, and I decided to give it a try despite the AHA/BHAs. And I’m so glad I did! My skin felt so smooth and hydrated after rinsing it off, and I only felt a slight tingle due to the chemical exfoliants but they did not exacerbate my redness or sensitivity like usual. Side note, the tiny amount of physical exfoliant in here is seriously not a problem at all - since this is a rinse-off mask not a moisturizer or overnight mask, you shouldn’t be rubbing it into your skin at all, only applying gently to the surface, so you won’t get microtears or damage your skin barrier. Don’t let people scare you over it. Seriously the amount of blueberry shells or whatever is so small it really doesn’t matter, this isn’t St. Ives scrub level lol. Docking a star because I really don’t like the smell, and because I have a feeling I’m going to run out quickly because it’s a smaller size. But when I do run out, I’ll definitely repurchase! A must-have for dry skin with large pores
