I really wanted to like this because although Glow Recipe is known for using fruits in their products, the thought of using strawberries was different to me, because it’s not an ingredient I see in a lot of skincare products, and I just love the fruit itself! I saw a lot of reviews saying it smelled like the real thing, and I do agree with that, but I could also smell artificial strawberries mixed in. You get a little bit of both! Anyways, the product unfortunately broke me out! I was hoping it was a small purge since it exfoliates, but it was every time I used it I noticed something new in my face. My face has been freaking out in the past few months with texture, which is honestly something my skin is foreign to, so I was really hoping this would help, but unfortunately it didn’t! I’d still say for everyone to at least give it a try or get a sample of you can because everyone’s skin is different from the next! Wanted to like this!
