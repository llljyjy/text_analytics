Let me warn you first, it smells like bubble gum. I know the product claims guava, but it is NOT a guava scent. Would not recommend to anyone who doesn’t like fragrant face products. The smell does go away shortly after applying to the skin. As far as what it does, I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and seems to have helped slightly with evening out my skin tone. The change is not as dramatic as I would like, but I think I need to wear sunscreen more often to protect the investment. The texture is like a water-y lotion, so that’s not bad. I’m not opposed, but I don’t know that I would repurchase. nan
