I love Glow Recipe products, but I could take or leave this. Obviously it smells wonderful and gives a beautiful hydrated glow, but it’s not a unique result, though from a unique product. I like to douse my face with all sprays so it does go quickly, so I have to balance the price with anything I spray. May or may not purchase again, but it’s not bad by any means, just not sure if it’s worth the cost. But complements the other watermelon glow products in the line nicely. Incredibly fine mist which would be perfect for setting spray but I honestly would like more for this type of product. lovely scent, super fine mist, but just ok
