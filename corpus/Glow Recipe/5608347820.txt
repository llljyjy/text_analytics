I’ve been using this for a few weeks and I must say this is the gentlest aha/bha/salicylic acid treatment I’ve come across. Instantly absorbs into my skin and leaves a refreshed, plump feeling that I really enjoy, thanks to the addition of hyaluronic acid. I’ve noticed the most difference in my pores; they’re smaller and less visible since I started using the serum. The best part is not only the cute packaging but also the yummy strawberry scent. It’s very light and non irritating. Will recommend to anyone who’s looking to start incorporating acids into their skincare routine. 4 stars only because I haven’t used it long enough to give a fair enough verdict! Recommend for anyone new to acids
