I’ve given this product many chances, however it just does not work with my skin! Something in it irritates my skin, it causes my skin to break out. The breakouts stop when I stop using it. My skin is quite dry and has dehydrated areas, however it didn’t moisturize at all. It left me extremely oily, and not with the beautiful glow others have said. Unfortunately doesn’t work for my skin but it does smell so wonderfully like watermelon! I tried so hard to like it. :( nan
