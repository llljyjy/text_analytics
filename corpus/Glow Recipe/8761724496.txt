Overall I find this product okay. This texture is thick which I like for an eye cream since it keeps the under eyes hydrated over night, but given the price and the minimal results, I would not but it again. I just haven’t seen much change since I’ve been using. I’m sure there are better alternatives. Nonetheless, still obsessed with the glow recipe. nan
