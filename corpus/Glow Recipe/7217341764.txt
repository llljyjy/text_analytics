one of the first products i’ve ever tried from glow recipe was from their watermelon line so i knew i had to try this. the ingredients in this are amazing!! i’ve been using this every other night and i noticed that my skin looks more glowy the morning after i use this. i’m hoping this helps with my acne scars in the long run. nan
