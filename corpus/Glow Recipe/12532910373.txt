I bought this product hoping it would help with winter dry skin. I have dry skin and it’s far worse in the winter. I know any products like this one with hylaronic acid work by pulling in moisture from the air into our skin and are best used when your skin is still damp. I pat my face after washing with my hands ** no towel** then apply. If I use serums I pat water onto my skin before applying anything with hylaronic acid. So far it keeps my skin hydrated. It goes on smooth and absorbs well. It has a light scent. it’s not the best moisturizer I’ve ever used but it’s pretty good. It didn’t pill after I applied sunscreen, another good point. It's not bad :)
