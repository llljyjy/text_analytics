Surprisingly, this is my first Ike I’ve used the watermelon mask! I haven’t used the older one so I was super exited when this was coming out with a new formula. Love how easy it applies! There is a slight scent, so if your sensitive to fragrance, be aware! Haven’t noticed any changes in my skin yet but hoping to see results in the time listed! nan
