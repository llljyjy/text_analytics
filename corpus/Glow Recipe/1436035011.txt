I received a sample of the Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser from Glow Recipe for review purposes. I am 45 with dry, dehydrated skin that still breaks out occasionally and is prone to hard, oil-clogged pores at my temples and cheeks. My primary treatment concerns are hyper-pigmentation (from acne) and crows feet. I used the GR avocado cleanser twice a day for two weeks. The cleanser was creamy yet rinsed away cleanly. (It’s reminiscent of the Herbivore Cloud Jelly Cleanser, for comparison purposes, but is a touch more moisturizing.) The GR cleanser is a really nice “final cleanser” as I do use an oil/balm first step, second step foam cleanser, then a “treatment” third cleanser such as one that contains glycolic acids, AHA, PHA, salicylic acid, or a moisturizing cleanser, depending on what my skin needs.  I really appreciated the GR avocado cleanser on days after I’d used a chemical exfoliant. It was very soothing and did not cause any stinging. I highly recommend this for all skin types, even oily or acne-prone. As I mentioned earlier, it does rinse away cleanly and did not leave behind any filmy residue. I also love that it has ceramides and pre/postbiotics, so I’m treating my skin as well as gently cleansing. Overall 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️! Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser - 5 ⭐️s
