While this product seems to be either a love it or hate it in the community, for me, it’s a love it. It goes on so nice after my moisturizer, doesn’t leave a white cast, doesn’t leave me greasy, smells like watermelon, etc. The only reason it gets 4-stars and not 5-stars is that it doesn’t always play well with my foundation. If I used a thin liquidy-based foundation it is fine, but a thicker foundation pills when applied over this product. A must have SPF for my skincare routine
