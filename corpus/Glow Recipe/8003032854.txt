I got a free sample of this in one of my sephora orders and now im coming back to purchase the full thing. I LOVED how this felt on my skin, i have skin that isnt necessarily sensitive but does get irritated/dry when products have heavy fragrances and stuff like that and this stuff soothed my skin so well. Its very lightweight and makes my skin look so youthful and bouncy. It also did not create any breakouts on my skin. My holy grail moisturizer is the cerave daily moisturizer and this honestly might beat it for me. Not quite sure if i would recommend it to people with oily skin, maybe try a sample if you can because it is quite hydrating. But if youâ€™re looking for that hydrating glow or have normal to dry skin, then i would 10000000% say buy this. Got a sample-now buying the whole thing
