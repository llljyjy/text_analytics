I am very puzzled by all the reviews saying that this pills up on the skin. I donâ€™t follow the patting it on the skin instructions but I sort of smooth it over the skin. I really love the glowy finish it leaves and find it wears beautiful under makeup. This is been the case after I use the Tatcha Water Cream and Dr. Jart Cicapair Color Correcting Treatment. I did, however, just got the Herbivore Pink Cloud Moisturizer, so hopefully it will continue to wear well. I have noticed no irritation but my daughter did stop using after complaining of an itchy face. Her skin typically reacts better than mine with products so I can see it causing irritation to some people. I have not noticed a cast on my fair skin or my daughters latte skin tone. If you can get it to smooth over the skin with no irritation, this is a gorgeous, high SPF lotion that I have sincerely been enjoying. No pilling here
