This night treatment is so nice! The scent is very light, barely there, so it’s great for those sensitive to scents. The texture is a watery gel type and I love it, it feels so good on the skin! I love how hydrating it is and gentle. After cleansing I use a toner, eye cream and sometimes a serum, then last apply this overnight mask and it’s been great! I wake up with smooth, plump skin. No issues at all with this one, definitely recommend it! nan
