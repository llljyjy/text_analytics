This new guava vitamin c bight eye gel cream is lightweight and absorbs like a dream. I love how it helps depuff and brightens under eyes while keeping them nice and hydrated.  Works well under my concealer and does not pill up or crease. Another amazing creation by glow recipe. Keeps the under eyes extremely hydrated and comes in the cutest bottle that holds alot of product. A must have!!!
