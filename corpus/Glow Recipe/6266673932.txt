After using this product, I could already see the difference after the first wash. I love how this cleanser hydrates my face, you could really feel the difference after you rinse your face. I recommend it for people with sensitive skin like me. Itâ€™s so calming and soothing as well, it takes my make up off gently. I am now torn between using this and the blueberry face wash. All in one cleanser
