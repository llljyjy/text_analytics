I love Glow Recipe products. This will be my only cleanser. I liked the blueberry more than the apricot, but this new avocado cleanser is so improved (over both). My face feels like it’s fully complete when I’m done cleansing. Like it has moisturizer on it.  I realize I also like this creamy texture over the others, as well. While I don’t eat/like avocados, GR’s avocado line is sensational!  I do hope they make it this in a large size. Also, kindly requesting this formula in a body wash! Game changer new cleanser!
