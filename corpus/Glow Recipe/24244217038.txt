The new Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow AHA night treatment is great! I’ve used it 3-4 times now and happy to report my skin feels and looks great with no reaction.  I can tell my skin is more even, less dull, firmer, and hydrated after use. The texture is a lightweight gel and applies great over other products as the last step of my skincare routine. I’ve been using it twice a week. Love this overnight treatment!
