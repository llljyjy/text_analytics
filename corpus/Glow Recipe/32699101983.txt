I can’t live without this stuff. How did I remove eye makeup before? I can’t remember. This stuff smells delicious, feels wonderful, does its job and leaves my skin soooo soft. Lately it has been sold out of my Sephora stores, so I have been hoarding it like a crazy person in fear that it will become more difficult to get. I am obsessed.
