I used it for the first time tonight since I was out of my farmacy cleansing balm and although it may be too early to say, but I think I found a new favourite! This one glides on my skin a lot smoother than the farmacy cleansing balm does. I still have to see how it effects my skin in the long term but upon first impressions, my skin feels amazing!With every cleansing balm, I always do a double or triple cleanse to ensure thereâ€™s no makeup residue leftover. I find a cleansing balm is great at gently loosening long lasting makeup like mascara without tugging and damaging skin. I used the ole henriksen wonderfeel double cleanse (discontinued) and the truth juice cleanser. I feel like the 2 totally took everything off.Will update if any future adverse reactions. So far, so good!
