I have been using this daily for a little over 4 months now and i love it. I use this every morning to help calm down any redness i have. It doesn’t make all the redness in breakouts go away but diminishes the redness around them making my breakouts less noticeable. This product is something i will continue to use because i love how well it works to calm the overall redness in my face. My skin can be really sensitive because i use a prescription retinod and this serum is so gentle that it never bothers me even when my cheeks are sensitive from using my retinod. I actually keep this serum in the fridge because it feels great in the morning using this when it’s cold. nan
