I have combination - oily, acne-prone, dark skin, and I purchase this sunscreen on a whim without reading any reviews, which is VERY unlike me when it come to skincare products for my face). I have been using this product regularly for the past week, and I have experienced no issues at all. No pilling, no white cast, no breakouts, and no burning or irritation. I’ve applied this sunscreen a few minutes after putting on my moisturizer and I have reapplied while I was extremely hot and sweaty (wiped off the sweat, of course!), and still had no problem. However, I do not wear makeup, so this is probably a contributing factor. Honestly, if you live close enough to a Sephora that you can easily return, if necessary, and can purchase without breaking the bank, I’d definitely recommend trying it out! A definite hit for me!
