I have mild rosacea and my skin is on the dry side. After researching serums to help with this I landed on this one. It’s out of my price range but I thought I would splurge! It makes a huge difference. I used up my bottle and didn’t repurchase immediately and noticed my skin was not looking as even toned and supple. Then I repurchased! I wish there was a larger size - I used up the whole bottle in about a month. Great results!
