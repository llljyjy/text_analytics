i don’t normally leave reviews but this product was legitimately the worst sunscreen i’ve ever tried. i love glow recipe and all of their products and have been supporting them for a very long time but this product was pilling, left a white cast, and did not sit well under my makeup. i’m extremely disappointed and hope they can fix this formula. nan
