I’m not a big fan of expensive moisturizers with fragrance anymore, I prefer to stick to simple, derm grade skincare like LRP from the drugstore. I was able to get a sample of this with my purchase and I am so glad I did. I fully understand the hype now. My skin is super dry and I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that hydrates, replenishes and moisturizes my skin without breaking me out. This one just feels so nice starting from the texture, how it feels when it’s applied, when it’s dried down, everything. It smells amazing but the fragrance in it or the product itself hasn’t broke me out which is amazing. I’m not sure how to describe the consistency either but it feels very cloud like, soft, and lightweight but deeply hydrating. I’m def considering buying the full-size now, the only reason why I took 1 star off is because of the price point but it’s Glow Recipe and all their products are around this price range. If you’re willing to splurge on a good moisturizer this one is an amazing option. Also a huge bonus, it looks and feels amazing under makeup which is a plus point for me because I usually buy one for wearing underwear makeup and one for when i don’t wear makeup. So the fact that this feels beautiful under makeup is awesome. Some people say it pills if you use too much but I use a good amount and I haven’t that had that issue. Love it!
