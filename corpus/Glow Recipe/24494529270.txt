Glow Recipe sent me a sample of this product before its release, and as someone who regularly suffers from eyelid inflammation it was HARD to keep from shouting its praises before the official release. Niacinamide and vitamin C are my skin’s happy molecules, so I’m thrilled Glow Recipe made a product specifically meant for around the eye area. If your eyelids are moody like mine, I can’t recommend this product enough! Eyelid inflammation savior
