The packaging is so beautiful as always from glow recipe.The formula looks promising and I a intrigued by succinic acid and azelaic acids in the formula.AHA is also milder making it ok for sensitive skin.My thoughts are it feels a bit tingling upon usage and also not super hydrating as it claims.I need to wait and see what results bring to the table. nan
