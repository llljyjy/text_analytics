I have received this product for free to try out. I was first in love with the packing I love the pink packaging and the watermelon designs throughout the box. When you open it, the design of the sunscreen is all pink and has a very sleek look. I tried the formula and it smells as an average sunscreen but when applied it’s very lightweight! I love the overall application and look/feel of the bottle. When applying it’s very blend-able, and you are left with a very hydrated glow. I do love this product and I plan to use it everyday! nan
