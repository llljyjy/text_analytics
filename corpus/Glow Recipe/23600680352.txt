I love the fluidity of this product, itâ€™s a great consistency for a sleeping mask and a great addition to my exfoliation nights. At first I did get a bit of irritation whilst using this, but if you use a calming/light moisturiser underneath while your skin get used to the product, you can minimise the irritation. Now that my skin has got used to using this product, I love it! I wake up to smoother and more hydrated skin and it layers really well over serums and moisturiser! Definitely worth giving it a go! nan
