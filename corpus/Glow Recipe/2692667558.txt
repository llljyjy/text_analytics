Honestly it’s not as bad as everyone makes it seem to be. Personally, I like this product Bc of the high SPF. I don’t think the Niacinamide in it has done much for me. This will pill if you put it on immediately after your moisturizer. As long as you leave a gap between the application of the two you should be fine. Also, this does leave a white cast for a bit after the initial application but it does end up going away. I also enjoy the glow it gives me. I would say the big downside to this is if you rub your eyes hours after application and you somehow get some sunscreen in your eyes while doing so, it will burn. I’m in between a 3 and a 4 but Bc of the burn and not seeing a difference in skin unevenness with the niacinamide, it’s a 3. However, I will most likely repurchase again purely Bc it’s an SPF 50 and you don’t see that often. 3 almost 4 stars
