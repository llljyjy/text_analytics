I think I’ve found my holy grail SPF for my face! I am extremely fair skinned. If I’m in the Sun for 5 minutes I literally turn pink. I wore this on my face the past two days at the pool for 5 hours each day and my face didn’t burn….at all.  I don’t think I would wear this under makeup just because of the consistency, but for outside days with no makeup this will for sure be on my face. holy grail spf
