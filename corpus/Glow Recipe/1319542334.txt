Generally not a fan of GR as I find most of the products ineffective at best. However this product is the exception. This is great at removing makeup especially eye makeup, and those stubborn stay all day lip colours. Most importantly no tugging or pulling at delicate skin around the eye is required! Cons: heavily scented (as expected with GR products). And expensive. Keep in mind a little goes a long way. General gripe with a tub format is itâ€™s finicky. A GR product worth the money
