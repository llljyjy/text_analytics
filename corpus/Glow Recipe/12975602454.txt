I have been using this cleanser for about 2 months now and I found that this combined with the tatcha rice wash has been doing amazing things for my skin. I have never felt smoother and I always feel clean but not dried out when I use this! Definitely recommend! I wouldn’t give it 5 starts though for a few reasons; 1. The price. It’s very expensive for a cleanser. 2. Effectiveness. Because I use this with another cleanser i can’t say that it is 100% effective by itself. I have used it on its own and it was ok but I did not get the same results as I do when I use it with the tatcha. Because it works so well with the tatcha I will be repurchasing and I do recommend it as one of your double cleansing steps! nan
