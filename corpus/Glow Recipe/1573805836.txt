I bought this product on launch day and have been using it for a few days. One of the main reasons I wanted to try this was because I had a hard time finding a SPF for my face that didn’t irritate my eyes. So far this hasn’t done that for me (although I know that could change in the summer with more oily skin and sweat). I apply on my eyelids and under eye without getting too close to the lash line, even rubbed my eyes later in the day a couple times and no irritation. The texture is creamy and light but feels slightly thick on the skin and stays that way throughout the day. I didn’t notice any white cast. My skin is oily yet this didn’t make me look greasy but gave a nice soft glow. The slight thickness felt better after applying a primer. Also, I noticed if the cream is applied by patting there is hardly any pilling/flakes. No problems with my foundation and the smell is very light IMO. Initially when applying you can smell the watermelon but that fades into the spf smell. Overall I think this is nice facial sunscreen. I hope they come out with a bigger bottle because I think this can go fast. nan
