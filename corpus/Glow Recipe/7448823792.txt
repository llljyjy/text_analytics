Similar consistency to their Banana moisturizer which I love. Very hydrating and doesn’t irritate my skin. I have very sensitive dry skin and this makes it feel very plump and juicy!!! And love that you can buy the refill for a lower price. More brands should do that. 10/10 recommend. Not heavily scented either, just a very slight plum scent but that’s all. LOOOOVE
