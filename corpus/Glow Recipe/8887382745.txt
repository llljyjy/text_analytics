I got this in one of the Glow kits and was super excited to try it. But after a month of consistent use, I’ve noticed nothing but MORE fine lines and dry appearance around my eyes. I’ve also now got little milia that weren’t there before. I rarely stop using a product before it’s empty because I’m cheap, but I did move it to the cabinet and won’t be using it for some time to see if my eyes improve back to normal. nan
