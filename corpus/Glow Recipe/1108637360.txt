Hey Beauties!A powerful yet soothing AHA and BHA acid serum that gently smooths, addresses the appearance of breakouts, and visibly refines pores for clear, hydrated skin. This powerful clarifying serum gently smooths rough texture and visibly clears pores and breakouts while calming and hydrating skin. It is formulated with a 10% Clarity Acid Complex including 2% Salicylic Acid and one percent Mandelic Acid blend to visibly clarify, decongest, soothe, and help prevent blemishes. Key Ingredients:Clarity Acid Complex 10%~ Visibly diminishes blemish-causing pore buildup, gently exfoliates dead skin cells, and smooths the look of bumps and fine lines. Strawberry~ Helps reduce excess oil, exfoliate, and even the look of skin tone. Hyaluronic Acid~ Hydrates skin by holding up to 1000 times its weight in moisture, keeping skin visibly plump. I’ve just started using this gem and I’m already in love. Since, I have sensitive skin I haven’t used it every day yet. If you have normal skin you can use it up to twice daily. Personally, I prefer using this before I go to sleep followed by my moisturizer. This has been soothing and hydrating, thanks to the Hyaluronic Acid. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy or tacky feel behind. This product is Vegan, Cruelty-Free, and comes in recyclable packaging.
