Love this but hate the packaging. Understand waste and better to go with refills but mine just sat in top on the container and felt like it was going to tip off. Hard to explain. Simply put, hate the packaging. Took off one star for that. The cream is nice, easily absorbs, soft, plump skin. Layers well with other serums, makeup. No complaints on the cream itself. Nice cream, dislike packaging.
