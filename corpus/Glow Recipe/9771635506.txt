It’s okay, but I feel this is a hype product. I have used other less expensive products with better results. The product is quite thin (like a water gel cream) and doesn’t feel like it sinks into my skin, more like it rests as a wierd top film. I honestly feel I get be better results using a hyaluronic acid serum combined with Summer Fridays Jet Lag Masque, or even CeraV PM Repair cream. It’s okay, but not fantastic. The smell in quite nice and not overly chemically. I might use this as a lightweight moisturizer durring the spring or summer months?Packaging is cute, product formula is nice, smell isn’t terrible. Formula didn’t do what I wanted for my skin. Glow Recipe is giving me Starbucks kind of vibes. Cute packaging, hype products and ingredients. I'm looking for more.
