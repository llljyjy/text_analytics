I feel pretty conflicted for how to give this review because I really think it depends on what kind of skin type you have. With all the hype there is for Glow Recipe, I really wanted to give this a try. After using this for a bit, I noticed some red bumps that appeared on my cheeks. Once I stopped using it, the red bumps disappeared. I figured it must be the fragrance in this that caused that reaction. I imagine this could work better for people who arenâ€™t as sensitive. If you react badly to any products that have fragrance, I would stay away from this, and the whole brand in general. I gave it 3 stars as sort of a neutral opinion, think it could be unfair for giving it 2 stars if its unsuited for my skin type. Sensitive Skin People Stay Away
