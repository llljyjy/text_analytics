Great gel cream for hydration without it leaving your skin greasy. I was able to tryout this product from my Trendmood box. It has a slight fruity smell that fades after a few minutes. I have combo/dry skin. The cream smoothes out some wrinkles I have on my forehead and provides hydration to my dry cheeks. This is temporary, but it lasts throughout the day. I also enjoy the fact that Glow Recipe is moving towards more sustainable packaging by making this refillable! Fine wrinkles go away
