I love this brand!!! I tried the toner just because I had a gift card and I noticed the woman in front of me and the woman behind me were purchasing GLO RECIPE stuff. I’ve tried other watermelon moisturizers before so I assumed I would like it- well I love it!!! Super light weight but also extremely hydrating. It makes me feel beautifully radiant. My only regret is that I purchased the smallest size “just to be safe” but had I known- BIGGEST SIZE THEY CARRY. YOU WILL LOVE
