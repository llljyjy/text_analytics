I love everything Glow Recipe and this overnight treatment is no exception! My skin feels so soft and smooth and looks so bright when I wake up in the morning. The texture is fairly thin, which feels nice on my skin. It plumps up and hydrates as it works its magic overnight. I sometimes have sensitivities to stronger products, and was delighted to find that my skin experienced no irritation as the formula is just the right strength. I would say that itâ€™s lighter in scent than some other Glow Recipe watermelon products, which may be a plus or minus depending on how you feel about their other products! nan
