This Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel cream has a nice gentle consistency. Love the pink bottle with pump that makes it easy to use. I have super dry skin. It hydrates the skin around the eye area for sometime, but for my skin it wasn’t enough hydration time. I think it’s for people with normal to oily skin. Didn’t notice the brightening effect either. Then I used it only a week. Will update my review after more time nan
