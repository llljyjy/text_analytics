This night mask by Glow Recipe is magical! After Applying it for the first time woke up to a beautiful soft skin. My face felt super hydrated and soft as if I had no pores !! The texture is gorgeous! Gel like lightweight and applies beautifully. Unlike other overnight masks I’ve tried before this one doesn’t feel heavy on my skin or cloggs my pores but dissolves into my skin giving me a beautiful glow. I plan on using it as much as I can! I am obsessed!
