I love this stuff! One of my fav YouTubers recommended it and I have no regrets. I apply this after washing my face and it leaves the most gorgeous glow but it doesn’t make you look oily. Even just after a few uses my skin looks much more alive. It definitely has a scent so I wouldn’t recommend if you don’t like scented products. The packaging says to use two pumps but I’ve never needed more than one. nan
