I’ve been using this serum for the past two weeks and here are my thoughts. I really like that it feels lightweight and the texture doesn’t feel sticky. It’s perfect for layering into a multi step routine, which I love to do. I also really like the pleasant fruity smell and the cute bottle. What I’ve noticed so far is that this is surprisingly gentle for daily use and since I’ve been using it consistently, I’ve noticed my skin overall looks more brighter and smoother.
