I have pretty acne prone skin but given all the hype over the brand I thought I would try their kit. This is the first and only product I added to my routine so I would know if it worked or didn’t work for me. After one night and one morning of using it in my routine my skin which I JUST got to a good place broke out in whiteheads everywhere. I’m not ultra sensitive to fragrance so there must be something else in this that is comedogenic or something. If you have acne-prone skin just avoid it. This was my first and only GR product I will be trying. Breakouts
