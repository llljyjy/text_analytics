Made me have a terrible acne breakout.  And for an expensive, monetary price, too.  I regretfully overlooked how this product ambiguously hides some of its ingredients behind the listing of “natural fragrance,“ an inconspicuous tell that the product is hiding unfavorable ingredients from its buyers.    It really is just a cheap product that was able to hype up its price because of Glow Recipe’s reputation and trendy advertising. nan
