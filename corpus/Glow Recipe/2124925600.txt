I was super excited to try this moisturizer out as I’ve seen so many great things about the company. My skin gets pretty dry in the winter months so I treated myself to this cream for Christmas. I used it for about 3 weeks and my skin broke outterribly. I really wanted to love it so trialed it longer than I probably should have as my face got completely spotted (I quit using it about 3 days ago and it has started to clear so I know it was the culprit). Other than that, it does give a glow but I found that I either didn’t use enough product or if I used too much, it would sit on the skin. Love the packaging though! nan
