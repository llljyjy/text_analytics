The moisturizer isn’t too heavy for my sensitive skin. It’s perfect for this  winter weather. I always love the scents and packaging from Glow Recipe. I love that it has a pod inside so going forward you can buy refills. This moisturizer is so good. It feels very hydrating and moisturizing and leaves my skin glowing. Glowing skin
