I absolutely love the Avocado Recovery serum and was so excited to try this. I have always suffered from sensitive skin and my cheeks and forehead have redness. In the winter, this is even more prominent because of the cold weather, drying out my skin. The cleanser felt like a lotion when applied and the lather really felt like it was cleaning my face, without stripping away my barrier. My skin felt hydrated and smooth. It has definitely helped with redness as well. I will continue to double cleanse with the papaya balm because it makes me feel like Iâ€™ve wiped away the day. This wonâ€™t replace my blueberry cleanser but I will rotate them as needed. This will be my winter staple ðŸ’š Perfect fit for hydration and redness
