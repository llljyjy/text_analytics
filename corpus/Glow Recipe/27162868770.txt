I really wanted to absolutely love this product but I do have to give it three stars. Things I do love it does have a beautiful glow and the scent is really nice it does apply and leaves no white cast however you cannot wear this with make up on top and it does peel when you have loads of other products on so this is something that I will keep in my bag for when I have like no make up on and I just need SPF alone nan
