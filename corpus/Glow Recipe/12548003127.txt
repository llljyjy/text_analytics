I have solidified my skincare routine except for finding a good spf to top it off. So far I am enjoying this product for my spf. It leaves a glowy look on my face while also leaving my skin feeling moisturized. The cute pink packaging is also a plus. So happy to be protected from the sun with this sunscreen! Doesnâ€™t leave a white cast!
