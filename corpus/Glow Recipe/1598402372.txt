I am giving this 4 stars out of 5 strictly on scent, which was blah for me. Now, this product is terrific. Very creamy and smooth. Mix with water and does well on makeup removal, but I double cleanse. Fantastic for an AM cleanser as well. It leaves your skin with a very clean feel, yet beautifully moisturized. Not greasy at all. My barrier is protected and it is just lovely. I will add this to my regimen. Highly recommended. New Product That Doesn’t Disappoint. Love ❤️
