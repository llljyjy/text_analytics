I absolutely love this concealer. I have used it everyday since I have received the product. It is creamy, allows for easy application, and most importantly it is not cakey. Personally, it is a little more matte than I would prefer, but with a little more moisturizer applied before application, it is perfect. It also is great for sensitive skin! GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
