I hate this sunscreen so much it makes me actually angry whenever I use it. I don’t know how this got past testing phase without anyone pulling the plug. The way to make it work without pilling and flaking is to do one small section at a time, rub in only until it’s spread around and then never ever touch it again. You can make it work but there’s such better options. I hate this so much
