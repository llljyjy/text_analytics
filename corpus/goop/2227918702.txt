Greatly overhyped. Has a very strong smell - like an unpleasant, industrial smelling tanning lotion. It does provide a bit of a bronze/ glow tint to the skin upon application but it actually dries my skin out as opposed to hyrdating or moisturizing it. It also sinks into and emphasizes fine lines. Back to the drawing board, Gwyneth! Overhyped / Smells Like a Bad Tanning Lotion
