I love what goop has done for my skin my pores are almost nonexistent and my face feels so much smoother. I have noticed some acne scars have faded a lot and I overall look smoother and refreshed. One pump and that’s all you need there is no smell and so easy to use. The serum does have a tingling effect but I read that is normal so no concerns there for me. I do wish the price was better though that’s the only reason it’s 4stars for me. Absolutely a must have for brighter smoother face
