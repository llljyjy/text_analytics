So I’ve been using this for a little over a month. So about me I have combination skin that is dramatic and by dramatic i mean sensitive and I worked my way up to using this 3 times a week. So as a skin care junkie I must say this is something you would purchase. It did take a while for me to work up to the 3x a week to use because of the strength or the other things in my skin regimen I’m not sure but at thing of 30 days my skin glows noticeably more, it’s tighter, and I have blemishes fading it’s a good day ☺️ I’ll add it to my routine
