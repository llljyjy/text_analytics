I received this cleanser in a Influenster vox box. I have never used any Goop products before so it was exciting to open. I was surprised to receive a cleanser with beady things in it and I have sensitive skin but I don’t feel that it is too abrasive for me personally. With that being said I also haven’t used it every day, more like 4 to 5 times a week. I like it so far and have had no breakouts or reactions! nan
