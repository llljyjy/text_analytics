I recieved this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using these for the past couple weeks & I do enjoy it. I have dry skin so I’ve only been using it about 3 times a week but it has left my skin very soft & smooth, not overly dry. I will continue to use this! Great exfoliating cleanser!
