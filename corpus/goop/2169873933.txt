This is a refreshingly different cleanser! It presents as a jelly, but you quickly find it is full of exfoliants. I love the scent, very fruit forward and fresh. It did a good job cleaning and exfoliating my skin. Great size and application. My only concern is if it has too much exfoliant to use daily for my sensitive skin. Juicy, exfoliating and fresh!
