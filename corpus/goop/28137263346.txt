I believe this is a bit on the pricey side and I don’t typically like the scent so that is my reasoning of removing a star… going into the review: I feel like my skin benefitted from using this serum at night. I used it about 3 times a week and my skin feels softer. I am not certain I see results as for as correcting skin spots. I possibly need to use it longer to see those results maybe. I have only had it a few weeks but feel a difference in my face texture, Forsure. Night time routine
