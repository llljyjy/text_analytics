I was given this product to review and I’ve used it pretty consistently for about a week to really get a good read on it. Like a lot of other reviews have said, this cleanser feels nice and doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped or rubbed raw like some more aggressive exfoliating cleansers out there. The citrus scent is light and pleasant and it left my skin feeling clean and hydrated. No complaints, but no wow factor either. I liked this product, but didn’t love it. I probably would have liked it more if it was sold as part of a skincare set, with a toner and moisturizer bundle. On its own it’s simply adequate and doesn’t really command any particular interest. Liked, Not Loved
