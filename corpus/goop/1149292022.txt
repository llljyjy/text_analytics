I like this product! I use it more for overall exfoliation vs. dark spots (I had IPL done a year or so ago, which drastically reduced/eliminated dark spots on my face) and I like it! I do use tretinoin so for this product, I’ve learned that I can only use it about once a week to avoid irritation. At first, I was alternating this every other night with my tret, and my skin was getting dry and flaky. Once I went back to my usual tret routine, and only used this once per week in its place, I’ve been fine and I do think this is assisting in the clarity and smoothness of my skin! I like the texture of this product - a little goes a long way since it’s on the runny side, and it soaks into the skin nicely and quickly. I can’t feel it on my face which I love.I’d give it 5 stars but it’s pricey, and I think a good routine that involves tret would be sufficient, at least for what my skin goals are. Great product!
