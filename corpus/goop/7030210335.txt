This cleanser is quite nice and does what it says with a few caveats. The foamless formula cleans away impurities and daily grime well, while boasting a subtle citrus scent. However, the exfoliation is mild at best. A person with substantial texture issues on their skin would definitely need something that packs more of a punch for smoothing. After continuous use I notice clear and vibrant skin. I did fin the cleanser to be quite drying after each use. My skin felt stripped of moisture and in need of hydration. All in all, this cleanser is a good buy for those who want a blank canvas after washing their faces. Though I wouldnâ€™t use it as my main cleanser, it is a welcome addition to my skincare team.
