I received this product complimentary from Goopglow and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using the serum for two weeks and I will say my skin feels very soft the next morning. The product has not caused any break outs. It does smell a bit glue like to me but is pleasant feeling on the skin. I feel it is too soon to notice any difference to pore appearance but will keep using. I am unable to say at this time if I’d repurchase simply because I feel skincare products should be used longer than two weeks to judge results. At this time I can only recommend for softer skin as that is the only benefit I’ve noticed thus far. Serum for softer feeling skin
