Ive been using this exfoliating serum for the past few weeks and I’m so happy with the results I’ve been seeing. This has truly help to fade my dark spots due to acne, my face has been looking healthier, more plump and with more luminous than before I started using this serum type of product. I rather use it at night since it has exfoliating properties. I’ve been getting a few compliments on my skin so that’s how I know it’s working. Love this magic in a bottle. Would highly recommend it Must have item
