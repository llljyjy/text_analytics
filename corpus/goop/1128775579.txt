Overall it is a pretty decent exfoliating cleanser. It doesn’t foam, which is fine, but sometimes I felt like the micro beads didn’t get spread around enough. I was worried that the beads would be too harsh for every day use but I didn’t have a problem. I’m not sure what a cloudberry smells like but I’d say the cleanser sort of reminded me of jelly beans. The jelly/gel consistency slightly clogged the dispenser hole if I didn’t use it every day. nan
