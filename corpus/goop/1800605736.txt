I received this from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. So here it goes.I’ve been using this for a month and haven’t noticed any change with my dark spots, however if you have sensitive skin this might be one of the better chemical exfoliate I’ve tried. Twice a week would be enough, doesn’t have a weird smell or feel greasy. Honestly if it wasn’t $98 I would be more open to making it part of my normal routine but I just can’t justify the price where there are similar products out there for half the price. Best for sensitive skin but not worth the $98
