I have tried many products and procedures to help remove pigmentation due to scaring from breakouts. I unfortunately pick at my skin and create damage but thatâ€™s another story . After a lot of money spent results were minimal but after 3 weeks of using this I see a visible fading of the spots. So from someone who has spent thousands on skin procedures and skincare this is worth the splurge but it takes time and consistency. Skin Rejuvenation
