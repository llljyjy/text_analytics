I received this product free for review from Influenster and Goopglow. This review is incentivized. I have normal skin and occasionally oily in my T-Zone. I have dark spots and uneven skin tone. This product worked well for me. I have been using it for a week and three days. This has helped my skin tone be more even and the dark spots are almost gone. My skin also seems brighter than normal which I like. I don’t know how it will work on everyone’s skin, but for me personally it worked amazing. I enjoy this product. The price is a little steep for me to keep using but if I had the funds I definitely would purchase on my own. Goopglow
