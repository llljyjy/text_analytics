I have been using the goopglow cloudberry exfoliating cleanser a few times a week for the last. I recieved this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I feel like this is a decent product. I typically go fir chemical exfoliates rather than physical exfoliation products with granules or beads however, this product does have a thicker gel like medium the granules are suspended so it’s pretty wet and as such it does not over exfoliate or aggrevate my sensitive skin too much so I like that. This product also has made some improvement in my hormonal acne and I didn’t experience any acne breakouts when I first began using it. I think this product would work especially well for women who are sensitive to exfoliation products. It says daily use but, I would not personally recommend using this everyday rather 3-4 days a week would be ideal. nan
