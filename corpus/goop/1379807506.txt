I received this complimentary product, the Goop Jelly Cleanser courtesy of Influenster in return for my honest review.  My initial impression that it looks like an innisfree product, but it costs double the price. The product has a citrus scent which I don’t mind, but it may be a little overpowering for others. The product itself does look like a jelly consistency but a little more liquidy. I used it for a week and I honestly didn’t see any difference. It’s not horrible, but it’s not something I was amazed over. It’s free so I’ll keep using it, but I wouldn’t spend my own money on it knowing that there are other products for way cheaper. Not impressed
