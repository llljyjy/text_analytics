I love Goop Glow. I’ve been using this product for about a week now. I haven’t really noticed results yet but I’m sure it will lightened up as I continue to use it. I like that it’s moisturizing and easy to spread. There isn’t a scent to it. I do feel that it is a bit sticky but doesn’t make your face feel oily. Overall I like it. I have hyperpigmentation so I’m hoping to get good results from this. Darks Spot
