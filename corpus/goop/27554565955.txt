I really love this exfoliator! It has a sugar scrub texture and is definitely gentle enough to use daily. The citrus orange scent is not overpowering and is bright and uplifting. After cleansing with this product, my face did not feel overly dry or red like with other exfoliating products. Sensitive skin users should definitely give this a try. The bottle size is pretty good for the price tag. Iâ€™d definitely buy this again after my bottle is gone.I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.
