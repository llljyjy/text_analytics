I received this product from Influenster to test. I am not a huge fan of exfoliating scrubs but this one was pretty mild. my skin did feel soft after using and the smell is nice and not overwhelming. I would recommend this if you like scrubs and want something that isnâ€™t too harsh on your skin. nan
