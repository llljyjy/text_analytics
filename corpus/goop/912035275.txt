I am insanely picky when it comes to a daytime moisturizer. However, I am absolutely in love with this GoopGlow Lotion!!! It leaves my oily skin with a velvety glow, never shiny or greasy. My skin looks and feels perfectly healthy and soft thanks to this lotion, even when I apply it over my vitamin C serum (which on its own makes my skin feel tacky and appear shiny). This is my first product by Goop and I am so impressed I cannot wait to try more from the line! Healthy, velvety glow!! Absolutely love!
