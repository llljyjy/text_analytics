I really enjoy how Goop Glow by goop beauty leaves my skin feeling! This Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser is made with lots of beneficial ingredients like fruit extract, and bitter orange peel which has lots of properties good for your skin. It’s rather easy to use just apply to wet face morning or night and gently massage using a circular motion with your fingertips or a soft cloth. As with any product be careful around your eyes and test a small area before trying it all over your face and neck. After massaging the jelly cleanser in rinse with warm water and pat dry with your towel. You’ll notice results instantly or I did. It left my skin soft and radiant, very hydrated and after using several times my pores seem smaller and my fine lines aren’t as noticeable. Ohhh and that glow! Yes, it leaves your skin with a nice glow to it. The only drawback for me is the scent of the product. It smells like a cleaner you use around your house... I push the smell aside so I can achieve the results the product gives but it is pretty strong while you wash your face. Overall I’m very pleased with it just wish the scent was different. Amazing Jelly Cleanser!
