I have normal to dry skin. This cleanser wasn’t harsh and left my skin feeling clean but not stripping. I do wish it foamed or lathered up, which it does not. The microbeads are gentle and do not feel abrasive. The scent is a mild citrusy scent. All in all, it’s a good cleanser, but not revolutionary. Good cleanser
