I’m not at all impressed with this. I was totally skeptical going in, because frankly I think the founder of goop is a self important nut job with no sense of reality, who panders over priced garbage. However, after my first use I said to myself, ok you were wrong. I have super dry skin, and it left my face feeling the way your hands do after a sugar/oil scrub. So silky soft and smooth. It felt that way until I stepped out of the shower and my face dried. Then my skin just felt tight. I’ve been using it daily, and no, my skin is not glowing. nan
