This is the first time I try any products from this brand and I’m so far impressed . This cleaner is foamless and its a exfoliating cleaner . It has a gritty texture to help exfoliate your skin . It has a strong citrus smell , at first it was a little intense but now after using it more I have grown use to it . I have oily skin and I find this doesn’t break me out or make my skin more oily . My skin feels so soft after I wash my face . This product is exfoliating but its also really gentle so that you can use it as a “ everyday “ cleaner . I don’t use it everyday but when I do use it , I love how my skin feels . My skin looks more glowy and smooth after I wash it and the next day my skin just looks really good . So far I’m really enjoying it and will continue to use it . First time trying out this brand
