I had such high hopes for this product. I am 33 with no spots but slightly uneven tone and large pores. My biggest problem was the smell. I gave it a week to try to get over it but it was unbearable. If scents don’t bother you I’d assume this product works based on the other reviews but I really wish it was unscented Not a fan, unfortunately
