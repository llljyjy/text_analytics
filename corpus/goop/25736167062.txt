I received this courtesy of influenster to try for an honest review. I absolutely love it. My Pores have definitely shrank since using it for the past week. My skin is smoother and feels tighter. My only dislike is that it smells like Elmer’s glue. I will definitely purchase this when I run out. I use its every night. I haven’t had any tingling or anything like that happen while using. A must have!
