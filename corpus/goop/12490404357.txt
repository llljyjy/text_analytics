Not impressed. I wanted to really like this, but it missed the mark for me. My skin didn’t feel that deep down cleansed feeling and I wasn’t a big fan of the smell! I have combination skin, and it just didn’t do it for me, I had to follow it up with my regular face wash. Sorry goop. Too much goop not enough wash
