As many of others have written, I did not want to love this but the product has greatly improved my skinâ€™s hydration, texture and dark spots. My fine lines look better. I added in a small drop of essential oils to customize the scent. The only drawbacks are the very high price and the packaging (the bottle) (once the 2 products are mixed). The lid does not close tightly enough when travelling and some of the liquid gold will leak out. The bottle is also very easy to knock over. Love the product, hate the price and bottle.
