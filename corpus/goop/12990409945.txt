I have been looking to add an exfoliator to my skin care routine and this one is a great addition. I use it 3-4 times a week in the shower and follow it with a smooth facial cleanser. I’ve noticed a huge improvement in how my regular cleanser lathers after using this Goopglow cleanser. My skin feels much softer and does not get dried out from it. Another huge bonus is that the scent is very mild, refreshing, and “natural“ smelling and doesn’t seem to bother my regular migraines like many other scented products do. I also really like the squeeze tub, flip lid container which makes using it very convenient. The only cons I have at the moment is that the price is a little high for me to want to buy regularly and I haven’t noticed much improvement in evening my skin tone and still have some redness in my cheeks. Feels so clean!
