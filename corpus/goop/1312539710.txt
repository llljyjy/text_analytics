My skin requires regular exfoliation or i’ll end up with clogged pores and dull complexion. My beauty regimen regularly includes retinol and vitamin C serum. I’m sure you all know any kind of acid will make your skin shed faster and i’m often very flaky. I always have a flakey patch here and there. Even if I start the day with none visible, i always find one creeping up on me midday. When I received a complimentary sample in my Vox Box I was worried to use it because I had just come back from vacation in the Caribbean and being under the sun made me even more sensitive though I lather on sunscreen religiously. After reading the ingredients which is very clean and directions for use, i cautiously tried it. I wasn’t so fond of its scent but i really liked the texture of the squalene jelly. It’s so easy to over exfoliate but not with this scrub. When you massage this onto your face, the jelly beads dissolve. After you rinse, you’re left with a natural glow and no dryness or tightness on your skin. I can use it daily and have no adverse effects. I’m ditching my other cleansers and sticking with Goop cloudberry exfoliating jelly cleanser. Natural Glow anyone?
