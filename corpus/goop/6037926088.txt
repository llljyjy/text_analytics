This oil isn’t anything special. I’m in my 50’s so I’ve been using different oils and thought this was gonna be better because of the price tag. Very wrong. It moisturizes, and that’s about it. Hasn’t done anything with my fine lines or anything else it claims. The smell is very earthy which isn’t that bad as some other reviewers claim. Not anything like rotten curry. Lol Sadly I actually paid for this. Didn’t get a sample, or was given to for a review. Not worth it!
