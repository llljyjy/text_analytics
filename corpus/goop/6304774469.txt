I was a little skeptical trying this because most exfoliating products dry out my combination skin but this one took me by surprise.  It was gentle and refreshing.  Left my skin smooth and soft. It was drying what so ever. The products texture is like the name goopy but not too thick. It was easy to use and the scent was pleasant.  Has a citrus scent and not over baring.  Over I was please with this product. Refreshing.
