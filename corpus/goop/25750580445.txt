The Cloudberry Exfoliating Cleanser has a subtle citrus scent that is enough to feel refreshing without overpowering the senses. A small amount is needed so a tube will last a while. After using for several weeks (but not every day!) I noticed that my skin does feel very clean after washing, but the exfoliant seems to remove extra moisture and leaves my skin very dry. A good moisturizer is a must after using this. Definitely not recommended for every day use. nan
