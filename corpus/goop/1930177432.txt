The Goop Cloudberry exfoliating scrub does exactly what it says it does...it exfoliates! My skin is always nice and smooth after using it, and the smell is not overpowering. It does feel gentler than other face scrubs, but not gentle enough that you should use it daily, as the product suggests. I also noticed some dry patches and redness around my nose, but no tightening and no burning sensations. Overall I think itâ€™s a good product, but some of its claims are questionable. Overall Good, but Not for Daily Use
