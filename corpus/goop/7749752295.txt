I received this product for free from Influenster and Goop in exchange for my honest review. I have enjoyed washing my face with this scrub. I like the jelly consistency, and the exfoliating granules feel good. I like how my skin felt moisturized after cleansing. The smell is pretty strong citrus,  and I’m sure some people won’t like that. It is okay to me, but I wish it was a little more subtle. Overall I like it, but it is not my most favorite. I don’t use a scrub every day because I feel like it would be too harsh. My skin needs a break in between scrubs. nan
