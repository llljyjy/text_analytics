I received this item complimentary from influencer in exchange for my review. This cleanser has a very light, fresh, citrus like scent to me which I found very refreshing. It has grit to it to help slough off dead skin and it leaves sin feeling Soo smooth and soft and fresh feeling! My skin was visibly smoother and healthier looking from the first use! I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry, dull skin! So smooth!
