This is the first time I ever tried a goop product and I really like this exfoliating jelly! It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. I appreciate the exfoliating beads - they aren’t too harsh on my skin and doesn’t feel like it’s scratching like some other exfoliating cleansers do. I recommend this product and will be trying other goop products. nan
