This is a mixed review for me, it is easy to work with and you donâ€™t need a lot to smooth over face, it does make you glow and does not feel greasy which I loved. But THE SMELL is horrible, it has a slight chemical smell mixed with an old hotel room that has been chain smoked in for 30 years ( lol not to be dramatic ) but I was super disappointed in the smell because I love the actual product but the smell is awful, so if you can look past a HORRIBLE smell for a good moisturizer this is for you lol Good moisturizer TERRIBLE SMELL
