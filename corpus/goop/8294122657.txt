Let me start of by saying I would give this product a 3.5. In recent years, I have completely stepped away from physical exfoliants and moved to chemical as my skin is very dry and sensitive. To my surprise, although this cleanser seems super harsh to the touch,this cleanser feels nice and doesnâ€™t leave my skinfeeling stripped or rubbed raw like some moreaggressive exfoliating cleansers out there. The citrusscent is light and pleasant and it left my skin feelingclean and hydrated, which is very surprising when using physical exfoliants on my dry sensitive skin. I will say that you should use an oil cleanser beforehand if you have any sort of makeup on because this will not fully cleanse. That being said because it does feel harsh to the touch I would definitely not suggest using this on a daily basis. I still have enjoyed my experience with it and will continue to use it 2x weekly until I have finished. I will not be repurchasing, again since I prefer chemical exfoliant formulations. However, if you prefer physical exfoliants then this may surely be for you! Good for a physical exfoliant
