My skin is typically more on the dry side with oily t-zone, I will however say that I do have some dark spots from picking acne. I found this product really useful for putting over these spots and have noticed a difference over time. I understand the price with the ingredient’s list, but at the same time the only thing I’d prefer would it to be slightly more affordable. Other than that, no complaints so far Great product, over little time, visible change!!!
