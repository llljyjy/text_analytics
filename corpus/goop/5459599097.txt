For reference I have oily/combo skin. I found this cleanser to not lather much, so it was nice to use in the mornings when I needed a gentle clean, but I do not prefer it when my skin needs a better cleaning or if I have makeup on. I like cleansers that lather to feel a better cleaning sensation. As I mentioned, itâ€™s a nice and gentle for morning use or if you have sensitive skin. The scent is also pleasant and mild. Gentle scrub
