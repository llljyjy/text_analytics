I received this product complementary for my review. I love this brand’s glow serum so when I heard they were releasing a jelly cleaners - I was excited to try it. This product smells fruity and clean. A little bit goes a long way. After gently scrubbing for about a minute, it rinses clean and my skin felt smooth. This product can be used everyday but I’ve been using it every other. After a week of use, I noticed more brightness so I’m excited to continue to see what more it can do for my skin. I love that this product is not tested on animals. Clean!
