I received this product to review for free. Overall, it exfoliated pretty well. I did get a pimple after using it, but I’m not sure if I can solely blame the face jelly! It didn’t have a strong smell, but definitely has a citrus fragrance. Overall, I enjoyed it and will continue using it to try to help a couple dry patches on my face. nan
