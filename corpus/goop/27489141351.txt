Itâ€™s still cold where I live and I think it was a little harsh for my already dry skin BUT I will be incorporating in my skincare routine this summer. I could tell a difference in the morning after using this at night - I had a noticeable glow!! I personally like the grainy texture and it left my skin feeling soft. 4/5 stars because I like it but definitely not a year-round exfoliant. Glow
