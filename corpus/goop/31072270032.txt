I absolutely loved this cleanser! I have oily / acne prone skin and I felt this product provided an excellent deep clean with the exfoliating properties. The jelly was thick and a little bit does go a long way. The product has a citrus scent but it’s not overpowering. I love that this cleanser washed away the oil and left my face feeling like a soft canvas. My moisturizer actually penetrated after using the cleanser which was an extra added bonus. My skin feels and looks radiant and I couldn’t be happier. Check out my instagram reel of me using the product @briethebeaut I received this product as a complimentary sample from Influenster.
