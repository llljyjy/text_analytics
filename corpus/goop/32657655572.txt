This exfoliating cleanser is soft and grainy. It does a good job of scrubbing my skin and leaves it fresh and clean. It did however leave my skin with a little redness after using. It did fade quickly and left me with fresh glowing skin.I also liked the container it came in because I do not have to completely remove the cap to use, it allows me to push down on it to dispense as much as little or as much as I want. Good Exfoliating Cleanser
