The light citrus scent of this cleanser is great for the morning to wake you up and isn’t overpowering. The little particles do a great job exfoliating, you don’t have to rub hard onto your face to know it’s working. It was easy to wash off and left my skin feeling recharged, fresh and soft. I would highly recommend this cleanser to anyone looking for a good exfoliant! nan
