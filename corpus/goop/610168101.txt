I have light Sun spots and hyperpigmentation and have been always curious about skin lightening products so I was excited to give this one a try. After using it for about 3 weeks nightly  I can’t say that I can tell any visible difference in lightening however  I do enjoy the consistency, it is a lightweight medium texture that glides on easily and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowy. I did not experience any irritation. The fragrance is slightly sour to me but dissipates quickly. I will definitely be using it up as I believe these things take more time in order to see any results, so  I’m not giving up on this product just yet. nan
