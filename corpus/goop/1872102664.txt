I received this product for free for a review. This cleanser felt way too harsh on my face, it felt like a body scrub. The reason I gave 3 stars is that it worked great as a scrub for my legs and prevented ingrown hairs. The smell isnt unpleasant and the packaging is decent I just wouldnt use it on my face. nan
