I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this product! I have fairly sensitive skin so I was a bit weary of using an exfoliating wash but it was actually gentle. It also smelt good which is always a plus! I use it twice a week even though it says you can use it every day just to be safe. It made my skin feel super clean and refreshed. It wasnâ€™t drying either which always a concern of mine, it felt hydrating without making my oily skin more oily. Overall it was a great product! Definitely recommend
