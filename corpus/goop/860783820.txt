I really like this cleanser. I have dry skin and it never left my face irritated after daily use. The cleanser is definitely gentle which I loved and gives you a light exfoliation. I just have a love/hate feeling about the little beads. They give the great exfoliation but they are also a little tough to get off. Overall, I would recommend! Great Daily Cleanser!
