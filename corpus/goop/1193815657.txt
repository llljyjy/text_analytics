I have mixed feeling about this product, it isn’t bad but it isn’t great neither. The texture is ok, but I do love the beads and the way it exfoliates. I love that way my skin feels after using it but I can’t say it did much to control my oily skin. Can’t describe the smell, I don’t think of citrus when I smell it it’s weird, some days I like it and other days I hate it go figure! Overall it’s a decent product I will continue using it till it’s finished but it won’t be a part of my future regimen. nan
