I received this cleanser complimentary from influenster. This cleanser is a nice basic exfoliating face wash and seems like good value for the price. I use it a few times a week in the shower - the citrus scent is nice in the morning. Gets the job done and leaves my skin smooth, it does not break me out. I wish the exfoliating beads were a little smaller / gentler - they are kind of on the bigger side. Nice morning exfoliater
