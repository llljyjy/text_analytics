I received this product complementary from Influenster. I loved the citrus smell and packaging. The jelly scrub made my skin feel soft and smooth afterwards. However, it did make my skin feel dry so I used a moisturizer afterwards. Itâ€™s a good cleanser and I would probably use it every other day. I would recommend. Smells nice
