It smooths my skin all right, and it even helped me clear out a whitehead that was on my face for a while. I like its lid design which I can open and close single-handed and allows me to easily leave no residue around the opening. I just personally donâ€™t like its scent which smells so similar to citrus-scented house cleaning products out there. nan
