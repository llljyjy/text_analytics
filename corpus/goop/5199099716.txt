I received this product from Influenster and Goop Beauty to test out and give my honest review. Even with inconsistent usage I saw results. I have African American skin (Bahamian). I have some hyperpigmentation on my right lower leg. It had an ok consistency, but I was not a fan of how it felt on my hands after I applied it. I definitely had to wash them after. It felt fine on my actual leg. Since one is putting it on before bed, it feels fine. Doesnâ€™t really have a scent. I would purchase this in the future. I want to be more consistent with my usage. There were nights I would forget to apply it. I liked my results. Works To Fade Blemishes
