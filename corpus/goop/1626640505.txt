For the past couple years Iâ€™ve been using a dry brush to clear dead skin cells, and leave my body feeling refreshed and revived. As a practitioner of Ayurveda, I was already familiar with the ancient practice of body brushing, but had yet to find a brush that truly exfoliated my skin. With the goop G.Tox Ultimate Dry Brush, I immediately felt the difference as it left my skin soft & supple, renewed & restored, without the irritation that a brush of poor quality may have on sensitive skin. What I love most about the goop dry brush is the natural bristles provide a firmer finish with increased pressure to encourage blood circulation, open pores, and support lymph flow to remove harmful toxins from the body. Much Love & Many Thanks - xoxo @Luxury_Lindsey Great Starter Body Brush
