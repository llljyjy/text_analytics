I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I like the packaging, easy to use. The scent definitely wakes up your senses: I would compare it to an orange sour Skittle. I typically use exfoliators that are a bit stronger on the skin so I didn’t get as much exfoliation from this as I was expecting but if you’re specifically looking for a gentle exfoliant this is a good contender. I can’t say my skin felt anymore moisturized/hydrated after using this product nor did it look brighter but perhaps effects take longer to appear and aren’t instant like Olehenriks’ Clean Truth. Finally, I’m not sure if it was this product or wearing a mask but my skin did seem to break out a bit after using it and I don’t usually get breakouts at all. So if you have sensitive skin that’s something to consider. Also, it’s very sticky so when you rinse off make sure you get everything. I was finding dried up bits of it in my eyebrows hours later. Overall, not bad but I can’t say I was wowed. Meh. It smells good.
