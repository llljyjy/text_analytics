Not my favorite cleanser from the start. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this cleanser has too many irritating ingredients. After every use I noticed my cheeks are very flushed and skin feels dry because of the exfoliation. I would not recommend this for anyone with dry and sensitive skin. The smell is ok but I would not be repurchasing this cleanser Not Sensitive Friendly
