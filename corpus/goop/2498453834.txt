I received this product a few weeks ago and I’ve been using it every other day. I noticed immediately after my face felt smoother. I had been in need of a good nontoxic exfoliated and this is gentle but extremely effective. So thankful I received this to try. I will most likely be purchasing after I go through with the bottle I was given, it’s that good. I noticed that my moisturizer was more easily soaked up by skin after using Goop. I have normal skin but deal with the occasional dryness, this product seems to really help with that and what I love most is that it’s gentle,but effective. Truly a great product in my opinion. Gentle, but effective !
