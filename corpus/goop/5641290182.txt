I was really excited to try Goop Beauty Goopglow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser because I love Gwyneth Paltrow, and her skin is amazing, so I figured it would work well! But, after using it, I wasn’t as great as I expected. The smell is not appealing at all. It smells kind of like a chemical cleaner that is lemon scented. It’s not pleasant at all. I really liked the texture and consistency in my hand. It has these tiny exfoliators that are encased in the Jelly, and it melts into a liquid quickly. It goes on smoothly and forms a nice lather on your face, but was too abrasive for me. It was a bit uncomfortable, actually. You’re supposed to use it once a day, however, I don’t think I would use it that way since you’re not supposed to exfoliate more than 2-3 times a week. It did leave my skin softer, but I have combination skin which tends to be on the oily side and it amped up the oil production on my face after an hour or so. I used it  every day for a week just to see if it would level off once my skin adjusted to it, but the results stayed the same. Overall, I had mixed feelings about this facial cleanser. There were good aspects, as well as bad and ultimately, I wouldn’t purchase it again since it didn’t work well for me. Mixed feelings...
