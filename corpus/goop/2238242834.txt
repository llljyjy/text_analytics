So overall I will say it made my face extremely smooth, I think this would be a great as a 2x a month scrub but I wouldn’t recc to do it more often. The smell was straight up cleaning product and the exfoliating beads/particles weren’t all uniform, some were a lot chunkier and coarser than others and it felt like I was sand papering my face tbh. Wouldn’t feel comfortable using this often feel like I could damaged my skin barrier. Way too coarse for me.
