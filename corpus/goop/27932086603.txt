I love this cleanser.  I have skin that is normal with dry patches.  I am usually worried about using an exfoliating cleanser because my dry patches are usually sensitive, but it was so gentle.  I am actually able to use this every evening.  The smell is very light, which I love.  It also smells good.  After about a week I saw my face was softer and did look like there was a glow.  I am going to keep using this and will definitely rebuy. GoopGlow  awesomeâ€¦enough said
