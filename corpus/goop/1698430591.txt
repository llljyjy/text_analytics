So, I love the grainy texture. I don’t have sensitive skin, but it is oily, so I really enjoyed this. It didn’t feel stripping, just like a thorough clean. The smell is strong, like a medicated orange, so I took one star off since it’s a bit much. Thanks to Influenster, I received this complimentary to review. Great, but strong smell!
