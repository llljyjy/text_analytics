I received this for free to try from Influenster. Initial thoughts- I personally like the citrus smell for the morning. It is a nice way to wake up and start the day, though I do see how it can be bothersome to those with sensitivities to scents. I typically opt for chemical exfoliants because physical exfoliants tend to be too harsh, so while I was hesitant to try this, it was surprisingly gentle and did not irritate my skin. It was not over drying and overall a decent cleanser. I gave it 4 stars because I still prefer to not have any beads in my cleansers. Good physical exfoliant
