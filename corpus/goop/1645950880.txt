I love a good gentle enzymatic exfoliant. And it doesn’t get more fun and natural than papaya and pineapple for this purpose. These are top notch ingredients and help skin look bright and balanced. With this being said, I don’t think the physical exfoliants were necessary give the excellent enzymes already present in the cleanser.I’m super happy about the cloudberry and think this is innovative being the next big ingredient. Squalene inclusion is also a major plus for hydration.  Like other reviewers have stated, I also had a difficult time with chemically fragrance.  And even though the instructions said this was good for everyday use, I‘d probably suggest a few times a week for most people as a second cleanse. I love the packaging as it feels like it will keep the cleanser fresh for longer (shelf stable) - thus keeping the efficacy of the cleanser good for a solid period of time. YES to natural enzymes, no to physical exfoliants
