Been using for a little over a week. The product stains my hands and I noticed my pillowcase has smudges of discoloration on it. Not sure if this is normal and I do wash my hands after every application. Haven’t noticed any improvements on my skin yet. I wonder if there would be a different product that doesn’t stain?
