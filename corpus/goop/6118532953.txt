I received this complementary of Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this cleanser. I have dry skin and live in a very dry area so I have to be careful with how much I exfoliate. This cleanser is gentle enough to be used twice a day in comparison to many other exfoliating cleanser‘s or scrubs. I am not a citrus type of person so I am not a fan of the smell. But this cleanser works so well that I just tough it out. I always do a double cleanse with an oil cleanser and then a separate cleanser. I love how my skin feels polished and smooth afterwards without any redness or irritation. If you don’t mind a citrus smell then you will love this Love love love
