I tried this serum after receiving it as a free sample with Influenster. My nightly routine typically starts with a gentle bar soap facial cleanser, which I follow up with either a retinol or an exfoliating acid product, alternating evenings. I substituted this serum in for my Drunk Elephant Glycolic Night Serum every other night for a week.I have to say, that I didn’t notice any huge difference in my skin tone apart from my skin feeling more sensitive to my retinol creams the night after. The consistency of this formula is light, absorbs quickly, and there’s no terrible scent, which is all a plus. It also seemed to perform at least as well as my Drunk Elephant. But I didn’t see any dramatic reduction in skin tone unevenness or discoloration spots, and it did leave my skin more sensitive afterwards. So I can only give it 3 stars. An okay product, but not as gentle as hoped
