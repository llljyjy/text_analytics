I was really excited when I received this in the mail, it has good ingredients and seemed like something that would be beneficial to my skin. I have been using it for a a little over a week now and I really like this. It does claim to be a daily am/pm cleanser and with the gentle exfoliation I guess you could use it that way. Personally I will be using it just a few times a week in place of my normal face cleanser. This smells really good and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Really nice cleanser
