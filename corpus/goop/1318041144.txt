It’s understandable why GOOP employees use this amazing peel every Sunday; it actually changes the texture and glow-factor of the skin! These are in every overnight bag; they’re all I need in the summer, and in the winter I’ll douse my skin with an oil after the magic concoction dries. One pad is enough for the face, décolletage, and arms. I’M A BELIEVER!
