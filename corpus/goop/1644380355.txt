I like this serum a lot. Love? I’m on the fence. Prior to trying this, I was using Environ’s mela-fade serum, and the Goop alternative works much better as far as evening out texture and brightening my complexion. I also didn’t have a negative reaction to this, which is always a concern with sensitive skin. I would buy this again. I did receive a sample to test for free. I used the sample consistently for six weeks prior to my review. My skin is dry, with moderate rosacea. Does a good job brightening!
