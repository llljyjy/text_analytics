I received this cleanser complimentary from influenster. I will give mt hinest thought on this even if I received this at no charge and in exchange for a review. This cleanser is ok, not the best but ok. If you are someone who is sensitive to smells this is not for you. The cleanser is very heavily scented but I personally enjoy and notice it doesn’t break me out. I love to use it in the mornings due to its citrus scent. Gets the job done and leaves the skin smooth but it just wasn’t my favorite. nan
