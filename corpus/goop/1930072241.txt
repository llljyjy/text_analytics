I tried the GoopGlow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser and I love how it smells and made my face super soft. It has a citrus orange and lemon scent to it which I love! It also has exfoliating beads that goes on cool to your face and leaves your skin super soft! I have somewhat sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t cause any irritation. I would recommend this to friends and family! GoopGlow Cleanser
