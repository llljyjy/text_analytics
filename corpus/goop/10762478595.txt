Love this cleanser! I donâ€™t typically use an exfoliating cleanser daily due to how harsh it can be on my skin. This product shocked me! It can be used daily and my skin feels so soft after using. I use daily in the morning and the exfoliating is very gentle and it creates a great base for my skincare and makeup application. This is a product I will recommend and repurchase.
