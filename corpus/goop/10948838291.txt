I received this free from Influenster and Goop in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for several weeks and have noticed an overall improvement in my skin. It is a little tingly at first but after that it’s fine. My skin feels softer, tone is more even, and I feel like it is reducing the appearance of dark spots. I really love this product, I only am rating it four stars because the price is a bit steep. Solid product
