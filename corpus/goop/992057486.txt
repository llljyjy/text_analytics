This has a bright clean citrus smell, a little too much for my liking, but I do appreciate that it is a natural scent with NO added fragrances. That is actually something I look for with having sensitive skin and mild rosacea. I also thought the scrub was a little on the harsh side, again for my own skin care preferences. I would never be able to use every day. More like once or twice a week. Last thought is it leaves your skin very ‘squeaky clean’ feeling, definitely needed to follow up with moisturizer. I prefer one that leaves a more moisturized feel. It’s a great product, maybe for when I was in my teens. But not for my maturing skin now in my 30’s. Nice product. Just not for me
