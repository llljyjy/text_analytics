I received the Goop Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser free for review from Influenster. Overall I think it’s a great exfoliating cleanser. It does exfoliate well, and didn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dried out. I also really liked the packaging of this component. It has a pop top instead of having to just squeeze it straight out of the tube. However, there is an ingredient in this that my overly sensitive skin didn’t like. I’d say that if you have normal/oily/dry/combo skin—you’ll probably really like this. If you have sensitive skin, I’d say get a sample to try before you commit to a full tube. Otherwise, it did leave my skin looking glowy and soft. Excellent exfoliating cleanser
