The packaging is beautiful and you receive a decent amount of product. Only a tiny amount is needed, so this will last for months. It completely removes all makeup residue from my face (including difficult to budge waterproof mascara!) while still being gentle on the skin. After use my skin looks clearer and there is no tightness at all. I would recommend this product to everyone. Goop Jelly Cleanser
