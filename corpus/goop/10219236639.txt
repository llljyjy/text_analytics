I have been using this product for 5 weeks now and results although subtle, they are definitely their. I have a dark spot on my cheek I have tried many products and most are strong and but but do nothing else. This product I was able to add to my daytime and nighttime skincare routine and it is super powerful but also gentle. It feels like an extra moisturizer but has definitely lightened my dark spot. It is unscented and literally I have zero negative reactions to my face. Powerful while remaining gentle
