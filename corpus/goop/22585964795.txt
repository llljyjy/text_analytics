I was send this product complimentary by Influenster to review in exchange of my honest opinion. I was using a really good cleanser before trying this, but I git to say that this is by far one of the best I’ve tried. The smell of orange is refreshing in the mornings, it has the perfect grit for every day use without been harsh on my skin. And after trying it for over twoo weeks I can say I’ve notice a change on my skin. It looks brighter and healthy. I recommend this product and now I’m willing to try something else from this brand. I love this
