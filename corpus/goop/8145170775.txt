I received this GOOPGLOW Exfoliating Dark Spot Sleep Serum for free to try through Influenster and Goop in exchange for my honest opinion and I like it overall.  I did use this serum for the full recommended 8 weeks and it did effectively eliminate all darkness around my eyes (though now that area looks lighter than everything else).  I did not experience any itching or irritation but did break out during the first two weeks of using the serum.  My skin is very dry and the serum makes it feel smooth and moisturized.  There is no noticeable unpleasant scent which is a plus.  I would recommend using this serum  for dark circles although it takes weeks to show improvement, because once it works there is a big difference. It works well after some weeks, patience is key.
