This scrub does effectively cleanse my skin, without leaving it feeling and dry or tight. The scrub component is aggressive enough to feel like it’s making a difference on my skin, but not so aggressive that it feels like I’m doing damage. The smell is nice and citrusy, which is probably it’s high point. I don’t think this particular product performs any better than some other drugstore-priced scrubs I’ve tried. I will not be repurchasing. Nice, but meh.
