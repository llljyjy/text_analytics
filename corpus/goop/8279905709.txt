It stings when applying it to my face, it does disappear after awhile. After about 3 weeks of using it I feel that I only have gotten minimal results.  The results that I have seen is a reduction in my brown spots. I don’t feel that it has a fragrance which I like. The texture is smooth which is nice. If I had to purchase myself I don’t think I would. Not up to the hype
