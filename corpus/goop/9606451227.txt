I received this product for free, in exchange for my honest review. I was really excited to try this product! I have dark spots from acne scars and sun damage from being out on the lake and not wearing sunscreen when I was younger. The consistency is not too thin, where it will run down your face when youâ€™re trying to apply it. It has a light scent that reminds me of raisins and feels really light on my skin when applied. The product is not sticky and my skin feels really soft after applied. I have been using this product a couple times a week with my regular nighttime skin care routine. Within the first couple uses, I noticed my pores shrinking and my makeup primer not having to work so hard. My skin felt smoother and looked brighter after using it. I did not have any tingling sensations when applying the product like some of the other reviewers did. My dark spots and sun damage are slowly lightening with use. I have high hopes with continued use and time, that they will lighten even more. Slowly But Surely
