I got a mini with points. I love the smell and feel of it. Gritty and grindy, and fast acting, so it’s easy to integrate into your existing routine. I’m not sure how “good“ physical exfoliants are for skin, but I like the sensation. I’m just not sure I can get behind the price. Very worth a try though. Gritty and great!
