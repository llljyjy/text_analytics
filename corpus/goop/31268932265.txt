I like the texture of the goop cloudberry exfoliating jelly cleanser and how it feels when you put it on your face.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. Iâ€™m okay with the smell. I have combination skin and it dry my skin a little bit. I do recommend this product for a oily skin. So fresh and clean
