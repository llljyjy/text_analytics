The jelly was thick, but application is super easy and a little bit does go a long way. The product has a citrus scent but it’s not overpowering. My skin looks so much brighter and healthier. I’ve been using it every day, with no issues, followed by a moisturizer. It has a Citrus smell to it, so it doesn’t smell bad at least. I love Goop products! I will definitely be buying this regularly! My favorite cleanser
