I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have sensitive, reactive skin and the product was okay for me. I did not care for the scent, but the texture was silky and light. It does seem to do what it says after many weeks of use, but for the price point I have other products I prefer more. The pump and packaging could also use work, it feels cheap to me. Okay for me
