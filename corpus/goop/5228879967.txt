I received this product complimentary for my honest opinion. I love this goopglow jelly cleanser. This is a gentle exfoliating wash that I’ve used daily without feeling like my skin is drying out nor any irritation. I like the subtle scent. At first I wasn’t used to the jelly consistency but grew to like how easy it is to use and I don’t lose or waste product like with a typical liquid face cleanser. Just be careful to avoid the eye area as the exfoliating beads can sometimes stay on your lashes. Or I guess just rinse more thoroughly than me. Overall, would definitely recommend for daily cleansing with gentle exfoliation. nan
