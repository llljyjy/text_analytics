I really like this! I didn’t notice any scent, so it must be pretty light? I have a pretty hefty skincare regimen. Indie Lee, bloomeffects, Drunk elephant vitamin c, and now defunct coq10 serum. It keeps my skin soft, my combo skin likes it! The exfoliation I don’t normally do (my skin tends to feel too sqeaky clean with some exfoliants, normally)but I really like it! Gonna use it up, it exceeded my expectations! Got to keep to try!
