I received this product free from influenster & Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I’ve used it twice so far and I honestly really like it! It makes my face so soft, I usually breakout super easy but so far so good! Even my oily-ness has gone away for the time being so even though I’ve only done it twice I’d recommend it, it doesn’t make my skin feel tight or red afterwards and that’s a win for me. First time using sephora
