I revived this product on a free trial through influenster  , this is my honest opinion on the product.The goody goop! Ok first off let me say thank you influesnter I actually really like it. Goop has the tiny little bead sand things I really like in my product. You know the whole exfoliate part, seems k feel cleaner with that , most companies are leaving those out now and I’m over here like seriously (sad face). I have lupus and that affects my skin, I have a had time finding a product that won’t burn me or cause more skin ulcers. Like even water causes pain for me. The only downfall was it seemed to not want to come off even with eager so goop is definitely a fitting name lol The goop is seriously goopy
