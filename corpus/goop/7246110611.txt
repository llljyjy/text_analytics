I received this free from influencer for my honest review and let me tell you I love this exfoliating cleanser. It has a non- overpowering delightful refreshing Citrus blend of lemon and orange zest scent that goes on cool to your face with nice size exfoliating beads that mix well in the texture of the jelly. As You Are circulating it over your face you can start feeling your skin soften and actually feel clean I couldnâ€™t wait to look in the mirror and see the aftermath of this delightful product I would definitely recommend and purchase GOOP it on, you will love it!!
