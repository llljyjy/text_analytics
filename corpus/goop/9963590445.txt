I received this product via Influenster. I really enjoy the cleanser’s look and feel. I didn’t love the smell as much as I’d hoped. It still smelled pleasant but it wasn’t a smell I’d want to stick to me all day necessarily. I like that it really feels like it’s doing it’s job and my skin has looked brighter ever since. nan
