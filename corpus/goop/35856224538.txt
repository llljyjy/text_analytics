I’m being using this wonderful cleanser lately and it’s an amazing cleanser, my skin feels so much fresh, smooth and clean, I love to used this product when I wake up in the morning and with my night skincare routine, cause it cleans very good my face before to put anything else on it, also it exfoliate cause it has delicate and tiny particles that help me slough off dead skin cells. you certainly have to try it, this past week I’m feeling my face skin  renovated cause it’s hydrated, soft, supple, and youthful-looking. This is an amazing cleanser
