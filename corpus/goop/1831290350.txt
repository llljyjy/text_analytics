I have combination to dry skin so I normally exfoliate maybe once or twice a week.  However with Goop Glow Jelly Exfoliating Cleanser I exfoliated twice daily.  It is effective yet gentle.  The round beads are tender and clean the skin leaving it smooth and clean.  The fragrance and packaging are delightful Excellent Exfoliator
