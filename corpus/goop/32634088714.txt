I was sent this product for review, but all opinions are my own. The goopglow cleanser smells very good and after using it the first time my face was very soft. I was a little cautious with using this cleanser every day as it has exfoliating bits in it. I use it every 3 days and it seems to do very well. I wish the product was a bit bigger for the $28 price tag. The orange smell is very good and makes the process of washing my face so much better. You donâ€™t need a lot to wash your whole face and I also wash my neck as well with the small bit. I will recommend to others if they love orange scents. nan
