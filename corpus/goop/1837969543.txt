I was sent this product to test for free from Influenster. I’ve been using it for almost a month. I’ve been dealing with acne and scaring lately and I think this serum has helped. I’m only using it every other day since like the directions say to on the bottle. I do think my skin is a starting to get a little better. My skin is smoother and my acne scars, but I’m not 100% sold just yet. I want to see more visible results, especially for the price point. Goop Glow?
