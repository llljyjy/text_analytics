Iâ€™ll admit I had some preconceived notions about the Goop brand, but this cleanser defied my initial expectations. The fragrance is pleasant and subtle, and the exfoliation is gentle enough to use this product daily. It leaves skin feeling super smooth and looking clear and polished. I will very likely purchase it on my own after I finish this bottle! Call Me Surprised!
