I received this free from influenster for my honest reviews.  I have very sensitive skin, and have dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I immediately felt a surge in my moisture levels, it definitely helps with that. I don’t feel my dark spots got much better, but I was forced to stop using it due to my sensitivity. I have used other products, and this one is pretty good for sensitive skin. If you’re in the market, I would suggest giving this a try. Good for sensitive skin
