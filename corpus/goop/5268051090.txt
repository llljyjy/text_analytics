I got this product for free in exchange for an honest review. So far it’s a toss up I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin like some spot removal products do but it’s also hard to see much difference. I have only been using it for a few weeks though and I truly feel this is the type of product that probably takes a month or two to really see a huge difference. All in all I do like it and will continue to use it to see if it will help lighten some spots for me. Doesn’t irritate my skin!
