I was excited to try this product because this summer I had sun spots appear on my chest for the first time.  The packaging is nice and product comes out of pump easily.  The serum smells like Elmer’s glue to me.  I was fortunate I was using on my chest because if it was on my face and closer to my nose I probably wouldn’t have dealt with the smell for hope of results.  I didn’t notice enough improvement with this product.  I will probably ask my dermatologist an RX for something next visit. Good first try but RX product will be next
