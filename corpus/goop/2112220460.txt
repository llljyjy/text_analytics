I received this as a sample from  Influenster.  I was skeptical of using an exfoliating cleanser at first, but after using it, my face felt literally  squeaky clean. It didnâ€™t dry out  my skin or make it feel super tight afterwards either. After close inspection of the ingredients,  it seems pretty mild and would not irritate facial skin like other exfoliating cleansers.  I will continue to use this once a week. Surprisingly great
