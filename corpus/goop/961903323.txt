I received this product complimentary from INFLUENSTER. - Good consistency - Great soft skin feeling after first use - Nice ingredients list -  Gentle enough to use  twice a day—even with other AHA, BHA, or vitamin C treatments -  Unpleasant scent - Mediocre packaging but not bad - Seems a little pricey ($28) but okay if it works -  Need more time to discover possible skin benefits. So far, 4 out of 5. It definitely leaves your skin feeling smooth, though cannot yet tell if it does a deep cleaning of our skin, but since it gentle for everyday use, I assume that it doesn’t provide a deep cleansing . IT WORKS BUT IT IS OVERPRICED
