This cleanser is… ok. It does a fair job at actual cleansing, but the exfoliation beads feel somewhat harsh against my skin. After using this, I went back over my face with micellar water on a cotton pad and could see that this cleanser did a great job of removing the majority of my makeup, which is a huge plus. Something I’m not a huge fan of though is the smell. It smells a bit chemically even though the ingredients all look ok. I typically love goop products, however I would not repurchase this. nan
