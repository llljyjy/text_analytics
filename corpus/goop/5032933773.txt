It has a mild scent like grapefruits.I usually don’t like fragrances in skin care products but I like this smell.It looks like the scent is from bitter orange peel powder and lime/orange/lemon oils etc.The microbeads have a softer, good consistency and they don’t hurt my skin. The scrub I was using before felt hard on my skin and I like this one better.My skin feels soft after using this exfoliating cleanser. nan
