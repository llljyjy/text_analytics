Iâ€™ve been trying out this product for a few weeks, when I started I had a few breakouts on my skin and some clogged pores that I was struggling with and this cleanser cleared my skin in about 5 days! Nothing else in my skincare routine was changed. The texture is like small grains of sugar but not at all painful when you apply it and lathers nicely as well. Beautiful product that cleanses while exfoliating gently and has no real noticeable scent. Love!!!
