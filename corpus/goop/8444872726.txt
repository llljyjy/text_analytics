Application and feel of this product is dreamy! I have been using it consistently for a couple of weeks now and really notice a difference in the evenness of my skin tone! A little bit goes a long way, so the cost may be high but it will last me a long time, so the cost isn’t a huge hindrance for me. I’m looking forward to continuing use and seeing how it helps my skin long-term. A Product I Didn’t Know I Needed!
