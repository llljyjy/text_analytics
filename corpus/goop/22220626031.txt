I really wanted to like this one.........my skin is kind of rough from years of sun and no sunscreen, so exfoliation is kind of a must. This, however, doesn’t really exfoliate. The grit doesn’t do much for my skin, but seems kind of difficult to get off. I have to rinse my face 2 or 3 times just to get it all. Also, the smell is terrible. It smells like the disinfectant that hospitals use. Not for me
