I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The smell of this cleanser is a really nice orange scent and my face was left feeling really soft and smooth. The exfoliating part of this was too harsh for my skin for an everyday cleanser. I will use this maybe once a week after cleaning with a gentle cleanser to get some exfoliation. Overall, itâ€™s too rough for me for everyday use or for a cleanser. I have sensitive skin so this could work great for someone else. nan
