This is a gentler cleanser than others I have tried but I wouldn’t say it’s gentle enough for every day use. I like to use it every other day and it does have a scent, like orange peel or citrus, that isn’t strong but you can smell it when using it. It didn’t break me out or dry out my combo skin so all in all I would say it’s not my favorite but it works. *Received complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review* So so
