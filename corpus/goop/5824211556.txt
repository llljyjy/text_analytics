I have been using this for over a month and have not noticed any real difference. It is certainly Moisturizing to an extent, as I do believe my skin feels fairly soft upon waking after use. However, I otherwise do not notice any difference compared to my usual routine. Also, it smells like glue. It doesnâ€™t last, but I smell it during application. Smelly, no difference
