The taste is not good. The ingredients are acceptable. The problem is they are very common supplements and very overpriced because it is GOOP. You are paying for the GOOP imprimatur, so it must be better than any other form of melatonin. Well, NO. You can buy 90 tabs of 4 mg melatonin and 90 tabs of tryptophan for 16.00 and 12.00. That is three months and 180 tabs for 28.00, not two weeks and 30 for the same. Goop is notorious for this. Donâ€™t fall for it. Exorbitant price for the GOOP name.
