So far I haven’t tried a GOOGLOW product that hasn’t worked. This serum has helped fade my dark spots and clear the stubborn pores on my chin. You do have to use it consistently if you want to see results. Although it’s a little pricey, I do think it’s worth it if you want to see results. I didn’t experience any tingling but I’m also very used to retinol. Overall I would recommend this product! GOOPGLOW Never Fails Me
