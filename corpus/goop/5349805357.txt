I have normal/oily combination skin and I typically exfoliate twice a week.  I have never tried a combo exfoliating scrub/cleanser so I was intrigued by this product.  I’ve used it for a week and I have mixed thoughts.  I like the subtle orange fragrance and the product works well as a cleanser.  I just don’t think it exfoliates my skin as well as my other exfoliating scrubs.  I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to cut out a step in their nightly skincare routine and only needs gentle exfoliating, but there are definitely better exfoliating scrubs out there for those who want to see real results from their exfoliator. Nice cleanser, but not my favorite exfoliator
