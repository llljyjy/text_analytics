This is a really nice, gentle exfoliating cleanser that I am happy I was able to try! The scent is very mild - not at all overpowering which was nice.  I only need a pea sized amount in order to be able to wash my whole face, so this bottle should last for a while.  Finally, I liked how my face did not feel tight after washing, unlike other cleansers that I have used. nan
