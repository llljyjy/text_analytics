I have had the opportunity to use this product for a few weeks. It looks, feels, and smells like Elmer’s glue. So the name is appropriate. Not a big fan. I don’t get a luxurious feel when using it. I haven’t noticed a big difference in the appearance of my skin either. I only felt tingling once. So the bright side is it didn’t have any harmful or surprising side effects. Received complimentary for my honest review. It’s Really Goop
