Been using this product regularly for nearly a month. I typically use this in the mornings and noticed my skin looks and feels so much brighter and feels incredibly clean. I like how less dull my skin looks and feels after every use. I rub a small amount GENTLY in circulation motion over my face and neck.  I don’t think it’s an absolute must have item but it is something worth trying to see if it’s one for you. nan
