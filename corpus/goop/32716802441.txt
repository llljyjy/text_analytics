After using this product for a few weeks, I’m very happy with the results. My skin feels hydrated and fresh. It goes on smoothly without feeling greasy. Absorbs quickly. The occasional tingles let me know it’s working! The scent is meh and has room for improvement. I’m not a fan.  But overall I’m happy with the product. Happy with results but needs a better scent!
