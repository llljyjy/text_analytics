I love this product! It works really really well! It smells good, but not overwhelming at all. A little goes a long way! My skin feels clean but not dried out and also very smooth! I’m so glad to get a chance to try this out, its a fave of mine now! The only tiny drawback is needing to rinse really really well, otherwise you’ll have leftover little granules on your skin. Other than that, its awesome!!!! LOVE THIS CLEANSER!
