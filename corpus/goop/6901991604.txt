There are so many face creams, gels, moisturizers, exfoliants, and serums available making this a tough market.  Having personally tried hundreds of products, I do not feel there is anything special about this product that sets it apart from the rest.  This cleanser does have a nice citrus scent to it, however I prefer to use something smoother on my face as I just don’t like the gritty texture of this product.  I didn’t notice any glow or skin fresh silky smooth feeling as this product claims. nan
