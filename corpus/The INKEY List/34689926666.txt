Love this product especially because it’s so affordable!! I got this item as a Christmas gift this year (2022) and decided to use it recently.  I have seen such a change in my skin, after using for 2 weeks my skin looks more bright and smooth.  I understand that some people don’t enjoy the smell but personally I think it smells a little bit like honey and I like it! My main concerns in my skin is hyper pigmentation (from acne and sun damage) and rough uneven skin tone and this has just made such a difference!! I have a dry dehydrated skin and this doesn’t dry out my skin at all, it gives a nice glow.  Once I go to sleep and when I wake up I just have a refreshing clean bright look. I think this product is super affordable and if you’re looking for an affordable retinol to use at night, then I definitely recommend you purchasing this item! I love trying new products but I will definitely be re-purchase this product again in the future. Affordable Holy Grail!!
