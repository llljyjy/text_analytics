OKâ€¦I can hardly write this review because of the love I have for this product. I double cleanse nightly, and this is my second cleanser. No scent, not oily, and leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft. The price is on point, and I feel like I need to buy an apocalyptic amount, because I never want to live without. Great for any age and a plus for anyone with dry skin. nan
