If you are looking for a cleansing balm to help remove makeup then do not use this one. For me, one thing I need cleansing balms to help with is removing mascara remaining from the makeup remover I used. I use waterproof mascara and this cleanser struggles a lot with being able to remove any of it. If you want a cleansing balm for sensitive skin and a good price point without it needing to remove makeup then I would recommend this, especially for sensitive skin. Something to note is after I use it, my eyes do cloud and I do feel a slight film after washing with a second cleanser still. Not good at removing makeup
