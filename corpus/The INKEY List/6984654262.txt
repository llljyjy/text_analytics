This eye cream is more of a serum texture, which I love, but idk if I’d call it a “cream”. But anyway, I’m very impatient and hate waiting for results with skincare, an im so glad I didn’t have to wait to see results with this product!! I’m bad at keeping up with my skincare routine too, but this product has made such a difference in my under eyes’ appearance. The puffiness is super reduced and they look so much better. A little goes a VERY long way so I’m fed gonna have this product for a long time. Will keep repurchasing though!! love love love
