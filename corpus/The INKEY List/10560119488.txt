Not too great for me personally. The texture is nice and lightweight as it says and you don’t need to use a whole lot, but when it dried I felt my face stiffen like it was frozen a bit. My skin leans more towards dry and I did notice flaking on my nose that I haven’t seen in a while. I think I did see some of the redness I had from acne go away so that’s a plus. Making sure that my skin is moisturized is the priority for me though so I won’t be purchasing it again. Drying
