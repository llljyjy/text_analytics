I’ve used this product for a few months and it’s so refreshing to put on in the mornings, especially to help wake me up. Long-term, however, I find it doesn’t really brighten my skin in the way the product says it will. Maybe in the moment it makes me look like I’ve had one or two more hours of sleep than I actually did, but over time it hasn’t done much to brighten my under eyes. It doesn’t dry my skin or irritate it, and I love that there’s no fragrance, but I mostly use it to freshen up my face, or to add a bit of extra moisture under my eyes on days where I’ve worn makeup. Given its price point, I gave it four stars, since I can’t expect too much from a $15 eye cream, but if you’re looking for a long-term solution for dark under eyes, I would look elsewhere. Refreshing, but doesn't do much long-term
