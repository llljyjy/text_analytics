I originally got this for myself because I have circles under my eyes so dark I look like a zombie with sinus problems who has been punched in the face. (not an exaggeration. they’re BAD) This is a nice eye cream, but it wasn’t moisturizing enough for me (to be fair, though, I’m *really* dry around the eyes) So my husband, Mr. “Can’t I Just Put Jergens Around My Eyes?” gave it a try and loved it so much, he’s now on his third tube. He is currently in his allergy season, and usually his undereye circles would be as bad as mine. They are significantly improved! Weirdly, it also seems to have tightened up the skin a little, but that’s probably just because it’s moisturized. nan
