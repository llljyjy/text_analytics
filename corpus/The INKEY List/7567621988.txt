I’ve been using it for two days now, so far so good, I woke up today with more even skin, my redness has been reduced by a lot, I can’t talk for pore shrinkage yet or controlling oil but I’m sure it’ll be great! The only thing is that this is too sticky for my liking, especially when layering other products ontop at nighttime, I end up feeling like slime paste. good but STICKY
