It seems people forgot basic science. Heat melts harden balm/oil/soap. Just let it float in your tub or in the sink in hot water for a couple of minutes and it softens the product. I have to do it about once every two weeks. It doesn’t remove any of the good properties and works like a charm!It is the softest cleansing balm I’ve ever used. My skin usually always reacts badly to a new product but it’s been loooving it, my wallet alsp loves it... Just leave the bottle in hot water 1 min
