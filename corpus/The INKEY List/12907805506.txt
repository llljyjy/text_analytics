I bought this product in the old packaging awhile ago but never got around to writing a review. It burned my skin SO BAD. I put it on as skin prep for makeup and ended up having to take off all my makeup while I was still in the process of doing it. Iâ€™ve used different products that are not suited for sensitive skin but none of them have ever left me with the burning feeling this gave me. I hated it! Burning sensation
