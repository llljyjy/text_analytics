Loved this cream for the consistency, texture, and formula. Unfortunately after using it for a while it cause a sever rash all over my face and neck. obviously everybody’s skin is different, just ensure your skin can handle peptides. I ended up using the rest of the jar on my legs and they’ve never been softer. Wonderful
