I have very dry skin in the winter and this cleanser is the only one I’ve tried that doesn’t strip my skin in minus 30 climates. It doesn’t really lather, it only slightly foams so I didn’t get that squeaky clean overly stripped feeling. It’s not a “fancy“ cleanser but it does it’s job well. My skin does in fact feel clean after using it, and I’m planning on buying a second bottle.I do usually use a micellar water for my eye makeup as cleansers usually aren’t thorough enough to remove my mascara, eyeliner etc. simple and effective
