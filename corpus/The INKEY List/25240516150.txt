Uhh wow. I’ve probably been using this a month, I use it every night before bed. A tube has lasted me almost a month exactly. My skin is still in the purging phase a bit I think, which is fine, but oh my gosh. My forehead wrinkles have smoothed out so much. They weren’t too bad yet, but after some wear makeup would start to sink in to them a bit. I can tell my skin is a bit drier but nothing crazy. Looking forward to hopefully seeing long-term results after my skin adjusts! Surprisingly good
