I really enjoy this eye cream so far. I have sensitive eyes/skin and it hasnâ€™t caused any irritation or redness thus far. It is very hydrating and it applies smoothly. I have only been using this for a short time, so I will continue to use this regularly to see if the fine lines around my eyes improve. Great First Impressions!
