i love using this cleanser when my skin is angry and i have breakouts. it’s gentle enough to not be super drying or irritating, but super effective. i like to use it in place of my other cleansers when i feel like my skin needs it. it’s my favorite acne fighting cleanser!other stuff to know:-little to no smell-lathers well-rinses well without leaving your skin feeling stripped, dry, or “squeaky clean” great for when you have breakouts!
