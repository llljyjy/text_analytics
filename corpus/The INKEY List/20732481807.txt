My skin loved this cleanser. Using it as the first step in my double-cleansing routine, I squeeze a small amount into my hands and work into a unified paste. Spreading it on my dry skin, the aroma is very comforting, similar to oatmeal and of a relaxing hot tub experience on a snowy mountain top resort. After reminiscing of better childhood memories of the past, I wet my hands and massage my skin some more and rinse away the cleanser. Now, I do agree that there is a bit of “residue“ left over, but with the help of the second cleanser, an ultra-gentle, creamy cleanser, most of the residue is removed and my skin feel great afterwards: smooth and moisturized and the best part, not striped nor in discomfort. I rate this cleanser 5 stars and I will be repurchasing this balm again. Excellent for Dry, Sensitive Skin
