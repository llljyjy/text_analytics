I’ve been using this product for a few months now, and adding it plus the Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant has absolutely changed my skin for the best! My biggest issue with my skin is small little bumps rather than typical acne, and this  plus the Paula’s Choice has been an absolute life saver. I feel like so much of the annoying small texture on my face has disappeared thanks to this! LOVE!!!
