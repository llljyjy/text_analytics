Works good but mabye not for more sensitive skin. I received this item from pinch me to review and while I love the texture and do feel it was moisturizing. I did have a small reaction of redness and some small acne pop up. I think it’s a great budget product and would be amazing for someone that doesn’t have quite as sensitive skin. Works good
