I have been LOVING this moisturizer so far, I have combination skin (I tend to be oily just more towards the corners of my nose) and this moisturizer made my skin feel moisturized but not to the point where I felt excessively oily which i loved. It’s a long lasting moisturizer that doesn’t dry out super quick so it keeps my skin moisturized all through the day! Will definitely be repurchasing! Great for my combination skin!
