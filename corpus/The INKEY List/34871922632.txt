After using The INKEY List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser for a couple weeks I can say that I am very pleased with the results. My skin feels plumper and more moisturized than it has in quite some time. It gently cleans and causes no irritation. I used daily morning and night. One of my new routine skin care staples! I highly recommend. Loved this product!
