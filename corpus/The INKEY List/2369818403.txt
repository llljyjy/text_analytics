This cleanser is great as a pre cleanse. I use it to take off makeup, and I do feel like it helps get more oils off my face. HOWEVER, you have to use a second cleanser. This will leave a residue on your face and it is pretty difficult to get off. If you have super dry skin, that might work for you, but it’s great as a 1st cleanser if you double cleanse. I have pretty oily skin and this doesn’t leave me oily (as long as I double cleanse) Great for your 1st cleanse! (double cleanse)
