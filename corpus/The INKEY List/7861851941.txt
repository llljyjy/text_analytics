This is not like the retinol that I get from SLMD line when I first apply it it burns my face at first but then the burning sensation goes away. I didn’t see any results compared to the SLMD. With the  SLMD retinol I saw results within three weeks. I only got it because it’s cheaper than the usual retinol that I get. unfortunately I’m not buying it again burns my skin
