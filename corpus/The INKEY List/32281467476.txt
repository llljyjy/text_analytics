This product was meh. I have super dark-purple circles (genetic) and I figured, for the price, I’d see if it would reduce the redness/purple colour. It did nothing for me, and actually, I found it made my eyes look more dull. I actually prefer puffier-appearing eyes because I have deep-set eyes. I do think the caffeine would work on someone who wants to reduce puffiness but, in my opinion, I think the dark circle claim is a gimmick. Meh …
