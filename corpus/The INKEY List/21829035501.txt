I received this product complimentary for review from influenster and the inkey list.  Niacinamide is one of my favorite skincare ingredients and this serum packs a serious punch.  If you have any active breakouts or open wounds on your face or fingers this will sting.  I’m going to be buying a new tube or two because I’m addicted and I’m nearly out.  My face really enjoys this especially under makeup.  I really feel like it keeps my face oil free and it helped improve some dark spots from recent acne. I have normal skin but in the summer especially it can become oily,  and I don’t tend to break out a lot nor do I have acne scarring. I. Highly recommend this serum New favorite serum need to buy 2
