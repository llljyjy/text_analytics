I really enjoy this product for a first cleanse to remove my makeup and SPF.  It does a good job of breaking down product, and doesnâ€™t cause any reactivity from my sometimes sensitive skin.  I give it four stars instead of five because I would prefer that the balm emulsified more when it warms up on the skin, but that is just a personal preference.  For the price point this is a great cleanser. Great Affordable First Cleanser
