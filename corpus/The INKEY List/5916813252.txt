WOW. I buy a lot of higher end skin care and still struggle with combo dry forehead and oily t-zone and even in my 30s, I get stubborn zits on my cheek and chin. I’ve been frustrated recently with a couple that would not my go away even with cleansers and spot treatments and patches. I bought this and within literally 24 hours after using, they’re almost gone and aren’t discolored. Highly recommend trying this product! Quick help with stubborn zits and discoloration
