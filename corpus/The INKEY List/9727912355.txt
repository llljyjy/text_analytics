I am a fan of other Inkey products, so had high hopes for this one. I found it mediocre, unfortunately. I don’t like the pump system, and wish companies would move away from black plastic which can’t be recycled in Canada. The moisturizer is okay, doesn’t absorb that quickly, and not all that great for layering. I think the Sephora house brand moisturizer (pink lid) is better quality and more hydrating. just okay
