Great moisturizer that isn’t heavy and doesn’t feel greasy! This isn’t light weight but isn’t heavyweight either! Leaves skin feeling very moisturized without leaving it oily. I can feel just a bit of tingle from the vitamin C when vitamin C normal burns my face so bad I can’t use it. Great bang for your buck! Great for those who are sensitive to Vitamin C
