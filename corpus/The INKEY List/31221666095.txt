I hate the way this product makes my skin look. It reminds me of Honest Beauty’s Hydrogel Cream (I didn’t like the finish on that product either). They both are incredibly lightweight and are easy to rub in. Nonetheless, they leave this greasy sheen on your face all day (I prefer something that looks matte or natural). I wouldn’t even describe the finish as “dewy.” Your skin just looks wet. If you don’t mind that look, I think this is a fine product, especially for the price. It also contains niacinamide, which is a nice addition. Not for oily folks
