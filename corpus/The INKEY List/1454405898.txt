Such a good serum and at an unbelievably low price point! I use niacinamide products every other day, alternating with products with vitamin C. This serum has multi-weight HA, so I can skip my HA serum when I use it, yay! I find it to be a little sticky/tacky (not too much though), so I use it at night. During the day, I splurge and use Sturm HA followed by Sobel niacinamide serum, that even together leave a smooth-feeling finish.. Using the Inkey product at night makes it so I have more $$ to spend on the pricy items for daytime. Fantastic serum for the price!
