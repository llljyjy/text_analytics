This didn’t really help with my acne. I’ve haven’t found a spot treatment that has, I genuinely think they might not work for me. But it didn’t irritate my skin or do anything bad. I’ll stick with hydrocolloid and micro dart patches, but this might work for someone else. I have combination skin and get hormonal acne for more context. nan
