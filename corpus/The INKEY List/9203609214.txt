I’ve been testing this product for about 2 weeks. To be fair I have used it as advised, after serums and before moisturizer PM/AM. This product does provide an instant “plumping“ effect that disapates once dry.  The brand advertises this as a primer. However, when used as such, after moisturizer with ample dry time, it pilled under (my) concealer and left a flakey cast on the rest of (my) face. In my experience, this glue-like serum exagerates texture. I will not be repurchsing this. Unlike the The Ordinary,  I have zero faith in the Inkey List’s efficacy. Pass
