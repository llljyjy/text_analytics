You certainly need a second and foamy cleanse after using this. I don’t feel it does a great job removing my eye makeup — I have to use a micellar water after. Has a very oily feel to it but sometimes does not feel like it’s off your face even after multiple rinses. Happy I only purchased the mini to try it. only use as a 1st cleanse
