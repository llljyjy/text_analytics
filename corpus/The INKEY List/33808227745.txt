So during my cycle, I decided to use this due to me getting bad white heads and pimples during the time.I don’t know if it was me I was oily and breaking out and I had to stop using the cleanser all together due to the fact I was getting so bad.  I don’t recommend this at all better off with a drug store cleanser. And that money you spend, spend it on a good serum for your target problem. Do I have a story y’all.
