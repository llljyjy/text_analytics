Amazing! I have cystic acne and yawing this consistently has helped so much. I was suspicious of the watery consistency but it’s so light and you genuinely only need a pea sized amount for your whole face. It’s weightless, and doesn’t pill under makeup or under moisturizer at all. It flattens all of my acne and within days it’s gone completely! It absorbs instantly and I love this serum! It’s a staple for me and has changed my skin. I didn’t get any results from using a niacinamide and thought my skin would always have blemishes but this serum has made me so much more confident. I highly recommend this product it saved my skin! saved my skin!
