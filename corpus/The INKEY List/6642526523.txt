I really wanted to love this product since it is very moisturizing for the winter and has helped me specially in the dry hospital climate. It’s the only moisturizer so far that I’ve gotten from sephora that didn’t clog my pores. A tub of this size from other brands usually lasts me 3 months.  I bought this bottle 6 weeks ago and it’s all done! When I opened the tub, it was completely empty inside. I should have read the packaging closer and saw the 50ml volume. It is such a waste of plastic for all that packaging that only contains air and is very misleading. I guess the low price point was just too good to be true. :( Misleading Packaging
