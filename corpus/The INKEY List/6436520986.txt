For me personally, this vitamin C was not it. I love the INKEY list line except this product. After working at Sephora for over a year 2020-21, I learned a lot and the first thing I noticed is when it comes to Vitamin C, you get what you paid for. It was a greasy formula with capsules that felt like hard beads, would not recommend. You get what you pay for
