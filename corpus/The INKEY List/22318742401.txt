After falling in love with and using up the YTP super food moisturizer, I was looking for a more budget friendly alternative that provided the same benefits. While it’s no where near the same consistency I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. A tiny pea sized amount would cover my face and neck so while the packaging is small, it lasts a while. I initially had oily skin so Its been hard finding moisturizers that don’t make me feel drenched however when using this don’t feel oily after using it and it has little to no scent. For the price it did the job oily skin friendly
