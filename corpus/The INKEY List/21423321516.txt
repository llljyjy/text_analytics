I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and notice a very slight difference in my skin.  Unfortunately I did have a few breakouts while using but such is the case monthly. I was hoping to see my facial scarring improved, unfortunately not yet.  I love the fact that it doesnâ€™t dry out my face and the price point is a good one. I do feel I need 10% instead of 5% so I will be looking into that with my next purchase of the product. Not bad
