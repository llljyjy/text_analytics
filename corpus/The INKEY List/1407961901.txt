Got tired of spending almost $100 of my hard-earned dollars on fancy face wash and took a gamble. I’m sure glad I did! I have sensitive acne prone skin prone to dark marks and since using this my facial complexion has never been clearer/smoother. A little goes a long way, this doesn’t strip my skin but leaves it feeling smooth and clean. I’m not mad at the price point either. Probably the best cleanser I’ve ever used…
