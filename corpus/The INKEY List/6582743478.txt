I’ve tried quite a few cleansing balms at this point and I think this one performs nicely. It does well with my waterproof mascara but I notice it doesn’t always get every bit of my liquid liner off. I think for the price it’s a good option and it doesn’t seem to effect my skin one way or the other. nan
