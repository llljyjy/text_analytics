I read that double cleansing really helps with those stubborn little bumps you can get on your forehead and using a cleansing balm before another cleanser really cleans your skin. Within two weeks, I noticed really and my forehead texture is basically gone. I love this product, it has become a staple in my skincare routine and I’ve been double cleansing every night! Perfect for double cleansing ✨
