I would’ve given it 5 but I’ll be honest although this is hydrating in a way, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling that hydrated. The reason I say this is because although it is a hyaluronic acid cleanser it doesn’t do fully was hyaluronic acid is meant to do. It does hydrate but more like a regular thin coat of hydration. The cleanser from selfless by hyram leave my skin way more smoother and hydrated. But although it may not hydrate fully it still leave my skin soft I and it helps my skin look healthier. I guess this would be better for those who like a light hydration. It’s still a good product just not hydrating enough for me. I still would recommend this to those who have combination or oily skin. Dry skin can use it but make sure to add extra moisture to your skin I recommend the collagen booster from inky list. GOOD CLEANSER LIGHT HYDRATION
