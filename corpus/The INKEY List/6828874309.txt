I have been so happy with this. I’m on my 3 or 4th bottle. Hydrates, reduces (not eliminates) clogged pores, and does not irritate my very sensitive skin. It has not eliminated my clogged pores, but has notably reduced them. Which considering I’ve been unable to use any product with an AHA or BHA for years - I’m thrilled this one works, and at such a fabulous price point too. Great for sensitive acne prone skin!
