This product makes me wonder why I ever spent so much money on cleansers. I recently decided to incorporate salicylic acid into my routine even though I donâ€™t really break out like that. I get occasional hormonal breakouts but nothing crazy. I worried that since the mask mandate is back in my gym, that I would start breaking out around my chin from wearing the mask while working out. I can happily report that this has done wonders for my blackheads and my pores. FOR THE FIRST TIME in my very expensive skin care journey, I can finally say my skin looks even, the pores minimized and overall good tone to my skin and I attribute that a lot to this cleanser. It has made me want to try more inkey list and start questioning the efficacy of my other expensive skin care products. Amazing. nan
