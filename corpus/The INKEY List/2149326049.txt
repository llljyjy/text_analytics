I thought this was a decent cream for the price. I didn’t overwhelmingly love it, but it did what it was supposed to do. It’s a thick, ~mostly~ unscented cream that absorbs quickly. I live in Michigan and it’s bitter cold right now, and I liked wearing this cream under my sunscreen to help protect my skin before stepping outside or wearing a mask for a few hours at work. It doesn’t pill under sunscreen or foundation, and it also doesn’t further irritate my sensitive skin (due to tretinoin use). Finally, I appreciate that I can trust the Inkey List brand to produce 100% cruelty-free skincare products, which is absolutely a deal breaker for me. Decent Cruelty-Free, Budget-Friendly Cream
