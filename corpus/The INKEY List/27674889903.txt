This works well to remove my waterproof mineral sunscreen at a great price. Canâ€™t speak to makeup removal, however. Feels gentle and hydrating, without leaving much of a film behind. Definitely heavier than other cleansing balms, like Clinique Take the Day Off. I started using it at the wrong time of year to get the full hydrating benefits, but I think this would be fantastic in winter. Great Budget Option
