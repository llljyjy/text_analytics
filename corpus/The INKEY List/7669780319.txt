Best cleanser on the market, I shamelessly purchase 3-5 bottles at a time. I need salicyclic acid in my cleanser as I’m prone to breakouts. I used to use the Vichy brand but it is over $30 for the bottle. The only downfall is I wish they would release a bigger bottle! This is by far my favorite cleaner I have ever used, and ive tried everything from Tatcha, Youth the people, Drunk Elephant. This cleaner changed my life and I won’t every stray from this one nan
