*I received this product for free from @Influenster and @TheInkeyList in exchange for my honest review. I was very excited to receive and review The Inkey List SuperSolutions 10% Urea Moisturizer. I have combination skin with dry patches. Makeup and setting powder tend to make my dry spots more noticeable as the day wears on, but to my surprise I had no issues with dry patches while using The Inkey List SuperSolutions 10% Urea Moisturizer.This Vox Box I received encouraged the use of product for at least 3 weeks before reviewing. I started using SuperSolutions 10% Urea Moisturizer September 7, 2022 took comparison photos on September 20th and October 12th, and am currently still using as I leave this review November 9th, 2022.My initial thoughts upon opening the box:Packaging is minimal and easy to read.There is an easy step guide on the back of the tube that lets you know what step in your skincare routine to use the product, andPackaging is 100% recyclable including the cap.My skin Loves this product! It layered nicely with my skincare routine of serums, spf, and the changing weather from hot to cold. My makeup looked flawless and dewy. The dry patches I had cleared up and left me with a refreshed clean complexion. I also notice my fine lines were softer and more hydrated. After I tested this product for a full 3 weeks I had 2 facials (microdermabrasion and then a laser photo facial) and The Inkey List SuperSolutions 10% Urea Moisturizer was gentle and calming on my face. It is also fragrance free but there is a slight scent but nothing too noticeable after a few seconds.I would highly recommend The Inkey List SuperSolutions 10% Urea Moisturizer to anyone looking to boost their skin‚Äôs hydration, smooth dry patches, and calm irritations down. The Inkey List is a Cruelty Free brand which I absolutely love!üê∞‚ù§Ô∏è A must-have for dry, irritated skin!! Hydrating
