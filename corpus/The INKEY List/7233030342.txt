I bought this a few weeks ago. I like to use this after a gentler face wash and leave it on acne areas a little longer so it really works. I initiallg made the mistake of trying to lather it and rub it in- that doesn’t work. I would recommend not using it where you don’t need it as it is irritating and flaked my skin in certain areas like around my mouth. As long as you’re sparing and use moisturizer, you should be good. I noticed my hormonal acne really fading within a week ish, so I’m happy about that. Works, But Don't Lather
