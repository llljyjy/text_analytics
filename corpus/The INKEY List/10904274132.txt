I am experiencing some purging with this product. My skin texture and acne has gotten worse but know that I have to stick with using it to see the results so will have to write another review after a couple months. I do like the color as it does what my BB cream was doing by correcting the redness so I have been using this instead of the BB cream under make up. The purge is real
