It’s pretty good for basic concerns. For $12 I think it’s a good choice! I’ve been using it every night for a couple weeks on my breasts to firm them back up after weight loss. I am happy with the results! Firmer skin, less noticeable stretch marks. It spreads really easily so a little goes a long way. I use about a quarter size. Obviously it’s not like a surgical result, but certainly a noticeable difference. Not sure how long it’ll last if I stop using it…? nan
