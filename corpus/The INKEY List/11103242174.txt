i’ve had this for a few months now, it’s just okay. yes, it smells, because it contains sulfur. any spot treatment with sulfur is going to smell like sulfur. however, this was just mediocre for me. i didn’t have significant improvement and it didn’t work as well as the Vichy 10% sulfur spot treatment. although that is more expensive it does last long so i’ll continue to purchase that. for someone with very mild acne this may do it just eh
