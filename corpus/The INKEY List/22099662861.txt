This is a no. I feel no benefit after using this on my face. It’s supposed to be good for dry skin, and I def have that from tret. Tiny whiteheads have appeared after only a few days of use, similar to what I get if I’ve used a heavily silicone based product. I’ve used peptide moisturizers before and they generally leave you feeling very plump and well moisturized. But this doesn’t. The texture is also like thick glue, and the recommended usage is a pea sized amount.. this covers nothing with this texture. This needs work. Big miss.
