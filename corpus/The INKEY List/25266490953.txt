Another inkey list winner for my oily hyper pigmented skin. Could tell from the first use I loved it and am on my 2nd bottle now. Only negative is about 1/3 of the bottle is air which you can see in this unused bottle in the pic. Itâ€™s hard to even complain about that given the price, but wish they would fill it just a bit more. Favorite new cleanser
