Does not help with discolouration. Really wanted to love this product but it did not do anything for my discolouration. It give my skin a hydrating look but didnâ€™t do what it was supposed to do. Also the instructions on the back are very confusing, I had difficulties understanding what step this was supposed to be a part of in my skincare routine. It said to use it at the end of ur routine, but it felt weird on the skin by itself . did nothing for hyperpigmentation
