I did not hate this, but I also did not love it or even like it. The metal applicator was my favorite part as this is refreshing and sanitary. However, the product in itself did moisturize when just applied but no long term effect. Also, I particularly dislike that there were glitters in it that were supposed to brighten. Meh but +1 for packaging
