I have used several face washes and most leave me feeling stripped of moisture aster washing my face. This one is amazing and did not leave me with that feeling. My skin feel hydrated straight after using it. The only thing I would say is that it did not remove my eye makeup as well as I would have expected. And I do not wear waterproof anything. Great hydrating face wash
