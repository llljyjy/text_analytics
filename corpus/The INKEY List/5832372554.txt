I love the feel of this moisturizer. It’s the perfect creamy non sticky feel. It’s smooth and a little goes a long way. However I don’t know much change in my face in hydration. My face is a little extreme on dryness so that could be it. But I really do love the product. I use it everyday. The smell is not strong and the consistency is good. nan
