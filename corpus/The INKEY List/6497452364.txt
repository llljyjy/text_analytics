Definitely helps with acne bumps! I have so much “mask-ne” esp around my chin area. It gets tedious when one is healing but then another pimple would start to form under my skin causing a major bump before it develops into a pimple. I used this treatment on those targeted bumps for two days, and now that bump is gone! I’m so relieved, because I hate waiting for the pimples to fully mature before it can be popped or cleaned. Definitely recommend this product! nan
