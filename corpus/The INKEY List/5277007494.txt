Been using about 3 times a week for the past month and my undereyes are very noticeably less sunken in and dark. Also my makeup sits a lot nicer under my eyes since I started using this as my nighttime eye cream. Warning - it is not very hydrating so I top with a facial oil when I put it on! Bye bye undereyes
