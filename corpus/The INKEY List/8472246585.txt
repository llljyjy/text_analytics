As mentioned in the title, this serum is targeted toward those who experience redness such as rosacea and I have sensitive skin so I can see this being helpful when testing new products. I received this around the end of summer so this helped when my skin was a bit irritated from too much sun. I didn’t feel any burn or extreme sensations when applying. I haven’t used it consistently enough but every time I did, I was happy with the results. A little goes a LONG WAY so the recommended small amount is perfect. nan
