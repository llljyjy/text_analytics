Bought this because I needed a basic face moisturizer for the day due to acne products. Melts into face pretty well. I use a “pea size” amount like suggest, mines more like a fat pea but ya . That’s all you need . Didn’t break me out I’ll repurchase. 4/5 just because it didn’t wow me. But worth the $ nan
