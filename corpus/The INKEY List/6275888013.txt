Great product for under eye puffiness . Itâ€™s effects are not very long lasting and will certainly not diminish the eye puffiness indefinitely, but it does dramatically decrease the appearance of eye puffiness. When used day and night with your regime of cleanse, tone, and moisturizer and serum . I noticed results after one use. Definitely worth the purchase. Great product.
