I enjoyed using The Inkey List’s Omega Water Cream as a daily moisturizer in my skincare routine. I didn’t have any visible results from using this cream and nothing really wowed me about this product to run out and buy it. My skin is fairly sensitive and this cream was very pleasant since it had little to no scent and the formula didn’t cause me to break out. It’s a nice moisturizer at a nice price but I think I’ll stick to using my regular moisturizer. Pleasant Feel and Scent
