My skin has been clear for over a year as I am post-accutane. I bought this just to have a thicker moisturizer for the winter time. After about a week of use I got my first severe breakout since finishing accutane. I wasn’t sure what caused it at first but after reading the ingredients there’s SO many skin irritants in this that are known to worsen acne. If you’re acne prone at all avoid this at all cost. Do not use on acne prone skin!!!!
