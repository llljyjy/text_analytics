I expected this serum to be a little irritating because of the mandelic acid and retinol combo  (even though I don’t have sensitive skin these ingredients can occasionally irratate my skin). I was wrong. it’s a creamy almost clear serum with no scent. A little is all you need and it absorbs in quick leaving no sticky residue! I was surprised that the very next morning my skin had a little extra glow. After a week.or so my skin texture was much more even and healthier.  This definitely works! I received this as a free sample from Pinchme, but this is an honest review with my opinion! Great Results!
