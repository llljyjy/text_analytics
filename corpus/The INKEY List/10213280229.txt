I bought thinking it was a face wash, should have read better. I ended up keeping it an i don’t care for it in gets the makeup in my contact and I never had this problem using ponds cream makeup remover and cerave face wash. It also doesn’t do great at getting makeup all off around my eyes. Just buy ponds that stuffs great. meh
