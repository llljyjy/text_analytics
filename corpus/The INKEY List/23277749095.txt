I’m on my third bottle!! After getting a surgery, my skin was pretty dry— this product saved it!! I have combo skin and usually use a very light gel moisturizer. I didn’t want to buy another moisturizer for dry areas so I ended up purchasing this instead for extra hydration! Definitely recommend for those with combo skin! perfect for combo skin!
