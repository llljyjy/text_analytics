I really really wanted to love this moisturizer. It feels amazing on the skin, and great hydration. It just broke me out SO BAD. I thought maybe it was the other products I was using, but I tried this on it’s own and it caused so many under the skin pimples. I recommend this product if you have dry skin that isn’t acne prone. if you have acne prone skin be careful!
