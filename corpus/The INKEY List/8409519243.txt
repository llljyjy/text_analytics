This is a decent basic moisturizer. It is fragrance free which I love. I find the pump packaging to be really convenient since you don’t have to dip your finger into a jar. It feels nice on the skin and does not pill under makeup. I think this is an ideal cream for someone with normal skin. I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin since using it, so it’s a solid basic moisturizer in my opinion. Decent product, love the packaging
