I wanted to like this product because it came highly recommended, but I quickly found that it was similar in consistency to petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) and didn’t really do anything remarkable for my face. I felt like to properly wash it off my face after applying, it required me to tug at my skin, and nearly always left my pores feeling clogged and dry afterwards. Usually I have the opposite problem with products, as I feel like they strip the oil from my face and make my skin too tight and dry. After a wash, my face would feel far more textured by the end of the day. I really disliked this. To make matters worse, when I finished the bottle, the product had started to mold inside the bottle and around the cap. I won’t be purchasing from Inkey list again after this one.
