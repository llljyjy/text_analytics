Was a fan of the salicylic acid cleanser so I wanted to try this one and I love it. My skin has never been softer or more hydrated. I never get compliments about my skin but someone told me recently I have a great complexion and I think its partly because of this product. Does an alright job of removing makeup so I make sure to use a makeup remover before using this product. nan
