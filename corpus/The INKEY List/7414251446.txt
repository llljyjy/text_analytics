Bought this to target some wrinkles that were appearing (curse you, late 20s!) And it did make a difference in fading them. Admittedly I did get botox but using this retinol every night faded them faster than the botox worked! In addition to that, it has made my skin the clearest it has ever been. I’m not sure what about the retinol does that, but I haven’t had so much as a blackhead in months since I made it a daily part of my skincare. ABSOLUTE MUST DO: hydrate. Hydrate so much. It *will* dry your skin out like crazy if you don’t hydrate alongside it Smooth, clear skin!
