I have combination skin (an oily t-zone with the rest being dry) and this moisturizer was greasy all over. I didnâ€™t feel like it sunk in to the skin at all. It just sat on top. I really wanted to love it since I love other products from the brand, but this was honestly disappointing :(. disappointed unfortunately
