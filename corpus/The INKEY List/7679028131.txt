This felt like straight vaseline. And does not emulsify with water to become milky… It’s literally like rubbing vaseline on your face and trying to take it off with water. Stick to a good cleansing oil like the Elizabeth Arden or DHC. Elf even has a way better cleansing balm than this. Not my favorite.
