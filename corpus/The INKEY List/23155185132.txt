My auntie introduced the inkey list to me since I had some acne ever since 2020, due to wearing masks for a long time and stress. This helps with the dullness and removes your makeup so well! It even removes my white eyeliner where I would usually put around my waterline to make my eyes look bigger. Not a lot of cleanser does that! i recommend this!
