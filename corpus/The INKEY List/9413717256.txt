This is a pretty average spot treatment. I think you get what you pay for with the price tag. I can’t necessarily give a complete review of this since a lot of my acne is hormonal. However, this works really well on acne that is healing. I will probably continue to buy since it’s pretty cheap compared to other salicylic acids. Pretty Average
