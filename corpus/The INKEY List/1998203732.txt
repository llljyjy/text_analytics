Why would there even be 1 star on this product?? Some people must be using it wrong? Or maybe it’s the type of acne? I use this for hormonal pimples (that time of the month) or when maybe I forgot to wash my face the night before or maskne (face oily or dirty). Right when I notice a little red spot that’s starting to hurt, it’s succinic to the rescue. I’ve never had any other product work as well on pimples than this. It just dries them up quickly and shortens the length of time that pimple is going to stick around. You just have to make sure that you apply to dry skin (could be after the serum step, but make sure serum is fully dried) and make sure succinic is fully dried (wait a few minutes) before using moisturizer. Or to really make sure that it really works, sometimes I just skip moisturizer where I’ve applied the succinic. A great spot treatment! A Godsend
