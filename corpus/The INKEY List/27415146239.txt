I would highly recommend this to anyone with combination skin type, I’ve been breaking out lately due to the weather and this product helped my stubborn acne go away within a couple days. This product doesn’t really work well on a mild spot, but if you get like an acne pus it would work wonder!I kinda used like an acne patch after the pus went away as it leaves an open scar, the patch would help to catch all the sebum. nan
