I am wary of retinol.  but when I saw this combo composition of ingredients I decided that I want to try it.  I have wrinkles, as well as small acne scars.  I need something that scars and bumps, and evens out the tone.  the product is very soft, affordable and has an excellent composition.  Iâ€™m happy . Great product for small price
