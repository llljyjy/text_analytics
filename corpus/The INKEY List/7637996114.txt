Not moisturizing enough for my combination dry(oily t zone n cheeks, dry jowls area) sensitive skin. Its not very creamy. And i broke out on my dry areas of face after using it 1st time only. Got scared and I gave it to my husband who has oily skin. Luckily my money s not wasted . Not for dry combination sensitive skin.
