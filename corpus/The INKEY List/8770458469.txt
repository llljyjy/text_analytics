I bought this cleansing balm to see if it would be a good dupe for the Clinique take the day off balm. It did a nice job removing makeup but felt goopy and didn’t dissolve well. The style of product delivery via tube is wasteful. I thought I finished it but cut it open and there was tons of product left. The biggest plus was that it’s gentle and didn’t make my face feel dry after. If you don’t want to spend tons of money this is a good option but it definitely does not match Clinique’s cleansing balm. Needs improvement
