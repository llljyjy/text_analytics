My skin gets a little dry during winter time (whatever winter we have here in San Diego); I wasn’t expecting much of this product but decided to give it a try anyways, out of curiosity…I’ve been using it in combination with the hydrating serum before bed only and I have to say that my dry, slightly flaking skin is now under control. I’m very pleasantly surprised especially because I also have acne prone skin but this combination has not caused any breakouts either! Definitely a major win in my books! nan
