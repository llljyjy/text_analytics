I received this product with testing purposes.  After trying for a month I noticed a great improvement on my skin.  My face is usually dry around my nose and the sides of my mouth towards my cheeks.  This product provided moisturizers that hydrated my face giving a smooth glowing looking.  I love the results.  It dos not feel greasy or oily.  Comtains 10 of Urea moisturizer and 10% colloidal oat.  I do recommend this product. Got to have it!
