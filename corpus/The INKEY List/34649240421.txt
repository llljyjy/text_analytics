it was alright, i definitely notice a difference in areas where i didn’t expect it to fix but i haven’t seen too much of a difference in dark spots and hyperpigmentation. maybe because i an relying solely on this product, but maybe if you buy other serums and products ALONG with this, it will work wonders. worth it...maybe ?
