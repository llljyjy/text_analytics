I’m an avid Inkey List consumer. Like the other IL products in my roster, I was excited to use it. Unfortunately, I’m very disappointed.  I tried it more than once, to give it a fair chance but..it’s terribleThe consistency is like cloudy water. It doesn’t lather either. Yes, it’s about 5 ounces, but it’s so watery that you have to use more than you would a normal cleanser.Needless to say, I returned it :( Aww...I really wanted to like this
