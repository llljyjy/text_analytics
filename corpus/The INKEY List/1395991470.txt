I hate to say it but I don’t love this cleansing balm. This is the second cleansing balm I’ve used (first was Heimish All Clean Balm- love!) and I found this one to not wash off very well. My skin, even after using my regular cleaner, felt like it still had an oily film on it and I also found I was more prone to clogged pores and breakouts so I’ve stopped using it on my face. HOWEVER- because I don’t want to waste, I’ve been using it under my arms in the shower to break up and wash away my antiperspirant/deodorant and have found that it works great for that! Doesn’t wash clean- found and alt use!
