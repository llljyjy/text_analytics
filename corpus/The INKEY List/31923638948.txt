this is my second time purchasing the mini version and this particular tube had a bunch of brown stuff floating in it. it was smudge-able but throughout the cleanser in clumps. the tube came sealed and i haven’t seen anyone else have this issue, so i’m assuming it’s a quality control issue? brown stuff in cleanser, check yours
