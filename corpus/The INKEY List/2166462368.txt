I was very excited for this product - amazing price, and it went on like the Peter Thomas Roth water cream( my personal fave - but looking for an alternative because of the price point) In a few days of using this, I started breaking out. I have a hormonal acne but this was way off and caused bumps on my face. Wouldnâ€™t recommend. nan
