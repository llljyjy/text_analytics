I’m torn on how i feel about this product...i LOVE the inky list, literally every product i have used from this line has been amazing and my skin has loved it...this, however, not so much. I havent really noticed a difference in my under eye, and i really dont like the weird shimmer effect? But what bothers me the most is that the metal tip has oxidized and turned this weird nasty black color. It makes me not want to put that anywhere near my eyes so I end up squeezing some on to my finger which defeats the whole purpose of the “de-puffing“ cold tip... idk, they could have done better with this...im a little disappointed.. anyone else's tip look like this now
