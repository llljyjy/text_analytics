This is my favorite cleansing balm. It’s so moisturizing and soothing. It really helps to remove makeup and/or sunscreen before going in with my other cleanser. It’s even nice to use just by itself, but I prefer to follow up with my gel cleanser after since the balm cleanser is so heavy. Favorite cleansing balm
