I received this product for free from Influenster and The Inkey List in exchange for my honest review. This does seem to help with my post acne mark redness. It’s easy to apply and doesn’t smell too strong. Since my skin isn’t super red I will probably use this as a spot treatment going forward. Good for acne marks
