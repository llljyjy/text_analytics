I was using the cerave salicylic acid cleanser until I got this one, and I felt like it just wasn’t doing much for me. Cerave also doesn’t list the amount of salicylic acid in their cleanser, so for all I know it’s barely anything. Anyways, I really like this one and I have noticed a difference in my skin after using this as my nightly cleanser for over a year. I still get breakouts, but my skin has been more consistently better. It’s also not drying at all, and I don’t detect any fragrance. Better than Cerave
