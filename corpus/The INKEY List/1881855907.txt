i wanted to try this as a less expensive alternative for my normal cleaning oil but i would rather have spent 20 more dollars to avoid this experience. squeezing out the product was scarring on its own but this stuff stinks!! does it smell like oil? yes. but like... this is a bit wrong!! it was a bit too tacky to rub in comfortably. when i rinsed my face it was uncomfortably still oiled... it didnt even get off cheap mascara nicely, even after double cleaning and toning with a cotton pad i still feel like i did not wash my face well. this product is very silly. its not too expensive but even cheaper cleansing oils ive used before worked better. i feel like a fool for buying this.PROS: noneCONS: feels and smells icky, barely works, unpleasant to rub on skin, upset me.my perfect cleansing oil is neogen cica cleansing oil ($30). in the past i used kracie olive cleansing oil (~$10 if you live near a japanese grocery store dont pay 24 dollars like shein is trying to make u do). its an honest cleaning oil. miss inkey list oat cleansing balm ruined me dont walk, RUN away from inkey list cleansing oil!
