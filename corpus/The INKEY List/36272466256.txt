I’ll give it credit, this cleanser is not kidding around, and it works. I knew it would be harsh given the 5% benzoyl peroxide, so I tried very hard to be careful. I intended to use very little for a short period of time to deal with a horrible breakout. In the end I only used it twice. I spaced out the use over 3 days. Still the sensitive parts of my skin, such as my neck and eye area, became red and inflamed. (I promise I did not apply directly to these areas and tried to be very targeted where I utilized the product, but as I mention below the consistency made that extremely difficult.) It certainly works quickly, as benzoyl peroxide typically gives my skin a flaking effect due to the way it works. I did get that after the two uses, so it was doing its job. I don’t see the flaking as a drawback to this particular product, I see it as a necessary evil of using something that fights acne in this way. (For me, it usually goes away after a few uses of a benzoyl containing product. I can’t attest to whether or not this would have been the case, as I stopped using it due to the aforementioned inflamed skin in sensitive areas.)The consistency is runnier than I anticipated, and it is hard to control how much product comes out of the tube. It’s also difficult to control where it goes on your face, no matter how careful you are. The smell is akin to bleach-which isn’t surprising due to the ingredients-and was difficult to tolerate even though I didn’t expect a great scent. I love Inkey List normally, and I hope this helps folks, but this is a miss for me. runny + strong formula is a tough combo
