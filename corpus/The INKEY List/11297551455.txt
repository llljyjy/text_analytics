Pros: Affordable, emulsifies well, doesn’t sting/cloud eyes and removes waterproof makeup.Cons: Strange grainy texture, doesn’t fully remove waterproof mascara (though I can’t tell if thats the cleanser’s fault or the mascara is just that stubborn), difficult to dispense from the tube and doesn’t glide as well as other cleansing balms. It’s okay…
