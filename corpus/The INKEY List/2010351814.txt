Love this product so much. I use it religiously. I make sure my face is still moist from washing it or add a little water on top of the product as this is how hyaluronic acid works to absorb moisture. I use it before any toners or anything else. I’ve repurchased it many times, can’t recommend enough. I also tried the ordinary & didn’t like theirs. I have acne prone skin nan
