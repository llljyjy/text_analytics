didn’t really love this cleanser, although i do find it to be more effective than the salicylic acid one. the contents also last for a surprisingly long time. deducting points for the HORRIBLE PACKAGING and the CAP THAT BREAKS AFTER A COUPLE DAYS. i’ve been through a few bottles of the inkey list’s cleansers already and every single bottle’s cap has broken off. without fail. nan
