this is a wonderful product to remove makeup and sunscreen!! obviously, it feels oil-based because it’s a balm.. so you’re supposed to use another cleanser afterward (i use vanicream) to help remove any oily cleansers and other oils and dirt on your face! double cleansing is widely popular in asia and helps you achieve cleaner and clearer skin after continued use. i’ve used this balm for almost two years now, and i will continue to purchase it!! it’s a lot less expensive than other balms, has pretty good ingredients (there aren’t a lot of ingredients either), and i don’t have to wait long for shipping if i bought a balm from korea haha :( I bought this when i was broke and new to double cleansing, but even now i still reach for this product. i hope the reviews that only use this balm to remove makeup and don’t double cleanse don’t convince you otherwise because with this balm you definitely need another cleanser :D use to double cleanse!!
