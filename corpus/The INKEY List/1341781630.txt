I’m really enjoying this serum so far. I wore it overnight, and my skin looked visibly improved in the morning. It’s also a better performer than Deciem’s Niacinamide serum - unlike Deciem, there’s no pilling and visible results. I’ll definitely be repurchasing and exploring more of The Inkey List’s line. Really impressed
