I like the size of this bottle, as it is perfect for travel, but the bottle leaks. I also only had 2/3 of the product left in the bottle when I received it, likely from it leaking during delivery. When I take it in my travel pouch, it leaks, too. Just a very leaky bottle that can be improved. Regarding the product, I like another toner I’ve used before more than this toner, but Dr. Dray on Youtube has given her approval for this toner. I get acne here and there with some bumps around my temples, and I think Dr. Wu’s Pore Refining Toner works better for me, but this is budget friendly, and PHA is supposed to be quite beneficial for the skin. Good for its Price
