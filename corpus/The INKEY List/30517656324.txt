I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so I gave this mini a try while searching for something I could use when my skin is very irritated and thirsty. I’ve used non-foaming cleansers before and liked them just fine, but this stuff is just... odd. It separated into oil and thicker lumps, and no amount of shaking or massaging the tube would get it to recombine. Using it felt like all of the most unpleasant parts of the oil cleansing method, but none of the nice ones- the thicker bits were tough to get off and felt greasy even after rinsing and even rubbing with a cloth (a big no-no for rosacea, but I was desperate at that point). I eventually used a foaming cleanser to get the last of the ick off of my face but still had a moderate acne breakout a few days later. I’m not sure if the product I got was defective b/c of the separation, if it’s a poorly designed product, or if it’s great for other people but not for me, but I threw it away after two washes because I wasn’t gonna put myself through that annoyance again. I guess I’m back on the hunt for a rich, gentle, non-foaming facial cleanser. Absolutely not, especially for rosacea
