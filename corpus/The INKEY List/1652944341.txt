I love this product. I do a double cleanse anyway, so the reviews stating it didn’t remove makeup, that doesn’t bother me. However, I have extremely sensitive skin and this is literally like a balm to it. It cleans without stripping and my skin is soft. My rosacea has diminished so much since using it. I can’t rave about it enough, plus, it’s incredibly affordable. I love it. Game changer for sensitive skin
