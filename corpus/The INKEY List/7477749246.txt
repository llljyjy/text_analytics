This product was a no-go for me. The cleanser was very hard for me to dispense, I literally had to squeeze the bottle so hard for just a tiny bit to come out! It felt like an ointment and I hated how it felt on my face. The product didn’t clean off any makeup off my face, if anything it sealed it in on my face lol. I do not recommend. Feels like ointment, doesn’t cleanse
