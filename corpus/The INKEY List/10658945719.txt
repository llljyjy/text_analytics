I’ve been using this product for a few months now and I’ve been liking it! I have dry acne prone skin and I find this doesn’t dry out my skin as much as other salicylic acid cleansers. I also find my skin has gotten a bit clearer, but it hasn’t cleared my skin up entirely. A tip: if you have dry skin and are using salicylic acid for the first time make sure you slowly work up your tolerance!! First I did it once a week for a bit, then twice a week, and now I use it every other day! I use a hydrating cleanser the other days so it’s not too many harsh products at once. Good lightweight cleanser
