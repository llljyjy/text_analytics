This is an excellent daytime face cream! The texture is of medium viscosity and is easy to spread on my skin. I was actually surprised how moisturizing this cream is, since its not greasy, oily or heavy feeling on my skin! This cream is the perfect addition to my skincare routine since Iâ€™ve been experiencing some dryness lately but have to be careful  not to use too rich/ heavy products on my skin since its acne-prone. Truly an amazing facial cream! nan
