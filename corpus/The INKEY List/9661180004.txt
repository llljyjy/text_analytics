My previous cleanser started to break me out and I wanted to try a wallet-friendly replacement. My skin is usually dry and really sensitive but has responded amazingly to this cleanser! My only issue is that it does not remove eye makeup whatsoever, so now Iâ€™m adding another step to my routine to remove mascara at the end of the day. But aside from that, my skin looks amazing and is super hydrated without getting oily! Great for sensitive skin
