I work in a haunted house and we use a variety of special fx makeup and adhesives. Things like liquid latex, spirit gum, grease make up, lots of fake bloods and alcohol paint. I also suffer from adult acne so I wanted to make sure it would remove EVERYTHING gently. works like a charm. Apply, let sit for a couple minutes, then rub it in with wet hands. Now I do wipe off with a cloth before my 2nd cleanse. It was even mild enough to remove the makeup from my fever blister (hereditary unfortunately) without discomfort! Iâ€™ve recommended it to all the actors now. LOVE IT! My second pic is before wiping it off. Required for haunt season!
