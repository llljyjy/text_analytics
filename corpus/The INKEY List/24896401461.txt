I really love this product! It is great at removing makeup, especially mascara. I like that I don’t need to rub and pull at my eyes to get makeup off. It does leave a thick and balmy feeling afterwards, but I use this as the first step in a double cleanse so I don’t mind. This has been great for my sensitive combination skin! nan
