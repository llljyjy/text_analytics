Really love this treatment! It’s non drying but gets the job done. I use it as a spot treatment but sometimes do larger portions of my face like chin or forehead if I’m dealing with breakouts and it doesn’t irritate my dry skin. I can’t decide it I like it best in the beginning of my routine after toning , or at the very end, both seem to work well. nan
