I have mild random break outs and redness. This actually helped my redness but I couldn’t really tell a difference with my break outs. I used this product for a month and the redness for sure went down and some of the breaking out. I would like to continue to use to see if it actually makes a difference.After having children my face has been really hard to manage and products don’t seem to work like they used to. Overall love that it helped with my facial discoloration and will continue to use! Helps with discoloration
