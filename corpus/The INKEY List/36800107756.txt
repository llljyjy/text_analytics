I used it in my double cleansing routine together with caudalie vinopure cleanser. Honestly, it’s too oily for me. It removes makeup not so bad, it does its job. But leaves a very oily feeling on my skin afterwards, my hands are going for the next cleanser immediately. I won’t buy it again, want to try something less oily. Good product but not for me
