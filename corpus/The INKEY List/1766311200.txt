I loved this! It was hydrating, moisturizing, it made my skin feel soft and dewy all day long BUT it broke me out in tiny pustules. It took me 3 weeks to figure that out :( Granted I thought it was a natural based serum that was the culprit (it was) but I still had those breakouts everyday after for 10 days. I did see another review that said Oleic Acid could be the cause for that but I ignored it because that’s what I do when I’m excited for a product that doesn’t have Hyaluronic Acid. I have oily/combination/blemish prone skin, it didn’t work for me and I’m devastated. So now my neck gets to reap the benefits of this hydrating moisturizer. It didn’t have a smell at all for me. I’d still recommend this product for maybe drier skin types, just so you know I’ll be really jealous if it works for you :( nan
