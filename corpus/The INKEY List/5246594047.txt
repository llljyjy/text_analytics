Didn’t really do anything. I don’t like the formula. It goes on smooth at first, then when dry it pills. You can’t really ‘set’ it with a powder because it’ll rub off. The tube is convient but either too little or too much will come out. It’s a weird runny texture with glitter in it. Just buy something else
