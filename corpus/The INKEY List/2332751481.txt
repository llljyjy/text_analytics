I donâ€™t know if I got a bad one, but the texture of mine is grainy/scratchy. It comes out separated between a pool of oil and the thicker  balm part. The packaging makes it impossible to get the product out when it gets close to the bottom.The ordinary cleanser if so much nicer and for a lower price. separates, scratchy texture, bad packaging
