Ok so first impression it was very glowy. I liked the feel of this moisturizer ,my skin looked and felt good but the second day i decided to do what i always do which is take a little extra and apply on my under eyes. I woke up with red underwear that lasted more than a day. My skin is very oily and I would never call it sensitive because its never reacted this way. I thought maybe it was something else and it burned as soon as i tried to put it under my eyes again. I suspect its the niacinamide percentage .I am going to finish this product but not sure id buy again. burned my undereyes
