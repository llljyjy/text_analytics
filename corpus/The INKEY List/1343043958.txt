This cream is amazing! I’m really confused about the negative reviews. It is very creamy and excellent to mix with other products. Instead of applying it directly, I mix it with the Inkey List hyaluronic acid serum or my regular moisturizer. That way it helped to reduce the chance of stinging and spreads more evenly across the face. For the price, it’s such a great option to add a strong concentration of vitamin C to your routine. Give it a try!
