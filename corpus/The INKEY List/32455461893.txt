I’m not necessarily sure if I know if it’s working yet. I do know that my dark spots are fading, and not really showing up after a breakout. But I’m not really having a lot of breakouts to really know the extent of the product. I do like the way that it goes on my face, really smooth, so I think I will continue to use it. Nice for black spots!
