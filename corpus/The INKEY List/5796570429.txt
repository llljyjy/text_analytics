I had really bad acne at one point and im left with some serious hyperpigmentation on one side of my face. I’ve tried everything and saw good reviews on this so I got it. This works really well for me but I use it 3 times a week with no other product on my face except for eye cream. I like that this product dries down super fast and leaves no residue as Im a side sleeper and half the time I feel like my skincare ends up more on my pillow than anything else. Over time I’ve seen my hyperpigmentation get a lot lighter and I can confirm this because the amount of concealer I use to cover it has seriously decreased. I have really bad hyperpigmentation so it did take a while to see results but eventually I did. I really love this treatment, I know there are a lot of mixed reviews but at its price point, its really worth a try. Worth a try
