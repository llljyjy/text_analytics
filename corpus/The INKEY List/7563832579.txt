I have combo skin. My dry spots are BAD. Flaky and itchy. I purchased this after lots of research as I’m also blessed with sensitive, acne prone skin. I love Tatcha but can’t justify that price tag. This is better in my opinion. More affordable and made a HUGE difference in less than a week. I know people say “I saw results in less than 5 days!” But I truly did. I won’t buy anything else from here on out. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT
