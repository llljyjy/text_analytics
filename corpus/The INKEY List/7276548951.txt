I had high hopes for this moisturizer… unfortunately, it feels like water - not in a good way. It’s incredibly thin in consistency, and is difficult to spread. It starts off with a somewhat cream-like texture but as soon as you go to blend it into the skin, it turns into liquid and almost drags on the skin. The same feeling you would get if you tried to blend water into your face. To be honest, I can’t see how it would work for any skin type. Not Great…
