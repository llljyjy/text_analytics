I have been using this product for more than a year, but the last time I brought this product was my last. The last time I ordered this product I didnâ€™t check the ingredients because I thought it would stay the same. But for some odd reason, my face was getting very sensitive, dry, and was getting more breakouts. Not until I checked ingredients and saw that I had coconut acid, which is an acne-causing ingredient.  I will not order this product again and I advise everyone no matter if you know any company or brand from head to toe to always check the ingredients of any product before you order it, even if you have been ordering that product for a very long time.
