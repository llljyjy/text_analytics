I received this product for free for my honest review and opinion. I like this better than most products containing retinol. It dis dry my skin out in some places, but for the most part it works very well. I do feel there are improvements in dark spots, scars  and wrinkles. I am hoping with further use these areas will continue to improve! The first photo is with light makeup and the second photo is 3 weeks later with NO makeup. Working Well
