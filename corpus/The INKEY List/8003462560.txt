I’ve been using this mask on and off for about a year when my skin is really broken out. It helps dry up blemishes without drying out the rest of my skin. I never feel tight or dry when it’s on like some clay masks where you can literally crack it if you move your face. It is non-irritating on my sensitive acne-prone skin. I am on my second tube and will definitely repurchase when I run out. Simple, yet effective
