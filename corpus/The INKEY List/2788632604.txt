I’ve used this cleanser for about a week  and my skin is loving it! I have oily skin that gets dry patches in the winter; it’s a bit sensitive so I’m always hesitant to try something new but this has been great. My skin feels soft and smooth, no breakouts and a bit less oily. Sensitive, oily skin - give this a try!
