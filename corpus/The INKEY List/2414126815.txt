As someone who struggles with dry skin and redness, a gentle but effective skin product is essential. I love how affordable this brand is. I will say that this product is hydrating but it does call my rosacea to flare and sting a little bit. it also leaves my skin feeling a little bit sticky. just okay for dry skin
