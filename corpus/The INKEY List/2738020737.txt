Well priced but Barely useable. If I use too little it creates a grainy dry texture under my makeup. If I use too much it creates a sticky layer that pills a few hours later. Bought it for the EGF, but it seems like there’s so little it doesn’t matter. I’d spend your money on a better product. I’ll finish it because I’m stubborn but absolutely will not repurchase grainy, sticky mess
