I use this as a first step in my double cleansing routine. I can’t imagine just using this as a solo cleanser because of how greasy it kind of feels (and I didn’t know that other people use it as solo cleansers). But, this is pretty good as a cleansing balm and definitely comes off easily when you’re double cleansing with a regular cleanser afterwards. You get a lot of product for such a small price and it does a great job getting your makeup off. Love it.
