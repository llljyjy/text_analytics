This product is so good! The texture is simply the best, it feels amazing on and it does the job so well. I am oily and I can use it day and night, but would recommend to use nights only on very hot days since it is a bit more moisturizing. For the price tag and ingredients’ list you can’t bit it. SO GOOD! SO GOOD!
