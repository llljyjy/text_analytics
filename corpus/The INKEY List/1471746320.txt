For the price point this is a great eye cream/illuminator. When applied directly onto skin using the applicator itâ€™s cooling & soothing because the nickel material always keeps cool. It soaks into the skin easily and leaves a nice glow & highlight that is not too shimmery. It makes the whole eye area look more awake.Over time I have seen a slight difference in under eye brightness and smoothness, but the main benefit of this would definitely be for instant results. nan
