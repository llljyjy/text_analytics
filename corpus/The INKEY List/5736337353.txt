I have had years of hyperpigmentation (under my breasts, in-between my thighs, on my face - due to electrolysis).   After two weeks using it, wow, my skin is coming back to normal.  I would say that 65% is healed.  I can’t wait to see how my skin will be in a month.  I cannot be grateful enough to have found this product.  It doesn’t itch.  It is gentle for afro skin.  I am left amazed. Years of dark spots - now going away
