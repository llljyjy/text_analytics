Love this product, itâ€™s worth every cent!  I purchased the tatcha water cream 5 months before and I can say this is a dupe and maybe better feeling (I could have also bought the wrong tatcha product for my skin type) but I love how light-weight it is but also moisturizing for during the day time love this product
