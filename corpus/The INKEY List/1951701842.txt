I just received this yesterday so Iâ€™m reviewing on ONLY packaging since I have not tried the actual product yet. The packaging pictured online is an airless jar and what came was a poor quality tube. Eye mark is off in the back, tube crimp itself is terrible, and cap is scuffed. Does this affect the product in the tube? Possibly not, but it is a poor customer experience when paying $14 for a cheap tube when an airless jar was pictured. Packaging not as pictured
