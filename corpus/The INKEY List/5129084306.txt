I do like this but I don’t like that I have to squeeze the product out. Maybe it’s because it’s so cold now but it’s hard to squeeze out! I don’t know if I would repurchase again. It does the job though and feels good on the skin. I’m going to finish this and just stick to my usual cleansing balms. Hard to squeeze out in the winter
