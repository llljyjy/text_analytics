I keep finding myself buying this due to the price point and the fact that it does it’s job just okay… it does remove makeup , but I use it twice , or I use once and do another cleanse with a different cleanser . As a cleanser on its own- this isn’t it in my opinion , leaves the skin feeling pasty and not “clean feeling” Meh, it’s okay .
