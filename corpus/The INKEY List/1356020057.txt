This is such a bummer of a product because the price and formulation seem amazing. It doesn’t loosen makeup and SPF as effectively as a cleansing balm should. But then, it also needs basically its own cleanse to come off. To make this work, you need to really rub and then follow with two “second” cleanses. So, in the end, you are really not saving money. I gave it two stars because it is soothing when you first apply. nan
