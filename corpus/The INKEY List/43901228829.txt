Honestly I was worried given the ratings on Sephora to give this a try. I watch Cassandra Bankson skincare videos often and try most products she recommends. That being said, this is not a daily cleanser and I only use it for my makeup. I follow up this balm with a gentle cleanser and notice my face to be makeup free, soft, and so clean. Try it for your makeup removal needs and you will not regret it! Cassandra Bankson Sent Me
