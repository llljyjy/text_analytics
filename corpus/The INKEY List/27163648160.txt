I really enjoyed this product, especially the texture as it was easier to apply to my neck/chest than a serum. I’m giving this a low rating because the product went off/expired in under 8 months, when I had only used about half. I thought this was really unusual for this kind of formula and was super disappointed by this. The product changed colors and had an expired smell despite proper storage and being under a year old. For the price and the product quality it’s not a huge deal, but I won’t be repurchasing. Expires too quickly.
