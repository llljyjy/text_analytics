After trying this product for  3 months I feel that I can give my opinion as I received this as a complimentary gift. I had no reactions to the serum. I had no irritations and no adverse effects. It left my skin feeling  Soft and looking healthier. I was very happy with what it was doing but I know with Brett now it takes a long time to really notice a difference. I would love to keep this and my skin care routine and see how it does throughout the Winter. Adding into my routine
