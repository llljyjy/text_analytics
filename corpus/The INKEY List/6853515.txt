I really dislike this product. Oily. Separates in the tube so when you squeeze it you get just oil. Hard to squeeze out enough at a time because of the way it is packaged. Doesn’t really remove eye makeup, which is the main point of a cleansing balm. I just don’t like it. Will never buy this or recommend it. Worst cleansing balm
