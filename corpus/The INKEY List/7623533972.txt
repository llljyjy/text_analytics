After using this serum for about a month, I can tell the results on my face. I use it in the morning and before going to bed and it has worked great on my dark spots. I don’t have many though and aren’t as severe, so I can’t tell how well it can work on much serious conditions but I think that if you give it enough time and use it daily, you can achieve your goal. You need to commit to it
