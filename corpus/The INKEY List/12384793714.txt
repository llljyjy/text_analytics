Iâ€™ve probably spent hundreds on scar gels and scar creams but none of them have worked as well as this one. Saw a major difference in my acne spots within a month. I recommend taking a bit on your finger and dabbing it on to the scar instead of just putting it on the scar. This is also really good to put on healing spots because it reduces the pigment of the spot later on. On my second tube and will continue to purchase. try it!!
