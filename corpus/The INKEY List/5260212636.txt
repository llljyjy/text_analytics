Great moisturizer. Does what itâ€™s supposed to do. Giving it 4 stars only because it makes me a little too oily by the end of the day compared to other products I have previously used. Mostly use at night do to such, it is winter right now, so my skin is a little more oily to begin with. Overall, great product for a great price, hopefully your skin type takes to it well. nan
