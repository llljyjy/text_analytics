Hi Everyone! You guys look gorgeous inside and out! Just wanted to say that I absolutely fell in love with this moisturizer after first use. It immediately got rid of the dryness the next day. And one week using this moisturizer I’ve been seeing that my skin tone was getting a little darker than before. I have olive skin tone. Before using this I was using Cerave, la roche posay, avene, and Dr Jart and all of these products made my skin pale. I have many experience with different skin care products and I got to say this is the best moisturizer I’ve seen so far! I just use oil face cleanser and this moisturizer. Thank you so much! Have a wonderful day! Definitely recommend you gorgeous people trying this and it’s inexpensive which I really like! This last me for three months! nan
