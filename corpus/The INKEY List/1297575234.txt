I bought this last year and I have repurchased. It sits well under makeup and I haven’t had any issue with it drying out my under eyes, but the skin under my eyes isn’t all that dry in the first place. I think it reduces the puffiness under my eyes somewhat and that’s enough for me, considering the price point. It does say to moisturize along with this product, so I try to remember to do that as well, and I use a moisturizing eye cream at night. I would recommend giving it a shot. A Bargain!
