I received this product complimentary from Influenster and The Inkey List for my honest review. I have used niacinamide before, but I love In Key’s because of its high 20% concentration and it’s a lightweight serum that absorbs quickly into your skin. If you have combo to oily, textured skin like mine (thanks to teen acne and hormonal skin). I applied this serum AM & PM daily for 3 weeks and results include reduced redness, blotchiness, inflammation and minimized pores by keeping skin smooth, soft matte and moisturized. Be advised results are slow and steady with daily application so don’t expect rapid results but it’s gentle and non-irritating! I also recommend this serum for their transparency in the % of active ingredients. Slow & steady but effective, gentle for oily/acne
