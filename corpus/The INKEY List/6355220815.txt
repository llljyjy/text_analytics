I recently got this because I was on a medication that made my chin break out horribly. After one night I already saw much calmer breakouts without the drying effect I normally get from acne products. Does this product smell? Yes. But the people complaining obviously didnâ€™t understand this has sulphur in it. Highly effective, but smells. nan
