Very oily and hard to wash off. I have to cleanse my face really well with another cleanser after using this because it leaves a very stubborn, greasy film behind. It removes makeup okayyy but it is not the best with mascara. The packaging is also not practical because you have to unscrew the lid instead of popping it open quickly. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin or anything which is good because I have sensitive skin which is why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 Not Good
