I have oily, acne prone skin and have been using the Ordinary’s HA moisturizer for a while but figured I would give the Inkey list omega water cream moisturizer a try since I felt that the ordinary’s moisturizer wasn’t providing quite enough hydration, leaving my skin feeling slightly too dry. The omega water cream says it’s good for oily skin but it left my skin extremely shiny, more oily, and led to increased breakouts. I stopped using after a week and my skin has cleared back up and gone back to my usual amount of oiliness. I don’t recommend this for people with oily, acne prone skin. Not for oily, acne prone skin.
