Absolutely amazing!I’m allergic to hyaluronic acid and time flies really quickly, so mark when I could skip extra hydration is passed behind. In order to find anything that can replace hyaluronic acid I came across the information about polyglutamic acid. And found it in affordable variant. And I am astonished! It is so good, so hydrating and doesn’t evoke acne, hypodermics or blackheads. Especially hypodermics as it did hyaluronic acid.I’m using it pairing with omega water cream or Multi-biotic also by inkey list. It definitely worth trying! And it is my third bottle. Absolutely in love! For me it replaces hyaluronic acid perfectly
