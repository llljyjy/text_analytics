I love that it has clean ingredients and no artificial scents (no scented skincare for me, thank you very much!). The Peat does give a dirt-like smell which does not linger and doesn’t bother me (if you’ve ever tried Mother Dirt products, it is similar to that smell). I thought maybe the Peat would have a gritty feeling but not at all actually- its very smooth and gentle,  and minimally foaming. I got this to replace my regular gentle drugstore ceramide cleanser and think the mini will last me a long time. It does leave the skin a little dry feeling but also gives a nice clean feeling so make sure to moisturize well after using. I’ve noticed brighter skin after just a few days of AM and PM use, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. It is a little more expensive than my previous drug store cleanser, and I plan to get the full size next time as it is better value per oz than the mini. The full size is still $1 more per oz than my previous drugstore cleanser but it is worth it for the clean feeling and gentle exfoliation. Once again a hit from The Inky List
