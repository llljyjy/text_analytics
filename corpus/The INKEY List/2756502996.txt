Great Stuff!! I have nothing but great things to say about this product. I will say I was very leary about the need for spf while using it. I use SPF daily regardless, as I have sensitive skin. I have had no irritation or anything of the sort using it alone or in combo with an SPF. The claims of the Mandelic Acid Treatment are completely true from my experience. Itâ€™s brown girl friendly!!  My only complaint is that I wish I had access to this during my teenage years! I recommend this product. Gold In A Tube!!
