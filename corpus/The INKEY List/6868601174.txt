I wanted to love this but after a few months and a whole tube, I can say this did not work for me. Specifically I feel like it created a thick layer over my pimple and made it so the pimples would never come to the surface so it just lingered for up to a week+, large and painful. I’ll stick to pimple patches (even though they’re wasteful) for now until I find a better spot treatment nan
