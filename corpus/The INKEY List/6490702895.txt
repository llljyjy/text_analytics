I personally love this moisturizer. For me (personally and again in my opinion) has done wonders for my skin and has given it the moisture it needs while being light weight and not too heavy or thick. I have oily skin and a few small wrinkles on my forehead, I’m still watching for a difference since it’s been a week I’ve had this. But I will say that I love it. Of course not everyone’s skin is the same and like I said this is my opinion but I love it!! nan
