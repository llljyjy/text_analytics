Meh. Cheap, but my skin has looked worse since I began using it (red, breaking out, etc). The moisturizing effects also faded quickly, and my dry skin became noticeable again only a few hours after applying. The one I bought did come in a jar with an interesting pump feature that I liked and wish more products used. nan
