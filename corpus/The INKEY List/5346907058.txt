I was excited to try this moisturizer as it claims to be lightweight but hydrating yet help with oil control. I am pretty oily overall, so keep that in mind but my god this makes your face SHINY! Like I was embarrassed of how greasy my face looked when wearing this under makeup. Itâ€™s not a horrible product and I will use it up but only use it at night and even then, I prefer something rich at night. So...meh. Beware of the shine!
