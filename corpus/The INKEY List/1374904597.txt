Love this moisturizer! My skin is oily and prone to breakouts, and this formula is perfect. It’s light and sinks into the skin, but very moisturizing. It leaves my skin is so smooth, and looks great under makeup. I haven’t used it long enough to know if the peptides are making a difference, but this is a great budget moisturizer. Great budget moisturizer
