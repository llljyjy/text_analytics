I have used this product for years. I have a skin care routine for morning and night. I prefer to use this at night. It’s great for sensitive skin, incredibly moisturizing, and it dries down quickly. I will say this; be careful not to overload your skin with hyaluronic acid. If you have other steps in your routine which also contain the ingredient, you can end up using too much, which will disrupt your skins barrier. A staple in a routine, but don’t use too much
