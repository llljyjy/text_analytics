I was looking for a moisturizing cleanser for the winter so I tried this. I donâ€™t usually have issues with my pores, but I noticed that after using this for a while, my pores became more visible due to being clogged up. I had to use my clay mask a few times and a better cleanser, and my pores were back to normal. Doesn't Feel Clean
