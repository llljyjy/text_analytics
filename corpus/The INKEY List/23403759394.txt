Powerful. Clears bumps and pores. More so than PC BHA 2%, imho. I limit use T-Zone and I often rinse it off depending on my skinâ€™s condition . With a pad or towel you can swipe flakes. A hydrating version would be a blessing, perhaps with Squalane.   I took one star off because the product could be more hydrating and  because it could use a tad more product volume. MIGHTY.
