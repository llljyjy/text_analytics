Works fine for a no makeup day or just complexion products kinda day. I wouldn’t recommend for use on the eyes or for eye makeup removal. Unlike other cleansing balms I use, this doesn’t melt down to a thinner oil when warmed up in my hands, it stays quite thick resulting in more tugging and pulling of my skin trying to distribute the product. Also has a bit of grittiness to it, not completely smooth nan
