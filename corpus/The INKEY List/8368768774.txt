Dissappointed with this one. First Inkley product and it really didnt do much for me at all. I much prefer the Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench. I see a few comments mentioning using it on the body - will try that. 60 day period passed so I couldnt return but $8 for glorified water is taking a hit on my conscious Watery doesnt work
