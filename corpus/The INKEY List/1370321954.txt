I really like this as it’s thin and absorbed quickly and blended well with my other serums and moisturizer. My only issue is that I broke out around my eyes. After 3 days of not putting around my eyes the break out went away. I have sensitive skin and normally it would have affected my whole face but with the eye area being most sensitive only affected that area. I’ll still use it but not around my eyes nan
