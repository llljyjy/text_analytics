Loved this cream it did not leave any greasy film or residue. my skin absorbed it right after a shower and it lasted throughout the day. I have worn it under makeup and did not have any issues with pilling or patchiness. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this has helped as a day cream. I recommend it, no redness or any irritation on my fair skin either. Must try!
