Reason for one start. Its not the item in the pictures. I literally ordered this moisturizer bc of the packaging pictured. I wanned to be able to mix it with onr of my serums. I received a completely different packaging all together and it sucks. As for the product itself.... its a moisturizer. Nothing extraordinary. Im just annoyed that I wasted my money. NOT AS PICTURED!
