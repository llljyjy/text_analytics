I loved this moisturizer! So hydrating and simple and made my skin feel silky smooth, but the new packaging is terrible! I loved the old pump pot packaging. This tube is half full and I feel like if your going to switch to cheaper packaging they could at least make the product cheaper too. I will no longer be purchasing this product. I tried to get past it but I just canâ€™t. New Packaging is TRASH!
