I have very sensitive skin and wanted to start using a gentle retinol to start with like this one. This is not irritating my skin so I’m happy with the formula. The 3 stars are because of the packaging. Trying to get out a pea size amount is almost impossible. I have tried everything and still way too much comes out. I am a person that does not waste ANYTHING so personally for me it’s a deal breaker. I will be finding another brand of retinol when I’m finished with this which is a shame because I like this product Deal breaker for me
