I just started using this and I really like it! Nice thicker lotion, or watery cream consistency. Not to thick and moisturizer pretty good! Plus it’s a great price for a good quality product! Only 4 stars because I’ve only used it a few times, I will try to update my review after a couple months of usage. Just started using and I really like it!!
