i like that it’s gentle and very affordable but honestly it feels awful :/ with other balms you can feel the makeup / residue of the day melting off but with this product it feels like it just mixes with what’s on your face and then stays on your skin no matter how hard you scrub. Definitely only tolerable if you double cleanse because that second product will actually make your skin feel clean, I can’t imagine just using this to cleanse. Cheap is great but sometimes it’s worth it to spend more. I’m using this until my glow recipe papaya sorbet balm arrives gentle & affordable but doesn't feel great
