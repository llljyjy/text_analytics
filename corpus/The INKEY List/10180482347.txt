I bought this moisturizer in August, right before the temperature dropped and the air became dry. Between my period (my skin get’s very dry on my period) and the winter, this moisturizer had a really hard time keeping up. After using it, patches of my skin we’re still tight and even burned as a result of how dry my skin is. During the summer, I think this would be a good light cream. During the winter, it couldn’t keep up for me. Good for Summer skin, not Canadian winters
