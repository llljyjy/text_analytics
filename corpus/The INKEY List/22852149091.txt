Within a week of using this I could already see a reduction in the fine lines in my face. I was a little worried because retinol can be such a strong ingredient but when I use Niacinamide before the retinol it works perfectly. I recommend this product to all of my friends whether they are in their 20s or 50s. Amazing product
