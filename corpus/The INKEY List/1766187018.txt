I like it. After a month of daily use, I feel like my pores definitely look smaller/smoother. It’s really good under makeup too as it controls oil pretty descently. I took a star off for the packaging. The product builds up around the cap every time I use it and it looks gross. It’s also a waste of product. A squeeze tube would be better. If I buy it again I’ll transfer it to a glass dropper bottle. Good product, Bad packaging
