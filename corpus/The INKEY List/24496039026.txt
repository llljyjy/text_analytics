Decent acne spot treatment. I find myself having to dot the blemishes multiple times a day to get it to begin to work on the acne spots. It also is a green color which means you have to wipe it off before going out (and it leaves a visible green spot when it dries even).Points for reasonable cost and effectiveness. nan
