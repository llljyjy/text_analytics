I’ve used other spot treatments but this one is magical. Most of the time after using, my pimples calm down overnight. From pussing to barely there. This is also not as drying as some other spot treatments I’ve tried. There is a slight sulfur smell but it’s pretty easy to ignore, especially since this treatment is so amazing! Magical
