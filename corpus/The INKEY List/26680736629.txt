I use panoxyl face wash and HA is not enough to keep my skin hydrated after, so I started using this and I instantly Loved it. Then I started mixing it into my foundation and loved it EVEN MORE. So so so good. It gives any foundation a radiant finish, literally ELIMINATED cakiness, dry patches that would develop mid-day on my skin, and makes your skin so smooth. I also noticed after I applied this on my skin it almost makes my skin poreless due to its consistency, which makes it an even better makeup base. If you’re debating this buy it and if you don’t like it send it to me because I LOVE. soft glowy skin with and without foundation
