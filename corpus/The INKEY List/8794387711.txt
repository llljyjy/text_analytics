Got the job done I suppose but wouldn’t be worth purchasing again imo. It was slightly gritty, the packaging made it extremely hard to squeeze out, it smells a little funny, and I needed more than I normally would to get a good clean. Just wasn’t really enjoyable though it didn’t make my eyes blurry like other cleansing balms do. Not what I was expecting
