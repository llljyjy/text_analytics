I had high hopes for this product considering I have oily acne prone skin, however, this product made me break out in places that I donâ€™t normally have pimples in. My neck for example, after a month and a half of using this product has completely broken out. Prior to this, my entire chin area broke out however when I saw that clearing up I thought the product was just purging and that my skin was now going to look better than before. Unfortunately, it just led me to break down in other areas so instead of continuing further use, I decided to cut it out of my routine. It has only been a day so I cannot tell if this was the main cause of my breakouts although I am certain it is. nan
