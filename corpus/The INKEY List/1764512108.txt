I’ve tried many eye creams and this one is my latest purchase.I have been using it for a little over a month and did notice that my fine lines reduced in size.  The makeup application of my concealer is also smoother.I do apply it only at night.  I take about a pea-size amount, even smaller, and it is enough to apply it around my eyes, the 11s, some frown lines on my forehead and the lines that are near the nose & mouth.  Afterwards, I apply my Tarte Drink of H2O moisturizer.  My skin can tolerate retinol & hyaluronic acid together. But if you are new to using retinol, do not mix it with hyaluronic acid as it can cause irritation to the skin.Also, please do not forget to apply SPF when using this product as it can have an adverse effect with the sun’s rays and cause irritability. I went away to the south for one week and stopped using it a week before my departure date.So far, I’m very pleased with this product and will intend to repurchase once this tube is used up. Give it a shot!
