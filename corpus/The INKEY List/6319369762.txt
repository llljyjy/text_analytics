Puffiness isn’t my main issue, but I didn’t feel like this didn’t do anything for me. Couldn’t tell if it took down my typical morning under eye puffiness or it just naturally went away as the day went on, so the effect wasn’t significant. And it’s not ultra hydrating either, so I’m just not getting enough out of it to make it worth repurchasing. Overall, if your problem is dark circles, this won’t help you, but it might help puffiness a little. At least it’s so affordable I don’t feel bad about giving it a chance! Meh.
