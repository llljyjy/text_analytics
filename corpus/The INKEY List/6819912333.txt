For context, I have super dry skin that gets easily irritated and red. Sometimes it’s red when I wake up but also can get red throughout the day. I have been using this every other day for a month and maybe some days it works a bit but it doesn’t have a lasting effect where it helps my redness throughout the day. Not the worst product but just wouldn’t repurchase, I have tried the Tower 28 spray which is more expensive but really does what I wanted this product to do. nan
