Love this stuff. I use it to wash off my makeup in the shower on my damp skin. It takes off my extravagant makeup looks so easily, even if I’m using strong pigments.I also like that you can rinse the balm off. With other cleansing balms I’ve tried, you need to use a cloth to completely remove it all.I follow up with my stronger cleanser after this and my skin feels so clean!Also really love that it’s in a tube compared to other cleansing balms that are in a container that can easily collect bacteria.Plus the price point? Literally, what is not to love! Perfect cleansing balm for makeup artists
