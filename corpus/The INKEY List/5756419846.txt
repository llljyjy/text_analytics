I am an avid inkey list user so I wanted to like this eye cream so much, but it was a huge disappointment. After using it for a week and a half, I started to notice my skin stinging after use, and it seems to be getting worse. Also, I love the metal head as it’s nice and cold in the morning, but the cream doesn’t absorb well after applying so I end up having to use my finger to pat it in anyways. And while I’ve only used it for about 2.5 weeks there’s been no difference in under eye brightness, if anything they’re worse than when I started. Super disappointing Makes my skin sting
