I know the name says anti-aging but retinol was connected to acne initially so I decided to give it a shot as someone who has had hormonal acne for over 5 years. Most topical products will not get rid of your acne, especially for me when it is the hormones controlling what pops up but I have enjoyed this a lot for overall smoothness and evenness of my skin. I purchased this in April 2022 and used it everyday for 2 weeks, I thought the percentage in here must be low and I’ve been using strong products for years but I definitely could not use this daily. By the 3rd week, my skin felt raw and there were bumps to show the irritation of using this daily so from April until November I used this 2-3 time weekly skipping days and that worked for me. This lasted super long and I am overall happy with the results. It helped the most with toning down acne irritation and really decreasing the size and redness of the pimples that come out here and there. I also haven’t seen one single blackhead on my nose since April so it definitely works. I’m in my late 20s so I don’t have extremely pronounced wrinkles, but I did use this on my neck and around my eyes and it didn’t help with those wrinkles so not sure how drastic the age effects really are. Great product
