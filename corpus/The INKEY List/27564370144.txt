I am not going to lie, this isn’t my favorite product. The price is amazing but the product itself is meh. I didn’t feel much improvement with my skin. I wish the packaging was different. I prefer a dropper because it helps me control how much product I put on my hands (I can be a little to heavy handed when getting product out of the bottle). It does give hydration but I feel like I needed more hydration than what it gives. Overall it’s not the worst, but I have tried better. nan
