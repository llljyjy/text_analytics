Literally can’t get enough! You do have to use it everyday for a few months to get results, have used at least three bottles so around seven months and definitely noticed results. I’ve very pale so my under eyes are typically dark but now I don’t feel the need to wear makeup all the time. My dark circles aren’t entirely gone, I don’t believe anything can truly do that, but they are much  much lighter. Dark circles lightened up!
