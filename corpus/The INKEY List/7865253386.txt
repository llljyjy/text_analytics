I am not loving this product. I think there are better affordable options that remove makeup better. My face feels greasy after using this and it does not rinse off well. If you use this product you have to be willing to use another cleanser after this. I have to use micellar water in addition to this just to remove my waterproof mascara. I think it removes face makeup okay but again I think there are better options. Not the best...
