I was using farmacy’s filling good and almost running out, i saw this and it seemed comparable but a lot cheaper!.  I have tried inkey list eye creams before and liked them and this is nice, it’s very light and liquidity.  It’s really good to use for layering. I don’t find it very moisturizing on it’s own so top with a moisturizer. I do have a  oily combo skin type and do find filling good maybe a bit too heavy and this just right, it sinks in fast.  I feel my skin does look more smoother and bouncy. It’s so cheap but really does deliver. Great for the price.
