This is a decent cleanser, for the price and quality you can’t really go wrong. It has helped me and my acne but not as much as I expected but that’s more a me and my skin issue. My brother with puberty-related acne uses it and it helps him out a lot and has cleared a lot of his acne. I don’t think this product will work for everyone but for the price its definitely worth a try! Decent, basic, works well
