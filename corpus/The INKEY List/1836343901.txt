After using retinol on my acne for so long, my oily skin turned into dry and flaky kind. And I was always searching for a moisturizer that locks in the hydration for whole day and then I bought this moisturizer. This is one of the best thick moisturizer and it sinks into the skin perfectly and lasts all day long. I would recommend this only if you are normal to dry/very dry HOLY GRAIL FOR MY DRY SKIN
