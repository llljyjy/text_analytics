This moisturizer is amazing! Got my husband onto it now and he’s obsessed. We have different skin types as well, I’m combo, he’s oily and we both love it. Not too thick, not greasy, sinks right in and moisturizes. The packaging on this has changed though. Regular squeeze tube now. Much preferred the airless pump as shown in the photo still where all the product could be used up. Now you’ll have to cut the tube to get to it. Great product, blah packaging
