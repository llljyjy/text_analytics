It removes makeup, even waterproof mascara,  but does not feel like the luxurious balm it claims to be. I have used a few other oil based balms to remove makeup and have not had the same issues as this one. It is very thick and hard to get out of the tube. It does not easily spread on the skin and I feel like I am tugging at my face trying to remove my makeup. I use my makeup eraser to remove the balm and clean up under the eyes and it also feels like it is tugging as I swipe the makeup eraser over my skin. It also leaves a greasy film where applied. I cannot seem to wash it off completely, even after using a wet makeup eraser and micellar water. Overall not my favorite and would not purchase again. Meh
