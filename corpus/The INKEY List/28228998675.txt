i LOVE this and LOVE the price even more. so nourishing. it does leave a film on your skin but it’s a cleansing balm so for the first step in your double cleanse it doesn’t matter! takes off everything really well. on the back of the package it suggests leaving it on for ten minutes as a nourishing face mask and i also love it so much for that, too. yes yes yes yes yes! yes!!!!!!!!!!
