This serum in combination with the INKEY  list hyaluronic acid serum and my Tretinoin Rx have reduced my forehead wrinkles by 70% in a matter of weeks. They’re almost unnoticeable. I was already using the Tretinoin for six months before using INKEY list so I know it’s the INKEY list products really making the difference. I was considering getting Botox but now have 0 desire for Botox after the results of the combination of the three products mentioned above. My holy trinity for wrinkles. wrinkle reduction
