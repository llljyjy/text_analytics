Very excited to use this retinol, it is the first product I have used from the brand and the first thing I noticed is how cheap it is and I loved the results. I had already used some other brands and I no longer felt the difference, when I started using it I put it at night one day if not another to see how my skin felt and it went very well my skin absorbed it very quickly I began to notice how my skin looked more radiant and with the acne marks it attenuates them with the use in I can’t comment on the wrinkle issue because I’ve only been using it for a month but I did feel a change in the skin texture and for the price it’s a super option excellent option
