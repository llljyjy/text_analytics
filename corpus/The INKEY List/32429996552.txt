I’ve seen so many good reviews about this stuff and I really wanted to try a cleansing balm. Because it’s supposed to be better for your skin than normal cleansing washes.  This one’s affordable and has great reviews. When I got it, I was super excited. when it comes out it’s almost like a Vaseline weird smell. which it’s not bad I still wanted to try it put it on my face follow the directions could not get it off like it took me forever to get this stuff off my face and then it left some behind and it says to get it all off I don’t know if I like it honestly.  I’ve only used it a couple times so far not that thrilled I don’t know what benefits it’s supposed to have for my skin I didn’t notice anything different my skin still felt dry if anybody has any details or something I’m not doing right you can let me know. not too impressed yet
