Very disappointed in this product. I don’t like spending a lot on a cleanser and I prefer simple cleansers with simple ingredients. I thought  This oat balm from the inkey list would be perfect for me! Boy was I wrong…  product separated within a week…and if a product separated…I throw it out because well…something has clearly gone wrong. Don’t waste your money. Buy yourself a ice coffee instead. Separated almost immediately
