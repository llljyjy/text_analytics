I don’t like this, at all. The packaging was an issue - the top of the tube split, so product was squeezing out the top. The product is not evenly mixed, and sometimes you get a balm, and sometimes you just get oil. It does a terrible job at removing makeup, and leaves a film on the skin. It can’t be used alone, it has to be used as part of a double cleanse to get the film (and any remaining makeup) off. Terrible
