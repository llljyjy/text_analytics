At the very beginning I applied this moisturizer right after washing my face, and I used a little more than I should have, because my skin couldn’t absorb it. lol I should’ve read the directions on how to use this product. A little bit goes a long way, so literally use a small amount. Works well with my OILY skin. Not bad for a $10 moisturizer. Will I buy this again? SURE!! #LoveIt nan
