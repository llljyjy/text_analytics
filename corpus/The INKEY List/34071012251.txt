I used regularly for a week and noticed no difference in oil production.  I was just as greasy/oily as if I never applied it.  Could also have to do with a sunscreen that I was also trying during the day (I used the Niacinamide serum at night) that was absolutely awful.  I would give it another fair try; canâ€™t beat the price. Would try again
