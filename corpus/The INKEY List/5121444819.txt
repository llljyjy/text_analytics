I received this product for free from Influenster and The Inkey List in exchange fory honest review. After using this product over a 2 week period with my face washing routine in the morning and at night I noticed that while I liked the way it went on my skin not heavy or sticky and with no scent but my skin did not take to it. I felt like it had the opposite effect on my pores which I always thought in certain areas were large but they seemed to get larger and I started getting breakouts which rarely happens. I will say that it seemed to balance my oily areas but that pro didnâ€™t outweigh the cons of my skin breaking out. I made the decision to discontinue using the product and have already noticed my skin starting to clear up. Not a good fit
