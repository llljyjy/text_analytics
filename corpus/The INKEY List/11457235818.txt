This product is great for the price. It removes all of my makeup easily and it does it’s job. However, when compared to Farmacy’s cleansing balm, this product doesn’t melt as easily into the skin and it’s a little harder to work with. The consistency of the product can also change depending on where you store it. Decent for price and does the job!
