I received this product from Influencer for free to try out. It’s alright I guess, probably not something I’d buy again. It doesn’t really foam up much like I’d like it to. It smells ok, left my face feeling alright, not super soft but not all dried out either. Cleans well enough but nothing special. It's alright
