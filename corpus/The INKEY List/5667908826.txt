I canâ€™t believe how well this works. I use it as a preventative measure because I  have noticed dark circles around my eyes and when I smile I can see crows feet starting  to form and what they will look like in years to come. Ive used this twice and this completely smoothes out my under eye lid, no smile lines or dark circles. In the past I used the Kiehls Retinol serum under my eyes which also did this but its much more expensive. Glad I found this. Ive had retinol burn a few times so Im careful with what I use and I had no irritation with this product. I am exicted to see how this affects my skin two months from now. nan
