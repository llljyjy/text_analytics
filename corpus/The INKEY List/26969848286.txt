I think this is the perfect cleanser for textured skin and pore relief. After one wash at night, the next morning my skin already looked smoother. After a week my skin has a different feel to it and most of the small texture bumps around my eyebrows and nose have really reduced. I thought the amount of product would be an issue but itâ€™s more than I thought it would be and I really like it so far. Love this product
