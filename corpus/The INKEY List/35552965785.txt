i’ve been using this product for a while now, and it’s really helped my skin! it works fast tbh. i use it as a spot treatment, but i also use it as an overall treatment across my face every few nights or before a big event to prevent new acne from coming. it helps get rid of redness as well when my skin is irritated. i have dry acne prone skin love sm
