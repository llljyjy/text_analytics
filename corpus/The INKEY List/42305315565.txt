I hated this moisturizer. I have sensitive and skin along with rosacea so the Inkey List chat person recommended me this. It caused a burning sensation when applied, dried my skin out, and peeled horribly. It was so gross when it peeled. You could see the product peeling and it looked like my skin. At first I thought another product in my routine caused it to do this so I applied only this after washing my face and it still burned and peeled. I don’t think this moisturizer is good for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. Maybe for oily skin since it dried my skin out but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. It was a horrible experience all around. It also smelt bad. Which I could ignore but the product sucked in general so I feel inclined to say something. Horrible for sensitive skin
