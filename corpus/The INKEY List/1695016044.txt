I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I have mixed feelings about this product. After reading reviews for other products by this company I was very hopeful this would help my postpartum skin issues clear up. I thought for a while my flare up may be my skin purging, but now I am less sure. Not a harsh product and I like that it doesn’t smell chemically.  I’m just not sure it’s the product for me. I wanted to love this!
