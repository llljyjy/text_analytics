This is a great cleanser. Not only does it leave my face feeling clean, it is surprisingly not that stripping - which I would have expected for a salicylic acid cleanser. The ingredients are fantastic. While this is not as effective as a spot treatment (which is to be expected), it keeps my breakouts to a minimum. When I use this, my acne heals quicker when I use spot treatment with it. Just overall nice for my combo skin. Price point is great! Great for combination skin, amazing ingredients!
