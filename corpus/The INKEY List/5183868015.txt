I can see someone who is extremely sensitive or even on the drier side enjoying this, but it doesn’t do anything in terms of oil absorption for the oily-skinned guys and gals.  It doesn’t set or dry like your typical clay mask.  Although it is more expensive, the Innisfree volcanic mask is a gentler option that refines the skin texture and reduces excess sebum.  Would definitely skip this one from The Inkey List. nan
