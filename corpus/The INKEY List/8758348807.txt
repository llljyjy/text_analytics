Okay, let’s start this off my saying that anyone that gives this a bad review doesn’t know how to properly use it. Since this is oil based it should be used as the first cleanse of a double cleansing routine, followed by a water based cleanser afterwards. It’s purpose is to clean all, makeup/dirt/sweat off your face before you go in with the water based cleanser to deeply cleanse the skin. Makes for a more thoroughly clean face. Of course its going to make your face feel greasy if you use it alone, it’s oil based! This is the absolute best cleaning balm/ first cleanse I’ve ever tried. It takes my makeup off effortlessly and helps to keep my moisture barrier healthy. I have combination, acne prone skin and this has helped me deeply clean my skin to keep it clear (one of the only cleansing balms I’ve found that is acne safe, I’ve researched the ingredients myself and it contains no pore cloggers). This is good for all skin types, dry, combo, normal, acne prone, oily. Don’t t let anyone tell you that you shouldn’t use this just because you have oily or acne prone skin, in fact you might benefit the most from it! Just make sure you use it properly like I explained above. The only reason why I didn’t give this the full 5 stars is because of how little product comes in a large bottle. It comes quite literally half empty. I only use this at night and one bottle barely lasts me a month. I would really appreciate if they would start filling the bottle all the way full or at least charge less for it. It wastes a lot of my money and plastic having to buy a new half empty bottle every 3 weeks. SO GOOD BUT PLEASE FILL THE BOTTLE MORE!!
