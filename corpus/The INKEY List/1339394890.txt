I did notice a difference from using this serum with a small bit of redness that I was dealing with - especially on my eyes and cheeks. I think this is a good treatment when you have redness but not an everyday serum. The product is a bit drying so I didnâ€™t use it daily (went for 3x a week). Good product to try if you have a lot of redness or scarring. Noticeable Redness Relief
