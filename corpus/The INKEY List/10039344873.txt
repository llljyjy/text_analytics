I purchased this product because I was looking for a higher concentrated glycolic acid. I made a mist spray out of it with pineapple and papaya extract for extra natural exfoliation.  I love this product because it has helped to reduce my ingrown hair and razor bumps in less than a week. I also use this as a natural deodorant as it helps to kill the bacteria that causes body odor. Lastly, I use this on my face as a toner. It cleared up my clogged pores and brightened my skin tone. I like this brand because it doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue on my skin when I use it. The only thing is, I wish that they had a larger version of this because I use it pretty often. For multipurpose use
