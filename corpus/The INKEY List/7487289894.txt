i didn’t think a product could surprise me given how many i’ve tried and abandoned, but in less than two weeks the difference i’ve seen with this product is incredible. i’m 50, with relatively light creasing at the corners of my eyes, and it’s reduced the lines dramatically. i’ve had no irritation or peeling either and i use it nightly. i do put a regular eye cream over top once it absorbs. highly recommend. Incredible
