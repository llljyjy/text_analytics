After using this product for weeks, I saw a change in the texture of my skin and my discoloration had lightened. This is definitely a product where less is more! I almost only used once or twice a week so my skin wouldn’t have reverse effects. Oh, you should listen to me because I’m in my thirties & don’t look a day over 25🙋🏽‍♀️ Not bad at all
