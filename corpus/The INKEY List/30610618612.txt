Excellent product. I was on the hunt for a simple affordable ha serum since my moisturizer and the makeup i use already have a small percentage in them. I was an avid user of The Ordinary ha but decided to try this for a change. Glad i made the switch. This is easily absorbed, doesnt feel sticky, my skin feels hydrated and smooth, make up applies beautifully after. Great product
