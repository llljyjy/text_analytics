I liked this cleanser enough to purchase again. It doesn’t leave my skin overly dry and removes my makeup well. It’s perfect for my combo, sometimes oily skin. I wouldn’t recommend it for drier skins. I really like the container because it allows me to get every last drop of product out without wasting it. It doesn’t have much of a scent which is good but also doesn’t smell so amazing that it makes me look forward to washing my face with it. It foams nicely. The price point is amazing for the size. I would definitely recommend trying it. 100% Satisfactory
