This broke me out, I’ve been using it on my back and my skin is purging... but I guess it’s a signal it’s working?... I’m giving it 3 stars bc of the gel consistency, I doesn’t foam at all and.. personally I don’t like it. I recommend using it on complete dry skin, not wet bc I have the sensation that the product works better that wayAlso, since it doesn’t come with completely sealed with some kind of protection.. Part of the liquid has been spilled into its package.. It’s something that definitely has to improve for this product in particular, or these kind of bottles. mmmmmmeh, I wanted to love it.
