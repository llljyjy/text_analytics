takes off most of my makeup pretty well, i always have to go in a second time to remove all my mascara. it does leave a little bit of a cast after rinsing but face wash gets rid of it no problem. Donâ€™t love the texture, i can get other cleansing balms that i like more for the same price :/ just okay
