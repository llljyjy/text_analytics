This night treatment gel helped minimize a large red bump on my forehead overnight and some smaller ones on my cheek and chin. I haven’t had recurring problematic acne the last few months but I keep this handy to provide some relief to occasional breakouts. I’d love a smaller size bottle since it would take me a while to use this up. nan
