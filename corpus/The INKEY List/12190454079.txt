I really enjoyed the texture of this cream. It’s lightweight but adds a nice hydrating layer to the skin for the next product. It also feels very clean on my skin. With that being said this cream alone isn’t enough for my dry skin. Definitely recommend this cream for oily skin people or a summer moisturizer. The texture! (:
