Before I switched to products reccommended by my esthitician I used this religiously in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. When I run out of those products I always come back to this. Itâ€™s an excellent hydrator and plays well with other products used to treat various skin conditions. I have oily acne prone skin, so I always need hydrators to pair with exfoliants and other actives. I also love this for prepping skin before makeup. Half of an Excellent Hydrating Duo
