I’ve been wanting a Vitamin C product (or any other antioxidant product) in an airtight container to keep the product was degrading over time.  It’s amazing how many antioxidant products aren’t packaged this way.  It’s a real problem because then you pay for product you can’t use -- because it oxidizes.  Not only was this packaged appropriately, but it works.  It really works!  my skin is literally brighter with a sun-kissed glow.  It’s easy to apply.  AND, the price is great.  Keep up the good work!!!  What a smart product.  We need more of this sort of marriage between form and function. An antioxidant product in an airtight container!
