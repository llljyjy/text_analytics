I don’t say this about many products, but I can honestly say I hate it. It’s horrible. The very first time I tried to squeeze out some product, the entire top of the bottle burst open shooting product everywhere. The balm is too thick to rub on the skin causing you to use way too much product. I made a mess on my sink trying to rinse it off. Thought I’d have better luck using in the shower. Didn’t make a difference. Even after rinsing, it leaves a gross film on your entire face. So disappointed. Definitely skip this purchase. What a horrible product…
