Did nothing for me at the time when I used it for a few months. I began thinking it may be making my acne worse, but that could be due to other products I used at the time too. I cut it out of my routine along with other things and noticed my skin cleared up a bit more. I think you have to use this more a couple months to really see the effect, but I decided against it! It may work for others! nan
