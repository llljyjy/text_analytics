This would be great for more oily prone skin.  My skin is a lot drier now and does not benefit my skin type.  Overall Niacinamide is great to help with keep clearer skin but this particular formula does not suit me. I would recommend trying if you are oily to normal. I normally love niacinamide products. Love Niacinamide but not this formula
