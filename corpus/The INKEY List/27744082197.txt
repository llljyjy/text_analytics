I actually really like the consistency of this product itâ€™s very rich and creamy and a little goes a long way. I have been using this product for 2 weeks consistently at night along with my retinol cream and this has definitely been helping to diminish some stubborn blemishes I have had. Great product with a nice creamy feel
