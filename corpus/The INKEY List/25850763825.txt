This is the one product that has cleared my skin without drying me out! I usually use Paula’s choice BHA solution, but I find that it’s too drying for me in the winter. BUT THIS- this is the first product I’ve used that has completely cleared my skin without any drying effects! Also, not only does it help my acne, but it is great on subtle hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory marks, dark spots, and just improves entire complexion. Holy grail for dry acne prone skin
