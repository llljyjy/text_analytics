i’m not one to hype up a skincare product for “immediate results” but y’all!! i woke up this morning to hormonal acne on my cheeks, and i’ve been dealing with blackheads on my nose. i wish i took a before photo. after using this mask followed by my nightly routine, my complexion looks noticeably smoother and clearer. i have dry/combination skin (more on the dry side bc of tret) and this clay mask didn’t irritate my skin nor dry me out. i have sensitive/reactive skin and did not experience any irritation other than a slight cooling sensation when first applying, which is common for me with masks. i had no redness whatsoever after rinsing off. i will definitely begin using this product weekly as needed! effective clay mask at a great price point!!
