I have been using this product few days a week for 3 weeks and my skin does feel better in the mornings. Although I need to use it longer to see the results, this product does absorb well, the consistency is good, causes a slight tinge just like other retinol products that gives me the satisfaction that atleast this product is working! Nice for the price
