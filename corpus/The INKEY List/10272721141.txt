to start off, i’m only 18 so i can’t speak for any anti-aging effects, i mainly got this to treat acne and it‘s been working great for that. like any other retinol, you go through a purging stage with this serum. for the first 4-6 weeks, my face was breaking out and i developed dry patches on my skin but after that, WOW! i’ve had redness and small red patches (not rosacea) on my cheeks for as long as i can remember and this helped minimize it so much and i really can see a difference. i’ve been using this for 3 months and every time i use it, my skin looks so much better. when you get started using retinol, i recommended you hydrate and moisturize your face to minimize any dryness and be sure to wear spf. nan
