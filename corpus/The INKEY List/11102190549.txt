It’s smells like something I can’t put my finger on it, but it’s also a moisturizer so I think they have the same base, this product does moisten and feels good, my skin had residue all day but I’m fairy dry so it wasn’t bad but if you have a oily face I think this will clog more because it does feel like it blocks my pores. Other than that I actually like the softness it gives after use. Wash face before and between
