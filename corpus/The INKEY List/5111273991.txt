I have some redness around my nose and chin area. I received the product to try for free from Influenster and the inkey list. I definitely saw a reduction in redness bc of this product. This is a light serum and was easy to add to my routine and I will gladly use the whole bottle. Iâ€™m not sure how the product will work if you had a lot of redness but I think it would be worth a shot. I like the inkey list bc they give you the ingredients you want in your skincare for a more affordable price. Worked for me
