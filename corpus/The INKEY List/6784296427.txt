My usual balm was discontinued, grabbed this to try. It’s like no other balm I’ve used and I’m not sure it fits the description. it’s slightly waxy and doesn’t emulsify well. Because it doesn’t emulsify, it’s hard to work with, you have to manhandle your skin much more than I’m used to, especially with waterproof eye makeup. it also doesn’t rinse cleanly. My tube separates constantly, and it’s really hard to recombine. In general you shouldn’t have to work this hard to make a product do its job. I’m glad this was budget friendly. I’ll be looking for another option. 2 stars for price and relatively simple ingredients. Not at all what I expected
