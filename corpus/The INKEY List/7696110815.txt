This cleanser removes makeup decently well but, for me, that’s where the positives end. My big issue with this is that it does NOT emulsify when you go to rinse. It leaves me with a horrible, greasy film on my face. I feel like I have to go in with my regular cleanser twice to get it off. I’ve never used an oil cleanser/balm that left me this greasy. This also has a really grainy texture even after trying to mix and shake it. I think there’s way better cleansing balms out there. nan
