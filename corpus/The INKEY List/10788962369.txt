The product is fine. But the packaging needs some work. It has a pump and half way through use it began leaking around the pump for no reason. I tried to take back and exchange it out but since past 60 days they would not exchange it..I wasnâ€™t about to take the leaking one back so I left with nothing..thumbs down for customer service at Sephora.
