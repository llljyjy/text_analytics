The product itself is neither here nor there. I don’t think it made me break out but I didn’t notice any lightening of my acne spots or any sort of extra glow to my skin. It wasn’t greasy - I’ll give it that. My real problem is the packaging. It leaks everywhere and the bottle is constantly sticky. I store my products up right too, so I know that’s not the problem. It also has an odd smell when you first apply it. It’s a bit unpleasant and almost like weed? It goes away though. The one from the ordinary is way better and cheaper. The Ordinary is Better
