Awful. Woke up with a horrible breakout the day after using it for the first time, continued using it for a week and my skin just got worse and worse. I looked like a middle schooler again. Discontinued use after a week and my skin cleared up almost immediately. Definitely would not recommend this moisturizer even though I do enjoy many other products from this brand. nan
