If you are on accutane/retin a buy this. One tube will last you for months even using twice a day. Itâ€™s a fine makeup remover but honestly too thick and greasy and leaves too much residue unless you have chronically dry skin. So for being on accutane this is the most cost efficient, wonderful thing ever. Your skin will not feel stripped or dry after using at all, if anything the residue this leaves is extremely helpful. 10/10 for chronic dry skin, would be great for bad sunburn too. amazing if you are on accutane
