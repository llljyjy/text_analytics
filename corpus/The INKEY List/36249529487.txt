For me this wasn’t a great experience. It completely dried out my skin and I understand it’s supposed to control excess oil but this product is WAY too strong. The only way this could work is if u use this then pile so much moisturizer afterwards. I have really oily skin and even this was too drying. If you buy this only use maybe 2-3 a week, not everyday. I also hate the packaging. It was leaking in my drawer and it went all over my other skincare. Every time I closed it very tight but It would still leak. nan
