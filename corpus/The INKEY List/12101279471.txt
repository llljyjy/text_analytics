I haven’t used an under eye cream for a while because they usually just irritate my skin.  I hadn’t read or heard others having irritation with this product so I tried.  It took 2- 3 applications but I am now sure this irritates my eyes- unfortunately.  I tried it a couple times because the irritation was very mild and wasn’t sure it was due to the eye cream. But, the irritation got worse and stopped after I stopped the cream. I will say it didn’t irritate my eyes as much as any other products have. Not approved for sensitive under eyes
