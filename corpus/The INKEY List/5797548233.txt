For the price, this stuff is great! Last week I had real late nights/early mornings at work and then two red eyes over the weekend. This stuff kept the dark circles  and exaggerated creases away. I knocked off a star because it’s not very hydrating. I’ve used it for a month now and have generally, otherwise, been pleased with the results. nan
