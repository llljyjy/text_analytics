I can’t decide if I love this product or not. I started using this back in October 2021 and am almost done with it now (Feb 2022). I use about one finger length of product and use it about 5 days a week. PROs-price is absolutely fantastic-tube makes dispensing easy (no need to use a spatula)-effective (currently wearing Kosas concealer, saie bronzer, milk makeup blush, NYX waterproof liquid liner, and sometimes waterproof mascara)-no residue after second cleanse(Main and only) CON-texture is inconsistent. I’ve seen many photos were the balm appears smooth, but mine isn’t. You kind of have to shake the bottle or massage it to fix the product. Otherwise, you’ll either just get oil or this grainy balm depending on how you store it. The oil can be messy and get all over the place if you weren’t expecting it when you squeezed the tube. I’ll most likely try another balm next but may come back to this for the low cost. Definitely worth giving it a try since it’s so cheap! I’m torn!
