I really had high hopes for this product. Everything I’ve tried so far from this brand has been good. I know it’s only one day and the skin has to purge. I just had a really bad reaction to this product. I woke up to more breakouts and more texture. My skin also had this allergic reaction brewing under the skin. The whole point is to help hyperpigmentation not create more issues in my skin. Perhaps it was just too strong of a formulation for me. It’s going back unfortunately. Not For Sensitive Skin IMO!
