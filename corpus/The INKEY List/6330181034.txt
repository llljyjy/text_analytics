I received this serum for free from Influenster and The Inkey List in exchange for my honest review.I kind of liked the serum first, it applied easily, but I didn’t notice that my skin would be less oily. After several days, skin on my nose started to appear dry and flaky. I stopped using the product and it returned back to normal. I don’t have big issues with acne or large pores, my skin is more on the combination side. I think this product would be helpful for more severel skin issues. nan
