As someone with oily and sometimes sensitive skin who’s picky about their products I’m telling you, YOU NEED THIS! I bought the mini one to test it out and I used it on my whole face and it took off ALL OF MY MAKE UP. I even went in with micellar water to see if there was any excess make up and there was NONE! This balm got everything in one step! I used my hands and rubbed the balm in circles and in mins all of my make up was off. I then wiped the product off with a water and proceeded with my normal skin care routine and it worked perfectly! nan
