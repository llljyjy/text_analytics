I have mild acne scars on my cheek and mandelic acid has worked wonders on those. I had an issue where makeup would cake on the scars but they’ve been smoothed out completely and are barely noticeable anymore. For the price point I’m super impressed and I would definitely get this again when I run out. worked great
