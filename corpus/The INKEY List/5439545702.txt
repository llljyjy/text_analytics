I love a good cleansing balm but this one just didn’t work for me. I wanted to love this one because it has such a good price point but there are others I love so much more.  It’s thick and leaves my skin feeling like it has a film on it. It just doesn’t make my face feel clean. I’m glad I tried it but I will not purchase this one  again. nan
