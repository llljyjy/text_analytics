This makes the skin feel so soft and plump instantly on application, and never greasy feel on the skin the whole time it’s on your skin. it lasts as long as an entire day and night - I end up needing to wash my face or hands before I can find out if this stops making my face feel moisturized after applying it.Prices for the most basic, greasy, fragrance filled or essential oil packed creams are outrageous these days even for newly launched products unless I turn to Korean or Japanese skincare brands. So I am happy this is so budget friendly & packs so much moisture in the smallest drop on the skin. For this steal of a price, I have now made it my hand moisturizer too as I hate feeling or smelling lotion on my hands when I need to grab food to eat it, or the alternative being when I need to wash my hands more frequently than ever in this day and age, and my moisturizer just comes off & it’s a waste of product. I still feel the conditioning effect on my hands if I have to wash my hands an hour after application, so I can forgive the slightly odd smell (which goes away fairly quickly) and slightly too runny formulation for the packaging, but since it’s not wasteful at all (as you can simply but through the top of the bottle to get every last drop), I’d much rather that than have to increase the price for fancier or bulkier packaging.I’ve seen some comments say this is not retinol - yes, that’s what it means by “alternative“: Skin experts are always emphasizing there is currently no better researched and effective anti-aging and photo-damage repairing ingredient than retinoic acid, as not even all retinoids are the same. And of course this is all only if you use SPF daily as directed. This is where you need to do your own research for what best suits your needs - and you can’t knock a brand for telling you the potential bakuchiol certainly does have in helping your skin in some ways certain retinoids can. Perfect lasting moisture on a budget
