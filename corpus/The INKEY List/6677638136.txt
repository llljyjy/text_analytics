I picked this up yesterday on a whim because my face has been tight, dry, and flakey around the eyes and temples. I’ve used it 3x since purchasing and it seems to be working. While it’s advertised as a gel, it’s not the typical translucent color. It visually appears creamy, but is thicker texture wise. It has no scent and does not make me feel greasy or oily. My cheeks feel more bouncy. I will be using this night and day for the next couple of weeks to rebalance my face. The fatty acids of Omega 369 is also good to restore and protect the skin barrier, which I feel is also a current issue for me. Glad it popped up when I simply searched “hydrating moisturizer”! The Inkey List also has good price points with effective products. Does what it says
