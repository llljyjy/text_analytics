This is supposed to be the first step in your cleansing routine, it’s to take off makeup and it DOES amazingly without stripping necessary natural oils! It doesn’t smell good nor bad and doesn’t sting the eyes. That’s simply the only 3 things I look for in a cleansing balm but to top it off this one is cheap with few simple ingredients. It should only have max stars but people rate it low I guess because they think it should be the only step? No, you need to follow up with a regular cleanser to get the balm off. The number one thing you need in a skincare routine is knowledge so research what the steps are and what you need before buying something and giving it one star. There is no ONE skincare product to treat your skin alone. PERFECT for those that know what it’s for
