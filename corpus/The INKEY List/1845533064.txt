I love using this new serum! I have not used much azelaic acid before but this does exactly as it claims. It did take about 2-3 weeks before I noticed a difference but it has helped my redness/rosacea significantly. There isnâ€™t any scent I can tell from this and I like you can use in addition to your favorite serums with no pilling. I like the price point for their skincare and will be buying more to keep my rosacea in check! Definitely recommend! nan
