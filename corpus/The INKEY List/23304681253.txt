This is an excellent product! I use at the end of my skin care routine in both AM and PM, and it helps seal in my moisture for the duration of the day and night. I am very breakout prone and this did not cause any breakouts! I have always struggled with very oily skin and have actually been able to scale back the number of products I use to combat this by using this product. My only two gripes are that I wish there were a larger package available, especially to reduce plastic waste, and I absolutely hate screw off tops on a bottom dispensing container; flip top would be so much better. I have repurchased several times & will definitely continue. Almost perfect
