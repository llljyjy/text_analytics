If your looking for an affordable Vitamin C serum, give this one a try. I use it in my morning routine. I wash, apply my Niacinimide and finish with lotion and spf. At this price it’s a great find. (Everyone’s skin is different so I think doing a patch test on your inside arm 24 hours prior to using it is a good idea, not everyone’s skin likes vitamin C.) For me, this works and it’s a good deal :) Great Price!
