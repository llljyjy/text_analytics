I was excited to try this out after seeing a dermatologist review this on YouTube. This however didn’t work for me. One of eyes seemed to have a hard time opening and closing. Like it drooped the lid or something. I thought it was just me but when my mum tried she also felt like something was making the eyes feel weird. I tried it after a while just to make sure it’s this and then again the next day the same eye felt weird. Made the eye feel weird
