This product is terrible. I bought it assuming that it would be a cream. It is very powdery, grainy and pills off right away. It also has that lingering metallic fishy smell, similar to soy sauce. I found that mixing it in your creams or a serum will work the best but I will NOT be buying this again. Avoid this product. Smells like Soy Sauce!
