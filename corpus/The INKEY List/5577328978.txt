My favorite cleanser ever. I’ve gone through so many bottles of this stuff. Removes makeup like a dream, and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or dry it out. Also leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. People saying that it doesn’t lather... IT’S BECAUSE IT’S A BALM. It’s not suppose to lather... YES
