When I first received this it was leaking through the box it came in, it wasn’t significant so I kept onto it. I’ve been using it for over a month now and haven’t been able to identify any extra benefits of using this vs other products I’ve used. I have a similar opinion on this as I do with the moisturizer,  the price does not match the amount that is given. I bought a bunch of INKEY list products because of the gift cards I had.... I read reviews as well.... I feel like I’ve been lead astray, from the reviews!!! lol geez. Anyway. I hope this review helps yall! nan
