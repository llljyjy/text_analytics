By far one of my favourite skincare products. I’ve suffered from acne scarring and redness for nearly 10 years and this product did wonders. It took about a month to notice a difference, so don’t give up immediately. My redness decreased enough that I stopped wearing foundation, and about 50% of my acne scarring completely disappeared. (I used it in the am every day & used the inkey list retinol 3x week at night, I think the combo is what really did the trick). This is a staple in my routine now! nan
