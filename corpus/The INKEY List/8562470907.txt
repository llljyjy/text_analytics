The INKEY List Omega Water Cream Moisturizer is a great moisturizer. I used this one time during the day time and found that this tended to leave my skin a bit more oily which I don’t mind at night but I do mind when it’s in the day time because I’m on the go and usually have no time to reapply my makeup or to blotch the oil. After the first time of use, I used at night and loved it. It left skin soft, absorbs fast, and left skin feeling very hydrated and moisturized. It lasts a while too. This is great for any skin, however if you have oily skin and don’t like the oily feeling, don’t think this would be for you. I loved it especially for those winter months when skin tends to feel more dry. This has no scent so it’s perfect for all day use and for sensitive skin. nan
