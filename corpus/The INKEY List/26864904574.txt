I couldn’t see the results until I put the pictures side by side. I have hormonal acne for a while now and my skin gets extremely oily. I went on vacation and couldn’t bring all my regiment. This is when I started using this line, and I’m pretty happy with the results. It’s not overnight, but it does work. I have a lot of actives in my routine, but this one is gentle enough to use everyday. Slow but steady results in my case
