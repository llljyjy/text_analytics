this was not the product that I want to buy originally when I went to the store the Beauty advisor told me it will do the same as the other product that I wanted. I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now,  I’m have not seeing any major change with the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  Maybe it take some time so I’ll continue using it until I see some kind of change. on the side, there are a few things that I do love about this product I  do have to admit it very light serum easy to apply on the skin. It doesn’t give me any irritation and you don’t feel when you put on sticky everywhere. nan
