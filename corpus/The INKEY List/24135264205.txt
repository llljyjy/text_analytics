I received this product for free from Influenster in return for my honest review.This product does what it’s supposed to do! I’ve been applying this product for 3 weeks now. I apply to my shiny areas. Nose and forehead. I have noticed that my nose isn’t as shiny and greasy as before. The con on this product is if you apply too much or don’t rub in long enough you’ll have white flakes that look like glue all over. Very embarrassing. I also don’t think it applies well with moisturizer. Decent product
