I’m currently regretting not taking before pictures but this spot treatment is magic. it’s the first one i’ve tried that has made a noticeable difference overnight. even with sensitive skin, it doesn’t burn and is overall super comfortable to put on. i woke up with the pimples i put it on noticeably smaller and in a few days at the very most, i think they will be completely gone. especially at this price point, the inkey list did so well and i would recommend this over some much more expensive spot treatments. nan
