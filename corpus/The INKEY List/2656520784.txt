I’m a long time tretinoin user and have had a tough time tolerating both that and most acids, because they often leaves me with angry irritated patches even if I alternate nights with the tretinoin. This toner has been great. It gently exfoliates and I don’t get any irritation. When I use this regularly my skin is super smooth. I tolerate using it after cleansing and using tretinoin at the same time. Definitely recommend. effective and non-irritating
