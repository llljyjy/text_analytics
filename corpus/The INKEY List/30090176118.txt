I received this product for free in exchange for a review. It was moisturizing, but it pilled on my skin. I have too many other holy grail moisturizers that don’t pill for me to fully enjoy this product. I do think it made my skin less oily, but I definitely can’t wear this with make up or even any other skin care products. This is okay to wear on days where you’re home by yourself however! Pills
