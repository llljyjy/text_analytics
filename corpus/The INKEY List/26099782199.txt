I haven’t notcied any difference in my dark circles since using this. Basically it’s a bit of a primer before you put on concealer but it’s not helping with puffiness long term. I was just at the dermatologist and they said the best thing for undereyes will have caffeine and Vitamin C in the ingredients. I will say the metal applicator feels nice and maybe has a cooling effect. nan
