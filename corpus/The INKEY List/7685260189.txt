Omg best makeup remover for the price!!! I wear full coverage foundation with contour, long wear liquid eyeliner, heavy mascara, etc and it all comes over super easy with this!!! I have tried many of the makeup melts at Sephora that are 3x the price and this works exactly the same and I find it’s packaging better cause it’s in the tube so it’s easier to travel with and your not dipping into a tub of product like some. I always double cleanse so I do use a cleaner after this, but I do that regardless of which makeup melt I use. For the cost and effectiveness of this product I will be buying again and again for sure!!! This is a fantastic product!!! Great Makeup Melt !!!!!!!!
