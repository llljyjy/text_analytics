I’m still not sure how this formula is able to outperform all the mega-expensive moisturizers I’ve tried throughout the years! I apply this in the morning after my hyaluronic acid serum and my skin stays soft and supple for the whole day. It seems to work well at taming oil production too - I used to have to pat my face down multiple times a day to keep from becoming too reflective but now my skin just glistens normally. nan
