I’ve become a huge fan of the Inkey List! Nearly every product I’ve used from their line has impressed me and you can’t beat the price! This product really absorbs into the skin and feels like water when you rub it in. I just wish this came in a bigger size. I would recommend this for a summer moisturizer as i could see it not being enough for a harsh winter. Overall beautiful and will repurchase and recommend to anyone who wants that glass skin look! Glass Skin in a Bottle!
