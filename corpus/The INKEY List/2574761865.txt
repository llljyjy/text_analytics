I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I use it more of an all over my acne prone area which is my lower chin area due to menopause etc. I use it after serums but before moisturizer or sunscreen. I use it in the morning and/or at night. For me I don’t use as a spot treatment per se as it’s very gentle but it prevents acne from forming as well which is why I use it all over. It also works fine under makeup which a lot of other acne spot treatments like benzoyl Prock side-based ones don’t do. pleasantly surprised
