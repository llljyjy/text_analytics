I do enjoy the Inkey list so i was expecting this product to be really great, was severely disappointed. Getting the product out of the bottle is a struggle, the formula is thick like fat and does not spread well. I found it left my skin feeling even more dirty then when i started, even when i doubled cleanse. Nothing Special
