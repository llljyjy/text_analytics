I enjoyed this product. It’s very moisturizing. I tend to have dry skin and found this to be a good base before putting on foundation. If you’re looking just for some hydration then this product will be great for you. I find that my skin needs a bit more than what this has to offer for my wrinkles. Overall I am happy with it but not raving about it. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Okay
