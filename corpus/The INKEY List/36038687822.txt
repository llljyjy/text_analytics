This cleanser is gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I will say that, when following the instructions on the bottle, I don’t like it as much; it doesn’t rinse clean on its own and leaves a film on my skin that I’m afraid will clog my pores. It also doesn’t remove my mascara and eyeliner using the method on the packaging. But what I do instead is massage it into my skin, add water and massage a little more, then use a microfiber cloth to wipe it off my face and finish removing my eye makeup. This is easier than rinsing, more fully removes my makeup, and removes the residue from the cleanser. I’m not sure yet whether I think it’s better than the other cleansing balms I’ve tried, but I do like that it isn’t strongly fragranced. Don’t follow the bottle instructions.
