I have tried a lot of moisturizers, and this one by far is my favorite. Last time I went to see an esthetician, she reviewd the products I was using and althought she said it doesn’t have anything spectacular, it is a nice and gentle moisturizer at a very good price point. I personally also love the pump style, I only wish we could see how much is left because I feel like it’s always a surprise. nan
