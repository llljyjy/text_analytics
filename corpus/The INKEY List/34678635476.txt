I loved this serum for a long time and repurchased it a few times but I started to notice that I had little bumps on my face that were not acne so I did some digging and found out there’s an ingredient in this product that might’ve caused It so I won’t be using it anymore,although when my skin barrier was damaged it helped it heal well.I recommend using it with the hyaluronic acid cleanser from the inky list,and the omega water cream from the inky list if you have inflamed breakout skin.overall 8/10 nan
