Looove her. Bought this as soon as I saw it cause I’m a big fan of mandelic acid, and I think the fact it has retinol in it is very helpful. I have super acne prone skin and get one of those painful acne dots under the skin like every 2-3 weeks (the kind that never comes to a head, takes forever to go away, and somehow still leaves hyperpigmentation even if you don’t mess with it) ANYWAYS I used this on a spot like that 2 nights in a row and literally 3rd day it was gone like it never existed in the first place, no trace left behind, which has literally never ever happened before for me.if you have sensitive skin just watch out cause it might make your skin peel. also make sure to use spf in the day!! if your skin sounds like mine try this out! nan
