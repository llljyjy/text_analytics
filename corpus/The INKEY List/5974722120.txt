4 star because considering the price for 5oz. You don’t see that often with cleansing balms. You just have to know how to use it. If you wear makeup this is an okay first cleanser to emulsify your makeup. Although not the best with waterproof mascara compared to other balms and cleansing oils. You really have to spend time working it in. Or if you have dry skin and don’t wear make up this is a good ‘cleanser’, since the oils take away sunscreen and the day but doesn’t strip your natural oils. I used this after accutane which pretty much makes it so nothing breaks me out, so idk how it is for for those who are acne-sensitive. If this were over $25 I would not rate it 4/5. Price is a big plus here. the price is right
