i decided to restock this product at first because it is super affordable, very lightweight, doesn’t stick and or pile, and i think it earned a permanent place in my daily routine. i used it over a longer time to notice how much it helped with oiliness and discoloration also, and it’s also safe on sensitive skin and makeup friendly! love it!
