I think this is a really great product. I was getting a few breakouts from wearing a mask during C19 restrictions. In addition, I usually break out around that time of the month. Incorporating this cleanser into my routine has reduced my breakouts drastically and I feel as though it has helped reduced my oily tzone. Price is obviously on point as well, and I really enjoy using a cleanser with no scent. I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there was a bit more foaming action, just personal preference. I don’t find this gets a very good lather but still works very well. Great for my combo-oily skin
