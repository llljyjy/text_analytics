I purchased this after hearing many great reviews, and because I loved how affordable this product is.  I have tried many cleansing balms, and unfortunately this is my least favorite. This product is extremely thick, which would be fine if it actually emulsified. Once you put this on, it seems impossible to get off. I had to use two different strong  foaming cleansers afterward, and even then I could still feel a film on my skin from the cleanser. The next day, I woke up with a small breakout on my cheeks. I really wanted to love this, but sadly I wonâ€™t be repurchasing. Disappointed
