This product does not live up to the hype! Immediately upon first use, the cleanser was separated in the tube, had to shake the tube to get the gel balm consistency seen in pictures. Having do this between uses got very cumbersome, often ruining the skincare experience. In addition the balm has a gritty texture to it when applied to the face, not a balm you want to message into the skin much. Furthermore, the oat balm doesnâ€™t glide well on the skin, leaving you needing quite a bit of product. The product does seem to leave a film of some type across the skin, double cleanse was necessary. Gritty slippery mess
