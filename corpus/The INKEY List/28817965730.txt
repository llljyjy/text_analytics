I’ve been using this product for about three weeks now and my face purged a little at first and now it’s back to clearing up. I had a lot of scarring on my face from acne and this is actually helping them look way better. I’m really hoping that it helps with my pores too but we’ll see. I really like the results that I’m getting so far. I’ll definitely buy another bottle to see where this journey takes me So far it works great!
