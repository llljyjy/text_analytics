Horrible cleanser. It has a weird smell (almost like cheap kid makeup smell), does not lather well, and leaves a weird film/slimy feeling on the face. My skin does not feel cleansed at all after using this product. Not sure if others with really sensitive skin would have a better experience with this product. nan
