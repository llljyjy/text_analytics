I’ve used Mandelic Acid as a serum, but this was a new experience using the treatment. It’s thicker like a cream. It’s slightly beige in color and rubs in easily. I used it at night under my night cream. I have noticed my face is clearer and the redness on my cheeks as improved. I really like this product, because it helps with my hyperpigmentation and discoloration. I’m a little sensitive to stronger AHAs like glycolic acid, so this is a very gentle AHA. I highly recommend if you cannot tolerate stronger peels or acids. Great new product!
