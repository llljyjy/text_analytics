I was looking forward to trying this because at work at Sephora Inside JCP and my coworkers recommended it along with a lot of customers buying the Inkey List products. This was a specific product that was most popular in our store. I gave it 2 stars because it didn’t take away my puffiness it gave it more of a hydrating and brighter feel. It didn’t work how it was supposed to, I recommend the Skin Fix Barrier+ Lipid-Boost Eye Treatment 360. It works wayyy better and I see a lot of differences. Very Disappointing
