I love the Inkey List, but this cleanser is not it for me. I have acne-prone skin, and whenever I use this consistently it breaks me out more. I know that’s what salicylic acid does, but I personally like the CeraVe SA Renewing cleanser much more. This one is too stripping and leaves my skin feeling “squeaky clean“ which is not something my skin enjoys. Not my favorite
