Who puts glitter in a skincare product??? Especially something that goes around your eyes! I noticed it first use but I thought maybe I hadn’t cleaned my highlighter off all the way. Even though these were red glitters and I don’t own a red highlighter. Then I get seeing it and checked the reviews and sure enough, other people have noticed the same thing. It’s a definte no for me because of that. HAS GLITTER!!!!!
