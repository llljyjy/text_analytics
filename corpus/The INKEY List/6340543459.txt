I wish I had thought to take a before picture. I purchased this as I get a lot of breakouts on my chin and jaw line. I put it pretty much everywhere, around my nose forehead, and of course the heavy breakout area. Just a thin layer. I forgot I had put it on and the next day when I looked in the mirror gad a moment of “Woah, why does my face look like this?“ There was a very noticeable blur effect, my pores were smaller, and my face much less red. This stuff is great! Results immediately! It's amazing!
