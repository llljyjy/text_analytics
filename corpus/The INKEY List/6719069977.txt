I have redness on my nose... I decided to take picture and after 15 Days of use am+pm now I am impress by the result!! See picture! Also, I have very very very sensitive skin, most inkey list product are irritating for me but not this one, I also have very dry skin and this product didn’t dryed me out... It doesn’t peel, doesn’t smell.. I can’t say that the Green color does any color correcting.. That’s why I give it 5 star ( because they claim it does..) it works!!
