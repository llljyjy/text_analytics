this stuff it pretty good! it is pretty hydrating and I like how it has ceramides, but it leaves your skin feeling sticky and tight. after I apply moisturizer it’s okay, but I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin. the only reason i bought this is because i was starting to develop redness because i wrecked my skin barrier and i saw someone say it was a dupe to the glow recipe avocado ceramide recovery serum but I really don’t think it is. the glow recipe serum helps with redness while this doesn’t. it may be similar but not a dupe. haven't seen much of a difference
