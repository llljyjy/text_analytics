I tried this out on just a section of my face first, my face definitely felt softer, but I instantly noticed little bumps on my skin where I had used the cleansing balm. Within the next hour I had broken out, what kind of product makes you break out that quickly? It went straight in the trash, I didn’t even want to give it away & put anyone through all that, especially when, after reading the reviews, others have had the same issue. You get what you pay for, that’s for sure... Made me breakout right away
