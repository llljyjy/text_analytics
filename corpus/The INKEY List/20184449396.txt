BEST BALM EVER! I was recommended this product from a client, said their makeup melted off, so I had to try. Soooo satisfied with this cleanser. I have very dry skin, so the fact that it doesn’t strip my skin like most cleansers has been so great for me, literally a golden find. To top it off, it’s SO CHEAP! I’ve shown my friends and they love it, one of the best things to get at Sephora! The consistency is paste-like, if you’re oily, I recommend going in with another cleanser after this if you’re using this for solely taking off makeup. Great product that will save you from tearing and pulling your skin with makeup wipes or harsh cleansers, that will leave you with pre-mature wrinkles, lines, etc! Everybody needs this if you wear makeup! nan
