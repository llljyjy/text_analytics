I have tried this product for the past few weeks, and I must say that it does leave my skin glow in just a bit and has relieve some of the redness that I encounter throughout the day. I have used azelaic acid from other brands and the texture of this one actually feels great. I’m going to continue using it to see how much more of this could do to my skin and I also think that it’s a must product to have in your routine. Add on Azelaic in your steps
