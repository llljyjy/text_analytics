I’ve tried a bunch of vitamin c serums and this is the best, inexpensive one I found. I’ve been using this for a few weeks and I really like it! Even after only a few days of using this I noticed my skin was much more glowy and dewy. Sometimes even a little too dewy. I started off with using this both morning and night and my skin became way too shiny so I switched to just using it in the morning. Now it gives me the perfect amount of glow and I love it. Inexpensive and works well. Use it once a day.
