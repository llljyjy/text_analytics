Pros: Scent free, long lasting, gentleCons: None!As most people who have used toners know, they can be extremely drying or can make your skin burn. I’ve tried several different kinds, and all of them absolutely wrecked my skin barrier despite using them three times a week max. This toner though? Didn’t. No burning sensation, and can be used daily. It also gives your skin a really beautiful glow. So if you’re looking for a toner that won’t burn your sensitive skin, try it out :) nan
