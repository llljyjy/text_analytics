smells gross and i hate not being able to moisturize afterwards but it works! I use the ordinary’s amino acids + b5 beforehand to hydrate my skin and it works like a dream. I use it 1-2 times a week depending on how much hyperpigmentation i have and im on my second bottle now. super affordable and doesn’t smell as bad as the topical faded treatment! i hate the smell but it works really well!
