After reading the reviews I have to admit I had slightly higher hopes for this product. But I think its important to understand your skin before you try testing out products, as everyones skin is different. I also think its important to consider your diet as well, as certain foods carry different vitamins which have skin healing properties, maybe why something works well for others and not so much for ourselves is also because their daily habits are different than theirs (my opinion at least). What I like about the product is that the price point isn’t very high so if you are looking for a product to test out this can be a potentially good one, make sure to do lots of research as once again not everything that works for someone else will work for you. Overall, it has a nice texture on the face (kind of velvety), initially applying it on my face on the affected area it can feel a little cakey and sticky but once it absorbs into the skin that feeing goes away. It doesn’t have a heavy feeling either. There also aren’t any heavy smells associated with the product which I like as well as I can be very sensitive to smells. I used this since the beginning of august 2021, and I cant say it hasn’t lightened my dark spots (from acne) at all, however I was also using other treatments as well (morning ones) and what I can say is it has reached a plateau for me at least. At that point I stopped applying it regularly as a night treatment and went to use try other products. In all honestly I think it started to plateau for me around the 1 month mark. Currently as it is just sitting there I have been applying it at night whenever I seem to see it or remember that it’s there as it would be a waste to just let it be. I cant say I don’t recommend this product because it did do what it says it would, but the effectiveness for me at least wasn’t as high as I had hoped. Maybe you can find our own personal hidden gem, I hope this helps! my experience
