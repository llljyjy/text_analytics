I used this for around three weeks and didn’t notice much of a difference in my skin. I really don’t get much acne though, just an occasional cystic pimple. I wanted to try this with the hope that it might prevent those. I didn’t get any cystic pimples while using this but I can’t say for sure if this was the reason why. I didn’t particularly care for the creamy formula of this. It does not foam up at all or feel very cleansing. I almost feel like I should use my regular cleanser to remove make up and then use this as a secondary treatment. It has no scent Not foamy
