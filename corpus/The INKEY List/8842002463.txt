I don’t know if maybe I’m using this product wrong because I read great reviews, but I don’t like this product at all. I bought it as a first cleanse to remove my makeup, but it doesn’t. I’ve tried it on dry skin, wet skin, emulsifying it, but it just doesn’t remove my daily makeup. I also don’t like the film it leaves on my skin after use, which feels very oily and like my skin just isn’t clean. Even when I double cleanse after using this product, my face still feels grimy from the balm. nan
