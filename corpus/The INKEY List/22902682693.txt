It has a very odd smell and it’s so hard to actually be able to wash my face, I’m also used to oil cleansers and water cleansers so balm may just simply not be my thing ! That being said there’s so much product needed to feel that it’s actually doing something but not every size fits all ! Will return though but I love other products from the Inkey List waxy feeling / weird smell
