This product is great. I have very light skin, and whenever I get a pimple, it scars. I then have a red dot on my face for about 6 months before it fades away. This product helps with quickening this process. I used it every other night and saw a difference in about a week. It evens out complexion really well, and makes redness fade away slowly. I am now on my second bottle and would never live without it. Great, inexpensive, and effective. The smell is not the most pleasant, but definitely not that bad. nan
