This product is a holy grail for me. I use it as my first cleanse at night and my only cleanse in the morning. I have had a huge shift in my skin hitting my mid 20s and now that my skin is dry, this is the cleanser for me. I haven’t felt any real film on my skin when using it, and it is the perfect gentle morning cleanser. Also you can’t beat the price. It does a good job removing most make up, but of course I rarely wear any at all so I am not the best judge of that. My Holy Grail Cleanser
