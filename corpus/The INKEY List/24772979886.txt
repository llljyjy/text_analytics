My dermatologist prescribed me tranexmic acid pills 250 mg twice a day for hyperpigmentation along with kojic acid topical cream.  My hyperpigmentation reduced drastically only after 6 months of taking this medicine but it came back as i was not using sunscreen.  I am not sure tranexmic acid topical will really work in reducing pigmentaion, i have been using it for 3 weeks i see a very slight difference in reducing pigmentation but i am not sure whether it is because of this product or the vitamin c that i have been using.  I will keep using it for next two more months as i have reordered the product, then i will decide whether or not to continue. Using it from three weeks
