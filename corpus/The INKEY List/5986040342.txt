Not much to say - a good amount of product for the price. Itâ€™s my first time purchasing it and I would likely re-purchase again. It has a slight scent to it, but nothing overwhelming. I deducted 1 star because I think it could do a bit of a better job removing make up. While I have used it to wash off a full face, I find that there is still some make up left behind. Although it does a good job in removing make up, in my experience, it does not remove it all. Good for the price
