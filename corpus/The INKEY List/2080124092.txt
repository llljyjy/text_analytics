I keep mines in the fridge. I don’t use it every morning. I’m peri menopausal and my sleep is total crap. My go-to is the Sunday Riley one, but this is a good backup. On mornings I use this, it feels nice and cooling under the eyes. It will not hide dark circles or eye bags, but it’ll give the subtle illusion that my eyes are awake. It looks natural like I slept. Nothing is worst than looking like have a glowing white ring around the eyes like I just came back from outer space. I do not like products that have a ton of reflects in them that brightens so much that it looks like I’m wearing something glittery around my eyes in the light. This a good one to try if you need a little help to look like you slept. Caffeine Eye Cream!
