This product works quickly on pimples. I have been dealing with deep and painful under-the-skin pimples that usually last for 2 weeks. I applied this treatment morning and night and the pimples have greatly reduced in size and are no longer painful. This treatment is also effective at drying out pimples. I think adding an acne patch over the treatment would help heal pimples even more quickly. This product does not seem to be very effective on closed comedones nor on blackheads. nan
