Love this cleanser and how it feels on the face before and after. Not drying in the least. New HG cleanser for sure. I only take 1 star off because it claims to remove makeup but it absolutely doesn’t, unless you like wash x10 perhaps? But god forbid wasting product like that. I also don’t use anything to scrub on my face, so perhaps that would help, but I also don’t like to pull on my eyes. In terms of just removing makeup straight from the face, still recommend doing a double cleanse (pre oil cleanse or a wipe w/e is your style) then going in with this and it’s golden. So hydrating! Great! New HG cleanser.
