I have been using this product for a few weeks and have really been enjoying it. I have really dry skin that has a lot of texture on my forehead. In the collage pic I added you can see in the pic on the left, even with makeup, the texture on my forehead. On the right, I am not wearing any makeup, and you can see how smooth and bright my skin looks. This product is fantastic and affordable! It isn’t too heavy or greasy for my skin type, it doesn’t clog my pores, and I am amazed at how it gives my skin a glow, leaving it hydrated and texture-free. nan
