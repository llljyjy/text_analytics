The perfect serum for oily skin! I love this product to help reduce pores, uneven texture, and oiliness. I have been using this product every night for a month now and it has really become one of my favorite serums! My skin is usually sensitive to new products, but this one didn’t break me out or dry out my skin which is amazing! One of my biggest tips for this product is to use a small amount because a little goes a long way! If you use too much, it may not be suitable for the skin. I also like to use this serum mainly on my forehead, nose, and tops of my cheeks as those are the spots I am usually the oiliest in. This product contains ingredients that are great for the skin, which is It blends into the skin so nicely when applied after toner. My skin looks brighter too and overall has improved.  For only $17.99, this product is an absolute steal! The good thing about this serum is that it can be used by normal and combination skin, as well. The packaging is simple, easy to use, and looks good on anyone’s vanity! I would most definitely repurchase this product. Highly recommend if you are looking for a new serum! Must have!!
