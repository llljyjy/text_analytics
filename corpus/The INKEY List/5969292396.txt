Honestly didn’t see much of a difference, I know my acne went down but that’s due to my cycle. I am sure it works for some people but it didn’t really show much improvement or anything cleared up on any acne spots also it didn’t seem very full. I think if it was in a different container maybe it would’ve felt differently but I felt like I was always trying to savor how much I put on since I needed to try it for 30 days. I like the name of the company..
