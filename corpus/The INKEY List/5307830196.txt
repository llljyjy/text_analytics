I was SO excited to try this moisturizer but I was super disappointed. The formula is a gel but when it dries it still feels like an oily film on my face and it’s irritating. No matter how I apply it, I can’t seem to get rid of this oily feeling on my face. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this to any skin type because it just feels bad. Left an oily film, super disappointing.
