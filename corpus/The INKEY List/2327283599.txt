DO NOT BUY—Not the packaging advertised, it came in a small tube that was not even halfway full. The ink from the bottle came off on my hands and dyed my fingertips black. It’s a thick moisturizer but I still have to add facial oil to make it hydrating enough for my skin. I was super excited to try this product and seems like they just phoned it in. nan
