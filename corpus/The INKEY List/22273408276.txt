I received this for free, I don’t know why since I don’t have texture in my skin, thus Im not the most appropriate person to review this. So far I am not loving it or hating it. When I apply it I don’t feel any moisture or cooling sensation on my skin, like I do when I apply other moisturizers. I love my skin feeling refreshed and like it is sucking up the moisture, but this doesn’t happen with this cream. I am not saying is bad  it’s just not for me A moisturizer not for me
