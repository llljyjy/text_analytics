I use this as my “in shower” cleanser - and I absolutely LOVE it! I have extremely dry skin and I’m always on the hunt for moisturizing/nourishing products, and this hits the spot. It is different than my other cleansing balms, as you should use it on wet skin. I like to use a different cleansing balm to remove my makeup, and then I’ll double cleanse with this in the shower and omg - between the formula and the steam it leaves my skin SO SOFT. I’ll usually use it as a mask while I shave/wash my hair or body and wash it off as my last step. I can’t live without this in my shower!! If your skin is dry you need this. LOVE IT!
