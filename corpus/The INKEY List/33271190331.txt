I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now. It is easy to apply and absorbs very quickly. It helps keeping my skin matte but unfortunately I haven’t noticed that my pores got minimized or my skin texture is improved. But I really like how my skin feels after using it and I also like to use it and I make up. I would recommend this product partially. Okay
