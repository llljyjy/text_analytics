This didn’t do anything for my skin. I have dry skin and was hoping to get rid of the tight feeling I get even with heavy moisturizers. I applied this while my skin was damp and while dry and neither felt good or moisturized. Just tight and sometimes sticky. This was my first step after cleansing and then I followed with a moisturizer. Still have dry skin and no glow like other HAs have provided. Also, the bottle came half empty. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. Did nothing
