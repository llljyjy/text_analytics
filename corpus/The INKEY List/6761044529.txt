After my first use (a few weeks ago) I went, “oh, this is weird.“ It’s a pretty effective cleansing balm (as long as you’re not wearing waterproof mascara) but it leaves an almost waxy-feeling residue upon rinse which is maybe supposed to be the hydrating part? It does go away, for the most part, with a second cleanse but it leaves me feeling like the moisture I’ve gained from the product is just temporary. The product also tends to separate a little in the tube and I’ve recently had some trouble getting it back to its original consistency. Since it’s such a great price and usually gets the job done I do intend to finish it, but I did end up re-purchasing my go-to cleansing balm in addition to this one bc, as I said, it’s not powerful enough to remove waterproof eye make up. Totally worth a try, and I see the appeal, but ultimately I won’t be purchasing this again. Waxy! Worth a try, but not worth a re-purchase
