I like this moisturizer. Itâ€™s a little thicker than I usually like but it makes my skin feel plump and moisturized. A little bit goes a long way! I was overdoing it at first and now I use 1 pump and it is plenty enough. Definitely worth the price. I was originally going to buy the SkinFix triple peptide but went with this one instead because the price was much better. Good purchase. Affordable moisturizer option
