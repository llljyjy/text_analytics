I did not like the product. It left my skin feeling like it had a thick layer of sludge and grease on it after using and it overall just didnâ€™t feel like it was making my skin any cleaner. Yes it does take off your makeup but there is so many better options out there for only a few more dollars. Not to mention this stuff separates like crazy in the tube and is so thick that it is almost impossible to mix up again. I would not recommend this product at all unless you are in a pinch. nan
