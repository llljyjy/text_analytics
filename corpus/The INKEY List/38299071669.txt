This moisturiser is so good! I have fairly dry skin with dry lil patches appearing every now and then. I normally use this moisturiser and the Avene one too. The texture is really nice and it isn’t greasy at all. Also I don’t know if it’s just me but it kinda smells like Avene which is nice. (The pump is also really cool and convenient :) ) Amazing for dry skin
