My go to daily BHA. Very gentle and non drying. I use it under my vitamin C without irritation. It keeps my skin super clear, I even apply under my eyes and keeps my milia at bay. I don’t have acne prone skin, but it is oily and I get small bumps under the skin. This, with niacinamide is a powerhouse combo for people with oily skin.  I personally prefer this over Paula’s Choice BHA. It has a gel consistency, I apply it on my fingers and rub it on my face and follow it with the rest of my skincare. The packaging is a bit annoying, but the product and price is right so I don’t care. nan
