think the ordinary is a better formula for me personally because it’s better for oily skin, but this one would be great for more normal skin types. it has more hydrating ingredients than a typical niacinamide serum so it won’t dry you out, but still helps with acne prevention and excess oil production. like ordinary better, but still great formula
