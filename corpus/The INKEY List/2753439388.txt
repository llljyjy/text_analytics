I add this serum to my foundation, goes on on smooth, my skin but better, healthy & natural. The consistency of the product is perfect mixing, no clumps, & does change color of shade. Also great for mixing different foundation colors together to get your own personalized shade & helps against color separation. It’s very easy, I’m far from a makeup pro. I love how I’m in control of the coverage. Works great with thick to sheer foundations. I strongly advise mixing with your fingers & using hands to apply. It seems to warm up & melts onto your skin. This serum is a real game changer at a great price. It doesn’t break me out & helps smooth dry patches. I even use less foundation, so I save $$.  Give it a try it’s incredible!!! Add to any foundation for smooth, & natural look
