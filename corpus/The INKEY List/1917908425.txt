I have purchased 4 times now.  When it’s fresh it’s really good. Only 2 of the 4 arrived with the product fresh (clear and not orange) and really helped with my dark spots. But the other 2 it areived orange/spoiled ir leaking. If they can fifure out how to package it well it would be my staple. I will have to keep looking. Love- hate relationship
