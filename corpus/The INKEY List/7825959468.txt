I neither love this product nor do I dislike it. It is a decent retinol for the price. I noticed it help some of the smaller acne and texture but it didn’t help much with the big acne spots or scarring. It dried out my skin so I had to use it sparingly. If your skin handles retinol well and you aren’t looking for a product to target deep acne and deep scars, then I would recommend this! Neither love it nor hate it
