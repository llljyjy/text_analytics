Is the tube half full? Yes. But is this moisturizer amazing enough to look past that? Also, yes. This is an amazing moisturizer and after only a few days of use, I’ve noticed a significant change in my skin. Fine lines and dark spots have started to fade, and it has not caused any rashes or breakouts for my super sensitive skin. I would say this is almost on par with Drunk Elephant, except not as moisturizing. I live in a hot, humid environment so I don’t mind lighter moisturizers, but if your skin is on the dryer side you might need something in addition to this. Great!
