As much as I love the inkey list, this product is not their best. It made me ridiculously flakey. I’ve used plenty of retinols before, and i’m definitely not sensitive to them. Even after only using this twice a week (every 4 days) I am so dry it’s ridiculous. I also think the price is a bit high for how their other products are priced. Not a fan
