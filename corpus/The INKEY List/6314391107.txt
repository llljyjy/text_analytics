super lightweight moisturizer that sinks into the skin super fast. it didn’t break me out as i’m not allergic to any of the ingredients (as I assume other reviewers are), but it’s not a good option for dry skin. It’s not moisturizing enough and my fave feels dry after like 30 minutes lightweight but dry
