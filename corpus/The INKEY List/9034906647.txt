this product is weird for a first time user. I tried it because of all the hype only to find out that it had less than 4 stars. The consistency is weird and comes out different each time. The first time I used it, it felt like it had exfoliating beads in it? As far as I know, this is a balm that removes dirt/spf/makeup etc and not an exfoliator. When I see even the girl on the video promoting this cleanser on Sephora site, it looks like she was able to take the product out of the bottle with ease. Last night it took me 30 seconds to squeeze a penny size amount on my hand. Also used it again and this time it’s creamy white and last night it was like that Vaseline texture. Definitely returning. It’s a no from me. It’s a no from me. Returning.
