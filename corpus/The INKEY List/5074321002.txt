This and the SA cleanser saved my skin! I got an awful, full-face breakout from a new moisturizer I tried and had tiny little bumps all over my face. I was recommended this and my skin has gotten so much better in only 2-3 days! Amazing product, a little goes a long way, price is great, isn’t sticky at all, and I’ve noticed a difference in my oily skin. I used to use The Ordinary niacinamide which I found VERY sticky, but this one is awesome. Great, way better than The Ordinary!
