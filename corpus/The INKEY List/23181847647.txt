I wanted to try this out since it’s super popular, but I’m glad I got the mini size. This is a big miss for me. The texture is super grainy and feels like it’s tugging on my skin. It also smells weird, kinda rancid?, so I didn’t enjoy that. I also found that it doesn’t remove waterproof mascara, nor much of my foundation. I used micellar water right after to see if the balm removed my makeup, and it didn’t remove everything. It gets one star for the tube packaging, I loved that I didn’t have to scoop it out.  Other than that, save your money for something effective! girl no
