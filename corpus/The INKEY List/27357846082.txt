This is a good beginner retinol, especially for the price. I don’t think I’d stick with it long-term, but if you follow the directions and integrate it slowly into your routine, it would be a gentle introduction to stronger, more effective products for your skin. I tend to experience some irritation with retinoids due to the harshness and found this to be pretty mild, comparatively.I’ve knocked a star off because I didn’t like the smell - astringent - or the texture - I don’t know how to describe it except as a sort of slime/cream hybrid - but other than that there’s not much to complain about. nan
