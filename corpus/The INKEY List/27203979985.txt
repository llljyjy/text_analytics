I loved the consistency (it’s light and absorbs quick which I love because essentially, it feels like  nothing is on your skin). I did not notice a difference, the bottle is pretty small and I ran out pretty quick. I heard that The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid is a bit better so I’ll be trying that out soon. Even though I didn’t notice a change in my skin texture, in the long run, it did keep me moisturized because my skin tends to get dry patches but the hyaluronic acid helped against that. Not much of a difference, liked but didn't love
