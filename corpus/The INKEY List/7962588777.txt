I was disappointed in this face wash. It didn’t cleanse my skin at all. I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks(haven’t purchased another cleanser yet) and after toning, I’m still removing oil and dirt. It did really well to remove makeup, which would be great for a double cleanse method. You definitely need another cleanser after using this one. Good For A Double Cleanse
