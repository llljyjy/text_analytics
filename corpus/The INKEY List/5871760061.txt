I be really love this cleanser and quickly felt a difference in my skin! I would suggest slowly using it as a daily routine. My concerns were aging and uneven texture break outs. It has made the appearance of my skin much smoother. I was given this to try and am shocked at the price point when I went to look it up. Usually products that work thus well are pricey!!! Will continue to use!! Great Product at Great Price!
