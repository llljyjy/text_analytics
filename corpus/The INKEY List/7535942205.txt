I love this oil, it helped fade my dark spots noticeably quickly (I also use fat water which helps fade dark spots as well). The oil isn’t greasy, it’s thick and a little goes a long way. It can cause purging so please be aware. It’s significantly reduced build up in my pores which I’ve normally had issues with around my chin. The only thing is that it’s causing skin colored bumps on my cheeks where I normally don’t break out. I’m not sure if that’s still considered purging or not but I’d say it’s worth a try! 9/10!
