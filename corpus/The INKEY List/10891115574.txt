Folks with dry skin, HEAR ME OUT. This cleanser is amazing!! I donâ€™t recommend using it other than in the shower as it can be difficult to thoroughly rinse it off. This balm can be used as a moisture mask as well. I found the best results by washing my face once with it for oil and dirt removal, then wash a second time but I will leave the balm on my skin for a couple mins for my skin to soak up the goodness. My face has never been so soft and I have so much less peeling and flaking! nan
