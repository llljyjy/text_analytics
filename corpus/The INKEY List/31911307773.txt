I was so disappointed about this product. I am never repurchasing this product. I originally bought this because I ran out of my favourite niacinamide serum and it was out of stock. The product is so sticky and leaves your face sticky. As you rub the product into your skin it creates a white sticky foam. After 1 week of using it I got annoyed that when I applied my makeup it left white residue on my face so I throw it away. never again
