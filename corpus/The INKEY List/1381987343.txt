I have really enjoyed this cleanser. I find that Benzoyl Peroxide based acne cleansers work best for keeping my face clean and clear. I’ve tried lots and this is a top one for me. It doesn’t dry my face out and I’ve had a pretty clear face since using it. The one thing to be careful with is this product will discolor your wash cloths because of the peroxide. I just use cheap ones I don’t care about. I don’t use this to remove makeup but a the second part of a double cleanse after a makeup remover. I would absolutely consider repurchasing this product. Great Cleanser for a Clear Face
