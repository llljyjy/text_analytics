So i got this product a month ago , the reviews killed any hope I had of it working for me. HOWEVER since the first day I noticed an improvement, something changed I had to colour correct coz of how bad my dark circles were , obviously thereâ€™s some discolouration but today is the first day im outside the house with NO CONCEALER after 4 years and my underyes look so good . im still in shock .The comments are disheartening but it really worked for my ive had dark circles for a VERY long time and they were sunken in !! nan
