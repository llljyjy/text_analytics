I have been using this for a few weeks and overall I found it slightly helpful for my acne. I recommend using this once a day and not using any other acne products when you use this serum. I used to use my acne cleanser in the AM and this during PM.  Make sure you apply a thin layer. I didn’t have any irritation from this product. Since I don’t have redness I can’t tell you how that aspect of the product works. The packaging is fine because the product is easy to dispense. I would also start off using this product slowly into your routine. I first used this every other day. Also felt a bit of pilling when I used sunscreen, so I switched to PM. It may have been the sunscreen I was using too. Overall I think you should try this if you have acne and have run out of options. nan
