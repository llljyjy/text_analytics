Bought this specifically to use alongside tretinoin that left my face soooooo dry and irritated. While it is very moisturizing and did not further irritate my skin, it left me feeling super greasy and oily, like I had a thick film on my skin, and it just got worse as the day went on. I gave it some time hoping my skin would eventually get used to it, but after about 3 weeks of my skin feeling so goopy and thick, I just couldnâ€™t take it anymore. Very disappointing. Not for oily skin
