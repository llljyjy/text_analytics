Unfortunately, I used this product for a week and got a nasty breakout (wasn’t hormonal and didn’t start using any new products). I retried this once more for a few days, and again, got a horrible breakout on the right side of my face. (I have dehydrated combo skin, only buy it if you have really, really dry skin). No Thank You!
