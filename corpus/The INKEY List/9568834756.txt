I was told this product was good for gua sha, but its the complete opposite. This dried so fast and I didn’t even get the chance to rub it in with the gua sha. This isn’t hydrating at all. I have combination skin. I can’t see this product working on the long run. Also there was residue on my eyebrows, leaving them all stiff and flaky. There are definitely more hydrating serums out there. nan
