I actually like this formula a little better than The Ordinary HA Serum (I think its slightly more hydrating) but for the price the TO version is better value so I probably wonâ€™t repurchase. Also, the packaging on this one is a little annoying because you have to squirt it out and its very runny. I prefer a dropper application. nan
