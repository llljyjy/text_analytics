Seriously the best for all my oily/combo people and for the price you literally canâ€™t beat it! I usually am an oily mess after 4/5hrs of wearing my makeup even moisturized and prime but after using this along with my toner (farmacy deep sweep) I legit have no oil at the end of the day. Especially on my T-zone. I always recommend! Pair it up with a gel based moisturizer too and do forget your SPF OBSESSED
