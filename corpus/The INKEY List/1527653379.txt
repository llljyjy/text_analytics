worst product ever, im SO disappointed i strayed from my OG Clinique take the day off. For one, this doesn’t work AT ALL - it doesn’t take makeup off at all. The worst though, is that the product completely seperated. I went to use it, and a bit of cleanser came out and then the rest was just gross liquid. throwing this out ASAP, so upset. DO NOT BUY
