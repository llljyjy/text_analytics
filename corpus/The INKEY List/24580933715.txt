My skin was breaking out around my mouth / chin area ever since I started using this. I didnâ€™t realize it was this product and thought it was hormonal. I travelled and brought a different moisturizer and my skin cleared up perfectly. Gave what was left of it to my sister and after 1 use she had a breakout in the exact same spot I did. Would not recommend or repurchase. Caused breakout!!
