I was never really a fan of niacidimide just because I had used up a full bottle of the ordinary’s niacidimide and saw no benefits and eventually just stopped using it.That was until I tried out this bad boy!! I noticed the benefits of niacidimide the night after using it, i’m sold!!! The only reason I took off 1 star is because I find the packaging annoying and somehow it doesn’t seem to last as long as The Ordinary’s which is the same size. Either way I think this product is great and would be 5/5 if the packaging was better :)) nan
