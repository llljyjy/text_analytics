An employee recommended this because they were all out of the ordinary glycolic toner. All I have to say, WOW! I’ve only used it about 3/4 times and the texture on my forehead has already smoothed out!! Only downside I have is it does burn/sting just a little bit when I first tried it, and I don’t have sensitive skin either. Other than that, this toner is amazing!! nan
