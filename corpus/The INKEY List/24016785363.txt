I’m so happy this amazing Mandelic Acid Treatment came into my life. I’ve never come across a product that can quickly reduce my dark spots while also helping with my acne at the same time. This past year my freckles have been going a little crazy, especially in the summer. I’ve been super self conscious because they’re popping up above my upper lip and leaving me with a few dark spots that from a distance looks as if I have a mustache. Nothing worked except to cover it with makeup which just got me more self conscious especially since it didn’t last all day. This has been a HUGE game changer for me. It has drastically reduced my frecklestache (lol) and has me feeling more confident to where I don’t need any makeup to help hide it. Ive also been having some trouble spots on my chin with scne that this has helped reduce the appearance of. I absolutely LOVE this targeted treatment and will continue to keep it within my skin care routine. The best part is that its vegan and cruelty free. This is the 2nd Inkey List product I’ve tried that has completely impressed me. I highly recommend giving this a try if you have dark spots as well. It’s done wonders for me. I can’t wait to try out even more Inkey List products in the future. I truly wish I would’ve taken a good before & after pic to show my results. Frecklestache Be Gone!!
