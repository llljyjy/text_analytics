I’m beginning to realize that I can only take niacinamide in smaller doses, and even 5% seems to be too much for my skin to handle. This moisturizer felt lovely going on - very light gel water cream and it absorbs easily. No fragrance or scent whatsoever which is also nice. Perfect for oily or oily/combination skin. However, a few minutes after absorbing it started to tingle and itch, which I know happens to me when I’ve tried 10% niacinamide serums. It seems 5% may be too much for me too, as I’m not sure any of the other ingredients would cause that reaction. But that’s just me, so if you don’t have the same issue, I recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a lightweight moisturizer. The price is right so I’m disappointed that I can’t use it. I gave it 3 stars because I do think on the right person this could be a great. Didn't work for me but has potential
