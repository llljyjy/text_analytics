I’m having a hard time reviewing this product because i’m so mixed whether i like it or not. i don’t wear a ton of makeup but it seems to do a good job removing my makeup without being abrasive like some makeup remover wipes, but i have skin on the oilier side so even after washing my skin feels slick and greasy so i don’t feel like it is a great cleanser. would probably be much better for someone with dry or normal skin. nan
