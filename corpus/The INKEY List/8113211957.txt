I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin that most exfoliators make my skin burn and turn red. BUT NOT THIS ONE. It doesn’t burn at all and it doesn’t make my face red one bit. I have also very dry skin on my forehead and it got rid of my dry skin flakes in only a few days!!! I started by using it only once a day to get my skin used to the product since it’s so sensitive and my skin looks amazing so far. It’s also already starting to get rid of my acne! I really recommend it for people with very dry and sensitive skin! It’s the only exfoliator that’s been working for me yet. AMAZING FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
