Surprisingly, this is the only moisturizer that I don’t break out with acne from!! I use it daily, in the morning, but where I apply it changes - one day I’ll apply it on my t-zone, neck and chest and the next day I apply it all over my face, neck and chest. Don’t use this moisturizer with AHAs,  BHAs, Retinol, and Niacinamide because the vitamin C in the moisturizer will either react or cancel out with those ingredients - like irritation, breakouts, dryness, etc. if you do, make sure to apply it 10 mins apart!
