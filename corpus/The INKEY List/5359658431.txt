I started breaking out like crazy after many years of clear skin and decided that the price of this was low enough to give it a try. Not only was it ineffective, I noticed more spots appearing in places I’d applied it - places I’m not used to seeing any blemishes at all.After struggling for a few months, I decided to pare down my skincare and get rid of everything containing comedogenic ingredients, no matter how small an amount. There were some things I was sad to see go, but no surprises - most of the pore-clogging products were foundations, heavy creams or oils with comedogenic ingredients way down the list.However, nothing was as big of a disappointment as seeing that this product- specifically designed to TREAT acne - has Glyceryl Stearate SE as the THIRD INGREDIENT. Glyceryl Stearate SE is highly comedogenic i.e. highly likely to clog pores in acne prone skin. There was not a single other product in my stash with a comedogenic ingredient so close to the top of the list, and I chucked some cheap foundations and a lot of very rich creams.This is very likely to be making your skin worse in the long run. If you’re using it, throw it out - and if you’re thinking of buying it, don’t. Highly comedogenic formula- stay away!
