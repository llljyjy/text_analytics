I received this product for free to test out from Influenster. It left my skin feeling soft it definitely didn’t dry it out like I thought it would after reading the packaging. I washed my face twice a day and I didn’t really notice a difference. My teenage son however, used it and he really liked it his face has been clearer. I think this is a great product for those with occasional breakouts like my son not so much for my age acne. Worked great for my teen!
