This is without a doubt the absolute worst cleansing balm. Sorry but it doesn’t leave your “skin soft“ it is the nasty consistency clogging your pores. I could still see trapped sunscreen after rinsing, had to use my 2nd cleanser 3x to remove the film. The formula separates and all the comes out is oil unless you break your hand squeezing the tube. Honestly, these good reviews have to be paid, I’d choose anything over this, even drugstore balms and oils. This is absolutely the worst product I’ve ever tried on my skin. Went right in the trash after 2nd use. Shocked.
