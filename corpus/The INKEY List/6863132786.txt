I couldn’t give this product a chance even if I wanted to. For the price I was intrigued but the packaging is horrible. The formula is a water like consistency and the moment I took off the seal, the product just oozes out. It’s such a waste! I immediately put the cap on and took it off and it oozed out more. At this point, am I even saving any money if it’s going to waste? I would rather return it and splurge on another retinol alternative and get my money’s worth. Horrible Packaging and Formula
