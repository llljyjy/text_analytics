Worked perfect for me both in the morning and in the evening! I see a lot of people say in the reviews that it leaves a film but that did not happen to me AT ALL. Might be I am using it right, idk. First time I used it, I was like why did I EVER pay expensive cleansing balms when this one existed. Definitely recommend, definitely will repurchase. A very good cleansing balm
