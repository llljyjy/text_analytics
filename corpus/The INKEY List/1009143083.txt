Good price for a first cleanse, but it must be followed by a second cleanse, as it leaves an oily residue. It also is almost exfoliating, as it has small chunks of something, and it separates in warm temperatures so you’ll randomly get a big glob of oil. No my favorite, and won’t be purchasing again, but it is cheap and does remove makeup pretty easily. Residue, oily mess, but good price
