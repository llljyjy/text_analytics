This did not work for me. I thought this would help me with a couple of blackheads I have along my jaw line and some clogged pores around my nose. Instead of getting rid of them, it broke me out like crazy and gave me these bumps on the side of my nose. It doesn’t look like pimples and it’s not really going away .. so now I have to book an appointment with a dermatologist to get rid of it ... I'd stay away from this one if I were you.
