I wanted to love it so bad. I gave it a fair chance but there are no words to express how much I hated. It purged my skin so bad and never go better. Just kept getting worse. Acne, redness, things I never had even as a teen. I absolutely do not recommend this! I have combo skin. After using this product I looked like I had a flesh eating disease around my mouth. The WORST cleanser I ever used!!
