I think this works just fine. It does cleanse my skin and remove my make-up. This is something you can use in the shower as a first cleansing step without issue, however, I have another cleansing balm I prefer to use and I find this doesn’t live up. I have acne prone skin, and do find that this adds a little bit of oil to myskin chemistry after use. I prefer to use this as a face mask before showering and it has a really nice feel; it does not affect my skin chemistry if I use it as a mask. I think it’s more effective as a mask overall. Plus, the price point is fantastic. I will definitely be trying more from The Inky List. nan
