I never write reviews, but this product is the only thing that has made a noticeable difference in my acne scars on my cheeks. I mix it with the inkey list vitamin c serum and there is a noticeable difference by morning. I have sensitive skin and it didnâ€™t break me out at all. I noticed a big difference in less than 2 weeks! This works!
