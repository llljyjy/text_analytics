I’ve tried many products to try and get rid of this hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. Some products would smell horrible and some did nothing. The INKEY list mandelic acid treatment showed gradual results within three weeks for me. I’m so happy with the results! It doesn’t have a strong smell and is gentle on my skin. A little goes a long way. nan
