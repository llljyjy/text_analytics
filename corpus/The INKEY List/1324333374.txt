Love this, Iâ€™ve repurchased 3 times! I use every AM and double cleanse at night (this is my first step) super gentle but removes everything without stripping and I love that there is no fragrance! I squeeze the product out by flattening the top like you would with a toothpaste tube and I never have an issue getting it all out or having it separate. This is one of my favorite products that I discovered in the last year! nan
