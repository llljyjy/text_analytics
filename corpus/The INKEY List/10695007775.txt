Literally amazing, especially  if you want fast results. It definitely boosted my confidence. However it will dry you out, so make sure to use a hydrating lotion, and even hydronic acid to help. It does cause a small amount of flakiness, BUT with the results you get from it itâ€™s so worth it works!
