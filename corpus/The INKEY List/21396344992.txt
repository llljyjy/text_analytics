I have repurchased this product because it worked so well into my combination acne-prone skin. The result of this vitamin C is amazing on my skin, I use it every morning before applying the sunscreen. It did not caused my skin to acne breakout, and I notice a big difference in brightening my skin and acne scars. Definitely I will keep repurchasing this vitamin C, I have used other forms of vitamin C but they broke me out. Best Vitamin C serum for acne prone skin!!
