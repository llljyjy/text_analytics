I wanted to love this vitamin C as it’s so inexpensive and i love inkey list as a brand. That being said this product did absolutely nothing for my skin. It didn’t create any new problems i’ll give it that. This product pills like crazy, every time i would go to do my makeup whether it was 5 minutes after application or 5 hours my makeup, moisturizer, and sunscreen would all pill as soon as i applied it. This vitamin C also makes my skin so tight and dry, no matter how quickly i applied moisturizer it would make my face uncomfortably tight, and then of course immediately pill. The packaging is also not the best as the product oxidizes quickly and the pump leaks. Sadly so had to return this product. Product pills, no results, bad packaging
