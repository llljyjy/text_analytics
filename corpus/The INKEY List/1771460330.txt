It’s good for the price, but Farmacy’s and Drunk Elephant’s balms are still preferred to me and worth the extra cost. I find it leaves a bit of a film and is too heavy for my oily/combo skin. I like the texture and it has minimal scent. It removes my makeup so it does serve its purpose. The packaging I wasn’t crazy about and found the product difficult to get out. Good for the price, better out there
