If you have chronic pain in your hands do not get this. I struggled so hard to get product out and my hands hurt after trying to squeeze a little product out. The product itself is fine. It took off most of my makeup, but I really had to work it into my eyelashes to remove my waterproof mascara. On the rest of my face it felt really nourishing. I think it does leave a bit of residue on your face as well but I found rinsing my face with warm water and really massaging the water into my face really helped. Overall itâ€™s a really meh product. nan
