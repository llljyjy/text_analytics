This is such my favourite cleanser yet! I’ve tried many expensive cleansers but the Salicylic Acid one is perfect for my sensitive dry skin. It helps keep my pores clean and prevent acne and scars. It’s not harsh or super mild, but the perfect balance and gets the job done while actually feeling like its cleaning, compared to other sensitive skin cleansers which are too gentle to clean pores. 1 bottle lasted me about 4 months, using 2x a day. Purchasing again because it’s essential to have in my skincare routine! It’s a small bottle, so it’s perfect for travel, but also goes a long way for its price! Amazing value for a low price!
