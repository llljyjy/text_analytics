Really liked using this cleanser for a good while, it helped to clear up a lot of the acne on my skin and always left me feeling fresh,  I recommended to friends and they felt the same.  After some prolonged use I stopped seeing results but that could just be my skin getting used to it.  I currently use it on my body as a body wash and the price point is great! nan
