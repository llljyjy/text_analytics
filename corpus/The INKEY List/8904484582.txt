I have dry skin but heavy thick creams tend to make me break out. I tested many of the face creams at Sephora and this one felt the best on my skin and it has been glowing ever since. You do need to use toners and serums with it as a heads up. I’ve only had the jar packaging so far so hopefully it’s not too different with the tube. Great for my dry skin and for the price!
