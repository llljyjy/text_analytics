Lovely multi-purpose serum that’s helped me simplify my skincare routine - niacinamide keeps my skin clear & soothed, & hylauronic acid keeps it hydrated. Doesn’t leave your skin tacky like the Ordinary’s niacinamide serum. I use this at night after washing & Glow Recipe’s AHA toner. Follow with a moisturizer and I’m set. My skin is happy! This hydrating serum simplifies my routine
