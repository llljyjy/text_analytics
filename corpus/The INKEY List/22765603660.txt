I came in to get a foundation in my birthday and was recommended this moisturizer by a staff member. The best moisturizer I’ve ever used. So lightweight it literally feels like water and my skin looks soooooo healthy and glowy. I started using this at the same time as Biore baking soda & blue agave face wash. Has completely changed the trajectory of my skin. I had a really oily t zone but dry nose and lots of little pimples and dirty pores on the bottoms of my chin. now, there’s literally nothing in most of my pores and my skin looks amazing. Holy Grail
