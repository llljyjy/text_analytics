I am looking for a replacement moisturizer since my favorite, Neutrogena Naturals, has been discontinued. I chose this one because it has Vitamin E, which I believe was a main reason my former moisturizer was so good. I am not pleased with the INKEY moisturizer. It has a faint, but unpleasant smell, does not seem to sink into skin, and flakes off after a few hours. Would not buy again
