I’m 52 with sensitive combo skin and I love this. I do agree that it does not rinse completely clean, so if you are oily you probably aren’t going to love it. I generally use this as a first cleanse followed by a mild foaming cleanser which helps with the residue, but if I’ve done some sort of peel (The Ordinary’s 30% AHA, 2% BHA peel, for example) I use this as a regular old cleanser. It really helps minimize irritation. I took a star off because it does indeed separate. However, it doesn’t appear to interfere with the effectiveness. It still removes my waterproof mascara, sunscreen, and long wear foundation completely. Good stuff if you aren't oily!
