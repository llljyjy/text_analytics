This cream really helped soften my skin. I have combination, acne prone skin and am surprised at how much it didn’t break me out. I traveled recently and wore a mask more than I’m used to and didn’t break out. I was legitimately surprised and so happy. Finally an economically friendly product that actually works. In terms of oiliness it helped minimize but not eradicate. I’ll take soft supple acne-free skin over a bit oiliness any day. Strongly recommend this moisturizer. acne prone skin gals come get your fix
