I have dry skin and this product is perfect for getting off stubborn makeup- even mascara- without having to apply too much pressure. I still follow up with a gentle cleanser. Everyone who wears makeup should have an oil based cleaner as part of their makeup removal for the sake of their skin- this one is affordable and has great ingredients. No reason not to buy :) Best cleanser purchase ever
