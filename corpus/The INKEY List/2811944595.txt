This is one of the best products I’ve ever tried. Retinol is too irritating for my skin so I gave this a try and my skin is SO smooth and bright in the morning when I wake up that I can’t use anything else. Truly one of the only products I actually feel and see a difference with. It works super well with the Omega Water Cream. Really hope these 2 products are here to stay. Favorite Active Product
