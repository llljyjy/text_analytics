I like this product, but I donâ€™t love it.  It is definitely non-irritating, which is a huge plus, but I do need to combine it with either salicyclic acid or niacinamide to get it to do what I want.  I think I am going to try it on my chest/shoulders, where I have more sun damage. Good for my sensitive skin.
