Eye creams are almost never worth going expensive on. I do really like this one. I did not find the retinol drying and saw improvement in my fine lines in just a few months after applying this a few times a week. For the price this is excellent quality. I also have very sensitive skin and did not have any irritation with this. definitely pick this one up
