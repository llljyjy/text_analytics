This cleansing balm is very subjective and I would definitely recommend getting a sample or trial size first, although it is so cheap you really have nothing to lose. It is grainy, yes, but as you massage it in the grains melt away. They are not harsh and could not be considered any form of exfoliation, they are just simply the natural formula. I love the hygienic mess-free tube, and appreciate it is fragrance free and EXFOLIANT FREE!! So many products on the market have exfoliants, especially cleansing balms. Almost every cleansing balm I see has papaya enzymes and this is a great option that does not! When I first bought it, the texture took a lot of getting used to, it was not silky or super easy to scoop as other cleansing balms I’ve tried are, but I’ve gotten used to the formula and come to really love it. I do not wear makeup, and if I do it’s just lipgloss or blush, so I cannot attest to the makeup removing capabilities of this balm, which is what many people look for in a cleansing balm, but if you’re looking for a nice option to deeply cleanse your face or remove sunscreen/light makeup, the price cannot be beat! I like it… but very subjective
