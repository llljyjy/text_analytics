Love this product. Was using this one and the Ordinary’s simultaneously and I MUCH prefer this texture. Not sticky and tacky, it’s watery and absorbs quickly. Easy to dispense despite the flip bottle top. This is a wonderful formulation at a great price and I am going to re-order again and again. This lasted me over 3 months with daily use and I’m so happy with it. Only negative review I have is that it’s in a plastic bottle, I wish it was a bit more environmentally friendly without contributing more plastic. nan
