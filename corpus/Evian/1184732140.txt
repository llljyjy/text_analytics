First time trying the Evian spray in years and I love it! This is a noticeably more fine mist than other face sprays of this kind (also love the Vichy and Avene ones which have bigger water droplets). It is just water in a pressurized can, but these are so refreshing to use on the face throughout the day, or all over the body in the summer. Highly rec bringing to picnics in the summer to cool off too Fine mist and large size
