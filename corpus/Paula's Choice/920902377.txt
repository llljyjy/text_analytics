I usually like Paula’s Choice products, however I didn’t see as much brightening from the booster. The product gets dry and crusty around where you turn the top / stopper which is a turnoff. I eventually bought the 20% formula because I thought I might need more potency to see results but didn’t see any improvement. The crust factor was worse with the 20%, too. I will be sticking with The Ordinary because of the results and price. Did not see any results
