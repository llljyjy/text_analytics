This product is amazing. I’m in my 20’s and have fine lines. I use this product 3 times a week on my forehead, smile lines, and neck. It’s thick and super moisturizing. It’s been absolutely helping with wrinkles and fine lines. Make sure to use a good moisturizer overtop once this product dries. It’ll help soothe and moisturize the skin because this product tightens the skin, making fine lines and wrinkles slowly go away. 100% recommend! YES YES YES GET IT
