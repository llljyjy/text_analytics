Lightweight moisturizer that does not leave any greasy feeling! I love how quickly it blends and hydrates my skin. The finish is not dewy and I love that! I also appreciate that it comes in a pump style package. I just wish it came without oils. But apart that from, nothing to complain about! Love the finish!
