I purchased this after doing a lot of research on what to do for my red cheeks that were beginning to get little pustules. I had tried everything soothing and calming with no luck. This started working right away and now 3 weeks later my cheeks look better than they have in years. I have an oily t zone with sensitive cheeks and it’s been difficult to find balance for my skin. Using this all over my face has also decreased pore size and improved skin texture. I’m not sure why Azeleic Acid isn’t promoted more - it’s like a secret weapon! Must have for red, bumpy cheeks!
