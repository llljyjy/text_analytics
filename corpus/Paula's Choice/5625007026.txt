I previously would not incorporate any products besides moisturizer and sunscreen before doing makeup because of pilling and other difficulties with layering. This product absorbs amazingly well and has a nice matte effect. It absolutely has helped me in the management of active acne and fading redness from blemishes past. Despite containing chemical exfoliants, it has NEVER irritated my skin, even when my moisture barrier is compromised. I have re-ordered twice, and feel that the price is worth it to me for the relatively small tube. A perfect product
