I love this Omega+ Complex Cleansing Balm from Paulaâ€™s Choice. I use this as the first step of my double cleansing process. It melts onto the skin and removes all traces of makeup. It does not dry my skin. I have acne prone, sensitive skin and this cleansing balm never broke me out. Love this cleansing balm!
