I trust Paulaâ€™s choice products to do what they are supposed to do and provide results and this c serum does exactly that.  I have developed sun spots and uneven skin texture as I have aged so a good vitamin c product is always a part of my skincare routine.  One of the best things about this serum is the texture - thin and not sticky at all.  It absorbs fast and wears well under skincare/makeup.  So glad to have this product in my routine!
