My skin loves Vitamin C, but I’ve been struggling to find a lightweight Vitamin C moisturizer for day that didn’t feel sticky or heavy, or smell funny. This one fits the bill completely - it’s as lightweight as a gel-cream or lotion, does not leave a sticky residue or interfere with my sunscreen, & gives a glowing finish that’s not too “dewy“ - I want to look radiant, not reflective, haha! I like the smell & it’s not overwhelming. I’m trying to lighten some old sun damage on my face, & in combination with the 10% Niacinamide & the retinol at night, I think I’m finally making some progress. My complexion looks brighter and clearer, at any rate, so I’m hopeful it will continue to improve. Non-sticky, non-smelly, brightens skin
