I have very sensitive, eczema prone skin so I am always very cautious when trying new retinol and bakuchiol skincare products but I have to say my skin has been loving the new Paula’s Choice .3% retinol + 2% bakuchiol treatment! I used it 3 times a week for my first week and now I use it 5 nights a week in my nighttime skincare routine and my skin has been smoother and firmer than ever and it doesn’t breakout my skin! Highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin looking to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles! Perfect for sensitive skin!
