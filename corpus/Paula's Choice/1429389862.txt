I love that this product contains bakuchiol and retinol. It is a great combo. I used bakuchiol moisturizing cream before and it is great if you have super sensitive skin. With retinol you need to be careful how much product you use. Start using it 3 times a week. I saw some mild reaction and now I use it two times a week. Overall, I can see improvement in my skin and highly recommend it! Great retinol product!
