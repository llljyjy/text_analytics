I had a bad reaction to retinol previously, so I was nervous to try it again, but I love Paulaâ€™s choice, so why not! At first, I used it and it dried out my face so badly, but then I started using moisturizer afterwards and oh my gosh, it was a game changer!  My skin was glowing after 8 days of using it and I will definitely be using this for the rest of my life - 10/10 highly recommend. A new forever must
