The texture of this product is lotion like but feels light on the skin. There is a slight chemical scent to it but nothing I mind too much. The product definitely moisturized my skin and made it look very glowy and plump; however, I did break out a bit after using it for the first week and am still in the process of healing the acne. Not sure if this was due to the product or due to stress from life but thought it would be good for me to mention.  Will continue to use this product and hope my skin adjusts because it does really hydrate my skin! nan
