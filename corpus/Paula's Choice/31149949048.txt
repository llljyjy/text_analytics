I have a combo skin, but I use retinoid at night and salisilic acid in the morning, so my skin needs be well hydrated. I use this moisturizer for the day time, and it does it job so well. At first I was worried because it contains ceramid and I thought it may be too much for day time, but not at all. Hydrates my skin properly. I haven’t experienced any break outs because of this product. I’ll keep using it. Great for my skin!
