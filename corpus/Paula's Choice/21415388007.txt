I don’t use this on my face. I use this on my legs to help with razor bumps i get from shaving. I put it all over my legs every night and then moisturize and i don’t get as many razor bumps as i used to. I also use this on my upper arms where i have KP and have seen it start to work well. I’m just taking off a star because i have to use it every night because if i skip one day i will get razor bumps again and the price is too high for 4 oz. Other than that it’s my holy grail :) nan
