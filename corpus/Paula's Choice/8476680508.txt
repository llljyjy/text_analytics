This product really did it for me. My dark spots are definitely so much lighter and I honestly also feel like my skin looks smoother. It was really nice finding a product for my oily and sensitive skin as sometimes I feel people overlook oily skin as being sensitive as well. It did not burn or make me purge either! must have for oily and acne prone sensitive skin
