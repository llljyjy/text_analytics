This is my favorite moisturizer! I have very dry, sensitive skin and I find that despite the ultra light texture it leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day or night. I can also use this following serums or retinol cream without pilling. I’ve used several other moisturizers from Paula’s Choice and other brands like Drunk Elephant, this is hands down my favorite, I’m just finished my third tube! Light AND super hydrating!
