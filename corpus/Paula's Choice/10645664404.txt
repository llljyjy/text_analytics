I’m 30 with large pores and oily acne-prone skin and this is the only product that has worked for me! I used to use Aveeno’s 2% salicylic acid cleansing bar but it was discontinued years ago. I’ve tried so many products since and they’ve ALL been irritating. This doesn’t irritate my skin and my pores look non-existent after only 2 days of use! My acne is goi g away!!!! Holy Grail!
