I’ve been using this moisturizer in the evening for two weeks and it really does make my skin bright, moisturized, and supple. Instructions say to use AM & PM but I use a Vit C serum in the AM so I skipped. There might not be any added scent but it certainly has a scent I just can’t place what it is. Other reviews said they required two pumps for face/neck coverage but I found that one pump was plenty. nan
