The Paula’s Choice Cleansing Balm is my absolute favorite. It’s so effective and melts my makeup off effortlessly without irritating my eczema prone skin. It removes foundation, eyeshadow, and any dirt and oil from the skin without leaving a film. It’s the perfect first cleanse step to any skincare routine. nan
