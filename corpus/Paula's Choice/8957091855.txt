It’s been a challenge trying to find a sunscreen that works for me, but this checks all my boxes! I’m breast feeding so I try and stick to mineral sunscreens. This sunscreen doesn’t smell, blends nicely, doesn’t feel heavy and doesn’t break me out! The tint is pretty blurring but can sometimes leave a cast if I put too much on. I’m a light-medium skin tone for reference. It works great under makeup though and I pretty much use it as my foundation. Not greasy and a natural matte finish. I probably wouldn’t go for it if you suffer from super dry skin or have a lot of dry patches. Most tinted mineral sunscreens will cling to dryness. But overall it’s a great sunscreen to try! checks all my boxes!
