This is the first wver product I’ver ever tried from the Paula’s choice and I really liked this one so far. It’s lightweight and quick absorbing. Although, I have very sensitive skin so I’ve used this serum only 2 times a week and feel like this is very gentle compared to other serums. So far so good. Very gentle
