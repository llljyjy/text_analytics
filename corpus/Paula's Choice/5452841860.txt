I have always suffered with dry flaky skin till I started to use this product! It has changed my skin In the best way possible. It does tingle or burn alittle at first but my skin has gotten use to it. I don’t feel like it’s really helped with blackheads but if I use this under my foundation, it gives me a beautiful application! I’m already on my second large bottle! staple skincare product for dry skin
