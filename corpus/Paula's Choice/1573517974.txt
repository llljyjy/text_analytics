I finally tried the CLINICAL 1% Retinol Treatment by Paulaâ€™s Choice. My first impression is that the pump is wonderful, one pump is the perfect amount for my face (usually it dispenses way too much in other brands). After using the product for 2 weeks, I noticed clearer pores and my skin looks less discolored (discoloration from minor acne scars). No strong scent. nan
