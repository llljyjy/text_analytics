This is one of those niacinamides that actually controls oil! With less oil, pores don’t look as pronounced. My fave way to use it is before retinols to reduce irritation. The texture is thin, light, and sinks in quickly. Works great under makeup and I haven’t seen it pill with any of my products. Actually controls oil!
