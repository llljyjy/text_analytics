Paulaâ€™s Choice products have never let me down and after trying this, that stays true! I was expecting just a thick overnight acne cream, before trying this, but it has an almost glass looking applicator and the consistency is a clear, thick liquid that does not burn upon applying! I used this on a small pimple and it was completely gone the next day! Must-have!
