Iâ€™ve used the 20% Clinical Solution and I loved it. This is a bit lighter so great for beginners or to adjust your skin to adding niacinamide. I love that it absorbs quickly on the skin and that it is fragrance free. It does a well job in terms of reducing oiliness of the skin, uneven texture and tone. For me personally the 20% Clinical Solution is better. Great for starting to use niacnamide
