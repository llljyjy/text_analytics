I really wanted to love this. Every single time I wore this, it clogged my pores and gave me 5+ new breakouts. I tried wearing it with and without makeup. I tried removing at night by double and triple cleaning with micellar water, cleansing balms, and water-based cleansers. Right when I stopped using this, no more breakouts. Positives are that it doesnâ€™t have a strong smell and sits well under makeup. Not for sensitive/acne-prone skin
