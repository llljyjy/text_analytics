I’ve been using this product for quite a while now and have had great results on my skin. The exfoliant does a wonderful job of smoothing the skin and even adding a slight glow. I have had acne for years now, as do most teens, and this worked well to really penetrate my skin. For those wondering about the best application method, I have cotton pads to apply this product in the past and found that the product would run out much sooner, and wouldn’t penetrate my skin as much. I believe the best way to use this product is to pour a couple of drops into your hands and gently pat the liquid into your skin, works wonders for me. Wonderful for Teen Acne
