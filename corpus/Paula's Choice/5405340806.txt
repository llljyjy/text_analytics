I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I chose this product because I wanted something that would improve my skin texture and tone. I have been using this product for 4 weeks now and I will say within a week a saw major changes in my pores. My pores got significantly smaller. My face also looked clearer. Less bumps. My coworker even mentioned how my face looked so clear and asked me what I was using. I told her about Paulaâ€™s Choice, she has been going through stress pimples due to work. Within a week her face also cleared up but even better, her pimple dark spots also started clearing up and disappearing. We both noticed this exfoliate did dry out our skin a bit and also gave us a feeling of tightness, but too tight as if we got a face lift lol. so we ended up using it every other day and that seemed to solve that issue. Personally I would recommend this product if you want clearer skin and smaller pores. One thing is that I do still have texture on my forehead, but not on my cheek bones anymore. So I will continue to use it and hope my forehead texture goes away. One negative is that this has a weird smell, kind of medical, but worth it for a clearer face :) Pic #1 4 weeks pic #2 with product, first week using it Great for big pores!
