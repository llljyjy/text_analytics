I have issues with acne on my neck (the dreaded acne that many people get in their 30’s, not fun) but after a week, I could see that my skin had calmed down. Even my housemates were like “How did your neck clear up so fast?“ Now, after three weeks with this product, I don’t have any new zits, my old ones cleared up right away, and all my other non-problem areas look better than ever - and my face is soft and smooth. With continued use, I imagine that the quicker cell turnover, I won’t have as many uneven areas on my neck from my acne. Paula’s Choice has changed my skin and given me more confidence! Game Changer!
