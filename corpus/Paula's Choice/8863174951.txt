Wow this actually is a cleansing balm in a tube!? And done well?I’ve tried other options in this category and found them to be awkward to work with (too thick for the tube, basically). I really have to give it to Paula’s Choice as this was done well. As a precaution, it’s done so well that if you’re like me and used to less-optimal renditions of this category…don’t squeeze the tube too hard! A little goes a long way, and it effectively removes every trace of skincare or makeup. It also doesn’t leave a film (my pet peeve).In short, it’s an excellent option if you like cleansing balms but are looking for that concept in a squeeze tube! nan
