This is really a great product, you noticeably see a difference in skin texture and pores. Best to keep in mind though that dry and/or sensitive skin people should be cautious; I have combination skin yet found it to suck all the moisture out of my face if I waited too long after to apply my serum and/or moisturizer. The reason I knock off one star is because I found the product to leave a oily residue after application, which is why I wait some time before applying serum/moisturizer. It is not a huge deal, but I would not say itâ€™s something that goes unnoticed. Good except for residue
