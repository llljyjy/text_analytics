This is the first time I’m trying any product from Paula’s Choice. The 10% niacinamide booster is a very concentrated formula. The serum feels a bit intense for my skin. I don’t feel any tingle or burning feeling, but it is stronger than what I am used to. To reduce the intensity, I have been using the serum on top of another serum or mixing it in with a moisturizer. it’s been working better like that. It has not broken me out. The serum comes in a clear liquidity form. Overall, I notice a smoother texture in my skin. The appearance of my pores and the texture of my skin looks and feels smoother. This is not something I would use on a daily basis, maybe more like a treatment and not all over the face and just on concentrated areas. For me personally I prefer products that are not as intense. Works but a tad strong
