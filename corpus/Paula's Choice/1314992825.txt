I’m loving this 10% Azelaic Acicid Booster and the magic it does for my skin! To begin its potent yet gentle on my skin which I love. The formula is a lightweight cream which I love and absorbs nicely. The product made me look and feel amazing by addressing the uneven skin tone and texture I have which I’ve been trying with other products in vain to achieve! This product did it fast too because I was applying night and day. My dark spots are lighter for example and texture has improved too. My skin felt softer and more even toned as a result. My pore size I think have actually diminished not quite sure but it appears to be so and with continued use I’ll definitely continue to get even better results.  Definitely amazing product because it has added benefits for acne and redness too. I’m so happy it’s helped fade my dark spots and my uneven texture and feel I can honestly recommend this product given these results. Perfect for uneven skin tone and dark spots
