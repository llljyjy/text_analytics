i use this product once a week and have noticed a consistent difference in my skin. i get an occasional hormonal pimple or ingrown hair that tends to lead to hyperpigmentation. this product does a great job of keeping my pores unclogged during the period of my hormonal cycle when i produce more sebum which is when i am most prone to breakouts. this is the first menstrual cycle of my adult life where i have not had a pimple or ingrown hair. i have also noticed that my preexisting hyperpigmentation spots have reduced in their appearance. what i appreciate most about this product is that it is not drying and is gentle on my skin that is prone to irritation from products containing active ingredients. it is worth noting that while i do believe that this bha product has made a difference in my skin, my lifestyle changes may also be contributing to it as i committed to a vegan diet that excludes refined sugar and is rich in vitamin c and antioxidants at the same time that i began making this investment in my skincare. i will continue to purchase this product. a win for sensitive skin
