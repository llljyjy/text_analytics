I am very impressed with this treatment product. I love that it leaves my skin feeling instantly firmed and smoothed. I like that it can be worn under moisturizer with makeup or it may be used in the evening. The retinol seems to be powerful, yet non irritating to the skin. It gives my a skin a nice glow and makes my fine lines look much softer, I find it interesting that it contains Bakuchiol which is a plant extract that enhances retinol. I had not heard of this ingredient before. Great product. Happy to have found it. Retinol Wrinkle Reducer
