I don’t often write reviews, but chiming in here because I’m surprised by all the negative reviews. I did not love this when I first started using it because the texture/feel just isn’t as nice as other moisturizers. That said, when I use this at night I always wake up to such smooth and even-toned skin (I have some redness usually). Once I got past the silicone-feel, and gave it a change, I found it really made a positive difference in my skin. I only use this at night, after actives/serums, as it’s not the most pleasant texture for day time use. Made my skin smoother and more even-toned.
