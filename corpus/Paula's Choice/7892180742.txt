I like this so far! I have sensitive skin so I’ve only been using a couple days a week but I’m really liking it. Using retinol leaves my skin irritated and dry after one use and this one doesn’t. The texture is thick but spreads well. No burning or stingy. It has a strong scent but that disappears quickly nan
