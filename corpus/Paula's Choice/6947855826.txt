I love this sunscreen it has no fragrance is non greasy! I have problems with sunscreen being greasy, but not any more! Itâ€™s lightweight which is great for my combo skin. When I have more oily skin it can be also used as moisturizer. It also pairs wonderfully with moisturizer and makeup. This made me enjoy put sunscreen in my everyday routine. Changed my mind.
