I have been using this product for a few weeks and although I was really looking forward to super brightening my under eyes (especially with a toddler and little sleep) i haven’t noticed a huge difference! It feels nice going on but it hasn’t done what I was hoping for. Maybe I’m not using it long enough and wil continue but for now, it’s just so - so Not much difference unfortunately:(
