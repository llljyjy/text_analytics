I will buy this again and again. This scrub is amazing, gentle, moisturizing, all the good things. I love that it exfoliates without being abrasive. The little beads turn into such a gently creamy milky cleanser. This scrub is a game changer. I use chemical exfoliants daily, but sometimes after a day of makeup i just want a nice scrub. I love this and recommend it to anyone. Love.
