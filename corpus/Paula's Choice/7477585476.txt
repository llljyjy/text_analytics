First time trying this eye cream and I really liked it! I have very dry under eyes and this eye cream provided the hydration I needed. After applied it feels very refreshing and gives a cooling sensation. Which I enjoyed due to having puffy under eyes. I don’t have much darkness in my under eyes, but I do have dryness. And it’s definitely helped me. My concealer applies so smoothly and doesn’t crease after I set it. Thanks to the hydration and smoothness this eye cream has given me. I recommend 10/10 Amazing eye cream!
