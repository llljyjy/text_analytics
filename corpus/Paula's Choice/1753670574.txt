I bought the small one because I didn’t want to invest in another product that didn’t work. well this was an absolute surprise. so my issue is that my skin is so dry despite what I do, I had tons of dead skin everyday and little red bumps. First try and I noticed that the dead skin had decreased, and it feels like my HAs actually penetrates my skin. goodbye dead skin!
