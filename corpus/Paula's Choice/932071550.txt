I have very dry skin that tends to get rough patches of texture.  I have been using this product for 2 weeks to see if I can help smooth it out.  The texture of this serum is slightly sticky but it absorbs quickly.  I like to layer it with a moisturizer and I do think my skin texture is improving a bit. I canâ€™t wait to see what happens after I finish the bottle. nan
