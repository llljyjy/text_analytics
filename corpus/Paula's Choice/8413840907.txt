I have bad hormonal acne along my jaw line (especially around my period) and as a result, I suffer from post inflammatory hyper pigmentation while those blemishes heal. Vitamin C is one of my favorite ingredients to help fade these spots and I am a huge fan of the results Iâ€™ve gotten from this serum. It takes patience and consistency but I have noticed my jaw line looking less inflamed for less time than normal. I think this is a great product for the value. Great for hyperpigmentation
