Have historically always loved Paula’s Choice products and her mission. That said, I haven’t had a great experience with this moisturizer. I agree with other reviews that it tends to make your skin feel “tight“ afterwards. My skin is oily/combination, but I think this is a great product for more oily skin types. It does absorb quickly and wears well under makeup, but it has not helped with breakouts or making my skin feel moisturized so I likely will not buy again. Better for Oily Skin only
