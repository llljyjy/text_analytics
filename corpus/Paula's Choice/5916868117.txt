I had been searching for a new retinol to try out and I happen to run across Paula’s Choice. I’ve seen so many amazing reviews about the brand alone so I decided to give it a go! This retinol has been so far, great! I apply it in the evening after cleansing and right before moisturizing. It feels really nice on the skin. Absorbs nicely and is very soothing. I do use this every other evening, not every night and after 2 weeks, I’ve seen some improvement in my fine lines on my forehead as well as an even skin tone and not so harsh texture which was my main concern. Definitely recommend incorporating a retinol into your skincare routing as early as your mid-late twenties! Great product!
