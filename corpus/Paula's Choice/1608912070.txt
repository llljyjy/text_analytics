I really don’t have skin issues, other than the occasional monthly pop up of a blemish or two.  It happened to time out I was able to use this on one.  I put it directly on the blemish at night before bed, so it could just do it’s thing while I slept.  It seemed to reduce redness, and dried it out pretty quickly.  My son used on pores, and seemed to help tighten his skin around his nose as well. Awesome
