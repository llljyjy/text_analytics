This is a great niacinamide serum! I have been using niacinamide (at a lower percentage) in my routine for a while and it works really well for my skin. This ingredient is really good for balancing the skin and helping to control oil production. This serum was a great addition to my routine! It layered well with my other products and definitely delivered all the benefits Iâ€™ve come to expect from niacinamide products! nan
