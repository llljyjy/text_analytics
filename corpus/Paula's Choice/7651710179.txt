I’m never let down by Paula’s Choice! I would say I have more combination skin that’s starting to go from oily to dry as I get older. I’m very particular about cleansers and I need them to lather but I don’t want them to strip the face. I like the lightweight cream formula because it lathers up well but doesn’t strip your face like other foam cleansers I’ve used in the past. After cleansing it does feel like my face is free from the dirt/debris of the day and ready for skincare. I have eczema prone skin and I havnt seen a change in any redness or sensitivity either which is always a plus (especially with no fragrance!). It’s a really gentle cleanser and I’d recommend for anyone with sensitive skin looking to add a great first step to their routine. Great for sensitive skin
