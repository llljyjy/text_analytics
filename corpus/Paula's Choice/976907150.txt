I have oily skin with a little bit of acne scarring that is almost completely faded now. This Treatment has a watery serum consistency. It absorbs well and doesn’t pill with my other products in my current routine, which is always a great thing! I find myself having to adjust my routine every time I incorporate something new, so I’m really happy to report that this plays well with others. I have l somewhat textured skin with larger pores on my nose and forehead, and this treatment makes them appear smaller. nan
