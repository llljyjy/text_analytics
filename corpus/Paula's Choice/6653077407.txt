I’m not sure how I feel about this yet.. it’s only been two weeks & I haven’t noticed much of a difference besides a spot where I’m purging. This is my first retinol & I’ve been using it every 3 days at night. Product absorbs well, has no scent & doesn’t pill with my other products. I’m going to finish the bottle & power through the purge stage to hopefully see full results. Need more time
