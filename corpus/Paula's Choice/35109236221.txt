The C5 Super Boost Eye Cream smells like oranges and has vitamin C, which is a wonder for undereye bags. The consistency is almost like a thin Lotion. The results were visible after just a few days. It was hydrating and smooth. It wore beautifully under makeup and helped with creasing in the undereye area also. I find this line to be more effective than most brands and it’s a favorite of mine. I think it’s incredible. It does have vitamin C, so be sure to avoid using with retinol ingredients. Wear during the am and cleanse at night before your pm routine. That goes for all vitamin C skincare products. It's your choice!
