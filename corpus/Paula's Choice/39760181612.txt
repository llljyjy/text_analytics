Great Addition to my Skincare Routine !! I normally don’t use toners in my skincare routine because I personally felt like they’ve stripped my skin and left it dry. So glad I gave this one a shot because it has has completely changed my outlook on toners. The Resist toner is awesome , it is super lightweight and  hydrating and leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. I feel as though since incorporating this product into my routine my skin is definitely more radiant and plump, I can definitely see a difference !! Love It !!! nan
