This is the best Niacinamide serum I’ve used. I love how elegant the formulation and texture is. It’s light and watery instead of sticky like some other niacinamide serums are. I either use it straight up as a serum or add a few drops to my emulsion before moisturizer. The after photo is after about two weeks of use. nan
