I love this serum. It’s been a repurchase of mine several times. I think the 10% is my sweet spot to keeping my pores balanced, clear and overall a brighter complexions. I apply this right after I cleanse and tone my skin. It’s super lightweight so soaks up into my skin and layers nicely in my skincare routine AM and PM. nan
