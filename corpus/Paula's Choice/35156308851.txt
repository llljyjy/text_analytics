I really enjoyed the light creamy texture of this product. Did not feel heavy nor sticky. I also did not experience any harsh irritation like I usually do when using a retinol. My skin felt smooth and soft for several days after using it once. Texture looked smoother as well. Great product from Paulaâ€™s Choice! nan
