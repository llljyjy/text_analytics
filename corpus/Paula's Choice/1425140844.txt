I tried this based on a recommendation, and while I hadn’t like another PC sunscreen I tried, I did love this one. It’s lightweight, doesn’t leave a white cast, doesn’t leave my face super shiny, and doesn’t pill under makeup. The only thing I would change is the price; otherwise it is perfect. Great Daily Sunscreen
