Waste of Money ! Save yourself the headache sis & buy something else . Like others said the moisturizer itself is fine but the packaging is trash . Before the tip breaks off completely , it’ll start to pull from the base & leak product with plenty left in there ! The formula is already runny thin so it becomes this super messy , wasteful Trash . Unfortunate because who doesn’t want a 50 SPF moisturizer for combo skin ?? Usually a fan but Paula dropped the ball on this one . Cmon Paula Girl Get It Together
