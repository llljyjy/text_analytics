I like this a lot specifically for my under eye & lips- I dab both areas with a little water first before patting some of this on & then top it with a little aquaphor & its wonderful for dry, tight, crepey skin. I had some red irritation & roughness under one of my eyes and after one night doing the above the redness is gone, the slight swelling & roughness are almost non existent now- both areas plump, hydrated & smooth now. While I love it on the rest of my face I do have some issues with it pilling under makeup or sunscreen so I only use it on my whole face at night maybe once a week when I wont need either in the morning. I use it for my under eye & lips!
