this product is a must have! i have extremely sensitive, acne prone, and oily skin, and this is the only exfoliant that works for me; it targets all my problems with no irritation! i use it 1-2 times per week, applying it to my palms and tapping it in. it has transformed my skin for the better! yes, itâ€™s pricey, but an entire bottle has lasted me a year! MUST HAVE
