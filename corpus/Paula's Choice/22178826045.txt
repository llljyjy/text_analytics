It definitely does prevent new (dark/deeper) discoloration from forming! The older hyperpigmentation is taking a longer time to fade but I do notice a very very small change. I also noticed how my skin is more hydrated, more even in tone and smoother. But it can cause irritation (my neck is not used to acids so as a result it is irritated esp post scratch). So be careful and follow instructions. Hopefully with continued use, it will do its magic on those stubborn dark spots. nan
