Perfect toner for a dry/oily combination skin! It leaves my face, feeling amazing, clean and glowing. I use it after I cleanse my face to remove any leftover make up and it does an amazing job. This is my second product using from the brand, and I think thatâ€™s so far in is amazing super affordable and effective. Very impressed. A must try!
