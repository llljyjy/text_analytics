I have acne prone skin and still get acne. This has helped so much with fading my acne scars! I get big pores on my cheeks and I think this has shrunk them a little! I don’t know if I’m tricking myself into thinking that but my skin has been looking better ever since I started!! I think there are definitely cheaper alternatives though Beware of purging
