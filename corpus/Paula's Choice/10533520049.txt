This booster is a great addition to any skincare routine. I have used it alone and mixed in my moisturizer and it’s not sticky and doesn’t leave me shiny, it’s more of a liquid than a serum which is great because it absorbs completely. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and have already seen spots start to fade. Great for spots and easy to use
