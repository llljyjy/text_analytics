This is the first product that ever made me take the time to write a review. I’ve tried so many and this is THE BEST one I’ve ever used in my life(at least for my skin) !!!!! For reference I have sensitive combination skin, oily around the nose area but a little dry on other areas especially forehead. This product did not make my skin feel dry at all, it’s actually hydrating and at the same time controls oil and minimizes my pores and blackheads. My skin is sensitive but this did not irritate my skin at all. I LOVE IT! 10/10 PERFECT AND TOTALLY RECOMMENDED
