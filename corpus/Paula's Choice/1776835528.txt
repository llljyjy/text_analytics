I’ve been using retinol for the past couple of years, and this option from Paula’s Choice really stands out. It absorbs easily, is extremely gentle, and hasn’t caused any flaky skin. When using it I like to follow with a thick moisturizer and in the morning my skin is glowing. Highly recommend! High quality retinol!
