This new vitamin-C moisturizer exceeded my expectations, and I was eager to try it. I’ll still add a couple of drops of the vitamin C booster to it. It has a lovely, airy feel that quickly absorbs into skin. My skin is much less oily and this moisturizer provides the ideal amount of moisture without becoming heaviness. It withstands my powder makeup wonderfully. This is now my go-to daily moisturizer, followed by Paula’s Choice’s tinted SPF 30. faithful client right here!
