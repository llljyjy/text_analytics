I have been using this product for two weeks and even though I haven’t noticed huge differences yet, my skin definitely feels and looks smoother and even toned. For a retinol product it is super gentle and I didn’t experience any bad reactions or irritation. It doesn’t feel sticky or leaves any residue behind. It also absorbs super fast. Really excited to see longterm use results and totally recommend. A great find!
