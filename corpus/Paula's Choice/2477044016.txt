This product caught my eye initially because it contains both Retinol and Bakuchiol.  I used it only a couple times a week at first to prevent my skin from becoming irritated, and then I slowly increased the use at night.  I liked the consistency of the serum, as it easily absorbed into my skin without an oily residue. Iâ€™ve noticed my skin feels and looks firmer, and areas around my eyes and mouth appear more plump, with less fine lines. Great product with both Retinol and Bakuchiol
