My skin is loving this vitamin c moisturizer! It feels softer and more hydrated and looks brighter after just a few days of use! It’s lightweight enough that it doesn’t leave my oily skin looking greasy. Absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky. Definitely a new staple in my skincare routine! nan
