Disclosure: I have very poor sleeping habits, which a cream alone cannot fix. That being said, I think it works! When I do get adequate rest my usually permanent eyebags look much less drastic. May look the same to me in the mirror sometimes, but in pics I have noticed the difference, even without any concealer or foundation. Feels good on the skin too. I believe in the cream! nan
