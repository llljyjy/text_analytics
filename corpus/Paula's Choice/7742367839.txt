This isn’t a bad product, but given the intense hype around it, I’ve been disappointed by my experience with it. The main thing I don’t like is the finish — for some reason nobody ever mentions that this has a greasy texture. The other thing I don’t like is its failure to deliver any significant improvement to my skin. Even when I used it daily, I didn’t see it really improving my acne. I’m currently on my third or fourth bottle because I use it right before a pure vitamin c serum: this product’s pH helps give the l-ascorbic acid a better chance of actually being absorbed by the skin. Obviously this exfoliant must be formulated well to be so many people’s holy grail, but it underperforms for my skin. nan
