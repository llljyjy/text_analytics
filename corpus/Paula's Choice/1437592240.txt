I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I love this cleanser! The pump makes it super easy to use. The formula is great too. It gets all my makeup off (I use a cleansing balm first and double cleanse with this). And I wear a lot of makeup! I love that it foams but it doesn’t strip my skin. My skin feel hydrated after using this cleanser. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a good cleanser that really works and doesn’t strip your skin! Great cleanser!
