I absolutely loved this vitamin c eye cream from Paulaâ€™s Choice. It is reasonably priced and loved the packaging too.Texture feels light on the skin and does not feel heavy or greasy. Absorbs nice into the skin and give an instant smooth and bright under eyes. So far I am enjoying this eye cream. nan
