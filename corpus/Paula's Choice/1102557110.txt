I think this product is a genius idea. If you have a favorite moisturizer or serum in your routine, but it doesn’t have niacinamide as an ingredient, all you have to do is add a drop or two of this Paula’s Choice booster! It’s so easy and makes so much sense! Niacinamide is one of the best ingredients for my skin. It protects against sun damage and minimizes fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and appearance of pore size. My skin feels so nice and plump when I use this. I add it to my moisturizer in the morning and night. It’s fragrance free and non-irritating. I will be repurchasing this over and over, I think this is the best product to come out this year!  Great booster product to add to your fave serum!
