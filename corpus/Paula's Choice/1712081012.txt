Rarely do I get excited about a cleanser because they usually do the same thing. The Paula’s Choice foaming cleanser, however, deserves a special shout-out. Simply put, it’s one of the best cleansers I’ve used. There are 3 key ingredients:- Hyaluronic Acid: helps with hydration- Ceramides: protects skin’s barrier to avoid that tight feeling- Aloe: calms skinWhat I love about this product:- The texture! The texture starts out as a light cream but as you massage onto your face, it foams up into a nice soft lather.- It effectively removes makeup and sunscreen! No need to double cleanse because this cleanser will dissolve and remove makeup and sunscreen. With my busy lifestyle, constantly on the run, any timesaver is welcome!- Leaves my skin soft and smooth!  Immediately after rinsing off, I can feel how smooth and soft it leaves my face. I am talking silky soft! - My face feels hydrated! After the first time I used this, I applied toner and serum but I actually forgot to apply moisturizer as I got distracted but my face still felt hydrated!  - No issues for my sensitive skin!  I love when I use a product that doesn’t irritate my skin. It should be a basic requirement but it isn’t always the case. I am so glad I had the chance to try this cleanser. It is welcome addition to my skincare routine. Nice cleanser!
