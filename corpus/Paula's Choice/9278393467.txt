I’m on week 4 of using this toner, wanted to give it time before reviewing, and WOW! I’d been using only witch hazel prior and the difference is incredible! It makes my face feel squeaky clean, and immediately evens out my skin tone slightly. It’s definitely helped combat some breakouts and gives my skin a nice, healthy glow. My only complaint is the packaging- I wish we could see how much product is left. Other than that, 10/10. Sensitive skin approved! Sensitive Skin Approved
