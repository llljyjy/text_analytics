I love this product. I think it’s a little pricey but it’s the one my derm recommended. It’s small but it lasted me around 4 months before having to repurchase. Smell is not too overpowering but it’s definitely there. If you have exposed breakouts that you like just popped it might burn a little. But other than that this product is good. nan
