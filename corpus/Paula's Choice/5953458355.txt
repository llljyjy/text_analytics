This is one of the best cleansers that I have ever used. The texture and appearance of the formula surprised me upon first use. It’s a creamy texture and it almost looks like lotion when it comes out of the pump. It’s very luxurious and creamy. It foams up nicely when I lather it with water and it’s very gentle on my skin. After use my face doesn’t feel tight or stiff as it has previously when using other cleansers. I can tell that this one does not strip the natural oils entirely off of my face. I will definitely be repurchasing once I run out. a Luxurious Cleanser at a fair price
