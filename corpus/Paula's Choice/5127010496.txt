I was looking for a new toner for winter that was adequately hydrate and tone bony skin and this is it! This product doesnâ€™t strip my natural oils and adds hydration back into my skin in the winter months. The scent is minimal and the consistency is perfect for a cotton round. Would definitely recommend! Great for hydration!
