I like the lightweight texture of this moisturizer. It feels like a hydrating nourishing gel cream. It wears nicely underneath makeup. I like the idea of a vitamin c moisturizer since I always use a vitamin c serum in my morning routine, however I wish this had a percentage higher than 5%. Ideally at least 10%. I am curious if 5% is enough for noticeable results. Overall I enjoy this moisturizer but question if the low percentage is effective. nan
