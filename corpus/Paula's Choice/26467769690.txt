I’ve been wanting to find something like this for a while and I’m happy that I finally did! I started using this every other night after washing my face for the first few weeks and gradually moved up to nightly applications. 2 pumps is the perfect amount to cover my face. I love how light this serum is and it doesn’t seem to have a scent! It goes on easily and doesn’t feel heavy. My skin color looks more uniform after using for several weeks! I’m super please with the reduction of spots! Super happy with reduction of spots!
