This product is great! From the simple packaging to the quality feel of the bottle itself, A+I use it right after toning & it absorbs really well. It makes my skin feel more hydrated & nourished. I’m very fair so any pigmentation shows up on me, so thankfully this product was able to calm my reddened skin. I definitely think this one is worth trying! I’ve been using for roughly two weeks and my acne scarring has really calmed down. nan
