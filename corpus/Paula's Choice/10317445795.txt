I have sensitive skin that becomes red and inflamed relatively easily. So because of this I am generally wary of trying exfoliants. The formulation of this product is amazing and does not cause me irritation. I also love that itâ€™s fragrance free. I noticed smaller pores in just one week and have been using the product every other day for about 2 weeks. In that time, I have not experienced any adverse effects. This OG exfoliant is worth the hype, for sure! Perfection in an exfoliant
