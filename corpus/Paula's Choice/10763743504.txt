This is such a wonderful cleansing balm with the softest of balmy texture to it. I like how this smoothed off all of my makeup as soon as I massages it into the areas of my wet skin. I easily saw how the makeup was melting off immediately and once I did my rinse the makeup came off pretty qyickly in just about seconds. I am soo happy to have this cleansing balm because it ho estly takes off even the most stubborn of mascara or lippie. I enjoy this and especially how soft and smooth my skin feels afterwards! Wonderfully cleansed
