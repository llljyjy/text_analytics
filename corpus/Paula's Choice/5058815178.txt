This has slowly become my holy grail SPF. I’ve been trying a lot of products suggested by popular you tubers and had settled on the Krave beauty SPF - until sunscreen gate happened. This has been the closest thing I’ve found to that product in terms of texture, results (doesn’t dry out my combo/normal skin, wears well under makeup without pilling, doesn’t cause any breakouts), while still having the SPF factor that I want. For reference though, my skin does not tolerate the physical sunscreen of the same line from this brand, I get instant breakouts. So if you’re looking for a nice fluid, moisturizing, non-pilling, reapplies relatively easily over makeup with a beauty sponge, high SPF sunscreen, this is the one I keep coming back to time and again. nan
