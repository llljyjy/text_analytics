Product was gifted for review.I stared using it for a bit over a week now. The serum has an amazing texture. It sinks into the skin leaving it hydrated and so soft! I also notice that it minimized my pores! I use 2-3 drops and apply. Just fyi i have acne oily skin type, that might be sensitive to some products. I haven’t notice any breakouts or bad changes in my skin. So far we been liking each other and that’s great. AMAZING
