After using this for about two weeks I can see that my skin looks healthier overall, smoother & definitely a brighter more even skintone. I started using this every 3rd night to be cautious. I am now using every other night. I haven’t experienced any redness, peeling or irritation! This has a lovely, creamy texture that applies easily & absorbs without any sticky feel left over.  I follow with hydrating serum & moisturizer. So far an amazing addition! I love the triple ingredient effect with retinol, bakuchiol & peptides.  Another great product from Paula’s Choice! Great results!
