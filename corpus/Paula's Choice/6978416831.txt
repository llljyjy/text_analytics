I truly love this product! The first time I applied it to my skin I immediately knew I was going to like it! It feels almost water-like once you put it on your skin and it has such a lightweight consistency. I’ve been using this moisturizer morning and night pretty consistently and love how healthy it makes my skin look and feel! The “before” pic is where I have my hair down and the “after” pic is where I’m wearing a white shirt. I forgot to take a before picture but found this one from a couple weeks ago and you can see how red and dull my face was before using this moisturizer! It’s really helped my skin just look and feel firm as well. A new favorite!
