I’m sure this toner might work for some people, but for me, it completely dried out my skin and caused the worst breakout I’ve had since doing a round of Accutane almost 10 years ago. I hardly ever write reviews but I seriously want to caution anyone who has had a history of cystic acne to stay far away from this product. I didn’t believe the reviews here and I wish I had because it’s taken me 3 weeks to get my skin back under control. CAUSES BREAKOUTS
