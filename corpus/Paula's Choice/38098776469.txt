i’ve been using this for a month and have noticed my redness around my acne scars has reduced. i don’t think it’s a huge life changer or that it really prevents or treats acne but it does seem to reduce my inflammation/hyper pigmentation. i definitely will use up the bottle but i’m not sure if i’ll repurchase nan
