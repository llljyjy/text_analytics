I am not new to chemical exfoliants so I began by using this exfoliant every other night and wow have I seen a difference! This exfoliant leaves my skin feeling refreshed and so much smoother. I have previously used the T.L.C Sukari Babyfacial exfoliant by Drunk Elephant and for almost 1/3 of the price, Paula’s Choice is better. After putting it on your skin it does feel sticky for the first 20 minutes or so but after it sinks in it does not bother me. I use it overnight and I notice a difference in the morning. This exfoliant will not “cure” cystic acne overnight but definitely does decrease the size and redness of those deep blind pimples. My skin did dry out but not dry out “uncomfortably” from this exfoliant. Meaning, I didn’t have skin flaking off or feel like I just burnt my skin off. Instead mu face will felt little tight and not as oily. My skin has a new glow to it from this exfoliant that others have pointed out! Best Exfoliant for the Price!!
