i have extremely sensitive skin that’s also oily & this product didn’t cause any further irritation. i usually can’t wear makeup bc it clogs my pores really bad & my skin looks awful. recently i used a new moisturizer that is too heavy i think & applied the bliss block tinted sunscreen on top & my skin was filled with tons of blackheads, whiteheads & some puss filled acne. i use the cerave SA cleanser bc i know SA breaks down oil deep in the pores. i knew i needed something a bit stronger & found this product from Skincare by Hyram on YT & i’m soo glad i tried this. it leaves the skin glowy & healthy, but its much better than a physical exfoliant bc it doesn’t do damage like a face scrub. it’s literally a liquid exfoliant that does everything it claims on the bottle. i’ve only used it twice, but am already seeing a very small change in my skin. can’t wait to continue to use it (& wear sunscreen during the day ofc) and see how much my pores, texture & skin tone improve over time. senstive/oily skin
