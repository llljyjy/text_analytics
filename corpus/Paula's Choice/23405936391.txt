I was struggling with clogged pores for the longest time (for years!). I used everything I possible could like SA, Azelaic acid, etc, but nothing seemed to ever work. My friend recommended this product and I got the travel size. BEST PURCHASE EVER. I have sensitive skin and it doesnâ€™t respond much to products, but this one was the game changer. My skin got so smooth and all the black heads around my cheeks, nose, and forehead area disappeared after a month of consistent use! Game changer and worth it!
