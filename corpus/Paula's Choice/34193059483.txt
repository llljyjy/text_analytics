So to be honest, I didn’t notice any change on my skin. I have oily acne-prone skin, with cystic acne as well as your average white/black heads, and I haven’t seen any change. I used it for a couple weeks and didn’t feel or see much of a change. However, I’m rating it at 3 stars because this product does have an amazing ingredient list and is awesome, it just didn’t work super well for me personally. nan
