I am always hesitant to bring new products into my routine, but I really like this! I have super sensitive skin and the first time I used it, I used probably too much and my skin felt dry. The next time I tried to use it, I used less and applied a heavy moisturizer and it made my skin look absolutely gorgeous and didn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s really helpful for breakouts! 10/10!
