This has become a regular in my routine.! Pricey but worth it. I’m currently going onto my 4th bottle. Even my mom loves it. It states to use it once or twice a day WHICH I did and I ended up ruining my skin barrier lol (learning process) Don’t do that. Now I use it 3 times a week only at night and my skin looks so much better in the AM. LOVE IT .! CAN’T LIVE W/O IT NOW
