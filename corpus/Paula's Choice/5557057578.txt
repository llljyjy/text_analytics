This is my first time using an Azelaic Acid cream and I am incredibly impressed by this product. This has a white cream consistency that is very easy to apply and blend into the skin. It disappears almost instantly. After using it consistently, I started noticing a huge difference in my skin texture within three to four days. The texture on my forehead that I always battle with was almost gone. I didnâ€™t think there was much difference in the pores on my face until I looked at a side by side and realized how much smaller and less gunky they were on my nose. Definitely work your way up on this if you have sensitive skin. Absolutely impressed by this and will definitely purchase when I run out. Powerful Product
