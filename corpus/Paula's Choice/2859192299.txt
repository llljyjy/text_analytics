Believe me when I say I have tried hundreds of sunscreens. This takes it all. With a watery consistency, this sunscreen absorbs quickly, spreads evenly and it takes very little product to cover my face and neck. There is zero white cast, zero pulling to the spread because it is so runny, and I feel firm, glowy and protected. I also have dry skin and am prone to perioral dermatitis, especially from sunscreens, and this keeps me hydrated and my pores do not clog. This can be used as a primer for makeup but I like to put it on in the morning before my primer. Hands down my favorite sunscreen I have ever purchased! Do not hesitate on this one, Paulaâ€™s Choice does it again! Incredible silky sunscreen.
