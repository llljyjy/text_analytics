To be totally transparent, I find PC products to be hit or miss, but I’m really digging this dispensable cleansing balm. I hate sticking my fingers in a jar and I find the tube packaging easy to deal with in my bathroom. Of course the product is good too–it’s such a soft, gentle balm with mild mild fragrance and makes my face so clean and soft. One of my favorites I’ve tried from them. nan
