The C5 Super Boost Moisturizer with 5% vit C & hexapeptide 5, overall a very good Moisturizer, lightweight & doesn’t clogged my pores or caused any breakouts. The texture is very good, creamy but not oily or heavy. Have been using it for two weeks and my skin definitely feel smoother, hydrated & healthy looking; you can notice that is shinier & less dull looking and I’m only using the moisturizer. Also it works well under makeup. Great Moisturizer for 30’s combination skin
