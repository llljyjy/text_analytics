I really like this product. After a random breakout along my jawline (thanks to excessive use of a clarifying mask), I was able to calm the breakout in a few days with this and some coconut oil. I personally like this better than The Ordinaryâ€™s version as for some reason that product ALWAYS pills (no matter how much or little I use). Also great for battling rosacea! Non-drying. great for rosacea, acne, sensitive skin
