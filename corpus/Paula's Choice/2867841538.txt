Have been using this product for 5 months now and notice literally no difference with it. At first was using it every other night and it made my skin peel and dry out, regardless of what creams I used with it. Then I went down to twice a week and it still made my skin super dry, no difference with breakout, no difference in skin texture. Now I am down to once a week, and again, no difference to my skin at all. I would hope that it would at least shrink a break out or make it less red considering the ingredients, but breakouts and rest of the skin look exactly the same in the morning, skin just looks more dry. Not for me
