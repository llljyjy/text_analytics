I have been using this product for a few months now and can see a noticeable difference in how clean my pores are. I never knew how people kept their noses free of blackheads but this is the secret. Donâ€™t use every day because it will mess with your skin barrier. I alternate this, retinol, and hydrations nights with slugging and my skin looks so much better. No scent and dries down well. No more blackheads
