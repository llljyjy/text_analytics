I am always so excited to try out Paulaâ€™s Choice products. This cleanser is amazing on my dry skin.  Love the creamy texture and how it lathers . In winters I am always worried if a cleanser would make my skin super dry and this cleanser does it works nicely. My skin feels super clean without any feeling of dryness and stiffness. It does removes makeup and any dirt off my face without stripping off skins natural oil which is the best part. Highly recommend! Good one!
