So my skin has been loving vitamin C lately and I couldn’t wait to try this one! I was not disappointed at all. I love that this contains a concentrated 5 percent of vitamin C in its formula working to brighten my often dull skin, along with its firming and hydrating properties too. I also love that it supports the skin’s barrier which is so important to me. It feels wonderful on the skin, I apply this every morning, it absorbs quickly and sets a good canvas for makeup application. My skin definitely appears brighter since using and I’m excited to see long term results. Loving this C Cream!
