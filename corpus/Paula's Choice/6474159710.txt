Not for dry or normal skin. This cleanser dried my skin terribly and I dont even really have dry skin. Must moisturize right away. Would wake up dry too. It doesnt really even lather.. oddly enough it lathered with dry hands better. Creamy texture was nice. If it wasnt SOO drying I’d continue to finish the bottle but my skin isnt so dry anymore since i’ve stopped! not for dry or normal skin
