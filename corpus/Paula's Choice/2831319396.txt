I have never reviewed a product in my life - I have used Paula’s Choice for well over 10 years. I’ll be 33 this year and THIS product is a game changer. No more mindset of “scrubs = exfoliants” this a STAPLE in my routine. I use it twice per day once in the morning after toning and same in the evenings. My skin will NEVER go without this!!! Anyone battling texture issues, acne, dullness or anyone who has skin of any kind - everyone needs this product along with an entire routine from Paula’s! nan
