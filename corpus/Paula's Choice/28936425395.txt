I’ve tried so many cleansers but I always seem to keep coming back to this one. I’ve repurchased multiple times and I’m always happy with the results. Not too stripping. Perfect for my oily skin. Love the pump because I never pump out more than I need. Foams beautifully. Doesn’t burn my eyes. What else can I say? Always my go-to. Keep coming back to this one. Love it!
