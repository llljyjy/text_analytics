I love these products so much! The exfoliating formula is perfection and makes my skin feel so smooth the next morning. The Azaleic acid smells horrible but I swear it’s like gold in a bottle so I put up with the smell. It helps with redness and overall complexion beautifully. The retinol isn’t as immediately effective as the other two so I’m still waiting so say but overall this is a magnificent kit. Brilliant!
