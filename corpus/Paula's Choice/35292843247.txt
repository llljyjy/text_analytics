I have a combination skin - oily forehead and dry cheeks. I was excited to use this cleaner because it was listed for sensitive skin. once I use this cleaner all the area around my go dry, it did feel refreshing. I tried to like it, but my skin around lips and cheek went dry. hope this is helpful for some one. Good cleanser, but not for me
