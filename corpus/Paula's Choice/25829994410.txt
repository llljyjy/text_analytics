this product is my new holy grail. at first thought it was too expensive but i finally gave in and omg it was so worth it. i have no acne but severe and stubborn nose blackheads. i am not exaggerating when i say i have tried every single product and brand to get rid of them. this did it in ONE night. ONE. after a single use my nose was completely clear. i will continue to buy this forever even if the price goes up to $100. not to mention thereâ€™s a lot of product in the bottle. CLEARED MY BLACKHEADS INSTANTLY!!
