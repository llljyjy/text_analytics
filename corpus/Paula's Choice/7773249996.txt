this is a fantastic chemical exfoliant that does wonders for the skin. be careful though, it is possible to over use it and cause damage instead of good. I use this twice a week for best results and it helps with my oily sensitive skin that gets easily clogged pores. I do see a visible difference when I use it and when I donâ€™t. Do what feels right for your skin not what it says on the bottle nan
