I used a bottle of this serum and liked it last year. When it ran out I decided to try something different and wanted to use this one again. This time around it totally wrecked my skin. I had chemical burns on my cheeks for weeks and now have hyperpigmentation. The only explanation I can come up with is a quality control issue that resulted in a much higher percentage Vitamin C in the serum. Be careful! Quality control issue?
