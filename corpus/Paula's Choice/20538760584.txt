So far this is the first Vitamin C product that I’ve used that hasn’t broken me out. I have really sensitive, acne prone skin and Paula’s Choice never lets me down, which is why I decided to give this product a try. This moisturizer absorbs quickly and wears well under makeup - although it is important to allow it time to sink in (I wait about 10 mins after applying my skincare before I apply any makeup). I’ve only been using this for about a week so I haven’t seen any substantial results yet, but I’m really enjoying it and I’m so happy to have found a vitamin c that my skin can handle.If you’d like to see more reviews from me you can find me on Instagram and YouTube at tashpalmerofficial and on Tiktok at tashpalmer_ First Vitamin C to not break me out!
