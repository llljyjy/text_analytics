I already love Paula’s Choice products so knew I had to give this one a try! It did not disappoint. Retinol tends to be drying on the skin but this was manageable. I also truly saw a difference in my skin after using it for just a couple of weeks. A piece of advice-don’t use it every single night! I’d say every other and you’ll see a difference also! Great Product!
