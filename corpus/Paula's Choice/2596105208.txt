The texture of this toner is wonderful. It is a smooth milky texture with such a pleasant smell. I love Paula’s choice, have so many products of theirs I use daily. This toner is really great for those who don’t want to strip their skin instead want to gently tone while still keeping a healthy barrier . Makes my skin super soft but even more so I can tell the difference in my skin after using it how much more smooth and hydrated it is . Texture is wonderful
