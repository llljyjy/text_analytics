I have extremely oily skin and I live in a very humid climate. This is a great moisturizer for winter time or for when my skin is feeling a little dry. Itâ€™s not too heavy at all but packs enough punch to deliver the moisture that I need without contributing to the shine. I highly recommend this for anyone suffering with oily/acne prone skin. Pretty Good!
