I don’t normally use a toner in my routine but this one is so hydrating because it contains Hyaluronic acid. It’s not like a normal toner that is astringent and completely disrupts the skin barrier and natural oil! Im loving it so far! It’s also very gentle and doesn’t leave my skin red! Wonderful hydrating toner!
