I received a sample of this from Sephora and I absolutely love it. After just one use, I could already see a big difference in my skin. At first right after I applied it, I didnâ€™t really like it, because it left an oily residue on my skin, but it sinks into the skin really nicely and the oiliness disappears after a few minutes. This leaves my skin feeling so smooth and gives the skin a really nice glow. I will definitely be purchasing the full size Amazing!
