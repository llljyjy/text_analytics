I reallyyyyy love this cleansing balm!! Dare I say, it might be my favorite one now! I wear bright eyeshadow and it takes it all off with ease as well as any lash glue (used for rhinestones) or glitter that gets left behind after tape removal. This is a much more travel friendly method than in a tub and even though itâ€™s thick, it comes out of the tube with ease! It doesnt strip my dry skin and actually leaves it smooth, soft, and oh so clean. nan
