I picked up this kit because I recently went off the pill and started experiencing some acne flareups. I had terrible acne as a teenager and tried almost everything (including pretty much every drugstore benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid on the market) before going on accutane. That worked wonders, but I still experience the occasional blackheads and hormonal acne. I have sensitive skin to begin with since stopping accutane my skin is prone to flakiness when using strong actives. I have not had that problem at all with this kit, even though I started off with applying the treatments every day. The acne on my chin went from angry and red and infected to completely smoothed out with just slight post-acne marks in three days. I have never had salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide products work that quickly and with such minimal irritation before. I’ve kept the exfoliating solution and skin clearing treatment away from the parts of my face that tend to be drier and don’t experience breakouts, which probably also helps to minimize irritation. The moisturizer hydrates effectively without any sort of oily residue and leaves a matte finish. While the products have made the sebaceous filaments on my nose less noticeable they have not gotten rid of them entirely, though at this point I don’t think anything will. I’m so impressed that I’ve ordered a few more products from Paula’s Choice including the full size of the cleanser in this kit and a niacinamide toner that I’m hoping will help to reduce the look of my pores further. nan
