One of the best sunscreens Iâ€™ve tried! This one is perfect for summer. I would say if you have dry skin you might want something more moisturizing but depends on your preferences. I have a pretty oily T zone so this works great for me! During the winter I will use something more moisturizing but this perfect otherwise. Lightweight, glowy sunscreen!
