I’m impressed! I have dry skin and this moisturizer gives me all the hydration I need. I usually have to use a thick cream for my PM routine but wow this one is light weight and my skin loves it! I also love the pump packaging because I don’t like digging cream out of the jar. Vitamin C is so great in it and the price point is fantastic!!!!!! Love it!
