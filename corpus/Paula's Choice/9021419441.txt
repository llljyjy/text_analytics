After only applying this product for the FIRST time it felt instantly amazing on my skin. I am already such a huge fan of Paulaâ€™s Choice products and I have to say this product did not disappoint. This moisturizer was insanely moisturizing and instantly sinked into my skin. I hate when moisturizers feel kinda cakey? This moisturizer was perfect and sit amazingly under my makeup. 10/10 recommend!!!! AMAZINGG!!!!
