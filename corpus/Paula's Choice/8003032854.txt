Iâ€™ve seen some people saying the same things in the reviews- this moisturizer is perfect in the summer months (i live in a humid area) as it doesnt leave me greasy and sweaty like some other moisturizers do. However now thats its getting a little more cool and dry i find it doesnt give me the moisture that im looking for in a product. Thats the only reason why i took off a star, otherwise this product is great Perfect Summer Moisturizer
