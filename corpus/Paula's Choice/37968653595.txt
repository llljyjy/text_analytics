I have acne prone skin and large pores, so I am always looking for a good BHA treatment. This BHA is a leave-on spot treatment. The texture is clear and pretty runny. It has 9% salicylic acid, much more than the typical 2% that I see in other products. I apply a thin layer on my nose and T zone areas. After a few days of usage, it seems to help make my pores less congested (or easier for me to push out the sebum). I think it is a good stable daily treatment to help prevent my pores get clogged up again. I would recommend this for acne prone, oily skin type. nan
