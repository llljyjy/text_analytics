This is much gentler than the 1% Retinol from Paula’s Choice. I like this one for winter and the 1% for summer when I don’t get as dry. This is still effective but with less irritation so it’s a great choice for those with sensitive skin that still want to use a retinol product. I would still do a patch test if you do have skin that gets irritated easily as it’s still potent. Also noticed this works well sandwiched in between moisturizers to help irritation. I think it’s a great product and I like the texture of it as well. It softens my skin and fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth. I can tell my mouth wrinkle isn’t as deep. Effective with little to no irritation
