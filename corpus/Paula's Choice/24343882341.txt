I have been using this niacinamide booster for  2 weeks during my nightime routine 1x a night . When I wake up my skin’s texture is alot smoother and pores look smaller. I like adding this into moisturizer aswell but I actually like the results better when I use it without moisturizer. I noticed it’s hydrating and has more of a toner consistency and gentle on my sensitive combo skin. Gentle Niacinamide booster
