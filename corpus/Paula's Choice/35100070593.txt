This eye cream applies smoothly and absorbs quickly, moisturizing very well. I wouldn’t say I have a severe problem with dark circles. However, after using this product for the last 2 weeks the area around my eyes definitely appears brighter. (The second pic is no foundation and no concealer.) my favorite thing about it is how soothing it is. I don’t keep it in the fridge but it almost feels like there is a cooling sensation when applied. As a girl who suffers from allergies, that is a huge plus. Looking forward to additional firming effects over time. Brighter Eyes
