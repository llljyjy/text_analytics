I had high hopes for this moisturizer but it doesn’t work for me.  I have dehydrated skin and typically use a gel cream for daytime and a heavier cream for night.  I heard this product is lightweight but packs a punch. While I like the whipped texture this seemed to leave a film on my face and felt like it sat on top of my skin and never fully absorbed.  I tried using at night and my face felt tacky.  Thankfully I bought a travel size which I will finish but I won’t repurchase the full size. Sticky
