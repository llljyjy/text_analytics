I tried cleansing balms for the first time this year and I’m loving them! The ones I have tried always came in jars, but I love that this is in a tube. It’s more hygienic and makes dispensing the product easier. The balm itself is a bit thicker which I don’t mind as it does the job. It removes all my makeup without over stripping my skin. A perfect first cleanse that leaves my skin feeling and looking clean. A perfect cleansing balm for travel!
