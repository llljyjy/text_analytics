So I’ve been using this product for about ten years and I’ve always purchased from Paula’s Choice website or Nordstrom’s. This was my first time purchasing from Sephora since they began carrying the product. I just cracked open the bottle and I have to say it has a very odd smell that none of my other bottles ever had. I’m a bit concerned. It almost smells like gasoline. This product should have no smell at all really. What gives? Has An Odd Smell That The Other Bottles Never Had
