I really like this sunscreen. It has a light lotion texture that feels really nice on my (currently) normal skin. I don’t detect any fragrance or scent when I use this. I also don’t see any white cast or streaks when I apply. I have also not had any skin irritation from it. This isn’t water resistant so I wouldn’t use it at the beach or pool, but for pretty much any other day? This is a solid daily sunscreen. A great daily sunscreen
