This isn’t a good moisturizer. I was disappointed that my face felt tight and dry after applying this product liberally. I had to apply a lot  (3 quarter-sized pumps) for my skin to feel even a little moisturized, and it’s still not good enough. Feels like I didn’t put any moisturizer on. The bottle is expensive for such a small amount size. Lastly, it smells gross, like cardboard. Definitely a pass for me. Not for dry skin! Does not moisturize well at all
