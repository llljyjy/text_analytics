I just started using tretinoin a couple weeks ago and it also started getting really cold outside, so my skin is definitely getting adjusted aka breaking out and feeling a little dry. I really like that this can be used in conjunction with tret to help with irritation and fading dark spots left behind from acne. You can see I have a few spots, but I feel as though they’re healing and fading faster than usual while using this. It’s a really lightweight texture with no scent, and it absorbs super easily into my skin. I found that there was no stinging or irritation or oiliness left behind when I added this to my routine both in the morning and at night with other products. With my vitamin C and a heavier gentle moisturizer over top, this is a really good combo for healing breakouts! Helps my skin recover faster
