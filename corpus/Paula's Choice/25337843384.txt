I love how quickly this stuff sinks into my skin when I apply it directly, and it has worked seamlessly into every single one of my moisturizers and serums that I have mixed it into. I have yet to use it long enough to know if it has significant effects on my pigmentation, but for the price, I think it’s so worth its texture. Other niacinamide-specific products that I have tried sit on top of my skin or create pilling. Looking forward to continuing to integrate it into my skincare routine! It’s already reduced my oil and redness quite a bit! Niacinamide is my favorite, and this is the best!
