Using this made the biggest difference in my hormonal acne, textured face. I use in the morning (after my retinol works all night) to remove dead skin cells and create the perfect, smooth, tight skin. My skin is extremely sensitive and I have been hesitant to try new. I stared with retinol a few months ago and after that was successful, started this. My skin had no problem adjusting. This has given me extreme confidence! Love this product and canâ€™t wait to try more from the brand. Game. Changer.
