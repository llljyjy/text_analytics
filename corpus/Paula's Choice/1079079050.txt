I absolutely love double cleansing and have been looking for a new balm cleanser that is also no fuss and super gentle. I was kindly gifted this by Paula’s Choice and I think it’s the most effective and gentle balm cleanser I’ve ever used. It gets my makeup off without disrupting my skin barrier and leaves my skin glowing. I’ll definitely be purchasing! Perfect balm cleanser for sensitive skin!
