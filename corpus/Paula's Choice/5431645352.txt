I’m on my third bottle. This stuff works beautifully for me. I’ve seen reviews stating it gave some people “bumps” and stopped using it or returned it- hear me when I say this, when I first began using PC’s exfoliant I too noticed I was slightly breaking out…basically my face was purging, because that’s exactly what the product should do- it goes deep into your pores and just sloughs all the gunk out SO we’ll without being harsh! *After about a week* my breakouts/purging cleared up about 90%…. I was shocked. Not only did it clear my face, it also makes my pores appear smaller and smoother. I use this product once a day at night before bed and The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid 7% in the morning as a toner and the pair works like a dream. This is all just my opinion of course, but dang this is a holy grail product for people with acne, large pores and discoloration.If you’re on the fence- buyyy itttt! This is yer sign : ) The Hype Is Real
