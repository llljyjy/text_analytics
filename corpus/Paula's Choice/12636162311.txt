I have tried The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, Biologique Recherche P50, and Glossier Solution, yet this product stands above everything. No other product, in my experience, manages to leave my skin this glowy and healthy. To give some background on my skin, Iâ€™m normal to dry with texture and rosacea. Even with my sometimes sensitive skin, this product does not irritate. I have purchased - three - bottles thus far and will continue until they make a bigger size : ))) Worth the hype
