I received this RESIST Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser from Paulaâ€™s Choice in exchange for my honest review. This foaming cleanser has a lightweight texture that builds into a light foamy lather as it mixes with water when cleansing the skin. It feels refreshing and gentle on my dry combination skin. My face feels cleansed and hydrated when I use this as part of a double cleanse. I do not experience any dryness or tightness when using this cleanser. I would recommend this product. nan
