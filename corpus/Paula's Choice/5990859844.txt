I’ve been loving this eye cream for AM & PM! It’s a very light and creamy texture that layers smoothly under other product or makeup! The hyaluronic acid is a plus for me because I’ll take any help with keeping my under eyes moisturized and bright! I’m a fan of this being fragrance-free...especially for a product so close to my eyes. No burning or irritation for me! a daily favorite!
