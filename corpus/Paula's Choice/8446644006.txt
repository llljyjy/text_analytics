Niacinamide is the first skincare product I used when starting skincare and it has always remained a staple in every routine. It has done magical things to my skin. I was a bit skeptical to try Paulaâ€™s Choice because it contains 20% but this serum is gentle enough for my sensitive and dry skin. It actually helped with some fresh pimples that were coming up. One use made the redness go away and the bumps go down. My pores are less noticeable too. Definitely recommend. Love PC niacinamide!
