My skin loves niacinamide, I was so excited that Paula’s Choice added one to their line. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I’ve seen a huge improvement in my pores, I can’t wait to see the results after a month on a few dark spots I have around my chin. The texture is this serum is very light and runny, almost like water. I personally love that! It doesn’t leave the skin sticky but don’t go overboard you only need a few drops. Excellent serum for your pores!!
