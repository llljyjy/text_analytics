It’s been tough trying to find a good quality spf that leaves no white cast & wears well under makeup - this is the best one i’ve found. I have combo skin, but in the winter my skin is just  super dry so I don’t mind the fluid almost a little oily type consistency (I almost prefer it) because my makeup actually glides on better. I like to wear spf all year round not just during the summer, so being able to wear well under makeup is a must. I can see why people with very oily skin dislike this, but if you have dry or even combo skin and struggle with makeup looking patchy during the dry months like myself this is worth a try. Amazing under makeup
