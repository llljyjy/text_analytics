I love this retinol. I experienced no redness or peeling with this retinol, which makes me so happy because it is a mid-strength retinol. The consistency is a little thick but doesnâ€™t feel heavy on the skin. My skin feels so smooth and my fine lines and wrinkles are less visible after using it. nan
