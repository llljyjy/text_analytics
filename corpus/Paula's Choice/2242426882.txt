My main concern is finding a cleanser that washes the foundation and other makeup off my face without stripping. I had hopes after reading other reviews, but this was one of the worst cleansers in getting rid of makeup that I have used. I wiped my face with micellar water after and there was still a ton of foundation left on the cotton pad. I donâ€™t normally return products, but this one I did. May be a totally fine cleanser for you if you do not wear foundation or a lot of makeup. Did not cleanse off makeup
