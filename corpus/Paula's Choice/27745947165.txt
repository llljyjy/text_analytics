I love this liquid exfoliant so much!If you wanna have the infamous “glass skin” this is it. I wash my face with Kate Somerville’s goat milk cleanser, then the exfoliant, then the retinal+niacinamide by YTTP and finally the olehenriksen peptide boost moisturizer. This combo has calmed my redness so much! nan
