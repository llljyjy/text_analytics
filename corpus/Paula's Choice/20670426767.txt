Best Skincare Product I Have Ever Used!With regular use, I am able to get a glowing, even-toned, and supple skin. It has made my skin healthy. Note: I use sunscreen daily and also, use a vitamin C serum before spf application. I use this product in the nighttime only. I also use a daily AHA cleanser and a lightweight moisturizer in the nighttime. However, this product definitely made a huge difference to my skin. I have been using it for the last 4 months and plan to use it more. Best Friend Of My Skin
