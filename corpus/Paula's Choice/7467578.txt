Bad rosacea out of nowhere,and I was going on vacation...I needed results. This,and going back on minocycline, saved my skin. Which did most? Of course, minocycline,but there is no doubt this helps,and as much as I want to save money, Iâ€™m not switching to the Ordinary or Inkey on this one....even though I love their other products..... especially PHA toner. My skin is so fair and sensitive that I fear using ANYTHING,but this stuff is worth it. Worth the extra money
