I have been careful while using it -  apply it once every 3 days. Still it breaks me out. I have dry skin therefore I use the sandwich method while applying retinol. First a layer of body shop Vit E moisturizer, then this retinol,  then a layer of laneige time freeze sleeping mask. Despite the precautions, it manages to break me out after 2 days of applying it.It has been 3 months with this routine. And I have a lot more pimples on my face than when I first started. I ma not that prone to breaking out. Except facial oils, nothing normally causes pimples. But with this one I have been having pimples every week.Giving it 2 stars because the rest of my face looks brighter after using it. But thereâ€™s also numerous pimple scars. Breaks me out. Frustrating.
