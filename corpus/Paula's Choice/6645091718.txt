I used this product before I went to the dermatologist and I would see a difference but the next day the small bumps would come back. Since you can’t use this product ever day and should only use it once or twice a week it was hard to see a consistent result. My dermatologist told me not to use it anymore while I’m using the products they recommended, but when my skin looks extra congested I do use this because it does significantly decrease those irritated, stubborn pimples. nan
