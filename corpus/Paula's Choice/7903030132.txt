This eye cream has been so easy to slip into my existing routine. I use it in the morning and though I was t sure it was doing anything for darkness, I think it definitely has for me.The texture is lightweight and goes in smoothly. Works great layering with other skincare and under makeup. It has a light citrus scent that doesnâ€™t sting my eyes, but the cream can tingle on the skin a little bit, especially if applied on days that my skin is really dry.All in all, this is a great option for those looking to moisturize and brighten the immediate eye area. Will definitely continue using. Moisturizing & Brightening
