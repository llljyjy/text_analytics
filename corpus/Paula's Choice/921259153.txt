I have tried many niacinamides and didnâ€™t like how they would make me break out. I was intrigued with this one since it had purslane as one of the ingredients. Purslane is rich in antioxidants, vitamins A, C, and E, fatty acids, and anti-inflammatory properties that provide a range of benefits to the skin. I had to try this. This had a light consistency and had no fragrance. I am happy to say that I did not break out. It did not leave my skin feeling sticky or heavy. My face looks smoother, my pores smaller, and my skin appears plumper. This is my second product from them, and I am loving this brand. Amazing ingredients
