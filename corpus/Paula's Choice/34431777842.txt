This is probably the strongest vit C I have used so far in my skin journey and I am so impressed my skin has tolerated it! It is very watery and easy to apply to the skin, instantly sinking in. There is only the slightest hot dog smell. This effectively faded two acne scars I had on my chin within two weeks. I think with more time I will see improvement with my fine lines. My overall tone still is quite red/pink because thatâ€™s just me! I would recommend this to experienced vit c users for sure! Good and powerful!
