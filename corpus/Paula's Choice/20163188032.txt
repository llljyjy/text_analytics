This cleanser does exactly what it says it will! My skin hasn’t felt so balanced and calmed in ages. I have dry skin, but am very acne prone & it can be so difficult to find a cleanser that doesn’t strip my skin but still helps calm my acne blemishes. This one does it! The texture is pillowy and soft, and it lathers well. Im noticing less blemishes, less redness, and a more even balance of hydration in the zones of my face. Definitely top tier for cleansers, this is a fantastic formula! nan
