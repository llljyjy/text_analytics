I’m still tentative when it comes to retinol, and this one has a moderate level, plus gentler bakuchiol. The product package recommends starting with use 3 times a week, so I’ve been using it as part of my skin cycling routine. So far it isn’t too drying or irritating. The texture is buttery, and 2 pumps is more than enough to cover my face and neck in a thin layer. I apply it at night, and the next morning my skin feels a little sensitized when I apply toner, but I haven’t experienced stinging or discomfort. I’m looking forward to seeing effects on my fine lines and wrinkles, but so far, it’s working well! Fairly gentle and effective!
