I purchased this product a long time ago, after reading the reviews I decided to give a try. I was using Skinceuticals retinol which is amazing but I was running low and decided to purchased something cheaper. After using it for a few nights, my face started to be full of little pimples every where, so I stopped immediately. I never used it again until recently, I decided to give it another change, and OMG , my face is glowing like glowing for real !!!! My sun spots and wrinkles are getting better, and my face looks younger! I don’t know what happened the first time, but I’m glad I gave it another change! Very happy with the results ! nan
