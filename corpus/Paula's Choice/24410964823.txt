This is probably the first skincare product I’ve  bought where you can actually see visible results, it definitely works getting rid of those little bumps on the forehead (super quickly it took probably 2 weeks to get rid of mine) and it makes the skin look smooth, I prefer to use it during the day because it give the skin a glow under makeup (with spf of course) Just don’t over do, it in the beginning I used it daily and my skin peeled so now I use it twice a week and it’s perfect. I will definitely purchase it again once I run out. In this photo you can see how quick it works in Thursday I had a lot of bumps because I didn’t use it for a bit and it took one use for them to go away. Goodbye forehead bumps!
