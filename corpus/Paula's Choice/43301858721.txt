I have been using the 0.3% Retinol + 2% Bakuchiol Treatment every other night for 2 weeks and I can see a difference in the clarity of my skin. It looks firmer and I’ve experienced less texture overall. My fine lines are still present, but less noticeable. The texture of this treatment is smooth and silky and has caused no irritation. I’m loving it in my nighttime routine! Great for retinol beginners
