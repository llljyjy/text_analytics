This was pretty amazing. I seen results overnight with some of my milia and pimples that were ready to emerge. Everything has shrunken down to basically nothing!! The scent is a bit chemical-like to me and the consistency feels like a serum. I do wish the bottle could be bigger but considering it’s going to be used as a spot treatment, I think it’s not bad. I also used this over my moisturizer to avoid irritation (I have sensitive skin).I’m so impressed, this is also the first PC product that I own. I’d definitely love to try more if they’re going to be this effective. One of the best BHA's I own
