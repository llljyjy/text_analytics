Had high hopes looking at the other reviews, my skin has been dry and prone to acne recently so I had high hopes for this yet it was oily upon application and when it dries down it is somehow very drying. I used just the moisturizer by itself and it pilled…that’s a deal breaker by itself but the fact that it isn’t even moisturizing either? My skin was left feeling like paper while looking greasy. Yuck Oily and drying
