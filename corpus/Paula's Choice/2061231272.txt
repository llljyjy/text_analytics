I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review- I would rate this a 7/10. It was light weight, with little to no fragrance and it wasn’t a harsh product. Overall no major complaint but I often wondered if it worked well for my skin type. In the past every toner when used with a pad would show signs of cleaning my skin more immediately IE oil, dirt on the pad but I never noticed with Paula’s Choice Toner. nan
