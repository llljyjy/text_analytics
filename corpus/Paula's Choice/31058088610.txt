I received the C5 Super Boost Moisturizer from Paulaâ€™s Choice. I had my friend with oily skin try out this product for two weeks, and they reported back that the product is smoothening and is great for brightening the skin. It evened out their skin tone, feels softer, balances out oil while not giving the face an unpleasant texture. nan
