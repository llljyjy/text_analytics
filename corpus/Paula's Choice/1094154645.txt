Finally got my hands on this, and I can visibly see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin on the second application! I have sensitive combination skin, and have quite a robust skincare routine in place. I am not new to formulations of retinols, acids and AHAs as texture is one of my main concerns(to be honest Ive tried most of what is on the market), so tbh I was not expecting more than what Ive already experienced with other brands/formulations. This - I dont know what makes this so darn effective - but the results are clearly astonishing; and in just one step, which makes it easy to be consistent about (+1 in my book). Pores werent ever really a concern for me, but they are completely nonexistent at this point. I hope continued use will maintain these results: I look like I just slept 20 hours, drank a gallon of water, and got a $500 facial, omg! If you are on the fence, I highly encourage giving it a try. Im so glad I picked this up during the sale - I was able to pick up a great sunscreen to go with it. Visible results on the 2nd day.
