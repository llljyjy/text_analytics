I bought this on a whim because it was hyped up on social media— which is well deserved tbh. It works well, but here’s the thing: it takes roughly 3-4 months of CONSISTENT USE to see a notable difference. I bought this back in August and it’s June and I still have a LOT left. So this lasts a VERY LONG TIME even with everyday use. Rememebr, this is a chemical exfoliator, not a physical exfoliator so it takes a while to see a difference, but the results are AMAZING. I used to have cystic acne, I have acne prone skin and now suffer with breakouts and fungal acne and some texture (small bumps on my forehead and face). This is what I noticed:MAJOR CHANGES:- improvement in overall skin texture (small bumps completely gone) -clean pores -less breakouts -lightening in dark spots -oily skin —> combo skin -hydrating WHAT I DIDNT NOTICE:-this does NOT shrink pores. Actually my pores have gotten bigger since using this product but they are very clean and there is no sebum. This is worth it 100%. It takes time because it’s gentle and chemical but i promise it works. Give it 3-4 months consistent use but I noticed improvement as early as 2 months in. PATIENCE IS KEY
