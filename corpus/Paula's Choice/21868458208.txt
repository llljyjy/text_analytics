I love that it doesn’t leave a white cast, it doesn’t oil and (for me at least) it gives a nice glow, definitely wouldn’t say it is matte. Deducting a star only because it did leave me with a bit of eye stinging. That may just be human error and I won’t put so close to my eyes to see if that was the problem. But overall, I have high hopes for it nan
