A nice cleansing balm—I have dry skin, and I prefer the consistency of a balm for removing my makeup and as a first cleanse. I like the way this one smells and feels. The texture is a hybrid of creamy and waxy, and as I massage it onto my skin and it warms up, it’s almost an oil. Once all my makeup has melted and broken down, a wipe everything off with a warm, damp washcloth. A great gentle way of removing makeup. You can also just rinse it off with warm water if you don’t want to use a washcloth. My face feels very clean (but not stripped!) afterwards. Gentle and effective
