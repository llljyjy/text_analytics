I have large pores and oily skin. Depending on the products I use, my skin gets dehydrated incredibly fast but becomes incredibly oily when trying to re hydrate. Itâ€™s hard to find in between products. I personally need a hydrating toner but also helps with my pores. This was not for me. It totally dried me out and made the following products pill every time. I kept trying to use it because I really want to like PC. Not bad, niacinamide just dries me out. If you have the same reaction, I suggest not using a nia toner. dried me out.
