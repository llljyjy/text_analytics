I am SO incredibly impressed by this. I got off birth control (IUD) a couple of months ago, and since then, my skin has been super oily and breakouts were happening every day. I’m 31, and suddenly felt like I was in high school again. I honestly couldn’t catch a break and it felt like any tiny whitehead that I had would multiply by the 10’s everyday, especially on my lower cheeks and chin area. Needless to say, I was desperate and pretty emotional about having to go through this stage in my life again.While browsing Sephora, I saw this kit and a specific review mentioning it was perfect for their hormonal acne. Purchased immediately! And I kid you not, after 3-4 uses of this 4-step kit, and my acne is completely gone, and I am no longer waking up to new white heads all over my face. My face has been significantly less oily, so soft, and I currently don’t have a single pimple on my face. I could honestly cry! I don’t even know what is in these products but it is EXACTLY what my skin needed. I feel like I got my confidence back. 1000000% recommended! If you are feeling defeated and deflated by hormonal acne and have skin on the oilier side, please just order this kit and give it a try! My new holy grail!!!!
