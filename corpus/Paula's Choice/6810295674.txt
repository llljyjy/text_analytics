This scrub is the best. My skin type is oily, and I struggle with hormonal acne, on top of my skin being sensitive. It’s super gentle, And This makes my skin feel so soft and doesn’t make me break out. It’s fragrance free, so it doesn’t irritate my face. It’s good for literally all skin types. The best. I’m currently being my second bottle. You won’t regret this purchase especially if your looking for a scrub with deep exfoliation but gentle. wow!
