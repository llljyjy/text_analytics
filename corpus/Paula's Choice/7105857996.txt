I really like this moisturizer and am repurchasing as it’s super lightweight, but I’m giving it only 4 stars because I also have to use it with Olay moisturizer. But it’s also been winter so my skin is extra dry, and using this after the Olay doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy and it really is great for oily skin. nan
