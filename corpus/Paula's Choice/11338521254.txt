I absolutely love this sunscreen. I wish I didn’t love it so much because of the price but it actually lasted me quite a while. I have tried many others in the meantime but nothing compares. I have sensitive dry and acne prone skin and this has never made any of those problems worse. I find that my skin feels hydrated and protected, I don’t notice any skin evening in terms of color but I noticed it’s sheer and almost watery so it’s easy to apply with or without a mirror. It gives me a nice dewy base when used with moisturizer and that looks wonderful under makeup. I have not experienced any pilling and my skin looks amazing! Couldn’t recommend enough for people like me who struggled to find a good everyday sunscreen! I’ll probably be using this forever
