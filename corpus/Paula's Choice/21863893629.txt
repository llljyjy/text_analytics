So I have used this before with zero issue but this time my skin definitely freaked out. After the first 2 uses my skin was so dried out it was extremely sensitive to any other active and even my moisturizers. If you have dry skin, and itâ€™s worse in the winter. Proceed with great caution. Maybe use only once a week until your skin is used to it. I gave it 4 stars because the first time I used it I loved it! This time was just due to my skin being to dry to handle it. Dry skin peeps proceed with caution
