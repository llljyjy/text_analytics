I’ve been using this product from Paula’s Choice for two weeks and I’ve noticed a slight difference on my face. My pores did minimize so I’m sure if I keep using it they will be gone. The product feels so hydrated on my skin and I like the no scent in it. I use it before my skin care routine and it’s been working well for it. I have very oily face and I love how this doesn’t feel oily at all when I apply it. A must have in my routine
