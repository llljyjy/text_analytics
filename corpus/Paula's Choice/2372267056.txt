I have tried so much skin care but this is actually my first time trying Paulas choice and so far I can say I understand some of the hype! It only took a couple of weeks to notice my dark circles appearing a bit lighter and generally my under eye area looks really fresh in the week and itâ€™s also really Hydrating which is great because I have dry skin! I like it!
