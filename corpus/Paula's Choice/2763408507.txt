This Vitamin C has become a staple for me. Drunk elephant didn’t do much for me and I couldn’t get over the smell. Paula’s Choice Vit C smells fresh and texture is lightweight. I have oily-combo, acne prone skin with some scarring and dark spot concerns. Worth the price and lasts for a while. Lightweight and worth the price
