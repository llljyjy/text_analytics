I received the product as a gift from the brand in exchange for your opinion.  This has made my skin feel really supple, soft and hydrated. I even saw a reduction in my pores. I do use this at night, twice a week.  And keep in mind a little goes a long way.  Spread it thinly around the face avoiding the eye areas. Niacinamide
