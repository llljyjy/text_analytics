I love how this serum works on my skin. I have combination to oily skin and I love how this serum doesn’t cause me any breakout or skin irritation. I do see my pores appearance getting better however I don’t see any the damage spot on my skin getting better and this is my second bottle and I’ve been using it everyday day and night. The consistency Its self is lightweight and it’s fragrance free so overall it’s good serum for oily skin. Great for oily skin
