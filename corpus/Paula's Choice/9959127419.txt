I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I can tell a difference in the look and feel of my skin. I have dry to combination skin and the fall/winter season is really hard on my skin. This has been so helpful to hydrate my skin at the end of the day every night. The texture is so soft and it isn’t too heavy on your skin. Really helped with my seasonal dry skin
