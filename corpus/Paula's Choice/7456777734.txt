On paper this is a great product. The retinol and the balancing ceramides are a great team. That being said if you have ANY oiliness I find it pills on me which is an issue with PC products as a whole. Combo and oily skin beware. It doesn’t irritate my skin but the retinol is very mild - honestly didn’t do anything for my skin so really you end up paying for the moisturizing part. I think you can find comparable moisturizer for cheaper at drugstore. nan
