Awesome ! Would be 5 stars if the bottle was a bit bigger for the price . I have extremely acne prone skin and this is a safe product for me . I use it in combination layered under and over my Tretinoin gel and it helps to avoid the dryness as a side effect of retinoids . I love the simple and minimal ingredients Awesome for acne prone skin and Tretinoin routine
