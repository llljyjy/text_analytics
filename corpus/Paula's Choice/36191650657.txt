Let me just start out saying I NEVER write reviews, but this one deserves it! I had my baby 9 months ago and my skin has been a mess since! I decided to listen to all the hype about the product and give it a chance  I’m SO happy I did. I’ve never been this confident in my skin. I can’t even remember the last time I wore foundation and it’s all because of this! Please please give this a try. Photos are about 2 weeks apart PLEASE GIVE IT A SHOT
