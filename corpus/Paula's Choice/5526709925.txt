Wow I went on a roller coaster with this product. When I first started using it I was so scared. My skin is super reactive, hates almost everything and breaks out easily. It is also dry so it’s tough to battle the acne without disrupting my barrier. The purging process is real. I was googling a ton about it, was it just my skin, was it normal? The people say to try it for a month or 2. If it is getting worse after 2 months it’s probably the product not working for you. I was really not sure what to do but I kept using it once a day at night only. Now it’s been over 2 months. I have noticed such a difference with my skin. It is brighter and smoother. I am still getting occasional breakouts, mostly around the time of my period. But they only last for a few days instead of a few weeks. I have also been using it on my back, arms, and butt. (Sorry if that’s tmi) but its working better than anything I’ve tried. I’ve spent SO much money trying things and I’m happy to say I will be repurchasing this product when I run out. Patience is key
