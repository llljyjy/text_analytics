I work in a dermatology office and have tried dozens of sunscreens over the years from all levels of brands. This sunscreen is certainly in my top five because it blends so well and leaves a light finish. I have fry but acne prone skin and this sunscreen is perfect for me. I do make sure before application that I wash my face and then apply some sort of moisturizing product before this sunscreen goes on (these days thatâ€™s been a Vitamin C oil that Sephora also sells). nan
