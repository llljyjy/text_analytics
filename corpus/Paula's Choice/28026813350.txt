I figured I would give this a try as part of my double cleanse because I prefer the squeeze bottle to the tub I’ve been using (farmacy green clean) but I absolutely hate it. I need to use a lot more of it and my skin doesn’t feel clean at all afterwards. I’ve been having to go back in with the farmacy balm on my eyes because it can’t even remove my eye makeup. It makes me wonder how much of the rest of my makeup it’s missing. I figured I’d keep it just as a quick nourishing face mask for in the shower in the morning but I think it’s even starting to break me out (maybe because the first ingredient is known to be comedogenic?) I hoped with a big name like Paula’s choice that I’d be getting a quality product but I’m definitely disappointed. Sub par and potentially breaking me out
