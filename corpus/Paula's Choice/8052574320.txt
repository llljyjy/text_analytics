I use the super popular 2% BHA toner and love it, so I thought this would be great for spot treating acne and large pore areas. Figured it was just a stronger version of something I already like. But the consistency is way thicker and stickier, and I actually didn’t see a major difference in effectiveness. So especially for this price and tiny container, I’ll just stick to the 2% toner. Sticky and not that effective?
