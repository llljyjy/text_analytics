If it’s one thing I love in my skincare routine is a great moisturizer. I have dry skin…sometimes patchy, year round and I NEED a moisturizer that’s creamy, non sticky and nourishing for my skin and this does it for me. Plus it’s affordable and that’s a win win for me. You’ll love it..dry skin approved
