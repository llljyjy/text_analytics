I’ve been purchasing this hydrating spf for a few years now. Reminds me of a facial serum. I’ve used with multiple foundations and primers and never have an issue with pilling. Gives good moisture but I still layer it over my normal everyday moisturizer (Sunday Riley Water Cream or Tatcha). Also recently started using it on my daughters and have zero issues with white cast. Definitely a favorite in our house and can’t go wrong with the price. nan
