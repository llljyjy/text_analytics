I love Paula’s choice products and this serum worked so nicely to keep my skin bright and clear. It has such a nice consistency and absorbs really well into skin under moisturizer. I only wish the bottle were a bit bigger because I am going through it so quickly ! It’s a great choice for a serum to give that extra boost of healthy skin glow. Great serum!
