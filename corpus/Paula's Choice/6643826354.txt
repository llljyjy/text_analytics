So I’ve tried a few different Vitamin C serums that are out there.  Decided to give this a try because I couldn’t bring myself to keep dropping $145 on another well known Vitamin C Serum. So glad I did. Going on my second bottle now. I’ve noticed more of a difference with this serum than any of the others I’ve used. Give my skin a nice, bright glow. Even get complemented on my skin. I didn’t have the issue of it oxidizing quickly.  Also much more affordable. 2 thumbs up
