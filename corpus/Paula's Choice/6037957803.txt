I only starting struggling with acne in my 20s when i started hormonal BC and originally turned to tretinoin but I found it restrictive so I wasn’t consistent. I started using this 2 weeks ago and its immediately replaced 3 other products for me. I have very dark skin & it’s already faded acne scars that usually take at least 3 months to clear on my regular regimen. Just get it! Hyperpigmentation girlies, this is for you!
