I am going to say.. I was nervous to try this but I am so happy I did. I have sensitive skin and this product did not effect it at all. I never got red or anything. It really does make your skin glow. I only use about once to twice a week but I can see the difference in my skin texture and dullness. Now I Know Why Everyone Loves It
