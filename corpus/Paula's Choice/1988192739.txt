This product works great if you are having textured skin. I used to have a lot of texture on my forehead but after using this Niacinamide serum, I started noticing a huge difference. There is still a little texture left, with continued use of this serum, I am certain I can get rid of it. Also, this serum sinks into the skin unlike some other niacinamide serums out in the market. Must have for textured skin
