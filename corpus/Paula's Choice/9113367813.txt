I’ve always loved this brand so I was really excited to try this product! For such a strong concentration it feels very lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin feeling irritated unlike other retinol serums I have tried in the past. No scent for me is always a plus too. Looking forward to to seeing the results. nan
