I’ve been using this as my only spot treatment in my skincare routine this week, and I’m loving my results so far. I develop difficult hormone acne for a week straight each month, and I’ve been applying this on each upset pore and bump. It’s been doing an amazing job so far, it doesn’t dry my skin and feels soothing on application. If you struggle with skin imperfections, this is definitely worth a shot. nan
