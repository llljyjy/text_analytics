I’m a huge fan of Paula’s choice products and this is no different! This product is fantastic, I typically use it in the morning at the end of my skin care routine. I’ve been using it for about a week but I already notice a more even texture to my skin tone, and my skin looks and feels much smoother overall. Definitely recommend! Evens skin tone great addition to morning skincare
