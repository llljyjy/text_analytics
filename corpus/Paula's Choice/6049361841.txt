By far, my favorite retinol product. I use this several times per week and I’ve not only noticed a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin, fading fine lines..I’ve noticed I have less breakouts. On nights I take a break from putting retinol on my entire face, I’ll still mix a small amount of this magical stuff into my eye cream at night for a targeted eye treatment. Absolutely love it. Worth the extra money..I’ve had this for months, and I use it regularly so it will last you! Buy it honey! incredible
