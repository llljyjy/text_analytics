This is the mildest and the most smooth toner I’ve tried from Paula’s Choice. My skin was tough when I was young but as I aged and experienced a lot of ingredients, it got more sensitive. This toner makes my skin so soft and it absorbs fast without stickiness.  No sensitivity was found using this toner. Sensitive Skin Loves It
