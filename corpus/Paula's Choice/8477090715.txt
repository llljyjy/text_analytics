the youth extending spf is probably my favorite sunscreen i have tried so far! it has a light texture, but feels very great on the skin! no greasy feeling, sets as a matte! it doesn’t sting around the eyes, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. in love with this product!!! favorite sunscreen!
