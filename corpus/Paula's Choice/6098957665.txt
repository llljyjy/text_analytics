This unfortunately didn’t work for me - it broke me out on my nose and forehead.  I’m in my early 30s and have oily leaning, acne prone skin.  I’m generally able to keep my skin pretty clear, so it was obvious that this product was the breakout culprit once I incorporated it into my routine.  K-beauty SPFs are my absolute favorite, so the texture of this seemed promising when I tested in store - it’s a lighter-weight watery consistency.  It ended up being a bit too dewy on my oily skin after just a couple hours, though, but it didn’t cause my makeup on top to break up.  I think this would be a great product if your skin is less oily and not break out prone! So 1 star for me, but I rated 3 stars because I think it could be great for other skin types :) Not quite it for oily skin
