I’m torn about this one. I didn’t see any difference in my skin’s texture. Honestly I saw more improvement from the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Cream which is half the price. I have nothing negative to say about the consistency or the bottle. I just didn’t see any result. I probably need something stronger. I think if you’re newer to retinol or are coming from an over-the-counter product (those have less the 1% retinol), then give this a try. Didn't see any results.
