So many sunscreens leave a white cast or burn my eyes. Or they’re very oil or far too matte. This is none of that. I am also very white and the color doesn’t make my skin look overly tinted. No breakouts, no stinging, works fantastic as a primer. My only complaint is the price seems high for the SPF amount. I wish it was a 50. Best sunscreen I've used.
