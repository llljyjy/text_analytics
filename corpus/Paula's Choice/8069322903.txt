I love Paula’s choice products, but this one is a pass for me, I have very dry but sensitive at the same time skin, and it seems that this product irritated my skin, since I know that I’m sensitive I use it at night time, and I wake up with red patches, itchy, extra dry. I suggest that everyone who ones to try it do a patch test before put it in you entire face It’s a pass for me
