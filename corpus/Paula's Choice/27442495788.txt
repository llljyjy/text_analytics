I had been using a vitamin c serum for years because *that’s just what you do*. To be perfectly honest, I was ready to stop wasting the money, because it didn’t feel like it was doing anything other than wasting my money... then I saw a tiktok about this particular Victamin C. I have been using it for about a month, and I already see and feel a difference in my skin. It is pricey, but worth the splurge! Worth the money!
