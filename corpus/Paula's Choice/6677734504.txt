I have been loving this new vitamin c moisturizer from Paula’s Choice! My skin has been feeling a bit dull recently and needed a product to help brighten and bring some life back into my skin. I started using this a week ago in my daily skincare routine and I have already noticed a huge difference! My skin looks fresher and brighter! I also have sensitive skin and haven’t had any reactions to this product so far which is a huge win! Amazing for brightening!
