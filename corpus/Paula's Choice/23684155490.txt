Fantastic for adult acne; I use this product on my face and then I purchased the body one for my back/chest (remember: retinol products are only to be used at night). My acne scars are fading and future breakouts are prevented. If it helps: I currently use a tea tree face wash from The Body Shop during my showers and the Dr. Gross chemical peel (the extra strength one) almost daily. I am about to try a Kiehl’s mask for remaining nose blackheads (pesky things) and a Paula’s Choice niacinamide for redness. adult acne; oily; large pores; nose blackheads
