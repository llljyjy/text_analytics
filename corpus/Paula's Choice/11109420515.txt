I like that the Omega+ Complex Cleansing Balm comes in a tube for easy dispensing and it travels well.  It can be applied to wet or dry skin. I prefer to get my skin a little damp to help spread and work it in better. I have dry skin so I really like that this cleanses without stripping. It has several oils in the ingredients so it works well to remove makeup too. I don’t wear makeup often and when I do it tends to be light, so I don’t know how this works on heavier makeup. good for dry skin
