I decided to hop on the dermaplane bandwagon. Biggest mistake ever!! my cheeks started breaking out and I began to get dark spots when my skin was always so clear. Using this exfoliant morning and night for weeks has slowly got my skin back to normal. it has put a stop to the breakouts and my dark spots are almost gone. Its a life saver! I can only hope this review helps someone who is going thru the same experience. Saved my skin from a dermaplanning nightmare!
