Idk why I haven’t been using a cleansing balm to remove my makeup. After using this I was baffled by how much makeup, mascara and eyeliner mainly, that I wasn’t actually getting off with just my cleanser. You can visibly see the difference. It is a simple & clean balm, nothing extravagant about the container, the scent or the consistency. Like it just gets the job done whether you enjoyed it or not haha. Might try another balm just to bring some excitement in the process but you can’t go wrong with this one. works with efficiency
