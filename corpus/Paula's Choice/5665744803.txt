This is great for oily skin especially is you use chemical exfoliants and tretinoin. It’s not heavy at all due to its airy texture. I would consider it to be a medium moisturizer which is perfect for me. I was looking for a moisturizer that will repair my skin barrier but wont leave me oily. I was on YouTube and came across a dermatologist channel that recommended this moisturizer to repair my barrier but would also aid in fight hyperpigmentation. It was sold on out Paula choice but I was able to try the travel size. Surprisingly the travel size lasted a while being that I only use this product at night. It leaves my skin moisturized and soft. I can also use it during the day and I will not be an oily mess. The oily reason why I don’t use this during the day is because I use Drunk Elephant F balm. As long the ingredient list doesn’t change I will continue to buy. Great for oily skin.
