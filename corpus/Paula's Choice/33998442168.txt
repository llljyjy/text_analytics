When I first started using this product, I had the clearest face from acne that I have had in probably years, literally in the first few days of applying once at night. My bf was surprised at how fresh I looked. Unfortunately, the spell seemed to wear off because three weeks in I was back to my regular acne-blotted complexion. I tried upping use to AM & PM, but didn’t find a change. Two months in I am still trying it 2x daily since I’m worried removing it from my routine now will make things worse (maybe they’re slightly better overall these days-- the verdict is still out), but I’ve switched to Naturium’s BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2% because it’s got the same actives, actually offers more hydration, has lots more naturally-derived ingredients, AND costs less! Getting into liquid exfoliants with Paula’s Choice through the 1oz trial bottle is the main upside, since Naturium doesn’t offer a small size. Good as a trial size, then found something better
