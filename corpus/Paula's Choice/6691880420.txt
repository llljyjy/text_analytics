Great kit! Thank you for giving us a smaller version to sample all the things! This helped me make my decision to buy the regular size bottle of the cleanser. The other salicylic acid solution and the benzoyl peroxide treatment products are great, but only use them as needed on the areas need, not for everyday use. Even the cleanser—now that my skin is clear, I only use it 2 days a week normally, or 3 days a week during PMS/period time for prevention and maintenance. I alternate with a gentler cleanser. Obviously if you use a salicylic acid cleanser and solution every day, you’re going to dry out! Make sure to use a really good moisturizer with SPF afterwards too! all the right stuff!
