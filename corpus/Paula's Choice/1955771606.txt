For a year, I tried rx tretinoin in 2 different strengths.  My sensitive skin could not adjust to it.  So I tried Paulaâ€™s Choice 1% retinol.  That was a lot better, but still caused some peeling & burning.  Then, I got this.  It is PERFECT!  No peeling, burning, or irritation. And I wake up with glowing skin!  So far, I am up to every other night with no issues and a big improvement in my skin.  Awesome stuff! Perfect for sensitive skin!
