I have tried MANY retinol products (from 0.025% to 1.5% percentages) on the market and this is the ONLY one that has given me irritation at all. I tried it the first night and when I woke up the next morning, my skin was covered in dry patches, flaking, dryness and red little bumps all across my skin. Mind you, I have used this with moisturizer and serums but apparently that much hydration was not enough. This is WHY you do not use retinol products that combine Vitamin C in them, lesson learned. This is immensely strong and I would not recommend, especially if you have any desire to keep your skin clear. DO NOT BUY THIS, please donâ€™t waste your money like I did. Lesson learned, next
