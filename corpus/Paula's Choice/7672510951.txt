I’ve been consistently using this serum since I got it, morning and even on my night time routine. The formula is light and a bit watery. I find that patting motion is required for it to be fully absorb by my skin. My skin feels tacky right after and I find the scent lingers on the skin for a really long time. However, I can really see a difference on my skin. It’s a little bit brighter now and it did improved the acne marks and dark spots on my skin. It didn’t happen overnight, but if you keep being consistent you will definitely see a difference. I'm impressed
