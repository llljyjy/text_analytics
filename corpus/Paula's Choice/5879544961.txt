Honestly.. I got this for the hype on TikTok hoping it would help my skin but I saw no difference. I have hormonal acne from birth control and was hoping it would help this but nothing. It does have some good ingredients which I like so that’s why I gave it 3 stars. Probably won’t be repurchasing after this bottle is empty. It did also last a really long time so that is a plus. Sad it didn’t work but it’s worth a try. Good but not for me
