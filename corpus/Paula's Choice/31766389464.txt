I really wanted to like this product and was very excited to try it out but it just did not work well for my skin. I have really sensitive skin so it felt very drying after using. I did feel a lot smoother texture but I don’t like the way it makes my skin feel. Still love other Paula’s Choice products, this is just a pass for me! nan
