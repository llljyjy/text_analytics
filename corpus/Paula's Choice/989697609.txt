I normally use a Vitamin C Serum and then a moisturizer, but I noticed my makeup wasnâ€™t lasting as long. So I loved the idea of a moisturizer with Vitamin C. This stuff is perfect, it hydrates my middle age skin, makes it look brighter and wears beautifully under makeup. Also great as a nighttime moisturizer as well. WOW WOW WOW, a must for any middle aged woman
