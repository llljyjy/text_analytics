My go to has always been a gel to foam cleanser but many of those often stripped my skin and left it feeling tight afterward. This one has been a dream as it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. The texture is super creamy/buttery but still does a great job at removing the dirt, oil, and sunscreen at the end of the day. I feel like it also has been helping my skin produce less sebum as Iâ€™ve always had to wipe my face down through the day. I just started my second bottle and will continue to repurchase. Love it
