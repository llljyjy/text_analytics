As someone who suffers from acne and acne scars, I always look for products with niacinamide to help fade any scars and discoloration. This product really helped to reduce the amount of acne I had as well as reduce the redness from the acne scars on my skin. Iâ€™ve noticed a difference in my skin texture as well as soon as a week in. It applies easily due to the thin texture and absorbs into the skin easily. Overall, I love this product and will definitely get another when I run out! Great for acne and skin texture!
