I tried it almost a year ago based off some YouTube reviews & I fell in love. My skin has never felt so soft & clear. For reference I have somewhat sensitive acne prone skin & this keeps it pretty clear & helps with texture. I definitely notice when I don’t have it that’s why I refuse to be without it! If you’re skeptical I would absolutely say go for it! Skincare Essential
