I was recently gifted the Paula’s choice C15 Super Booster and I am very pleasantly surprised at the quality and results of the product. The Paula’s choice C15 Super Booster not only has 15% vitamin c but also vitamin e and ferulic acid that helps with the absorption of the product into the skin so that the skin can receive the full benefits. I find that this serum is very affordable and comparable to many other products that may be more costly.The Paula’s choice C15 Super Booster has a very nice light consistency that is easy to apply and absorbs into the skin easily without leaving any residue. While it takes some time before seeing the diminishing of dark spots on the skin, I did notice that my skin was much more smoother and felt very hydrated after application.I would definitely recommend giving the Paula’s choice C15 Super Booster a try for all skin types. nan
