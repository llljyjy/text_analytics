I forgot to take before and after photos but it’s amazing the results I’ve seen in just two weeks. I’ve noticed that my skin feels more hydrated and I’ve always suffered from uneven skin tone, my skin is less red and my complexion is even again. I would have ranked it higher but I think it’s important to point out that a little goes a long way, but the package itself said it’s only good for 3 months. I’m worried about not using it all before the three months and for this price it should be used to the last drop! Even skin tone again!
