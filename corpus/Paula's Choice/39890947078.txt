Love this new product from Paula’s choice! I mainly use this PM, if I use it during the day I make sure I use a sunscreen on top of it. I love the mixed of moisturizer with Vitamin C! It has helped with my redness and evens out my skin tone. The only thing I noticed is that it says fragrance free, but it actually has a bit of fragrance to it. Other than that, it’s great ! the product glides on smoothly to my skin and has caused no irritation at all :) Perfect combination!
