I was hesitant to get this, as I have dry skin. However, this has totally helped with flakiness and overall skin tone. Being a chemical exfoliant, it also seems gentler on my skin than some of the physical exfoliants I used. I learned about this product from Taylor Wynnâ€™s YouTube channel, and I use The Ordinary Rose Hip Oil and CeraVe night cream after (also recommendations from her). My skin looks moisturized and smooth, even as the winter months get harsher. This will be a product I keep in stock! Surprisingly Effective with Dry Skin
