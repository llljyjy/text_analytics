This lightweight cream has a lot of potential. It has retinol, bakuchiol and peptides which is great for my well aging goals. I’ve been using this three times a week and haven’t experienced any irritation, but I do apply it after my moisturizer because I wasn’t sure how my skin would respond. After application, my skin feels smooth and in the morning it feels soft. I don’t notice any major changes in my skin, but I have no doubt that with consistent use, my skin would become firmer. Can’t wait to finish the bottle. Ingredients Galore
