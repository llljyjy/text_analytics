I have been using it for like 6 years….more than 30 bottles has been consumed. It is super lightweight, watery texture,, zero burden for my oily acne prone skin. It helps with large pores even diminished my acnes. I use it at night before my Tretinoin cream since the research said Niacinamide play well with Vitamin A family……. And It really works!Also,,, it is super lightweight———- which is really important for my oily skin——The founder of this brand Paula Begoun also been using it since it came out…. I saw her video and she also develop the 20% niaciamide one,,, which is little too harsh for me…I love 10% one— i’ve been using it since it came out….
