This cleansing balm is one of the best on the market. The texture is thick and very moisturizing. It melted away my mascara and the rest of my makeup without stripping my skin. I also like how it is in a squeeze bottle which makes it more sanitary than ones you have to scoop out. This also doesnâ€™t sting or burn my eyes or skin!! It also turns into a milky cleanser when you add water to it! Must have cleansing balm
