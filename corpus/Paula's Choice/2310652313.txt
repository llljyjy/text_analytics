This is a great product, particularly for those that want the effects of retinol in a more gentle way. I recommend following the instructions and starting with 2-3 times a week usage then working your way up. I love that this product absorbs super quickly and has an added bonus of zapping my shine if I want to wear it during the day on Zoom calls with no makeup.  My skin immediately feels tighter after using and over time Iâ€™ve come to see less noticeability in my fine lines. Retinol without Regret
