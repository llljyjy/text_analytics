Love! I have oily skin and am very picky about moisturizers. Moisturizers for “oily skin” usually leave my skin feeling parched and those marketed for “dry skin” make my skin oily. Finding the perfect balance between the two is really difficult. However, this moisturizer hit it right on the nose. My skin feels hydrated, plump, and radiant! 100% would recommend! nan
