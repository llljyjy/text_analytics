I like the packaging a lot because it allows me to control the amount of eye cream. You only need the smallest amount under the eyes so this will last me a while. Love vitamin c in an eye cream because it helps my dark circles a lot! it doesnâ€™t completely make the dark circles disappear but definitely helps. nan
