I really like the texture of this toner. It’s light and watery, and super easy to pat into the skin. I find and hydrating and soothing and I feel like it’s the perfect way to begin layering hydration in your skincare routine. I also really appreciate that it’s fragrance-free. I think if you want to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day, this product would be a great addition to your routine. Hydration!
