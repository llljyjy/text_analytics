I remember when Paula Begoun got her start as a beauty products watchdog, telling consumers which products performed and which didn’t, and what ingredients were best and what to avoid. She was truly before her time. So it’s great that she put together her own line of products with simple ingredients that work. And it’s even better  that Sephora carries them. This product is one of her best, does what it says, cleans pores, and is not heavy or sticky. Nothing else like it on the market. Love it for my skin! Thanks Paula!
