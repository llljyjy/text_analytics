I love Paula’s choice skin care products. This did not disappoint. I enjoyed the application, very easy to spread all over and less is more. With just one pump I felt like I had enough product to use on my face. My skin after rinsing off felt smooth and very hydrated. I will continue to use this product as my daily facial cleanser. I enjoy that it’s foaming texture as well, I enjoy how the product left my face looking very clean and soft. nan
