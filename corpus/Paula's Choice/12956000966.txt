I’ve used other retinol treatments and they have worked wonders for my skin in terms of reducing fine lines and pores. I don’t have sensitive skin, but this products burns. My skin is usually clear and smooth, and ever since I’ve added this into my routine my skin has taken a turn for the worse. It hasn’t lived up to its claims. I’m extremely disappointed especially with a price tag this high. I Don’t Recommend
