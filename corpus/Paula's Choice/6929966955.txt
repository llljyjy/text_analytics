All my life I have struggled with acne and trust me when I tell you I just used two products from Paula’s choice line that transformed my skin. This cleanser is a gods send at such an affordable price it first makes you wonder if it’s legit. This does such a good job with oil too I found. And at night I use the BHA liquid exfoliant. Do not hesitate to grab this. I have gone through bottles of these and will never change it back! best on the market
