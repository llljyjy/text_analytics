I loved this..but didn’t repurchase. In the AM I would layer this with lactic acid, then make-up primer, then foundation and it was all too much. It took forever for everything to dry down. I decided to use lactic acid serum and to get my niacinamide through a moisturizer.  For anyone just interested in Niacinamide, this is for you! (start slowly because it’s strong). Great Choice
