This is hands down the best niacinamide that I have ever used, and I have used a lot! One of my main skin concerns is the slight skin texture and breakouts and in the first few days this product wiped all of that away (it was not deep scarring just little bumps and skin texture).  This is a STAPLE now in my routine and I am so glad that I found it and tried it. WORKS WONDERS
