This vitamin C booster has a very watery formula. I kinda had a hard time getting used to it since it’d always slip off my hands occasionally. My skin is very sensitive and it stung a little in some areas for me. After using this for several weeks i did see some lightening on my acne areas. This has a light scent and isn’t too overpowering. Overall, this was a good serum. nan
