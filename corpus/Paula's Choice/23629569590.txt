I have loved Paulaâ€™s Choice products for a long time and have incorporated them in my daily routine. This Niacinamide booster is an excellent addition to my daily facial care. I add a couple of drops onto my palm and apply it all over my face and neck area. This gets absorbed quick and doesnt irritate or make the skin red. I feel i have seen a great difference in the luminosity of my skin with this product. The skin feels brighter and my dark spots have become lighter. I love how it makes my skin plump.
