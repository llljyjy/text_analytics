First, the texture/consistency of this vitamin C serum is different then what I am use to. It is thin with an ever so slight oily finish, that dries down quickly and leaves a beautiful glow on my skin. I love that it is fragrance free.  I would use it right after my toner and before any other serums. After a couple weeks of use I can tell it is a great addition to my skincare lineup. Excited to see even more positive results after continued use. nan
