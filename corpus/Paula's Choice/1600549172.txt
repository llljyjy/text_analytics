First impressions, was that this serum was pleasantly thin so it was very easy to layer. With continued use, I did notice a decrease in congestion and texture in my skin. No major immediate brightening, but time will tell! Only con, is that the product is a bit pricy for the amount you receive. Pricy, but does the job
