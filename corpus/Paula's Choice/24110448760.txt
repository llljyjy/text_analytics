I love this Paulas Choice C15 super booster serum. Its a very lightweight serum, absorbs in the skin very quickly. This concentrated booster with 15% pure vitamin C dramatically brightens uneven skin while improving the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. It has a blend of 15%stabilized vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) at a pH of 3.0,potent antioxidants including vitamin E and ferulic acid, and skin-smoothing peptides; as main ingredients. It helps with uneven skin tone, dullness, dark spots, discoloration and post acne marks. This booster is good for Normal, Dry, Combo and Acne prone skin. This serum can be use alone or with any moisturizers of your choice. It can be used twice a day, on face, neck and chest. So far im really impressed with this serum. Im looking forward to buy it again! Highly recommend Great product
