Wow, I am obsessed with this Plumping Eye Mask! I’m in my mid thirties and starting to deal with undereye issues, especially when applying makeup. This mask really brings my eyes to life! I look more awake, more refreshed, and my undereye area looks smooth and not puffy at all. It’s so nice because I can use it as a mask before bedtime, or I can use it to prep my undereye area before a glam makeup look. I’ve tried a few Hourglass skincare products and all of them are top notch in quality and effectiveness. I also love how the tube makes it so easy to get the product out. Super simple and easy! Undereye Area Looks So Refreshed
