I love the equilibrium line from Hourglass bc if itâ€™s filter like benefits. This eye mask did not disappoint. I love the thick gel formula as it instantly hydrates and plumps my under eye area. I use it right after my NuFACE toning device and I swear my under eyes look so invigorated and refreshed. The formulation is amazing for my dry under eyes, it is looking softer, smoother, and more alive! Love the texture!!
