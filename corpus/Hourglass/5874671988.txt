The Equlibrium Instant Plumping eye mask by Hourglass has been great for my under eyes. I’ve noticed they are more nourished, they don’t look as tired, and do look more hydrated/plumped. I would apply the product as recommended and have seen improvement since the first day that I started using it. nan
