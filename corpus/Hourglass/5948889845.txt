My favorite under eye product! I have sunken-in under eyes, and buying product this was my last attempt at improving the appearance before getting tear trough fillers. This is the best under eye products iâ€™ve used! I use it about 2-3x a week, and leave a thin layer on overnighth. My eyes the next day look plump, moisturized & brighter. I alternate between other products as well, but this one made the biggest difference! I would most definitely recommend buying if you have dunken in eyes like me 10/10 for Sunken eyes!
