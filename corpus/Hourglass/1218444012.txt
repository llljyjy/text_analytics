I have been using this Instant Plumping Eye Mask in the morning before I put on makeup. You have to leave it on  for 15 minutes and then I either carefully wipe off excess or massage it into my eye area well. Itâ€™s working great! I can see a difference in my fine line and wrinkles and it feels hydrating. Instant Plumping!
