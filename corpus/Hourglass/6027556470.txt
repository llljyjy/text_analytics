I have dry under eyes that are made worse by the fact that I wear contacts and my eyes are always watering. I like to use this in my skincare routine at night, I find that it helps my eyes feel more plump and awake in the morning when I’m doing my makeup. A little goes a long way with this product so you don’t need to overuse it and waste the product because it is expensive! This is definitely one of those products that you don’t necessarily need in your routine but once you get it and start using it you probably won’t be able to live without. I’ve really noticed a difference in how much less my under eyes are irritated and red since using this eye mask. I dont ever take it off after 15 minutes I just work the excess into my skin. nan
