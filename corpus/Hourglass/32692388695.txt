I tried the Hourglass Equilibrium Instant Plumping Eye Mask and I really liked it. I have now added it to my skincare routine. I follow the instructions on the packaging and wake up with hydrated skin under my eyes, whenever I use it at night. I have also tried it under makeup and love the results. I have combination skin but my undereye area is dry. And this winter the Hourglass eye mask is helping me keep my under eye area hydrated. This product is Vegan and has a slight plumping effect. nan
