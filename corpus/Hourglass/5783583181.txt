I received this product complimentary from Hourglass.  I was very curious about this new eye mask, so I put it to the test right away.  I like the packaging, it definitely makes the application easier. The formula is very smooth and hydrating. I apply this mostly and night and leave it on overnight. I like that I am waking up in the morning with a more hydrated under eye area. Overall I do enjoy this product, I haven’t seen significant changes on my skin (I do have dark circles, puffiness sometimes and fine lines), maybe because I haven’t been using this product for long. I am planning to use it for a longer period of time and see it at its full potential. Price point a bit high. Waiting to see its full potential
