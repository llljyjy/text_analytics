After turning thirty I developed dry and flaky skin on my eye lids. I used steroid cream to treat but wanted to find a long term solution that didnâ€™t thin the skin. Tried almost every hydrating eye cream and nothing worked long term. Saw the good reviews about this product but was hesitant about the price. This product turned out to be a great solution for it. I only use at night and on the upper eyelid but this has definitely improved the skin up there. nan
