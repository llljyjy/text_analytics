[Gifted by Hourglass] An instant plumping eye mask sounded so intriguing to me so I’m thankful to have gotten the chance to try this. It’s very pleasant to use and didn’t cause any irritation or sensitivities to the eye area. However, not sure if it’s because I don’t have a ton of under eye problems or what but I didn’t notice too much change from using it. I’m hoping that it’ll be more noticeable with more consistent use but it’s definitely not a must have for me. Regardless, I am enjoying it and will definitely continue to use it. nan
