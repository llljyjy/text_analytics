I had my doubts, but I was pleased to be proved wrong. This eye mask is so light, silky, creamy, smoothing and soothing. It feels amazing and it’s especially great for winter. No irritation, no swelling or burning or sensitivity. Just hydrating, firming goodness! It feels like it would contain silicone due to the slip texture, but it doesn’t. I also like that it isn’t heavy, but it’s still super softening! I have a variety of eye area products, but this is unique enough to hold its own place. It actually reminds me a little bit of a very high-end luxury French brand eye mask, except this one is much more affordable in comparison. I have used this as an eye cream and I have also used it overnight. I’ve massaged it in and it works all of those ways. I love how quickly my area feels smooth and hydrated. I’m not sure I would say “plump,” but very smooth and wrinkles and fine lines look way less visible. Highly recommend this one. Silky smooth and awake eye area!
