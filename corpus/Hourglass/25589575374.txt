It’s my first time trying an eye mask and I must say I love it a lot more that eye patches! I don’t have wrinkles yet, but I struggle with puffiness and dark circles (dark circles are genetics and they never go away), but the puffiness was gone in less than 10 minutes! Mask is very easy to apply and leaves the skin under eyes smooth and moisturized. It’s a bit pricey, but works well and the tube will last a long time. nan
