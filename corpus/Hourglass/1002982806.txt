I received this product to try and I like it but for $68 would I recommend or re purchase NO. It’s a thick gel like texture and I use a dot size amount on each eye and it does hydrate and plump the skin under the eye and it looks so shiny and glossy but do you need it, NO. I have been using it with or without makeup, when I apply it during the daytime before my sunscreen I love it because it’s not so shiny looking, at night I don’t mind it, under makeup I don’t really see a difference other than a hydrated under eye. I normally apply the product then a while later I dab it into my under eye. It’s ok, not worth the price
