I have dark circles under my eyes and now that I have a newborn, they’re often a little saggy too. I had really high hopes for this product so I hate to say, I was not impressed. This felt sticky on my skin and never felt absorbed. Afterwards I didn’t feel a huge difference either. I would love to love this product but I don’t think it’s for me! Not for me
