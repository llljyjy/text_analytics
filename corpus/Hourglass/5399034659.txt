This is awesome for instant plumping and smoothing around the eyes! I also use it on my nasolabial folds it works great there as well. For me, the effects last about 6-8 hours before it kind of goes back to normal. The instrcutions say you can massage excess into the skin, but it sometimes pills under makeup. Overall, this is nice to have for special occasions, but itâ€™s a bit expensive to use everyday. Instant plumping and smoothing!
