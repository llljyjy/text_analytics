Let me begin by saying that I’m absolutely in love with this brand in general and was really excited to try this eye mask out. I’ve used 4 times, 2 times a week right before bed. I left it on for 20 minutes and oh my I do see a difference. My under eye area looks so much better, super hydrated and wrinkles seem to be vanishing off slowly but surely. Great Eye Mask
