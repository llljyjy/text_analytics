This instant plumping eye mask is the beeâ€™s knees! It has done wonders for my dry under eyes. I started noticing a difference in hydration after only one week. I prefer to apply it at the end of the day after I fully cleanse my face, but it also wears great under any concealer. Such a game changer, 10/10. So hydrating!
