I have been using this new eye cream with Hourglass and didn’t realize they had any skincare. This has no scent which I do love and it also is a gel texture. I do find this hydrates my undereyes very well! I didn’t notice any difference in lowering my puffiness. If you are looking for a great hydrating eye gel especially for winter, this is the one to get! It did also help keep my fine lines and wrinkles at bay! It does not instantly hydrate or reduce puffiness as it says but it does hydrate well. nan
