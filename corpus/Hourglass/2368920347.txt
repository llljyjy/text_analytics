Really impressed with this eye mask. I love this gel consistency, it leaves my under eyes area so smooth and hydrated. It’s been a week I have been using this eye cream in the morning before I head to work. I would just let it soak into the skin for 10 mins before I apply other products.  I find that it’s instantly helping me with dark circles, and depuff my undereyes. It works for depuffing!
