The first time I tried this, I applied it to only one under eye so I could really see the difference between the two. I will say that because this is called a plumping eye mask, I was expecting it to have more of a plumping effect. With that being said, I was able to notice a brighter under eye when I used this product. It just helps you to look a little more awake. I will say that this product makes your morning skincare routine significantly longer because you need an extra 15 minutes for this eye mask. If you have the time to spare, this may work for you. I did see some results, but it wasn’t drastic. Out of convenience, I still might reach for my eye patches over these. This is quite a pricey product, but you do get quite a generous amount of product for what you’re paying. nan
