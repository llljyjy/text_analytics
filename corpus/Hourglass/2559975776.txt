The best essence on the market! Scent-free and hydrating; no wonder it won an allure beauty award. The only thing that could make it even better is if it was a clean product. Expensive but it lasts a couple months and it beats SKII essence, Juice Beauty green apple essence and Glow Recipe watermelon essence. nan
