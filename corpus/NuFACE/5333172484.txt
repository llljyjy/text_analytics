I have combination facial skin (oily around my forehead and between my brows, dry everywhere else). This cream made a great moisturizer and also seemed to clear up some minor blemishing on my forehead. I saw these results after 2 weeks, using once in the morning and again before bed. I love the dispenser which makes it easy to have on the bathroom counter or a vanity where you can just press down once and dab all over your face. With a much nicer price point than other products (such as the Dior Capture Totale cell energy cream at a whopping $115), and a product that feels great to the touch and is quite gentle compared to most, I’d say the softer, brighter skin and blemish clearing make NuFace worth buying. I can’t give it the full five stars because I did not see any firming benefits whatsoever. I’m not sure if I’ll be buying it again since the firming was my main concern. I didn’t buy the NuFace toning device so I wonder if that was the reason I didn’t see any firming after a month or so, so I might look into it. If so, that brings the price point much higher so it’s something to consider. Great product, minus the firming
