I had to knock off one star because while I love this product, there’s no way on the packaging for you to be able to tell if you’re running out. Also I find that it doesn’t work well with my moisturizer and spf and takes forever to dry down which is annoying since I like to keep my skincare routine quick in the morning. It pills up even if I do let it dry. I don’t want to have to go out of my way to get a new moisturizer and spf but I might have to. I’m wondering if I could do this with my night routine instead of my morning. Doesn’t work well with my other skincare products
