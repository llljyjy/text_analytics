I have two! Yes! I thought something was wrong with the first one….. it wouldn’t turn on. When I called, they told me that it was out of warranty. Even though I had only used it four times. So I thought, it’s my fault, I waited almost a year before using it. So I bought a second one. Stop working after only three months! Horrible! Absolutely horrible! I called, asked for a supervisor. Nothing! Basically they told me there was nothing they could do. I waited too long. Do not buy this product. The battery is horrible! Horrible!
