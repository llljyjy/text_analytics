I have both the face and eye devices, and I would never in a million years spend $40 - $60 to buy this gel. For one, I would not leave this gel on my face for longer than the treatment session. It dries very quickly and can’t really be used as real skincare in my opinion. It broke me out when I just started using it, though my skin got used to it but I have much better skincare products that I’d rather leave on my face all day. For two, I have a handful of gel face masks that are actually good for my skin and come in much larger sizes for cheaper. I didn’t notice a visible difference when I used the device over non-nuface gel. Way overpriced for what it is
