2 years of off and on use and it’s now not working. The blue lights flash, it beeps and then it turns itself off. Tried charging but its still does the same lights up and turns off.    At the cost of over $400 this unit should still be working after 2 years.   Nuface warranty is only for 1 year. So off to the trash it goes. Truthfully I didn’t notice much of a difference when using it. Expensive and unreliable
