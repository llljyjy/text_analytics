I use this with my NuFace device. Gel is fine, works great. I don’t like the dispenser. It’s unnecessarily large and wasteful. Just put the gel in a simple pump dispenser. I want to see how much remains in the container and I also want the visual evidence that I’ve used all the product. I don’t like throwing away such a large piece of plastic. Bad container, good gel.
