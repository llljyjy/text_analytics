Ordered Amethyst, next day shipping it was brilliant. I got so excited until I found a chip on one of the small curves where I’m supposed to use to circulate around my eye area. Still intriguing I got smart and ordered two so I can pick a better one. It’s natural stone, it can’t be perfect. 3 boxes in front of me under broad daylight, I had the urge to return all of them and I ended up keep one because of the trouble I’ve been through. It was not worth the money. I play with natural stones in jewelry making, the making of the products is not consistent. Shape, thickness, filing/smoothness on the edges and on top of everything Gua Sha is not an easy thing to do at home to yourself. Think twice. Do not Buy it Simply Because It’s Pretty
