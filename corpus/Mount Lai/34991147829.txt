I received a deluxe size sample the Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Balm for free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. This balm warms in your hands and turns into a serum. It soothes and moisturizes the skin, and it also works well with facial tools. It honestly smells like a spa! I have a few tools, such as a jade roller and a contour roller that I admittedly donâ€™t use as often as I should. This balm makes me want to use them more! It helps the tools glide over skin while softening, repairing, and restoring your skin. You only need a pea size amount for the whole face and just a little more for the neck. I received a deluxe size sample, but a full size jar comes with a silver scooping spoon. Smells like a spa
