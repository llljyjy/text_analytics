I receive this balm as complimentary from Mount Lai in exchange of my honest review. It came in a sample jar, so it doesnâ€™t include the little silver spoon, the texture is a bit thick so it is a bit difficult to work with without the little spoon. It is hydrating and soothing after applying. The scent is not my favorite. nan
