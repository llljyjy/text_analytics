I am an economical beauty shopper and don’t splurge on many products, but I will consider making room for this one once my current container runs out. I just dab a little on my fingertips and massage it into my skin. I have very acne-prone skin and this doesn’t cause any blemishes. My skin is so radiant and dewy after using it. I’ve used it day and night. I really didn’t think I was going to like it as much as I do, so it is quite a pleasant surprise! Surprise Hit
