I bought this in April 2022 despite the mixed reviews. I want to sculpt the lower half of my face and have tension in my jaw, so I decided to try this tool for both purposes. Regarding the delicacy - mine came intact and working, with both balls rolling, but it does feel fragile in two ways: the natural stone and the construction. This is designed differently than other massage rollers I’ve seen out there... the jade balls have a slightly oblong hexagonal surface, as opposed to smooth jade balls. The result is that as these roll across any area of my skin that has fat (such as my cheeks), it gently grips the flesh between the texture of the balls and tugs it in that direction, instead of just gliding across the skin. In my experience so far, that is the feature of this design that actually makes it worth it. The blood flow in my face feels more stimulated from this gentle “pinching“ motion than it ever has from a smooth roller, and I have my own way that I like to roll my face that always pulls upward. So this roller is always massaging/tugging the plumper areas of my face “up“. I’m extremely happy with that - but careful not to tug on delicate areas. The construction of this is excellent for facial sculpting, but perhaps more fragile, so definitely register it with Mount Lai and try not to drop it. And this natural jade feels a lot more delicate than what I’m used to handling in terms of beauty tools (plastic, metal, or even thick glass)... I’m sure this would break if dropped. If you’re worried about the breakage issues, they do make this same design in rose quartz. I haven’t gotten that version but in my experience, rose quartz feels a bit heavier and more shatter-resistant than jade. Personally, this roller is an A+ for me as long as I use it right for my face and don’t break it. Hope this helps. nan
