I been using Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Balm foe about 3 weeks. It has a lip balm type of texture but not as greasy and the smell is herbal but not that strong. You only need a small amount as it spreads out good. Iâ€™ve tried it with my gua sha and it work good maybe not as well as an oil but I still prefer this. It has left my skin so soft. And like others have said it sinks in well with no stickiness and gives a gorgeous glow to the skin. Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging
