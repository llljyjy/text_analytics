I really do like this serum.  I enjoy the earthy scent, how the product just melts into your fingertips, and how a little goes a long way.  For me, the only drawback is the physical act of spreading it on my skin.  I can’t help but pull my skin in all different directions in order to spread the serum evenly over it.  Also, if you have any sort of breakout or scab, you need to be extra careful or you’ll tear that scab right off.  You really have to work to rub the serum in.  Your face is indeed left supple and dewy, though.  I haven’t exactly aged backwards, but it does seem like a high quality product. nan
