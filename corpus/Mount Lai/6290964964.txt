This is the second time I purchased the Gus sha facial lifting tool. I already knew how fragile this tool can be. Despite me using a little bit of facial oil, the tool becomes super oily and slippery. So it fell into the sink and shattered into many pieces. I don’t recommend this product Don’t waste your money
