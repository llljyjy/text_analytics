I like how the product melts with touch and it goes on smoothly. It leaves a nice shine and smooth texture once you figure out the right amount. You only need a little, on my first day I applied too much and it didnâ€™t absorb into my skin and left a greasy feeling. After adjusting the amount, it works great. Only draw back is the scent, there is a slight smell that is off putting to me but goes away very quickly. I would recommend this product. Little goes a long way
