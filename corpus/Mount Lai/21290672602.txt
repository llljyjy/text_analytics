I have ordered this specific gua sha twice, 2/9/2020 and 2/1/2022. RIP to both.The initial unit ordered lasted nearly two years. Joining me on countless road trips and eventually some international adventures as well.  It rested on my bathroom counter and was dropped too many times to remember.   I used it almost every day and appreciated the texture as I would glide it along my skin while I followed tutorials on social media. it was smooth to the touch but also just a smidge coarse when applied to the skin.  It did its job.  Its definitely the nicest gua sha I have yet to experience and its appearance is even more lovely in person.  However, it all came to an end one day when I dropped a glass container of deodorant on it and it cracked.  I immediately ordered a replacement. The replacement looked almost as pretty but felt a bit lighter and had a different texture. It did the job but wasn’t the same.  It lasted two days. It fell about 3 inches from oiled hand to bathroom counter and it broke into multiple pieces. I understand that this product is not indestructible but it seems as if the quality drastically reduced during the last two years.  I would caution those considering ordering this item if you don’t plan on storing it in its box in a drawer between uses. I have yet to find a worthwhile replacement to recommend and am sad to stray from Mount Lai. !ALERT! Luxurious, Fragile  and Short Lived
