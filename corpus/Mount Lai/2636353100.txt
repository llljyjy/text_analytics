As someone with dry skin that lives in the desert, I was very impressed with this product. I would use this in the evening after washing, toning and then apply and use my gua sha stone. At first feel, you would think this would stay on top of the skin or feel heavy, but it melted into my skin beautifully and my skin felt instantly hydrated and dewy- not oily. In the morning my skin was visibly more plump and felt great. Hydrating Balm
