Amazing product - I was pleasantly surprised! I have received a free full size sample of Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm from PinchMe. I can understand why this product was so small. They do in small batches to keep up with the freshness of the product. I don’t particularly like the smell because it reminds me of celery sticks, however, this is all organic and all natural and will not smell anything fake such as fruity or perfumey. You will need to use a spatula and just scoop up a tiny bit and this stuff melts right in your hands. It’s very easy to apply to the facial skin. It wasn’t greasy and it absorbs easily into the skin. I really like this product a lot! I haven’t used any of the gua sha tools. I just used my fingers to massage my skin - works perfectly well too! Amazing Serum that melts in your hands!
