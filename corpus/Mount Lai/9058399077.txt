Unique consistency with herbal scent. I am obsessed with Chinese herbal things so this balm sounds right up my alley. I used it for a few times so far. It works really well with my other skincare products. It melts into oil once it touches my palms, then I will slather it on my face and use it as a gua sha medium. A lil goes a long way. Highly recommend it! nan
