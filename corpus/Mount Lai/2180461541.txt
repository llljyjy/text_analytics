I have been using the Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm. It has a distinct scent but not unpleasant. I don’t find it to be super moisturizing, it reminds me more of like a lip balm texture/feel. I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my skin but do plan to use the rest of the container to see effect. So I can’t say that I recommend or don’t recommend fully Interesting
