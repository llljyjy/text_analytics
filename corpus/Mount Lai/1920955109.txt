The Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm is one of the most luxurious balms/serums Iâ€™ve ever used. It is super soft and melts into your fingertips as you pat it into your skin. A little bit goes a long way and leaves my skin feeling soft, oiled and moisture-filled all day. It did leave me a tiny bit greasy, but not bad. The smell is unexpected, yet pleasant-- an outdoorsy, natural scent. I was hesitant to love this at first due to the size of the container. (NOTE: it appears the full size product will be larger when it launches, per the picture, than the one we were given to try.) The only reason for the 4 stars is the price point. I think it is a nice, splurge product, but given the small size it may be hard to justify the price. Amazing balm treatment
