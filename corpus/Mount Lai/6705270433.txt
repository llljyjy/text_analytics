I loved the experience of applying this product, and it made me use my facial massage tools more consistently than I usually do. There’s a slight scent that I didn’t mind but I could definitely see it bothering some people. The ritual of applying it made it feel like a luxury for my skin! I only had a sample size so I didn’t give it enough use to determine long-term effects, but it did make myself feel soothed and moisturized! Pleasant
