Such a great serum!! Literally melts into skin, and is super easy to use. I love using it as a lubricant for my Gua sha stone as well. If you have super dry skin like I do, I totally recommend this serum. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is for the price, I really hoped it came with some sort of scooper or spatula to get the product out. nan
