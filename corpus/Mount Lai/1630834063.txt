This product isn’t great but it’s not terrible either. It helps make my gua shua glide across my face with zero tension or pulling. Smells pleasant as well. It did help reduce the dry patches and skin flakes as a result of tretinoin use. It did help calm the skin down as well and slightly reduces redness. While it wasn’t a bad product, I do not think I’ll be repurchasing it nan
