I had never heard of a serum balm type of product so I was excited to try this. I have dry skin and have to apply a ton of moisturizer to prevent dry patches. I like to use hydrating serums to help with that under my moisturizer. I really like this product! It smells nice and melts right into my skin. A little goes a long way. My skin feels softer and extra hydrated after using. I love the packaging as well, I think this is a quality product and it feels a bit luxurious. Love this!
