After using this cream for a little while I have found that I like it more and more with each use. At first I thought the balm smelled weird, but it grew on me. The applicator that’s included makes this item feel like a luxury item. Usually they come in pump bottles or tubes so this was a nice change. It absorbed nicely and wasn’t greasy which is a plus for me! nan
