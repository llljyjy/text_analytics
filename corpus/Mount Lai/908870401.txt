Love!  You only need a *tiny* bit of this balm for your entire face.  When I first put it on, I felt like it was really greasy and would make my face greasy, but it did not!  It sinks in perfectly and I woke up with fresh feeling skin.  I used it at night and massaged it into my skin before going to bed.  I canâ€™t wait to see how well it works in the winter.  A new must have! nan
