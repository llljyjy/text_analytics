I have a few of these gua shas now and this one is the best. Yep thinner and therefore more delicate and fragile. However, that makes it better at massaging the lymph from under the skin. Its like a squeegeeâ€¦ you want it to be thin like a credit card to get near the skin. Super fragile though. I am so careful with it. If it drops at all, it will break. most effect Gua sha
