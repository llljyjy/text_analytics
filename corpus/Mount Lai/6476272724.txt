I received a free sample of this product and was excited to try it.  I love the scent and the packaging, but the balm just didnâ€™t work on my face.  I have combination skin so I was hesitant to try it on my chin and forehead.  It left those two areas greasy.  I think this would be good for some people, but not for me. Nice scent -but underwhelmed
