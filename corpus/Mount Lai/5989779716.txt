This is such an interesting serum. When you think of serum you typically think of a bottle or pump and something very liquid. This however comes in solid form and breaks down to feel like a serum on the skin. I think the scent is light and lavender-like which makes it soothing in all the senses. I would recommend this for someone needing an anti aging overnight repair treatment. Lovely solid serum
