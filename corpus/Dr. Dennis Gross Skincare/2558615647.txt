I have never been a fan of Vitamin C but this one is a different story. My skin feels softer and I have less dark spots. It is a little bit sticky and I don’t love the smell but I honestly love the results! I really recommend it! Also don’t forget to use sunscreen if you apply it during the day! Amazing Vitamin C!!
