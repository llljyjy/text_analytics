This seems to work really well on my skin. I’ve been using it in my skin care routine and my skin has been looking good. But it smells AWFUL (this is the first product that I’d have to actually complain about the smell), and when trying to use the dropper to put on your skin, the excess product on the outside of the dropper drips everywhere. You have to wipe off all the sides before trying to use. Just an annoyance, I ruined two shirts before I learned. Probably would not buy again. Works but smells gross & dropper system isn’t good
