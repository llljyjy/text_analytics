I absolutely love vitamin c but my skin is a little sensitive to it. I was curious to see how my sensitive skin would react to vitamin c in an eye serum. I really love how gentle and effective this eye serum is. I plan to use it once every few days to help reduce wrinkles and keep that skin bright. Gentle and Effective!
