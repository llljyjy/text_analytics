I received a sample of this and I’m not one to ever complain about a product having a smell, but this one was wild lol. It straight up smells like you poured the the juice from the Oscar Mayer hot dog packages. Besides the smell it’s a very nice serum and makes me have glory skin Nice serum BUT smells like hot dog juice
