I received this product complimentary from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare for review but the opinions are my own. I was not using any actives other than this product both morning and night. I did wear sunscreen daily. My skin cleared up, splotchiness disappeared, and became brighter. The pigmentation left after my recent breakouts lightened up dramatically and no new blemishes appeared. I honestly liked this product! Expensive but works!!!
