What an amazing bundle! I’m a huge fan of peels, but never tried peel pads before. I’m very impressed! So easy to use and the results are visible after 4-5 days of using. I must say that if your skin isn’t used to acids - don’t go too hard and use the peel pads every other day, so you don’t end up damaging your skin. I love how the cleansing gel, peel pads and moisturizer worked together - my oily bumpy skin started to look better without over drying (thanks to moisturizer!!) and my pores tightened up a little. All 3 products are very high quality and thoughtfully compliment each other in skin improvement journey. Highly recommend!This product was gifted to me by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Absolutely amazing
