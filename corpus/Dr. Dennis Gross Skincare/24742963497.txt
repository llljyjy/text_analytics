Just, wow. I used up all of the 5 treatments from the small pack, and immediately shelled out the money for the larger pack of 35. You should know, I’m pretty cheap. I don’t spend a lot on something unless it works.  I have paid $50+ for light dermatologist peels in the past, and I honestly think this is better.  Immediately after one use, my skin on my face and neck felt so smooth. After a few uses, I could see a visible improvement of texture. I have used about 8 of these peels so far with varying days in between, and each time my skin looks and feels great after. It’s cleared up any breakouts I’ve had, and has already made a difference in the texture of my skin which has years of acne scars. The peel has its limitations—it’s not likely going to “fix” deep acne scars, but it has improved the overall texture and I think that has already made them less noticeable. I actually went to the dermatologist and she said, “your skin looks great!” Something I’ve never heard before. In addition, it smells good and is very easy to use—unlike some other liquid peels. I can’t wait to see what it does after a full 40 uses. Love it. Worth it.
