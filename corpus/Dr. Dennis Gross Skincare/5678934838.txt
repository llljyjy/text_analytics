Yes it does smell but doesn’t really bother me too much. You do get a bit of a glow but I’ve just started noticing that it kind of leaves a bit of a residue even after I cleanse. I used a pad with toner on it and when I lightly scrubbed my skin was like pilling and it was slightly orange, which is the colour of the serum. Overall I’m not totally sure if it is doing anything but I can say that I have acne prone skin and it hasn’t caused any huge breakouts! nan
