I feel like I’ve seen results, and my skin does feel softer.. but I’ve also noticed pretty bad break outs when I stop using it. I honestly wish they would just put the formula in a serum instead of on these harsh wipes. Rubbing your face every day with these wipes is not only bad for the environment but bad for your skin. Very strange for an anti aging treatment. why the wipes?
