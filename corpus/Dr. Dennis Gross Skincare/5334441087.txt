I got this as a free pack of 30 gift when Sephora does their offers when you buy items online. You get 10 packs but I ordered three different times and I was like hey, it’s 10 packs for free, might as well try it. I didn’t use this for a very long time until recently. I started noticing recently a really long and deep wrinkle across my forehead (Frankenstein sutures across the forehead) look and was panicking as it got deeper and deeper. I remembered I had several packs of these in my closet and started using it. At first I didn’t see results about the wrinkle on my forehead but noticing the rest of my skin was getting clearer. I have acne prone, super duper oily skin. I also work in the medical industry so wearing masks all day for 10 hours every day, my acne was getting worse and worse. These pads seriously helped get rid of my acne and acne scars I had developed in the last two years because of Covid. I only use this two times a week because it’s pretty powerful even with my super duper oily, acne prone skin. Fast forward to two months or more, my Frankenstein wrinkle is gone! I no longer have that deep wrinkle and my face is all cleared up besides the usual time of the month acne. Since I only use this two times a week, it lasted me up to two months or more. I am forever buying these peel pads from Dr. Dennis Gross. I had ran out and started panicking needing to buy these. So I went to Dr. Dennis Gross’ website, they were having 30% off on their website. Now I’m stocked until October. I am never going without these now that I have seen results! As they say, give skincare time and the results will either be there or not and this has definitely changed my skin and the results are fantastic! I regret that I didn’t take a before and after photo considering I didn’t think anything of this to get rid of my wrinkle but now I am never without these! Can't live without these now....
