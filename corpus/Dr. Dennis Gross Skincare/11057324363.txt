I’m so glad that I added this to my skincare tool kit! I use it nightly, sometimes with a mask on and sometimes without, and I’ve noticed some major improvements in the size of my pores, the texture of my skin and my overall complexion.I really enjoy that this steamer is temperature controlled and set to a timer, it makes for a super seamless steam! Great tool!
