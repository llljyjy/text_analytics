Before I say anything good about this you should know that it’s VERY drying which makes sense as it has retinol but, that being said, it’s phenomenal. In about a month my skin around my eyes looks incredible; I definitely went to hard at first and my under eyes became really dry so pace yourself but oh my gosh the results are really worth it. My skin is so smooth and now that I’m using more hydrating products during the day and this at night my fine lines are seriously almost completely gone. Amazing. Very drying but effective
