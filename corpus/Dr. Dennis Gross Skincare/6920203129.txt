this cleanser absolutely removed all of sunscreen and makeup so well! After washing it left my skin so soft and smooth. my only complaint is that as a person who wears a lot of eye makeup, this definitely stung the eyes trying to remove all of it. Iâ€™m so sad, because it would have been perfect if not for the awful stinging. stings eyes :(
