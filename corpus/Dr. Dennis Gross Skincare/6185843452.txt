this is my first time trying out the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare brand and I am loving so far! My skin is always super dry during this time of year, and I’ve tried more moisturizers than I can count. This one is a great everyday moisturizer! It’s super light, soaks right in, and the product goes a long ways! I can’t wait to keep using to see how it affects fine lines and pores! Soaks right in!
