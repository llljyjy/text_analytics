I’ve been using this peel for a short time now, but I’m already getting unbelieveable results.  I’m mid-60s and have slightly oily skin, with life-long stubborn little blackheads and whiteheads in my T-zone.  I’m accustomed to using peels and my skin can handle the extra-strength versions.  Prior to using this one, I was using the Dr. Gross extra-strength peel daily for a couple of years.   I honestly didn’t know if this stronger peel would have any further effect on my skin.  However, after only the first try, my skin already looked somehow “pinker;“ that is, the “freckles“ (actually multiple sun spots) all over my cheeks had a diminished appearance.  I’ve been using it three times per week, and so far, the results are amazing.  I figured I’d have those stubborn sun spots the rest of my life.  They are the result of lots of teen-age sun damage.  However, they are starting to disappear.  It seems like a miracle to me.  My skin looks smooth, radiant, and more even-toned.  I am fair with a neutral-pink tone, and my tone has become more pink and dewy looking.  I’m actually getting the skin I’ve dreamed of my entire adult life.  I don’t like wearing lots of makeup, but to conceal my sun spots, I’ve always had to wear some type of foundation.  I am now using this peel 3X per week and the regular, extra-strength daily peel the other 4X per week.  With the results I’m getting from this regimen, my skin is looking so good that I have started leaving off the foundation.  Just a little powder and blush and I’m good to go.  Often I only use a primer and no makeup at all.  My skin is glowing and I have a new confidence in my appearance.  My stubborn blackheads and whiteheads are starting to disappear.  I am so jazzed about my skin, I can’t wait to get up in the morning and see how good it looks.  I cannot recommend this stuff enough.  Dr. Gross skincare really WORKS.  You do have to be consistent; twice-daily skincare is key.  Seriously; try this peel. THIS PEEL WORKS MIRACLES
