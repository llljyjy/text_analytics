I apply The vitamin C lactic 15% vitamin C firm and Bright serum after I cleanse and pat my skin dry . I would suggest to not apply any chemical or physical exfoliating products so it wonâ€™t cause any irritation. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. I then layer with an am or pm moisturizer on top. nan
