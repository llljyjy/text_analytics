I had just tried this brand for the first time a few weeks prior to ordering this face cream. I had tried the universal peel, and I was blown away by the results! I was not disappointed when I then tried this moisturizer! It feels SO luxurious and nourishing. It truly deeply hydrated my skin, which then resulted in beautiful, dewy skin come morning! Itâ€™s a yes for me! It's a yes for me!!
