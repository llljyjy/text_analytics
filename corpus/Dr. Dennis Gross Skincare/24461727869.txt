I love this product! It firms and brightens your under eyes, even after one use! It’s easy to use and can be paired with any of your skin care. It has a lite scent but isn’t overpowering, so is good for anyone who might have a sensitivity to smell. Packaging is chic and cute. It is in the pricey side, but you get what your pay for. Definitely recommend nan
