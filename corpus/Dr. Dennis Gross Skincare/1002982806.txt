I love this moisturizer for daytime use. I use this on top of another sunscreen and add sunscreen on top and I feel hydrated and moisturized throughout the day! I have been using about 2-3 pumps everyday and the packaging is nice because it shows the elevation of how much product is left in the container vs it being all messy and having to open the product to get the rest out.  The pump is also really nice. I haven’t been adding a vitamin c serum under this everyday which I normally use! My skin isn’t sensitive to the lactic acid that is in this either, so it creates a good combo and barrier with my other products. No sensitivity at all. I also feel glowy but not greasy and my skin looks brighter overall Love this product
