Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare sent me their Advanced Retinol + Ferulic Intense Wrinkle Cream complimentary in exchange for my honest review, and I am a big fan! Retinol creams can often be drying, but this one is surprisingly hydrating. It does the job of effectively fighting wrinkles and smoothing skin without the irritation, making it a great option for sensitive skin. This cream is made with a niacinamide and Phyto-Retinol Blend of retinol and soothing botanicals bakuchiol, rambutan, and ferulic acid. Itâ€™s effective, moisturizing, and safe for morning and night use. I got great results and enjoyed using it. It gets bonus points for being vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. Great option for sensitive skin
