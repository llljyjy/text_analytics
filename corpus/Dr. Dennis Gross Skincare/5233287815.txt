I just finished the entire bottle, a half pump 1-2 times daily under and around my eye contour area and let it soak in before applying other face products. Literally saw no difference in my fine lines. I’m 30 years old and feel my under eye lines aren’t even that bad. I’ve had better success with other high end eye creams that cost much less. So disappointed given the reviews and price. Full bottle used with no results
