I’ve been using this for about a week now, so of course I need more time to see the true results. As a first impression, this has been a nice, lightweight Vitamin C moisturizing cream. It claims to ultra rich, which I would disagree with, but I think a thinner formula is better for day time wear anyways. I find that it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. With that said, I am not finding that it leaves my skin feeling really hydrated or dewy, like it claims. More so, I’ve found that it’s dried out my skin and left me with some peeling. That must mean there is a good level of vitamin c / lactic acid in this product, which is good to know. I have dry, sensitive skin, so I’m hoping after more time my skin will adjust. Others might have a higher tolerance. The scent is very light and I haven’t noticed any breakouts. I’ve also been wearing this under makeup and haven’t had any issues but sometimes I feel like it’s on the verge of “pilling” so I try to give it about 10-30 minutes to absorb into my skin before applying makeup. I tend let my skincare set in anyways before applying makeup so it’s not a big deal to me, but if you are someone who does their skincare and jumps straight into makeup, I would atleast give it a couple minutes and try not to use products that need to be rubbed into the skin. I haven’t noticed any plumping yet, but I’m hopeful. Usually those kind of effects don’t kick in until you are almost finished with the jar - so if you are looking for those kind of results, be patient.This product was gifted in exchange for an honest review.
