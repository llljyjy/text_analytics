I am someone who can be extra sensitive to glycolic acid, and lactic acid has always been my favorite AHA. This moisturizer is a great combo of that and vitamin c, however, I would consider this more a serum than a moisturizer. Unless you have super oily skin, I don’t see this being enough moisture. The consistency is also more in line with a serum, so that is how I used it. I would use it as a serum and top with a moisturizer and it worked great. I like this for a one and done product with your AHA and antioxidants, and the finish leaves your skin super smooth. I didn’t have any irritation with this, and I definitely recommend it. Great alternative to harsher acids!
