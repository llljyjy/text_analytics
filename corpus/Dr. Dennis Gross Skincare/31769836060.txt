Save your money! I purchased based on all of the positive reviews, so many claims of seeing improvement after only 2 weeks, i did not see any improvement in 2 weeks but wanted to give it 30 days to be fair. This product did absolutely nothing, I used in combination with Dr. Gross stress rescue serum and found my skin and eye area to be dry by mid day, zero improvement in fine lines, zero improvement in  crows feet, zero improvement in hydration. Most regrettable, hard earned 200.00 wasted. Dr. Gross(ly) reduces your bank account only.
