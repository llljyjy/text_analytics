I received this product complimentary from Dr Dennis Gross. I love DDG lets get that out of the way. I have super dry skin< I use this eye serum at night on opposite nights of my retinol routine because if I use it during the day, it dries out my undereye. i really love the results. it helps reduce my undereye puffiness in the am & my dark circles. drying but i love the results
