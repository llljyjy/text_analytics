So far so good! It’s a silky cream that is gentle and very moisturizing indeed. It goes on easily and gets absorbed quickly. You can definitely use it in the morning even if you’re in a rush. All makeup glides on top effortlessly, too. The bottle is great as well - it is lightweight and compact enough to bring it with you when traveling, and the dispenser keeps it all neat and tidy. nan
