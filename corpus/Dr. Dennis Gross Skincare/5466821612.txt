I love the Universal Peel Pads! They make my skin look absolutely amazing and I always have a stash of them in my skincare drawer.  I don’t use them daily but instead about 3 times a week and that’s enough to really make a difference in my skin. My skin is clearer, smoother, and has a glow to it when I use these regularly. This set is amazing because it’s like you get the moisturizer and cleansing gel for free.  This was gifted by Dr Dennis Gross Skincare. Leaves skin glowing
