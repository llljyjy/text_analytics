This is my holy grail. I’ve used these on and off since I was 16. I use them on and off because they are pricey. Whenever I need a reset, have some extra spending money, or just want to treat my skin I always go for these. I had an esthetician tell me my skin looked like I had gotten a peel and facial at a professional salon 3 days after I started using these again. I cut them in half and use half of each step at a time to prolong their usage and find it still works great! You have to pair with a sunscreen or it’s like you just did all that work, go into the sun, and took a thousand steps backwards. I also have pretty sensitive skin, I was using tretoin cream and before prescribing my dr asked if I was okay with peels. I responded yes and tried it out. It wrecked my face in a matter of days. The way that these are so strong and effective while not giving me any type of irritation is WILD. One of the best products out there for skin. Good for acne, lines, brightening, literally everything I’ve ever wanted to improve! If you need a sign to buy these, this is it. Like buying new skin in a box
