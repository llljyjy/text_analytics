I havenâ€™t been using a vitamin c serum consistently for a while and needed a good product to help combat sun spots, uneven tone, and general signs of aging.  I love this brand and trust the quality and effectiveness of their products.  I use this c serum in the morning right after cleansing.  There is no stinging or discomfort and it layers well under other products.  My skin tone and evenness has shown signs of improvement  at this point and I know that with continued and consistent use the results will only get better and better! My new go to c serum
