I’d give this product 6 stars if I could. I have repurchased it over and over for years. It is the only product I’ve ever used that visibly reduced the appearance of the deep smile lines/parentheses around my mouth. I am in my early 30s. In my 20s I smoked for (I know), which really makes those lines around your mouth very deep. This is the only serum I have ever found to reduce the appearance of those lines, and it does a phenomenal job. I often get compliments on my skin, and this is one of the two products in my routine that really makes a difference (the other is Vivier CE Peptides, which isn’t sold here). This product is fantastic and I never want to be without it. Game changer for smile lines
