Let me start by saying I’ve tried and loved many Dr Dennis Gross products including alpha beta peel, retinol + ferulic renewal serum and eye serum. Unfortunately after trying this Vitamin C Moisturizer my skin didn’t handle it well. It made my skin irritated and red so I’ve stopped using it and hope to reimplement. I tried to replace this product with Youth to the People Vitamin C serum which didn’t cause me any issues so I’m thinking maybe it was the addition of the lactic acid. nan
