I’ve been using Dr. Gross products for years now, and They never disappoint. The only downside here is the size of the product, but because it’s just for the Eye area it’s gonna last a long time. It has a faint scent to it and overall I do notice a glowy affect around my eyes for under make up. Great for glowy concealer base
