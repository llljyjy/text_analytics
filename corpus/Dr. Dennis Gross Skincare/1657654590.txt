I love the texture of this product and how it went onto the skin so nicely and didnâ€™t feel greasey or heavy at all. I used it for two weeks and I saw brightness but I liked how it gave my skin a nice even glow and that it did not irritate my skin at all. The price is a little high for the product but I would still recommend Great on skin for glow
