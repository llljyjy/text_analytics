Made my eyes look older! This isn’t even remotely hydrating and while it has enough retinol to cause my eyelids to peel off getting my brows waxed… it doesn’t seem to have enough to make a difference. Underneath my eyes is so creepy and dry I look years older than when I started using this. Maybe works in combo with a hydrating cream but who wants to have to use two eye creams. Big Nope
