I have a difficult time using vitamin C products because my skin tends to breakout. I’ve only been able to use one other cream before and now this one. It is a really nice lightweight lotion. It isn’t sticky and it’s made my skin feel and look smoother and brighter. Love that it contains lactic acid as well. Been using this as my AM moisturizer and will definitely purchase again and keep this in my skincare routine. Brighter Skin
