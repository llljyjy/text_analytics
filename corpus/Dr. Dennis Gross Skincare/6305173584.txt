I’ve tried just about every eye cream and serum over the years, but I really like this. It absorbs easily, doesn’t dry out the skin, and you can use it on the lids as-well-as around the eyes. I think that the crepy skin under my eyes, crows feet, and upper lid “hooding” have all gotten a bit better. And I’m only on my first bottle. Dr. Dennis Gross Eye Serum
