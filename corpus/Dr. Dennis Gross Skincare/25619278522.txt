I have been using these peels pads for years! I’m always on and off, but this year I decided to get serious about my skincare and have been using them 3 times a week every day for the past 3 months! My skin has been smooth, radiant, tighter and definitely cleaner!! If you are looking for a gentle yet effective peel these are for you!  *If it’s your first time doing a peel, try the Ultra Gentle line ! My all time favorite peel !
