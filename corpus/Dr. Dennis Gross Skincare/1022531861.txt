I have sensitive, dry skin. I tried the mini size in this product because I was afraid my skin would act negatively, but it reacted in  an extremely positive way. I actually can’t believe it. I only used them every other day, and my acne scarring is reduced, and so are the lines around my nose and mouth. I have sun damage on my neck, and it even reduced the marks from that. I’m very pleasantly surprised to see my skin is even glowing. I highly recommend them. I wish the full size weren’t so expensive. I may buy them in the future, after I have finished up another skincare line I am using now. This was a great way to do a trial run on them. Very pleasantly surprised with results
