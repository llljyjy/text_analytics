I’m a lover of DDG products and this is no exception. This moisturizer slash serum does it all and makes my mornings a lot faster and easier actually since I know I’m getting my hydration, brightening and protection. Love that it uses lactic acid with Niacinamide and the three types of Vitamin C since lactic is nice and gentle but still gets the job of keeping skin smooth and exfoliated done. I highly recommend checking this one out! Another winner from DDG
