My first starter kit from dennisgross and more than anything im loving the peel pads. They are gentle and donâ€™t make my skin sting. I love the way it refreshes my face kinda brightening up and i def see my pores on my nose looking more even and tight. The moisturizer is soothing and calms your skin if irritated by the peel pads. The cleanser is gel based and also feels refreshing. Overall love the whole kit. Gifted by dr.dennis gross skincare. Brightening
