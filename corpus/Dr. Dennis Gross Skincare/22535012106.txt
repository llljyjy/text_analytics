I spend $100â€™s on this product as all the reviews made it seem like the holy grail for adult acne. But I used consistently for 2 months and I swear my skin got worse. At first I thought it was great first week my skin was instantly better, but over time just got worse and worse constantly using the product. Very disappointed. nan
