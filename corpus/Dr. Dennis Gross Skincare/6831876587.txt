The vast majority of the negative reviews are due to user error- people seem to have ignored the directions completely and decided that 1) this is a second cleanser 2) you use it like a foaming cleanser. It needs to be put on DRY skin and it DOES NOT RINSE OFF. You wipe it off like you would an old-fashioned cold cream. If you actually use it the way they clearly tell you to, it indeed does remove ALL makeup.Also, a couple of reviews say that it “smells bad”. It doesn’t. People will complain about fragrance in a product and those same people will complain that it doesn’t smell good when fragrance isn’t used. You can’t have it both ways. Anyway, I recommend this as long as you can follow the directions! Please read the directions before reviewing!
