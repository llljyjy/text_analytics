I bought this on a whim because I used to be a HUGE fan of DDGâ€™s old Ferulic eye cream, which sadly is has been discontinued. This eye cream does not leave my under eyes dry like some of the reviews, but it definitely does not help with dark circle brightening or firming. Not worth the price tag!! Not worth the price tag!
