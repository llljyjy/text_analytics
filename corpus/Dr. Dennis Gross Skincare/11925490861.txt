I’ve been using the new Dr.Dennis Alpha Beta Daily Moisturizer for a few days now. I can for sure say that my skin looks more dewy since using it. The directions say to massage two pumps into clean, dry skin and I originally thought it wouldn’t be enough to cover my face but I was wrong. A little goes a long way. It definitely has dramatically changed the look of my skin. My make up sets better and doesn’t appear cakey or greasy anymore which is a huge plus. Dewy skin!
