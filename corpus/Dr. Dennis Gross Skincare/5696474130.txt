This is a must-have! I was so hesitant to purchase it because of the price but it is so worth it. I have very dry acne-prone skin. I have been on Accutane twice and when my skin started to break out again I did not want to have to go on the third time. I decided to do a ton of research and came across Dr Whitney Bowe’s skin cycling routine. I already had a perscription for tretinoin but when I first started using it I used way too much and it made my skin very sensitive. I also needed a product for exfoliation night. I wanted to try Paula’s choice exfoliant but it is not available through Sephora Canada so I decided to give this a try. I am so glad I did. This is my favorite product in my routine. I notice such a difference every time I use it. It exfoliates without dehydrating my skin which is a miracle considering I live in northern BC with very harsh winters. It somehow removes all the dead skin while leaving my skin literally glowing. It works so well with my tretinoin and moisturzier - I have never had my skin look so good. Because I only use it once or twice a week with the skin cycling routine it actually is not that expensive. This box should last me 6-7 months. I didn’t think I would like the individually packaged wipes but I actually love them. So good for traveling to. I have NOTHING bad to say about this product! Ive included images that are only 3 weeks apart. Obsessed is an understatement
