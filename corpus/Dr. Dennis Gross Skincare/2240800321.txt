I have really been loving this serum! It’s definitely one of my favorite Vitamin C serums at the moment, especially when paired with the matching cream. It tingles just a bit when applied, but then it feels okay. It leaves my skin looking glowy & more even toned. I would definitely recommend this serum! It’s Great!
