I’d like to say that it’s such a great set to try the essentials set. Unfortunately, it’s too irritating for my skin that I had to stop. It’s probably because I’m also using a retinoid in my routine. The good thing about it is that It made my skin super soft. The fragrance is great but too overpowering for me. It probably would work if I didn’t already use a retinoid. I received it gifted by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare in exchange for my honest review. nan
