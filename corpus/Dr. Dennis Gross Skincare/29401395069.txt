I’ve enjoyed trying the new Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Dewy Deep Cream. I think it’s an ultra-rich cream. It is powered by vitamin C. It intensely hydrates and transforms dry, dull skin I appreciate that it’s cruelty free.  It’s a perfect solution for uneven texture. Plus, it smells amazing! If you are looking for an all-around great product that hydrates, has amazing ingredients, and increases cell turnover – then I would highly recommend this one! It has made a difference in the appearance of my skin and it is now brighter, softer, and feels more hydrated. Love this and smells amazing!
