As others mentioned - it legit smells like straight up hotdogs! I can deal with a lot and smells don’t usually bother me. But this was a return mainly for the smell. I love his peels, face wash and eye serums. I’ll take his pore refining serum over this though. Used a few times but didn’t do much. Sadly a pass on this one. Hotdogs!!
