This... this right here. This is amazing. I am very picky with my skincare, to the point I rarely try new products... On a whim and in desperation to get rid of milia that I have had all my life, I tried these. I’ve used two or three so far, and while I can’t say its helped the milia yet, the overall look and FEEL of my skin is incredible, so much that these will now be a staple at least once a week. My skin feels softer and smoother than it ever has in my life, and its just simply glowing. Only one star off because of the price </3Do your skin a favor and if you’re hesitant, just give these a chance. Life changing. Skin and Life Changing
