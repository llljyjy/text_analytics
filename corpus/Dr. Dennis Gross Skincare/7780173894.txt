I received a sample of this product and I must admit i was hesitant when i saw the price. But holy was I impressed with how glowy and evened out my skin tone was after using it for just a few days. Even helped with my textured skin, seems softer now. I couldnâ€™t help myself to actually purchase it. Pricey but worth it.
