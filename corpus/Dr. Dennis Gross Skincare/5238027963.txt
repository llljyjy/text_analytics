Absolutely love this already. Although it has been a short time I can tell a big difference in my skin which doesn’t happen unless I am using tretinoin. The texture of my skin is smoother and I can tell there is an overall brightness to my complexion. The texture is lightweight. This didn’t irritate my skin and hasn’t caused any breakouts. I’m surprised at how much I love this!
