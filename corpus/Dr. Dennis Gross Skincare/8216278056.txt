okay so yes it’s expensive so I typically only use this once every three nights and swap it in with other AHA peel products. HOWEVER I am in love. a) I love how I can pack the little individual sachets with me on vacay, b) I’ve found this product very effective for basically brightening, evening and toning my skin. I have NOT noticed a difference in my dark spots but overall my face feels healthy and supple after using these.  if you have acne marks this will change your life! worth the price
