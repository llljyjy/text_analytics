These photos are taken 5 days apart. I www struggling with acne flare ups on my cheek and pretty unavoidable scarring. With continued use I know this will give me the skin I’ve always dreamed of. It’s pricey but 100% worth it. In my late twenties with combo semi sensitive skin. I had no irritation. I follow it up with a hydrating serum and slather some moisturizer on. USE AT NIGHT NEVER STOP MAKING
