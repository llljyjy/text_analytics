This is a nourishing cream to deeply moisturize dry skin but also has vitamin C to brighten the skin. I love how gentle this moisturizer has been! I have extremely sensitive skin and it doesn’t respond well to harsh vitamin C products. However, I’ve seen some subtle brightening results by using this cream consistently. Not only does it have vitamin C, but it also has Niacinamide and Squalane to strengthen the skin barrier! Great Vitamin C Cream!
