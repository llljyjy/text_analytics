I never breakout from beauty products but by day 2 of using the product my whole cheek was filled with little red bumps. My skin isnâ€™t super sensitive and tend to have pretty clear skin, but the vitamin C was too much for my skin barrier. Even though I loved the consistency and scent of the product, I returned it and went back to my old moisturizer Caused breakouts
