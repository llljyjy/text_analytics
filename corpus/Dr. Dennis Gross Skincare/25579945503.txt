I’m in high school (sophomore) and I regularly check in with my dermatologist. During middle school and freshman year I was using the retinol that was prescribed to me. I don’t have acne but it was destroying my skin and making things worse, I expressed that to her and she said it takes time for things to work. I had been using the products for four years so I took it upon myself to make my own skincare/makeup routine. This is the retinol I had researched and is what I now use! obviously this one product wont completely transform your skin but it works extremely well. The only thing is YOU HAVE TO WEAR SUNSCREEN EVERYDAY even if you only use it once a week it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun and can cause more pores and acne worse if you don’t wear sunscreen. I use Eltamd spf 46 (i wish Sephora sold it). I would give this retinol 10/10 for effectiveness and being gentle on the skin gentle effective retinol
