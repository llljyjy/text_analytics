I love any skincare products that has vitamin C in it, it does so well for brightening our skin and provide anti-oxidant. I have dry and sensitive skin, so I’m very cautious when using any type of acid on my face. This serum is made with 3 forms of vitamin C and lactic acid. Since it has lactic acid, I started with once a day and every other day, then once a day twice a week. So far, I don’t have any irritation and I feel hydrated after using this serum, which I believe it’s because of the squalane in it. I will continue using this serum and work up to every day use to see what other benefits it will give me. So far so good on dry skin. Good for Dry/Sensitive Skin
