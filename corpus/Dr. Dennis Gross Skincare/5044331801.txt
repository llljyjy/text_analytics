I’ve been enjoying this eye cream as something different in my eye product collection. I really appreciate that it’s a pump vs. a tub too The texture is light and creamy, and absorbs easily. After using for a week or two, I do feel like my dark circles have improved a bit (they were really rough over the last week) and I haven’t experienced any irritation which is great, since I know that Vitamin C can be a little difficult for sensitive skin. This is something I’ll be using day and night and occasionally with a heavier cream over top for my drier undereyes. Good addition to eye routine
