This moisturizer is so nice! It’s for all types of skin! It features 3 types of acid- glycolic, lactic, and malic acid- all of which work beautifully together to benefit the skin. I don’t know how to explain the scent but it’s refreshing and light. I love the consistency of the formula! it’s light weight and leaves the skin dewy and youthful. nan
