Packaging of this bottle is nice and simple and pump works great. Absorbs into the skin well and isn’t sticky or thick and I really like that it hasn’t caused me any breakouts since it’s also oil free. I feel like my skin looks more radiant/glowy since I have been using this for a couple weeks. I often only use it once a day because I forget to do it in the am & pm but I still feel like my skin is looking more hydrated and just looking and feeling better and has been making me feel so confident in my own skin on my no makeup days. The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is the smell of this but it works for me so it doesn’t stop me from using it but to me it smells like hot dog water but I’d still definitely recommend checking this out and cannot wait to see my long term results from continued use of this product. Great product just not a fan of the scent
