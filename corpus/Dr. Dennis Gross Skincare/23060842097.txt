I love this Vitamin C serum. A little goes a long way,and it definitely firms skin. Even after using it a few times my skin feels firmer to the touch. It does make my skin brighter kind or yellowish. I don’t enjoy that part,but I can look past it. Weird smell,but doesn’t bother me too bad. I would highly recommend! nan
