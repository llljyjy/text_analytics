I have using this Dr Dennis Gross Vitamin C moisturizer, and I have been really please. It feels light, but not watery. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily at all. It is easily absorbed, and it leaves the skin feeling very hydrated, soft, and brighter. The only little thing I’m not a huge fan of is that it has kind of a strong smells as soon as you use it, but it does fade and goes away completely after a while. I will continue to use it. nan
