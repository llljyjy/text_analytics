I’ve been using this about 2 years and because it comes in packets, I always share with others! This is by far one my favorite products I have ever purchased. Aside from it being so convenient to travel with, I began using this for my rosacea and acne. Starting with the Gentle peel daily, I could not believe how it cleared my skin and helped to level out the texture and redness of my rosacea, really creating a smoothness I don’t ever remember having. Now, using the Universal peel is a standard part of my routine, 2-3x per week. This helps keep my face soft and skin clear, especially around my nasal folds. Additionally, with hormonal acne that likes to break out on my neck and chin, I’ll use this when I can feel the breakout pain under the skin and the peel zaps it often before it surfaces. Zaps my hormonal acne before it surfaces!
