This product worked so well for me. It is such a great light-weight moisturizer. The texture feels like a heavier/creamier serum-like consistency that absorbs into the skin fast! It left my skin feeling plump, soft and brighter. It has certainly become a favorite, considering that it contains vitamin C. Itâ€™s like a two in one! I would definitely repurchase this! Amazing!
