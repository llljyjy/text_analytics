I got a sample of this and think it’s great! Very impressed! I’ve been using it in the PM only, as I use Skinceuticals Silymarin CF (C serum with salicylic acid) in the AM. I’ve noticed an improvement in discoloration and firmness and love that it has lactic acid for skin turnover. As for the smell? Vitamin C serum ALWAYS smells funky - that’s just the way it is! Get over it! This serum smells no different from other medical grade vitamin c serums. Impressive Vitamin C Serum!
