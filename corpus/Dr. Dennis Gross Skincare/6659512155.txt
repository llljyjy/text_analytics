Great product; I took off a star for the expense and the bizarreness of the packaging (you only get 16 pads for $78; it should be twice as many.) My skin would really benefit from daily use, but these are neither packaged nor priced to make that easy.The Dr. Dennis Gross line is designed around their “alpha-beta daily peel,“ which I find way too harsh to use daily at any strength. I wish these retinol pads were packaged for daily use and alpha-beta came in a 16-pack at half the price. Good product, bizarrely packaged and crazy pricey
