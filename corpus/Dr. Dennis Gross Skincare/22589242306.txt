I have always wanted to purchase this item, but never had the guts to try it. I finally decided to give in and get the 5 pack. I wasn’t having any high expectations I was just desperate for clearing my skin at this point. I was using retinol and it was helping just wasn’t helping enough. I had to wait a day and then used this product only at night. I did nights only to avoid the sun with this product on since it does make the skin more vulnerable(retinols, BHA, & AHA should be night products only). I made sure also to put on my sunscreen every morning also (I make my own sunscreen with zinc oxide/ an oil, zinc might have helped). My skin did get really dry at first so I had to take a 4-5 day break, but after that I used it consistently. My skin still has light spots and a few baby pimples. Yet, it’s still better then before. Something is better then nothing too me. Takes patience, but definitely worth it. I was honestly amazed just after using the 5 pack I had immediate results. I would 10/10 recommend this product. Quick, simple, easy solution for stubborn acne. Just WOW
