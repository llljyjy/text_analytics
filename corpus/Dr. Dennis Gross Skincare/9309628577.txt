Prevents new under-the-surface pimples from forming and helps to reduce ones that do occasionally pop up.I’ve slowly worked my way to using this nightly and have definitely noticed fewer cystic pimples and a reduced number of the smaller bumps on my cheeks!Started with a free sample, fell in love and have been using/repurchasing it for almost a year!Expensive but it’s definitely worth the money for me (especially because I’ve been able to cut out a bunch of other skin care products, including physical exfoliants, since this one has been doing the trick I’ve been looking for!) preventative and healing!
