This is one of my favorite eye treatments. I absolutely love how hydrating and moisturizing this treatment is. It has a light , beautiful texture. I definitely had noticed the improvement of my under eye area. It slightly brightened the skin . Especially in the mornings I noticed that my skin looks more hydrated and smoother, which gives overall the better and more refreshed look to my eyes. Definitely must have for me . Love it
