I love DDG and was happy to try this vitamin C. It’s L-ascorbic acid plus lactic acid so I was both excited and a little apprehensive on how my skin would react but so far so good. I don’t use it daily; I started with two days a week and have been working my way up slowly just to be sure. I appreciate that it’s oil free and still leaves the skin glowing and dewy looking. This is another DDG hit for me and I can’t wait to see my results moving forward! Love
