I used the Alpha Beta pads years ago and really felt it was great at exfoliating so I was excited to try this new kit! If used together I think the results are nice for keeping skin smooth and exfoliated while also giving it enough moisture. Only caveat for me is there is alcohol in the ingredients which I don’t really like to use. But I haven’t had excess dryness so I guess it’s okay. *This was gifted by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare nan
