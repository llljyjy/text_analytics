These are my holy grail product. I used to have acne throughout my twenties and early thirties and quite a bit of scarring. My aesthetician recommended these (ultra gentle ones first). When you first use them, with regular use, you really do visibly see improvement in the texture. You need your skin to build up to them so try ultra gentle first. Over time, breakouts reduce and scars will fade, and a brighter more even complexion emerges. I have purchased these many times and love that through Sephora you get a few extra as bonus, as per pad they are something like $3-4 each. I use after washing face or showering and skip toner due to the neutralizer step, which balances the ph of the skin. Proceed with serum (nothing too active when I use these) and moisturizer. You need hydration after use. Ps. Now my skin has calmed down (no acne) and I aim to use 1-2x per week. My holy grail product
