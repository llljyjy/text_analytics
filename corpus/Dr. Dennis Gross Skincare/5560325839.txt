It’s only been three days and my breakouts are almost gone. My dark marks are fading and my skin as a whole looks brighter and more clear. I cannot wait to see results after a Month of use ! I have sensitive acne prone skin and use these at night after  cleansing and toning. I have not used this with any other actives so I’m not sure if they would play well together. I use hydrating and calming items alongside it since it’s extra strength and that seems to help my skin not have reactions. wow
