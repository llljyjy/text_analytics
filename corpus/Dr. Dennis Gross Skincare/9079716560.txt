So I’ve had this product for 2 days and I know it’s going to take some time to see results but I just wanted to say that the smell is not the best. I can’t put my finger on it but it smells like the aftermath of a fire...almost. It says to apply 8 drops and I find that amount hard to apply all over my face. I don’t know if I’m the only one with this problem but it doesn’t spread easily across my face. nan
