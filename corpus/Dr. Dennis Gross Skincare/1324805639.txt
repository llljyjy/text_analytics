I noticed results after the first use. & let me say that I’m 30 years old and I’ve been waiting my whole life to be able to say that about a skincare product. I got the free sample size and bought the 60 treatments the next day. I’m a redhead with fair skin that is highly sensitive and I shockingly didn’t react negatively to this. In fact, I was able to use it three days in a row. I do suggest using it before bed vs am as it can make skin more sensitive to the sun. This product has been a godsend for my hyperpigmentation. Combining this with vitamin c in the am has completely changed my skin. I do however make sure to use thd vitamin c with this so my skin doesn’t get irritated. If you’re on the fence regardless of the positive reviews ,I understand. What works for some, doesn’t for others. Thankfully they sell a trial size and if doesn’t work for you or you react negatively, you can just return it. I do recommend you do a patch test first, though. INSTANT RESULTS
