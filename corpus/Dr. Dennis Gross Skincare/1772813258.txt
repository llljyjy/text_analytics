I am actually super happy and impressed with this eye serum! I’ve always struggled with undereye darkness but lately I noticed it was starting to get worse, I was also noticing some more prominent lines under and around my eyes. This eye serum is gentle enough to use all around my eyes and eyelids, it hydrates but doesn’t cause oiliness (an issue I’ve had with other eye products in the past) or breakouts. After about 2 weeks of use I started to notice some slight changes that have only gotten better over time. My under eyes aren’t as dark and the lines are less deep set. It’s not a miracle product, but the improvements are noticeable enough for me to continue to buy this, despite the price. I find half a pump is more than enough to cover around both eyes and even though the bottle is tiny, its lasted me a few months. A new fav
