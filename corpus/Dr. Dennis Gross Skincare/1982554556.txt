This is not product I keep coming back to. I’ve tried other retinol serums, and I’ve gone without retinol at all for long periods, but for the past 10 years, I always come back to my first retinol love. This serum works it’s magic overnight and gives me beautiful texture and a glow. I either pair it with the Dr Dennis Gross advanced daily peels and a moisturizer, or with the Korres brightening oil. That’s always a perfect duo. nan
