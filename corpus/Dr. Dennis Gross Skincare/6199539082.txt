I love this! This seems like the first product that has actually made a difference in my skin. I had texture all over, while it wasnâ€™t really bad it was noticeable. This serum has made my skin baby smooth. It has also brightened my complexion. I used retinol in the past and it broke me out, I had no purging or bad reaction with this product. Love for textured, dull skin
