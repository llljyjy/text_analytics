It is no secret that I am a huge fan of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare products so I was super excited for this new Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment.The eye treatment comes in a small plastic bottle with an easy to use pump applicator. The product comes out with ease and a little bit goes a long way so you really only need about a half pump to cover both orbital areas of the face. The eye treatment is a nice consistency that I would describe as in between a lotion and a serum. I love that the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment is a product that you can apply to the whole orbital area. It is easy to apply and spreads easily around the eye without any force. The product is quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving any stickiness or residue and layers well with other products. The eye treatment immediately hydrates the entire orbital area helping with fine lines and wrinkles resulting in a more youthful look.I havenâ€™t used the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment for very long but I can already see that my eye area is a little brighter and less puffy overall making me really excited to see how the product performs over time.Overall, the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment is amazing for fine lines and brightening the orbital area. I can see this product going viral for the positive results and I would definitely recommend it. Great product!
