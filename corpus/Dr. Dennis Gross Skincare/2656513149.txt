This vitamin C serum has been my holy grail. I have hyper pigmentation and frequent breakouts that leave behind acne scarring. After using this product for almost 2 weeks I have already noticed a difference in my skin. It is more even and balanced as well as a more soft and moistures texture. I am a big fan and would absolutely recommend it. Even Skin Glow
