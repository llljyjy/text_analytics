I’m really liking the serum, I feel it’s helped with my skin’s dullness which had been notorious the last couple weeks. Definitely feel and see an improvement in firmness, especially in my eye area. The only thing I didn’t love is that is doesn’t absorb immediately and leaves a sticky sensation on it’s own, it’s not a problem since you have to apply moisturizer after but it is sticky.
