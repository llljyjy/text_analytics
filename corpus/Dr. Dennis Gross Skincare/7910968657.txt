I started using this as a gift to myself for my 35th. I can see a difference in my skin when I use it nightly vs when I miss a couple nights. However, in case it isnâ€™t abundantly obvious, it is not great for the more fragile skin around your eyes. I began to have dry, flaky skin if I used it right under my eyes. nan
