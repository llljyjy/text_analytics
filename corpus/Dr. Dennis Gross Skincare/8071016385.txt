Amazing results after one use. I have very sensitive combo skin. After one use, I went from dull to baby’s butt. This is from God without a doubt. It’s worth every penny. I will continue with 2 step once a week. Then use Dr. Dennis cleanser and moisturizer in between. Investing in skincare is everything. Trust me you’ll notice a difference the first time. Cleanliness is next to Godliness. I’m glowing. Investing in skincare is Godly.
