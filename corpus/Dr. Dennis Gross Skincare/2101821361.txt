This new Dr. Dennis Gross serum is effective and easy to use! I do have sensitive skin so I don’t use it every day because the lactic acid makes my skin tingle, but I do use it as a treatment serum a couple times throughout the week. I have noticed brightening on some old acne marks I’ve had for a long time. I’m excited to see results with continued use of this product. Dr. Dennis Gross
