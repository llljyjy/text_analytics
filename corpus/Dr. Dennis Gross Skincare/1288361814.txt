I received this product in exchange for review.I have positive experience with DDG products, particularly the peel. The texture of this moisturizer is almost gel-like, but offers nice daily replenishment to the complexion. Absorbs quickly, but I find with a bit too much product the dewy look becomes oily, so I save this for nighttime use. It leaves my skin plush post-cleanse. It is scented and that was surprising, could be irritating if you have sensitivities. Dewy Indeed!
