Dr. Dennis Gross’ eye serum is one of the best skincare products I’ve ever purchased. I originally bought this in hopes it would improve under eye bags, but, as you can see, there isn’t too much improvement in that arena; however, it’s really improved fine lines n such so maybe it will help those out a lil over time. *I should be fair and note: my eye bags are hereditary sooooo I’m gonna take a wild guess that something more “invasive” will be the only thing that’ll “fix” that. The most noticeable improvements are tone, texture, discoloration/spots, milia and the fine lines. I didn’t even really think I had all that much to improve in those areas (aside from milia and fine lines) until I used this product. It’s incredibly gentle, so those who have sensitive skin shouldn’t worry about it being harsh. Remember to use eye cream though! I always have to keep that area moisturized. Finding a good eye cream I think is the hardest part to nail down what eye care products work for you because, for me at least, many have a tendency to give you milia.I recommend taking your own before and after pics, not just for this product but all that you buy and use. I feel like there are so many “placebos” out there nowadays because marketing is only getting more and more powerful and intrusive; and, sometimes we’re so darn critical of ourselves that we’re blind to the improvements “legit products” do make. But this certainly does what it says (*for me)! It’s now one of my “for life” products, that’s for darn sure. Just Buy It... Seriously..
