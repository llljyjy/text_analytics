This is a super nice moisturizer. It comes in a high end container. The moisturizer comes on a bit thicker but melts into the face nicely where it doesn’t look oily. I could see the hydration results very easily. I think it doesn’t take much of the produc for it to go a long way. It works nicely as a day or nighttime moisturizer. I have fair skin and combination. This was a gift for my honest review. A great moisturizer
