I was looking for a replacement for the Skinceuticals HA Intensifier (for quite a while) and I bought a few other products, this and the Skinmedica HA5. Hands down this is a better product than any. I absolutely love it, it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks and it’s my new go to product. I’m prone to breakouts as well and this doesn’t cause any issues. The top of my hands are smoother as well from rubbing the last of the product into them. Fabulous product, worth every penny.
