Amazing moisturizer, itâ€™s very light in texture, but moisturizing really well, my skin is soft and hydrated.  I use it during the day to make my base makeup more docile, and when I use it at night, my skin is still very supple when I wake up the next day.  I think it should suit all skin types. Nice
