I am a big fan of Doctor Dennis Gross skincare and this product did not disappoint!I have used this cream for 2 weeks every night and I have already felt a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin.Thanks to the lactic acid, it gently exfoliates while not being irritating on the skin. It instantly brightens my skin and gives it a healthy glow. It absorbs within seconds and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It has a nice rich texture without being too thick.It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and thanks to the squalane it replenishes my dry skin (especially after a harsh treatment like retinol)Overall I am very pleased with the results and highly recommend it! Smoothing and brightening!
