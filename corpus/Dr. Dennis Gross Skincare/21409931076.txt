I bought this as a moisturizer and didn’t really expect it to do much else, but it definitely got rid of the wrinkles around my upper lip.  It hasn’t done much for the fine wrinkles elsewhere on my face, but to be fair I don’t use it consistently.  However, the nights when I put it on before bed I wake up to a very noticeable difference -- my skin looks radiant and glowing for the rest of the day.  A little goes a long way, too, so don’t be put off by the price. Noticeable difference
