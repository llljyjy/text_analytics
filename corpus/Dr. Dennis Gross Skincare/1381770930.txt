Love love love this cleanser. I was on the search for an EFFECTIVE cleanser after moving to a hot-humid climate to deal with extra oil production and some acne. I was using dermalogica for a few months with several of their cleansers and switched to this one. The results were immediate - bright, clearer skin and zero drying. Effective Cleanser ---> RESULTS!
