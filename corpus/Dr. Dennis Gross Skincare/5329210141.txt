I donâ€™t want to admit how much I enjoy this because it is on the pricier side but I have to say it is a really nice moisturizer and I will probably have to purchase once I run out of this jar. It is lightweight and very lightly fragrant - leaves my skin feeling very plump and after using it for two weeks I can see and feel a difference in the way my skin looks and feels, it is a lot healthier and more balanced. Alittle goes a long way
