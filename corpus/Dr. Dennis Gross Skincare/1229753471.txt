This cream is a truly a winner for me who is semi-mature, dry skin person! The texture is like a thick gel cream type, but not heavy at all, absorb pretty quickly.  I use it morning & evening for a while now, I can confidently say that this Vitamin C Lactic Dewy Deep Cream from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare helps my skinâ€™s moisture level, and stay hydrated all day. Winner for semi-mature, dry skin!
