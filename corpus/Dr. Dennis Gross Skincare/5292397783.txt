This deep cream smells very light and isn’t too overpowering, eventually it fades. I found that this cream took longer for my skin to absorb. I have extremely dry flakey skin and afterwards I did notice my skin looked more plump and dewy. I love a good natural glow. Definitely reccommend if you’re looking for a hydrating cream to give you a dewy complexion. nan
