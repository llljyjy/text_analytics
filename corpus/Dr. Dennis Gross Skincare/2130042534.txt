I have been loving this incredible serum this month. I am in my late 30s and have normal to dry skin, and my goal is always to get my skin looking fresh, firm and hydrated. This serum has a beautiful texture and melts into my skin. I love using it once a day all the way down my collarbone. It absorbs easily and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky. My skin has looked very radiant and refreshed. I can’t wait to see additional results! A little goes a long way and I think it is a great addition to my skincare routine. Nourishing serum adds glow
