Wow! Vitamin C with Lactic Acid is a powerhouse duo. This serum has made my skin glowy and reduced the dullness from being out in the sun all summer. I did notice a few of my dark spots lighten slightly but my overall skin felt much brighter. Overall the formula is fantastic but it does have an interesting smell. Itâ€™s not bothersome to me, so I will definitely continue using this! nan
