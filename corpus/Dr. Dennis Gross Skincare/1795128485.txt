Vitamin C is essential for my everyday skincare routine and this new Dr Dennis Gross product is perfect for my sensitive skin. The formula is so great, L-ascorbic is the most studied form of Vitamin C and Iâ€™m happy to report that this serum did not irritate my sensitive skin. I love the brightness and firmer looking skin effect after application.  Only a few drops will do, leaving your skin glowing and not greasy looking. It has the typical Vitamin C smell but it fades very fast. It layers well and I highly recommend. Effective and non irritating
