I seriously did not think this product would work so well and so fast! I’ve just been using it two weeks, and my sun spots on my face are fading well. It’s also not too harsh on my skin. I have spots that usually get dry and itchy after treatments like this, but I was surprised how gentle it feels on the skin. nan
