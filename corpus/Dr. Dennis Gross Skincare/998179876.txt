I’ll start by saying I have dry, sensitive skin and my skin loves this cream. With both Vit C and lactic acid I was afraid it’d be too much. But I find that it’s actually deeply hydrating. I haven’t been using it long enough to see reduction in fine lines but I have high hopes. Great for dry mature skin
