I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I think it is a decent moisturizer. It absorbs quickly on the skin, has a slight pleasant scent, and leaves a very pretty and glowy finish. It does not irritate my skin and leaves it without any dry patches and goes well under most of my makeup complexion products. It also goes really well with my other skincare products that include ones from glow recipe, Paula’s choice, kiehl’s, and ole henrikson. I only need one pump for the whole face. It isn’t greasy, too tacky or oily. Consistency is amazing. Absorbs nicely and only need a small amount
