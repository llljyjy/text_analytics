I really wanted to like this melt away cleanser however I believe you can buy other ones on Sephora that are much better. This wonâ€™t remove your eye make up properly and it stings the eyes. The scent is really nice but you need to put a lot of product to work it in. It kind of just spreads the product everywhere. meh
