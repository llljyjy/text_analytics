The pandemic left my skin a mess. Maskne, dull, lines galore. Someone suggested this to me and I bought this, the retinol for eyes and the texture serum. In six months, my skin is much firmer, the small lines have mostly disappeared. For the first time in my life I don’t have to wear makeup and it’s freeing. The cost of these products is high, but I can’t see myself using something else. Oh I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any challenges!!!! my must have product
