This product is a staple in my skincare. I love the ease of use with the 2 step packets. I noticed a difference in my breakouts and skin tone within about 7-10 days. I use these now about 4-5 times a week to maintain. They do not irritate my skin, just a slight tingle when applying. However, I will disclose my skin is not terribly sensitive. There is no strong scent to these. Just remember to always wear sunscreen when using as acids like these make your skin sensitive to the sun! Does the job
