I love this so much. I used to have very bad cystic acne as a teen that’s left me with some undesirable texture on my cheeks and forehead. I used to use a physical exfoliant once a week, but I noticed that the ones I liked best had ingredients I wasn’t comfortable with using anymore. I’ve really noticed a difference with my skin since using this. When I do break out, it sucks a lot less, and I’m a lot more likely to remember to exfoliate because it’s an everyday use product. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and I really only felt a little discomfort for the first couple times.I’ve made several of my friends use this and WOW I cannot recommend it more. My *only* gripe is that I wish this was more environmentally friendly packaging. I know that’s not really possible with the type of treatment that it is, but I’d love to see a lower-waste option in the future. An all-time favorite
