Step one was a very harsh alcohol smell to it that slightly burned my skin. I didn’t rub it in until the pad was dry because it was starting to get very irritated. Step two was more soothing and calming but again I didn’t use until the pad fully went dry. I have combination skin and this did make my face feel softer after but I don’t think this is worth the price harsh on sensitive skin
