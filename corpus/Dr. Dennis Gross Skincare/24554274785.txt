The skin absorbs this oil very well and leaves the skin very moisturized. I recommend using a clay mask to remove dead skin cells so your skin will absorb it better. After a week my skin looks glowy and kind of healthier. I think it works better in dry skin and I do not recommend using it during the day. nan
