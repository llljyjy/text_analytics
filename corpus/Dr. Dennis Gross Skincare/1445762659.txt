All I can say is WOW!  As a pale redhead, I struggle with sun spots and freckles, and it takes effort to keep my skin looking fresh after 40.  This is such a miracle serum!  It fades both sun spots and hyperpigmentation from old blemishes, it takes me from “pasty” to “porcelain goddess glow”, and it allows my moisturizer to absorb better for longer lasting hydration.  Give it a few weeks to take full effect, but the results are so clear and obvious I don’t think I’ll be switching vitamin Cs anytime soon! Miracle Serum
