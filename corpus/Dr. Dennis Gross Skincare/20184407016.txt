When I received this product, I adjusted my skincare routine to be just cleansing and this serum. I think the concept of a serum and moisturizer in one is fantastic! However, after about a week of use, I started getting tiny whiteheads and larger pimples. Great product but might not be great for all skin types. Great product but not for me
