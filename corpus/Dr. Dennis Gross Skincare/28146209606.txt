First, can we admire how gorgeous the packaging is? The packaging is an orange luxurious jar with the perfect pump.  I have used several eye creams, serums, etc., in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help the early signs of aging as I just turned 30. When I started using Vitamin C Lactic Firm and Bright Eye Treatment, I was so impressed with how my eyes felt! This helps firm, brighten, hydrate and smooth my fine lines. I noticed my skin feels brighter and I look more awake. I use it in the morning and I use it under my moisturizer. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. My dark circles have really started to lighten making my eyes look brighter. Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier looking glow under my eyes and I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results. Life Changing Eye Cream!
