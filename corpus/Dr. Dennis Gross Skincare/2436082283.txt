I’ve been using these once a week for about 3 weeks now. My skin is just now coming out of a purge that was triggered by starting to add this to my routine, but I can already tell that my skin looks better underneath. It’s much more even in tone and texture, and it seems to have gotten rid of some of the dry patches I have been dealing with for quite some time. It may be uncomfortable at first depending on your skin, but push through the purge blemishes and a little bit of peeling for a couple weeks - it’s worth it. Total game changer
