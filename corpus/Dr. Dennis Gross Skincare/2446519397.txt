I’m in my mid-fifties and still prone to mild acne. After one treatment, I was convinced this was the greatest thing ever. After about 8 to 10 days I had the worst, and I mean the WORST acne I’ve had since I was a teenager. I’ve never heard a board certified dermatologist use the term “purge,” but it’s an apt description of what I experienced. The A/B peel accelerates skin cell turnover, so if you’re acne prone you do run the risk of bringing blemishes to the surface very rapidly. But the life cycle of the blemishes is also accelerated, so they’ll subside as quickly as they appear. (Oh my though, they are dramatic looking. Ugh!) My advice is to power through. In fact, you might want to choose a “start date” where you don’t mind looking … er … a bit spotty for a few days. I switched to the ultra gentle version, and I have to say my skin has never looked better. So … try to power through. It’ll be worth it! Worth the splurge and the “purge”
