Iâ€™ve been using these once every two weeks for about 6 months now and it does work it got rid or some fines line on my face and faded discoloration from previous breakouts. However the smell is very strong and the price and very steep, I would say if your thinking about getting these, have the money to spend and can stand strong fragrance I would say go for it. If you have sensitive skin try the mini size for the sensitive first. You could probably find an exfoliate that works just as well for a more affordable price good but overpriced
