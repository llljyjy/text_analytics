I don’t usually have a dedicated eye cream for my routine bc I don’t feel like most of them work. However, recently with stressful work that effects the quality of my sleep which causes dark, dry under eyes - I am happy to add this into my routine. I love how lightweight it is! I haven’t seen much improvement but can already tell after 3 weeks that my under eyes are less dark and well hydrated! I am also prone to milia and this one did not cause any! Good to check out if you are looking for an eye serum! So far so good!
