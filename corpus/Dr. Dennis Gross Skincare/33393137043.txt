I am pleasantly surprised by how well it looks on my skin, when I use this with a niacinamide gel on top it gives my skin a lot of glow and it works well underneath makeup. I was worried about the smell due to some bad reviews, but I donâ€™t think it smelled bad more like licorice. Im sad its so expensive because this is now a must have. I love this product!
