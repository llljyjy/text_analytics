I love Dr. Dennis Gross. His peel pads are holy grail and I buy them in bulk. The LED mask is also a class act.Sadly, this moisturizer and my skin did not get along. I had a reaction to it and woke up with a bit of a swollen face. That said, the texture is quite beautiful and the ingredient list does have some amazing inclusions. If you are not super sensitive, I would highly recommend it. Don’t worry, I’m still a DDG fan and will be gifting this to another I know will love it! Not for my skin
