I use this AM and PM and love how hydrating it is. It does not affect the application of your makeup and I think it has made the skin under my eyes smoother and less dry. I’m 23 for reference, so not sure about the effect on wrinkles/aging but it seems like it’s great for prevention. Hydrating and sits well under makeup!
