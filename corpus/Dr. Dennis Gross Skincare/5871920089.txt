I’m a little torn on this moisturizer. I love all the natural beneficial ingredients, the glass jar & the light clean scent that reminds me a bit of a mild version of Irish Spring soap. lol BUT, it’s just SO heavy on the silicones. Ugh! It’s like it never fully absorbs & the silicones just smear around on my face all day. I was afraid to wear makeup over it because my skin felt so dang slippy. If you love silicones in your moisturizer, this might be perfect for you. But I have come to the conclusion that it’s not for me fam. Too siliconey for ME
