This product got rid of texture I didnâ€™t even know I had! My face was soooo smooth and soft afterwards especially because I could layer my serums over top of this for added benefit (I topped it with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in the morning). If you have textured, rough, bumpy skin you need this. I have clogged pores and black heads on my chin and nose. I could literally feel the bumps wipe away with these towels. These are incredible! I will never not purchase these! Expensive but Worth It!
