Iâ€™ve suffered with acne since I was about 12 years old.  Nothing has worked for me; ever.  I came into store with a friend who was purchasing some face products for herself.  I bought a few items from a cheaper brand and I saw no improvement.  I was scrolling through the website and came across these wipes.  I did a full read on the reviews and by a whim, I purchased a set.  Within the first 2 weeks there was a noticeable difference in my skin.  After the first month I was getting lots of compliments on my skin.  Several people; some I knew and some were strangers, asked if I was wearing foundation.  The second time I purchased I found this kit.  The face wash and face cream are just as amazing.  My face is glowing.  I just ordered my 3 set. Definitely must use if you're battling acne
