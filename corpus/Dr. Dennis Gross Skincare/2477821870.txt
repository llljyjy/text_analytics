Who cares about smell when you can see and feel the results?! Not to mention the smell is not THAT bad. It actually gives a scent like a self tanner, but this one disappears after five minutes or so. Really not that big of a deal my skin is glowing and smooth after just four uses. I layer with a heavy cream like Fresh Black Tea Age Delay and I’m good to go without makeup. Smell fades…Leaves behind visible results!
