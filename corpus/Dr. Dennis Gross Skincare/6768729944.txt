Not sure about this product yet, I received a sample of it. I really like that it has a retinol and ferulic acid but….it honestly smells like boiled hot dog water. It is super gross but at least it’s not like they added that fragrance so I don’t think that it will cause irritation. Good ingredients bad smell. Smells Like Boiled Hot Dog Water
