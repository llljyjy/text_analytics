The texture and weight of this cream is ideal for the drying winter season.  Many retinol products irritate the skin, but not this one. It’s surprisingly moisturizing and far gentler than other retinol skincare I’ve tried before. If you’re looking for an anti-aging cream with an excellent ingredients list, this DDG gem is for you. nan
