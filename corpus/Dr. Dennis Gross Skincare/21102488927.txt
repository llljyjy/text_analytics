I first tried this as a GWP and used it for about two weeks before deciding to buy the full size. I’ve tried a few vitamin C serums and didn’t like any of them but this one has actually shown visible results. I don’t have texture or dark spots but this serum has improved my skin tone greatly. My skin is more even and more glowy and I have started going out without wearing foundation. One thing I’ve noticed is my skin can quickly become oily if I use more than 4-5 drops and it does have an unpleasant scent. I’ll keep using in hopes of greater results.
