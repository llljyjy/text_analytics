I use this daily for 12-20 minutes to cover multiple areas on my legs. I have been using everyday for 1 month and  I am beginning to see some improvement in sagging/dimpled skin. I love how you can conform it to any body part. I mainly just use it on legs and chest but my husband has used it a few times for back acne. Starting to see improvement.
