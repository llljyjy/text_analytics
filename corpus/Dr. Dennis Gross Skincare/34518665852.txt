I used this moisturizer every morning for two weeks straight and I SWEAR I can see a difference in my skin. I think it’s due to the Vitamin C/Lactic Acid combo, but whatever it is, I’m happy. Goes on light and sheer and leaves my skin dewy but not oily! Love! Great new addition to my skincare routine!
