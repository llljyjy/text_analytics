I’ve never written a review before on ANYTHING. But I was trying everything to stop my breakouts and fix my hyperpigmentation before my wedding. These were expensive, but it was a last ditch effort. This is exactly ONE WEEK difference. I am blown away. I couldn’t recommend them more if you struggle with hyperpigmentation. nan
