Dr. Dennis Gross has done it again. This Vitamin C Lactic Oil-Free Radiant Moisturizer is my new fave because it does triple duty by smoothing skin, adding antioxidant protection and lots of radiance. This is everything a girl could ask for in a single product. I really like how this feels on my skin and I love that I see immediate results with radiance. This has so many of my favorite powerhouse ingredients including Vitamin C, lactic acid, centella asiatica & chaga mushroom extract. They all work synergistically and I see the difference. I like that this is a combination moisturizer and serum so itâ€™s a real timesaver. I have been using it a.m. and p.m for a week now and my skin looks so good. Serum & moisturizer in one LOVE it!
