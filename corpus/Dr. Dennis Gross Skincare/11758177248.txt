I have used this eye cream for some time and I am very pleased with it so far. I love it’s texture because it is a little thick but quick absorbing and it makes it very hydrating. I only have a couple of fine lines around my eyes and I have noticed some improvement but they are still there. I am more interested in preventing the appearance of more and I think it can help me with that. I recommend it and I like it’s airless packaging, it is very important for me when I am thinking about doing an investment in skincare. It’s worth it
