This was my first Dr Dennis Gross product and I NEED MORE. First off, im in love with the light tangy smell. Ive been using this first thing in the morning after cleansing my face and ive see noticeable changes in my skin. Its cleared up red patches, my skin feels more firm and the little wrinkles I did have are minimized! If you have the money for this product, absolutely buy it. Yes, you need it
