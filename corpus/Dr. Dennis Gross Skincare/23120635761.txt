This is expensive and I only use it when my skin flares up and it works well. I have rosacea. I apply it when my breakouts need to dry after being busted from the hydrcololloid stickers. Also this product needs to get cheaper. It’s essential for those of us suffering from scarring and breakouts. Packaging can also be designed to be more efficient and reduce overall costs. I’m not the product manager but if you’re reading this please do something. nan
