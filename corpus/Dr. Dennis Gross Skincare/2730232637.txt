This eye treatment is great because it isn’t heavy or thick. It doesn’t disrupt my under eye makeup application. I like that it brightens my under eye and  I always look well rested. I am not sure about the de puffiness because I don’t have under eye bags but I can see how it makes my eye so much more healthier. Hydrating and brightening
