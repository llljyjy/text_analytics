This eye cream is a very thin, almost like an eye serum. It applies beautifully and absorbs quickly. It helps my skin look a bit more taut but Iâ€™m still waiting to see if it helps with my dark circles. I love that it has lactic acid! Also, the packaging is fantastic. Most eye creams come in jars but I much prefer a bottle with a pump. nan
