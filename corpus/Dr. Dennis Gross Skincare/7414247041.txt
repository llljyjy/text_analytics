I love this product! I got it for Christmas with the Cleanser as well in the gift set they had. I have really sensitive skin and recent I have gone through a really rough patch of cystic hormonal acne leaving me with scaring. I have attached photos from before and after. This is March 4, 2022 to May 9 2022. I have not used these daily since March but I have used them daily for the past 2 weeks! Totally recommend even for sensitive skin!!! Helps Cystic/Hormonal Acne Scarring!
