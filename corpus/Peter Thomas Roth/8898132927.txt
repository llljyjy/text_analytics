Received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. This Pro Strength Vitamin A,C,E Retinoid Creme is amazing yall.  So many noticeable results. First off let me start by saying that not only is it ultra moisturizing,  it also provides the benefits of a toner by wiping away uneven skintone. If that was enough it was also effective at fine line and wrinkle remover.  I started seeing visible results after just a few days. My skin was glowing and radiant,  Smoother and healthier skin almost right away. This is super effective and I highly recommend it. Ever so light fragrance and very gentle on your skin so I would say totally safe for everyone.  The formula & triple benefits from the A,C, & E vitamins are a real winner. Triple the Goodness
