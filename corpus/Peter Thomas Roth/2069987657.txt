I was skeptical about buying this since it’s super pricey for face wash but bought it at Target since I had a gift card.Surprised at how well it works!  I’m 26 and have recently started to see a few wrinkles (forehead, bridge of nose, laugh lines).  Not very noticeable but still bothers me.  I’ve been using it every other night for 2 weeks.  I’ve already started to see some changes and my wrinkles, especially on my forehead has become less noticeable!  I feel like it would be more effective if used 2 times a day, which is something I choose not to do since I use other products like benzoyl peroxide, retinol, and vitamin C.I use this at night before applying toner, serum, eye cream, and moisturizer.  Sunscreen is a MUST if you use this in the morning! Love This!
