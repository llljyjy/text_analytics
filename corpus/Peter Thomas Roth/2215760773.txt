I tried a sample of the Water Drench when Sephora had that program that delivered a box of trial sizes at home. I loved it and purchased the larger size soon after. Why it worked for me? I have one of those combination skin types. If I use moisturizers with an oil base I’ll be shinning the whole day. I actually carry with me oil blotting tissues to soak up the oil in my skin. Even a matte primer (on an oil base moisturizer) can’t control the oily skin. This moisturizer has really made a difference. My skin feels hydrated but not oily at all. When I apply this product my skin doesn’t look like it has anything on. In addition to that, I feel that the hydration lasts the whole day long. Depending on your foundation and makeup, it might not last the whole day. What now? The 1/7oz lasts for more than 6 months. I use a little bit every morning on face and neck. I also bought the mini for my travels. I love it. If you have dry skin, this might not be the best for you. But if you have combination or oily skin, I suggest you try this. So glad I found this
