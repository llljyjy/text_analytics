I’ve really enjoyed using this retinoid treatment. It’s my first time trying a Peter Thomas Roth product and it definitely won’t be my last. It has a great combination of ingredients that work so well together. The consistency is smooth and it goes on easily. Absorbs quickly and leaves no stickiness. I’ve been using it every other night with no irritation. I can see an improvement in the lines on my forehead which is great. My skin feels smoother and looks so much better. Would definitely recommend this product. This product was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. So good
