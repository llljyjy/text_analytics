These eye patches are great! The size of the patches are smaller than the typical ones I see (Wander Beauty, Pathology, and Pixi), so they fit under my eyes better without covering half my face. There are also three different shapes: one for each eye and one for your forehead. I always leave the container in the fridge so that they feel extra cooling under my eyes. nan
