I have pretty clear skin EXCEPT for the pores on my nose- I had stubborn blackheads that wouldn’t budge no matter what I tried. Despite the high price tag I decided to try this and wow- it WORKS. The first time I left it on like a mask for about 4 minutes, washed it off, and my pores were clean as a whistle. I’m amazed. My skin is quite sensitive so I can only use it once a week tops and ONLY on my nose. But it worked for me when nothing else did! Worked for me when nothing else did
