these patches live up to the invisible name! i use these to hide pimples for everyday wear; although they arenâ€™t the best as actual treatments for bad blemishes, they are super easy to use and the adhesive is SO much better than starface or peace-out pimples. overall would recommend especially in replacement of covering pimples with makeup! work well + long lasting wear!
