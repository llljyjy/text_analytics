I wasn’t impressed with the results of this peel AT ALL.  It feels and performs more like an exfoliating toner than a peel. For 52 bucks I expected way more.  I will say that it didn’t break me out but I didn’t see any improvement either.  I struggle with mild acne and some fine lines and pores and I bought this assuming it would provide results similar to the Dr Dennis Gross Skincare extra strength daily peel but it doesn’t even compare.  If you have sensitive skin or if you are looking for something extremely mild I would recommend this but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Dr Dennis Gross, definitely skip this one.  For the results I get with Dr Dennis Gross extra strength peel I’ll pay the extra 36 bucks. Total let down
