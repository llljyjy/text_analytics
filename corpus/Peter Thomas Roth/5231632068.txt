I’m shocked this only has 2 stars, I love this matte spf! I wear this spf after my primer, before I apply a minimal makeup look. It has no cast on my olive skin, stays pretty matte and wears well through out the day. I’ve tried so many SPFs, so far this is a winner. I will definitely be repurchasing. I’m shocked!
