Finally something that works well with a light layer of makeup! Completely clear consistency, (a lot like petroleum jelly). It’s thick not liquidy. No pilling, no white residue! I’m so amazed with the consistency. It has a little greasiness to it which I actually likeBecause it works well as a primer too. A little bit goes a long way and works well with a bit of foundation! Love it as a primer too!
