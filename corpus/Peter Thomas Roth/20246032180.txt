This is my first time using retinol on my skin and I don’t know much of what to expect.  The Peel pads sting as everyone mentions ,but could be tricky to use if you have sensitive skin. I did feel my face tight , but it made it dry and I got a few break outs. I will continue to give it a try since it says to use 1x a week until you’re skin gets used to it. The combination of the pads and serum are a perfect balance. nan
