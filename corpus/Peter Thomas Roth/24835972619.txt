I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. I would like to start by saying I really appreciate the fact that this product comes with tweezers to grab the patches. I also love the fact that it includes two different sizes so you can place them under your eyes or other places on your face such as the forehead. Being in my mid 30’s, I have been trying to add more collagen in my skincare routine whether it’s in the actual product and with oral supplements. The fact that this one has seven forms of collagen and collagen supporting ingredients means a lot to me. When I apply the patches under my eyes, it gives a nice cooling sensation that feels refreshing. I usually apply them and continue on with the rest of my routine. I had no issues with them sliding down or falling off. Once I remove the patches, my skin definitely feels hydrated and ready for makeup application. nan
