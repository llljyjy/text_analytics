I went out to buy the Unseen Sunscreen from Supergoop but came across this one on sale. It had the same silicone primer like consistency which I really like. I did notice that this one pilled up a lot, which I hate. After researching, I found that I needed to let each layer of my skin care products absorb a few minutes before applying the sunscreen and this stopped the pilling, for the most part. There are a couple of my moisturizers that just won’t work with it, but that’s ok, because majority of the ones I have work. Not all products are compatible, especially silicone based products.  I would recommend but if you are experiencing pilling, make sure to let your skincare products fully absorb for 5-10 minutes before applying. Once I Stopped the Pilling, I Loved the Product
