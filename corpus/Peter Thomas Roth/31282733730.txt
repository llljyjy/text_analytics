I don’t usually rave about moisturizers because it’s hard to find one that truly works for my skin. I have oily combo skin and most moisturizers will either sit on my skin and not absorb or they make me look like an oil slick within hours. This is the ONLY moisturizer that truly works for my  skin and doesn’t make me oily at all. I believe the hyaluronic acid in it balances my skin. In myopinion, this is more of a gel cream because of the consistency of it. It’s not a super thick moisturizer at all so if you have dry skin this may not be the best choice for you, but for someone with oily or combo skin you’ll love this. There’s also no fragrance and this doesn’t make me break out. There’s a reason why this has so many good reviews and why people like it so much. I’m on my third jar and will continue to repurchase it! The Perfect Moisturizer!
