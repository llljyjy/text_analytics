I use the Peter Thomas Roth PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment in the evening after washing my face and so far, so food, I like it. I love using retinol on my skin to address aging signs.  Plus I like that it also has Vitamin C & E for added benefits. Itâ€™s gentle on my skin.  I look forward to keep using it. I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. nan
