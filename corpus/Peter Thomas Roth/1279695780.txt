I received a sample and used a thin layer overnight. The next day, my skin was SO DRY. It wasn’t dry before the mask, the mask just leached the moisture right out. Despite returning to my normal routine and moisturizers, the day after that my skin was broken out in pimples and skin flakes off around my nose. How on earth is this supposed to be hydrating? It’s wrecked my moisture barrier. nan
