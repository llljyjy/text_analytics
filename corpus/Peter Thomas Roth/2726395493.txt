I really need a chemical peel but way to abrasive for my highly sensitive skin. I actually need it all…firming due to collagen loss, wrinkles, pores, less dullness. I’m so sensitive I am extremely cautious using acids, certain types of exfoliants. Trying this out. Increased usage to two-three times per week. Haven’t had any reactions, unbelievable. Pads are extremely saturated. Like that no rinse is needed after applying. I know that with mature skin will take at least 8 weeks to notice a difference. I want it all but really trying to reduce pores. Aging skin, more prominent pores :( So far, very slight reduction in pores. Does tingle and slight burning on my sensitive skin but not lasting. I apply serum then Tatcha water cream or PTR drench moisturizer slathering it on. Slight burning using pads is somewhat concerning but haven’t had any reactions. If continued tolerance may look into purchasing the serum to incorporate with pads. Was torn between purchasing Even smoother, PTR peptide and Dr. Dennis Pads. Will use these up and then decide if I will repurchase or try one of the others. Note that 4 weeks in, using Even Smoother pads approximately 3 times a week, slight difference in pores, clarity, brightness. No reactions sensitive skin
