This was gifted to me by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. I love testing new SPF’s and whenever they mention that it’s a good primer too, I am so on board! This was a nice product, not my favorite but definitely nice. The texture was very comfortable on my skin and it sank in nicely leaving a good base for makeup! nan
