I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth for my honest review of the FIRMx Collagen Face & Eye Hydra-Gel Patches. I love that these patches are made for use just about anywhere on the face. With the two unique patch shapes, it’s easy to find a patch that’ll fit whichever area you wish to target. There are also included tweezers, to keep all patches fresh and sanitary. The patches themselves stay on the skin well and the gel-like texture feels comfortable and cool when applied. I leave them on my face for about 15 minutes each time and my skin is always left feeling more hydrated and smooth afterwards. I’m looking forward to the results after my container of these is finished! Good face patches!
