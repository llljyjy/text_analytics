I received this complimentary from Peter Roth Skincare. I am amazed how much I really love these clinical Face and Eye Patches. I canâ€™t believe there is 90 patches and tweezers in there. Awesome! This FirmX collagen Hydra Gel is really cool to my skin and takes away my puffy eyes. It also helps with wrinkles. I  placed a patch on my forehead or fold lines and lip lines. I have been looking for something like this for years. It is way better than a sheet mask in my opinion. The tweezers are so helpful getting a patch. These are a treatment patch in two cool shapes packed with 7 forms of collagen. It has helped plump my skin since using this product and I look really hydrated. I had dry skin but not anymore now that I have these patches. Every product from this brand is absolutely incredible! Cool to the skin
