All of the reviews saying it leaves a white cast - listen up! You are using way too much if you get a white cast. Way too much. For the deep 11s between my eyebrows I use a pinhead-sized amount. TINY amount! For my deep forehead wrinkles, I use a teensy bit more, but still a TINY amount! You also must shake the tube or knead the contents in the tube prior to using.This is the poor girl’s Botox (or those who don’t wish to inject toxins into themselves!) Try it, I was amazed! This works! People are using it incorrectly!
