Like others have said, you have to experiment with this to get it work for you. After I wash my face I put all other skincare products on except under my eyes. Then I put this under my eyes. It makes the bags disappear--it’s incredible to watch--but it does make my skin somewhat dry and sometimes leaves a white cast, especially at the edges. So after I’ve done all my other morning stuff (at least an hour later), I put eye cream on, which takes care of both the dryness and the white cast. (I use Tranquillity Banish Puffy Eye Cream.) It breaks the product down just a bit, but I still end up with a great result. I’m able to dab a tiny bit of concealer (either liquid or powder) just on my dark circles, no farther down. I had tried to put this on AFTER putting all my skincare on my eyes and waiting an hour, but it wasn’t very effective then for me. It’s a game changer. Good luck! Game Changer
