Overall it’s a powerful cleanser; I’m very impressed with how well it removes makeup, even waterproof mascara. I just love the wonderful peach scent! It’s a nice change from all the floral-type scents. I bought 2 minis and so far my first mini has lasted me well over a month, you don’t need much product at all to clean your face. It’s a perfect size for travel. The thing that I don’t love is that it’s very stripping. It’s probably a great feature if you have oily skin, but my skin is normal with slight dry patches on the cheeks so it feels very tight after washing my face with this cleanser. That’s why I took off a star. I’m a little on the fence whether I will repurchase because of how stripping it is on the skin. But it does leave my face squeaky clean and velvety soft, ready for my skincare routine. I only use this cleanser at night; in the morning I just rinse my face with warm water and a clean cloth. dissolves all makeup in an instant!
