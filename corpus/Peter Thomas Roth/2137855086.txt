I have repurchased this product probably eight times now and have recommended it to everyone in my life who is willing to pay for it. It is tinted, so it doesn’t leave a white cast. The percentage of zinc oxide is significant enough for proper protection. I don’t need any foundation or concealer when I wear this because it makes my skin look so healthy and slightly glowy. It is so lightweight that I forget I am wearing it. Also, it is fragrance free and doesn’t break me out or cause rosacea flare ups. I fully recommend this! Best SPF ever
