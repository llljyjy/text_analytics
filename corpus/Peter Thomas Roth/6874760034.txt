Product: Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible DotsPackage: cute, will re-purpose the metal containerAppearance: thinner than Peace Out Acne Healing Dots with Salicylic AcidUsage: 2 times, 12+ hours each time (same number of usages and hours as I used Peace Out). Appearance without makeup: the dots are glossy, so camera will capture the shine. Peace Out is not glossy, so no shine.Effectiveness: Peace Out significantly shrunk and dried up the puss acne while this brand minimize reduced only one third of the acne.Don’t recommend as it is pricey but ineffective. I could have spent on Peace Out and don’t waste my time on testing this brand.Acne background: my skin only had a few pimple during my monthly. But, not sure what caused the puss acne break out that started at jaw line up my forehead then down to neckline.I tried Peace Out Acne Healing Dots with salicylic acid in it. After I went through first bag, I switched to this brand hoping it work the same at a lower cost. But, this brand failed me. Disappointed, Pricey and ineffective
