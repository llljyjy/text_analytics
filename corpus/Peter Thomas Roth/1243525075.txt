I love Peter Thomas Roth skincare products and the FIRMx Collagen Face & Eye Hydra-Gel Patches didnâ€™t disappoint. I love that they come in 2 different sizes for the eyes and the smile lines & forehead. The eye patches are a great shape that fit my eyes (unlike eye patches from other brands). They plump my skin and leave it feeling supple and moisturized. There are 90 patches in the container which is nice. nan
