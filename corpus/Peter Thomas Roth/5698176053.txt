I’ve been on the hunt for some eye masks and these do a decent job. I love that it comes with little tongs so you can easily and hygienically grab the masks. There’s are two sizes: one for under eye area and one for lines around the mouth. The masks have collagen in it and feel nice on the skin, but even more refreshing if you put it in the fridge. They can tear easily though because they’re made of a jelly type material so be careful when handling. My under eye area looks a little bit more plump after using. nan
