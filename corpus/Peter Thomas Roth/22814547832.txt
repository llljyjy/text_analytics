I really enjoy this sunscreen! It does feel very silicone based, but I actually really enjoy that and use it was a makeup primer as well. It does need some time for it to set, otherwise it pills a little bit. It doesn’t feel like anything is on my skin when I wear it and it has zero white cast because it’s clear. This is such a great summer spf ! nan
