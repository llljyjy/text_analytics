I used this treatment for 3 months, I followed the instructions, and I didn’t see the slightest change on my skin. It was like putting on regular lotion. I have to say, I have used many Peter Thomas Roth products, and I have always been very pleased (I love their serum), but not with this one. Won’t buy again. nan
