got a sample of this with a recent online order. really wish i hadn’t. it irritates my eyes like crazy and it’s somehow migrating into my mouth and i can taste sunscreen. it was moisturizing, which was nice since i use 0.1% tret and my skin can get extremely dry. don’t waste your money on this, though. Waste of reward points.
