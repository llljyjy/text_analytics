I won’t lie, I’m thrilled about the product. Unfortunately I dropped the container on the ground and I can’t get the dispenser to re-engage. This means I’ve wasted almost $70 almost this week in from receiving the gift (~5 days in). I felt like I was beginning to see the results, but I was stopped before any excitement (i.e. wrinkle reduction) began because of my unfortunate event, as I sadly dropped the container and it broke. I don’t know how to fix it. Great product, faulty container
