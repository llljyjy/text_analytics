I received the PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare in exchange for my honest opinion and I am extremely impressed! If you are searching for a product that gets results, then this is the one for you. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I can’t wait to see even better results as I continue to use it nightly. I’ve noticed my complexion appears brighter.  Because it has retinol I was expecting dryness and I had very minimal drying.  Because of this I’ve used SPF during the day to combat the potential effects. I can say this cream is great and will be a part of my skincare routine moving forward. This is a skincare secret I had to share with friends. Great results so far
