Itâ€™s surprising long lasting for the amount. I wear allot of winged eyeliner so I mainly got this to rehydrate. It is hydrating and it also removes waterproof makeup. It does not brighten at all though. If your main concern is dry patches then I would recommend, but if you want something to brighten and moisturize I would go with Olehenriksen banana bright eye cream. nan
