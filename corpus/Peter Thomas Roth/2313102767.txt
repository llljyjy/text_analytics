I got this as a sample and was interested to try it out. I wore it overnight rather than as a 10-minute mask for max hydration. It absorbed into the skin well and was soothing on my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way and it doesn’t really have a scent. It’s perfect for adding extra hydration, although now that it’s starting to be really cold where I live, I do not think it’s quite enough for my dry/combo skin so have been adding argan oil on top of it, which is why I gave it 4 stars. With the oil, it is a really nice and refreshing product that packs a lot of hydration. If you typically have oily skin, this might be the perfect mask for you and you won’t need to add anything to it. Hydrating and soothing
