I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth for my honest review. I have been using this as a part of my nightly routine. It really seems to be helping even out my skin tone and with wrinkles I have been getting, I think they are reducing. It absorbs nicely into my skin and it does not irritate my sensitve skin like other brands have. It has a slight yellow color and is very creamy and does not have a harsh smell. I have had a great experience using this and would love to try other products from PTR. Look better feel better
