i truly hate wearing sunscreen because of the sticky feel, weird smell and whitecast but this sunscreen doesn’t do that to me! love the lightweight gel consistency. it absorbs easily into the skin and doesn’t leave a white cast on my yellow complexion. i also appreciate that it is higher than spf 30. nan
