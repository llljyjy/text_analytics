I have been using this sunscreen ever since it was sent to me.  It has a lightweight feeling but you can definitely see the blurring/priming effect.  I have mostly been using it alone, but can definitely layer makeup on top without feeling like I have too much on my face.  I was gifted this product in exchange for an honest review. nan
