I’ve had a sample of this gel cream before and remember liking it. I went to Sephora to pick up some marine hyaluronics by TO as I ran out but they only sell it online so I grabbed this instead. It was about $80 and highly recommended. I tried it every day for about a week and a half and although I enjoyed the texture and application, it didn’t hold up throughout the day. My skin flaked all that week and I will be returning what I have left because it was not cheap. I’ll happily be going back to my TO marine hyaluronics at a fraction of the price! Not worth the hype or cost
