This was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare but my opinion is my own. In just the 2wks I have been using this face cream I have noticed a huge difference! My skin is naturally glowing and is so much healthier. The unevenness is already almost gone also. My crows feet are much less noticeable which I didn’t expect to happen so fast. I can’t wait to see what my skin looks like after the 4wks and even later. The cream itself doesn’t really have a scent. It was the perfect consistency and was absorbed fast. It didn’t feel like it left any residue which is great to me. Gets the job done!
