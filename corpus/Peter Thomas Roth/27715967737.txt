This product was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. Packed with 10% granactive retinoid paired with vitamin C and E, this is a triple threat of a retinol treatment. The cream itself is slightly thicker in texture, but feels lightweight on the skin. I’m an avid retinol user and this has been super gentle on my skin and has left it looking radiant and feeling soft and supple in the morning after I’ve used as part of my nighttime routine. A small amount goes a long way and seems to be quite effective thus far as I’ve only been using for a short time, but have already seen a couple of areas on my skin that appear slightly brighter and smoother in appearance. Definitely recommend for anyone looking to add a retinoid treatment into their routine. Gentle and effective retinoid treatment
