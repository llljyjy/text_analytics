This is really nice for at home self-care moments. It’s the first of 3 masks I do when I’m doing my weekly mini facial. It’s a sensorial experience; smells amazing and the physical exfoliants, if you’re gentle, can feel nice. My only complaint is that it burns slightly for a bit. It’s a quick sensation that doesn’t last the entire time I’m wearing the mask, but would enjoy the product more sans the sting. I Really Like But Don't Love
