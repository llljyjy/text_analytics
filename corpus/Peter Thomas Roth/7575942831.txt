Listen to the reviews! After realizing this item isn’t eligible for return I used it multiple time to try and give it more chances but ugh. It’s less than half full there’s more air than product!! It crumbles on my clean dry face every time!! Leaves crumbs all over my face and clothes and don’t get me started on the smell :( it honestly smells like expired fish on the skin I really wanted to love this sunscreen, I own multiple PTR products but this was a miss for me :-( nan
