I’ve been using this product nightly for about 2 weeks now, and I notice a difference in the way my skin appears to look more smooth.  The pads have just enough product and tingle so I know it’s working.  I use in conjunction with the serum, and a good moisturizer since I do have extremely dry skin.  Hoping that if I keep up with this in my nightly routine that I will see better results when it comes to uneven skin tone. nan
