I received this PeterThomasRoth Even Smoother™ Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum and Pads complimentary in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. Hands down of the most effective duo I’ve used. I started with once a week use, then gradually increased to every other day usage. My skin loves it. I had tiny marks of pigmentation here and there and they are completely gone. Definitely will continue incorporating it in my daily routine. I’m very satisfied with overall appearance of my skin. Just start slow and low. Amazing duo with Resurfacing Pads
