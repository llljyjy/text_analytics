This really is a 2 in 1 product! It acts as a primer while still being a sunscreen! It blurs pores really well, and it leaves a matte finish. It does have a typical sunscreen scent, but I don’t find it too overpowering. It has not irritated my sensitive skin in the week I’ve been using it so far! It looks great under makeup, and I will definitely continue to use this! Primer meets sunscreen
