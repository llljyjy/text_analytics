I like that this was specifically made to use WITH makeup because most makeup products dont use enough SPF or the SPF is too heavy on my skin and doesnt look nice under makeup. I dont really care for primers but I liked that this didn’t mess with my makeup application and I got the SPF boost. But this won’t work for ALL foundation formulas due to the blurring effect, some foundations will case like a “pilling” effect. nan
