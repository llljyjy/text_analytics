These face and eye patches are so innovative! Iâ€™m a huge fan of underage patches, but have not seen face patches until I tried this product. I love that the eye patches are too big and covers just the areas that need a little more love. I used the oval face patches for my smile lines. My under eye area and smile lines looked smoother and plumper after taking the patches off. One downside is that the patches felt kind of dry when I took them out of the jar. I wish there was more serum in the container. nan
