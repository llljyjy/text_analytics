I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my review. I am a dedicated sunscreen user (mostly KBeauty sunscreens) & also love to wear makeup, so I’m always looking for a good combo sunscreen that will act as both sun protection & makeup primer (with SPF 30 or higher). I was excited to try this one as it is SPF 45 & is marketed just for this purpose: combined SPF & primer. It is such an interesting texture, completely unlike a sunscreen & more like a silicone primer. It’s quite thick, almost paste-like, & I would not recommend using the same amount as you would for sun protection (1/4-1/2 tsp) or it may not work out well - I did this the first time I used it, & it just sat on my skin like a film & refused to dry down, even after 30 minutes) Unfortunately, I’m not sure whether using less than the recommended amount for sunscreen will still give adequate sun protection, so I would recommend using this as additional sun protection, not your primary source. I think that this, combined with a makeup with SPF in it, might provide enough SPF protection, but I’m not sure how it was tested or the amounts used for SPF testing - I’d like more info about that from PTR. It does not pill or sting the eyes, which is great. As a primer, it’s pretty good - typical smooth silicone texture, does blur pores & skin texture, & gives a silky smooth but slightly tacky surface for good makeup adhesion. I will definitely keep using it with my makeup that contains SPF for additional protection. Good for additional sun protection
