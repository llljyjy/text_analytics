I just received the SPF today, and I had my doubts since some sunscreens did me dirty, but this is the ONE! It’s a truly clear makeup primer with SPF built in! It barely smells like sunscreen, every one can use it thanks to no white cast, and dries down to a nice satiny finish. Even the packaging is cute! The holographic tube is so fitting for a sunscreen. This product has me excited about PTR all over again. I’m getting another tube while Sephora has the sale going on! Hello Sunshine!!!
