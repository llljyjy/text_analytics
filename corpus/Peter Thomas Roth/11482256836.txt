This sunscreen has actually made me want to wear sunscreen consistently! It has such a nice texture that glides smoothly and evenly on to the face, which makes it very easy to use. It doesnâ€™t have any white cast whatsoever and makes my skin look very fresh! I also love that it is SPF 45 because sunscreens (especially for the face) are hide to find these days that are above 30 SPF. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to a friend as I am loving it so far! My new favorite sunscreen
