wow! i was hesitant as i expected this to be better for oily or normal skin but i’m so impressed! i have dry and acne prone skin so a good moisturizer is crucial and hard to find but i think this might be my new holy grail! it’s so moisturizing and hydrating!!! it’s thicker than i expected but not too thick! i truly think this would work for all skin types! this also caused no new breakouts on my skin! great for dry acne prone skin
