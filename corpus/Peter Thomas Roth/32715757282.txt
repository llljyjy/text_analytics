When it comes to choosing a sunscreen, I have four requirements. Is it light enough for my combination acne-prone skin? Is there a white cast to it? Is it fast to absorb or leave me looking like a glazed donut? Does it pile and stay well under my makeup? This one passes all of the tests! This sunscreen passes all the tests!
