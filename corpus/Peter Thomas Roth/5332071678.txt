I used the Peter Thomas Roth resurfacing pads and the serum together. Using it everyday dried my skin out, so I switched to every 2-3 times a week and I’m impressed with the results. My skin is glowing, clearer, and my pores look a lot smaller. I’m hoping with continued used it will help with softening fine lines. nan
