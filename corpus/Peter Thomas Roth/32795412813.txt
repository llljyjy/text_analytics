Oh my goodness. I have crazy dry skin. Like the smallest cold front and I’m flaking dry skin. This stuff is amazing! I’ve been using it for several days and I have hydrated, glowing skin. The texture is so amazing. I also use any extra on my fingers in my hands and it leaves my hands hydrated too. If you have dry skin, you need this! Hydration overdrive!
