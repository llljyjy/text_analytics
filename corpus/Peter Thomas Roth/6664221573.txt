I really wanted to like this. I was given a sample and read all the reviews. But after a couple uses, I just noticed my skin was red and dry. It was not a happy camper. So I stopped. I’m currently in the bath with another face mask on trying to undo the damage. I know so many have loved it but it was so good for me. I have sensitive and what I would describe as thin skin and shows me instantly if it’s happy. This was a no go. I wish I didn’t try it but nothing ventured nothing gained. nan
