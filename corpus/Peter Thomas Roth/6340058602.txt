I always love PTR products, so no surprise this is another major hit from the brand! It’s amazing this is a gel, which is such an innovative texture when it comes to SPF. It’s so lightweight and works beautifully on it’s own or under makeup. No white cast and perfect for skin that is more oily. I do find it helps keep my makeup intact, so it’s kind of a multitasking product. I am excited to use this more often as I spend more time outdoors this spring and summer. Multitasking SPF
