I have sensitive skin and dark marks from a scar as well as acne and this product definitely helps with skin discoloration and has helped with dullness under my eyes. These products can be drying however as o used in conjunction with the moisturizer. I definitely recommend this to anyone with discoloration however I didn’t see a huge difference in skin texture and I don’t have fine lines. This retinol pad is amazing considering I didn’t have any skin tenderness after using and my skin didn’t become too irritated, just a little dry. Definitely follow directions when using (use an spf and daytime moisturizer) and you may love this product! nan
