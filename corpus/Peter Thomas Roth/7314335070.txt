I’ve only used these 5 times so far, but very much a MEH for me. All the “juice” is at the bottom of the container, so all the pads at the top are pretty dry actually. I always keep my eye patches in the fridge for extra cooling, and I feel that’s the only benefit. Honestly, I feel like they do nothing, which is unfortunate. At least there are 30 treatments. MEH
