It feels like Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, but thousand times thicker. It’s extremely silicone-y. Overall it’s ok, I think it does what’s promised, it works as a primer. But it doesn’t pair well with all of my skincare products. I’ve also noticed it irritates my eyes sometimes. By the end of the day when I wash off my makeup my under eyes are burning and itchy. Honestly, I’m not a fan of this sunscreen. Mediocre
