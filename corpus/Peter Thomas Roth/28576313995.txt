Even though I have dry skin, my skin doesnâ€™t like thick moisturizers in the winter time bc they will often clog my pores. This moisturizer feels very hydrating for my skin but never uncomfortable. I layer it with a hydrating toner/essence and this moisturizer. I love how it works for my skin to keep it moisturized throughout the day and never irritates! Makes my skin dewy and soft too! Great makeup base as well! Good winter moisturizer!
