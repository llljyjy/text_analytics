I really loved how these eye and face patches felt hydrating on my skin. My exhausted skin looked visibly brighter and healthier as I got ready ahead of a big event. I felt like they instantly made my face glow. They are really fragile so I had to be careful with them however they stuck easily onto my skin. So hydrating!! Perfect before a big event!!
