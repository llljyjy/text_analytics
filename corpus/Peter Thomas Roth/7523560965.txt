I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare in exchange for my honest opinion and I am extremely impressed! If you are searching for a product that gets noticeable results, then this is the one for you. I started noticing fine lines around my eyes a few years ago and this cream has already given me noticeable improvement of my fine lines. I’ve been using 3 1/2 weeks and I can’t wait to see even better results as I continue to use it nightly. My overall complexion appears brighter and healthier too!  Because it has retinol, I did have to start out slow and gradually build build-up my usage. As with all products with retinol, it is important use SPF during the day to protect your skin. This really is one of the best creams I have used in my anti-aging skincare routine. If you want results then this is the cream for you. Fast results
