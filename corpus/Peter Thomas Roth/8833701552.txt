As a sunscreen, it does the job perfectly. My husband and I used it for two weeks in late July in Toronto and Montreal doing outdoor activities all day with only applying it once and didn’t get tanned or sunburned at all. To those people who claim this sunscreen doesn’t do its job, please first make sure you use enough amount (two finger-length stripes as all dermatologists recommend) before you talk about its effectiveness. The only down side is that I have combination skin and it makes my skin look super oily and greasy. Maybe because it’s very moisturizing? It may not be a problem if you put some setting powder afterwards but I don’t wear makeup, so I won’t purchase it again for myself. But overall it is a very good sunscreen and decent moisturizer. A very good sunscreen and moisturizer
