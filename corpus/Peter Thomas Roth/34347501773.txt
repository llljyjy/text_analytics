I was looking for some less wasteful eye patches. I love love love these they make my fine lines less noticeable. When I’m done on my eyes I just use them on my upper lip. Affordable, effective, less wasteful and multipurpose!  I love them in the sense of fun and an intense cooling feeling for wearing them after a long day or a day of allergies and puffiness! Definitely does the trick when it comes to puffiness but I don’t feel like it’s helped get rid of my dark circles nice eye patches
