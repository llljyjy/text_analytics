I’ve been using Supergoop SPF for 3 years now. I’m dark skinned and go hiking quite often. I noticed my skin getting dry. I went to Sephora and asked for a moisturizing SPF. This is the product I was referred to and the new love of my life. WOW! This moisturizing SPF is amazing. Much more than I was expecting to pay. I was already at the $40 mark for less than 2oz. It’s worth it tho. No cast and rubs in easily. My skin looks amazing. Started getting compliments on my skin the very next day! Love this stuff. I need a bigger size! One star off for horrible packaging/dispenser. BUY THIS! Don't even think twice
