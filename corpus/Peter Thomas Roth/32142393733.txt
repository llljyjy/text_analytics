PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment was gifted to me by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. My skin is has been loving this product. My skin has taken it very nicely. So far I’ve noticed a little difference in some of the wrinkles around my mouth. They are starting to look a little smoother. I like that this product doesn’t irritate my skin. It doesn’t leave it greasy or dry out. I use it specifically at night.  I always apply moisturizer after every use. I like the results I am starting to see. And can’t wait to see more improvements as I continue to use it. Great product
