I received this PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare in exchange of my honest review. The treatment comes in a little tube, it reminds me a tube of paint. It is very easy and convenient to use. The treatment has light creamy structure and it is yellow color. I haven’t noticed any fragrance, which I very like. I use the cream before going to bed. It absorbs quickly, and doesn’t feel sticky. After using it for a few days my wrinkles became less visible. I will definitely add this product to my skin care routine. nan
