Got as a sample. Itâ€™s a nice basic moisturizer. A bit moisturizing but not worth the money. Try Belif moisturizing bomb if you need something super hydrating. Honestly even the ordinary one is better than this. Wish companies would stop making expensive products with names like water drench and spending their whole budget on advertisements to convince you how hydrating it is, and just actually make moisturizing products. Way overpriced
