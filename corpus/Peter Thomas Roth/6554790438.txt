I received the Even Smoother Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum and peel pads #complimentary from @peterthomasroth and I am obsessed!- [ ] Serum - it’s a high potency 15% glycolic acid  and 1.5% Time-Released Microencapsulated Retinol formula that helps to improve texture, clarity, uneven tone, fine lines and wrinkles! Now usually retinol is problematic but this one is time released which results in a gentle use of the product without any irritation. What makes this so unique is the other ingredients here:* Niacinamide helps diminish discoloration* Allantoin and Adenosine soothe skin’s appearance. * Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen plumps the look of skin with moisture for a youthful-looking glow. In a 4-week consumer perception study on 34 women, ranging in age from 37 to 55:* 100% agreed skin did not feel tight or dry* 97% agreed the look of texture was improved* 97% agreed skin had improved clarity* 94% agreed skin looked renewed and less dull* 91% agreed skin appeared more even-toned- [ ] Resurfacing peel pads have the same ingredients and benefits as the above yet the glycolic percentage is much higher at 20%!* In a one week study on women aged 25-55, the 31 women tested reported:* After just 3 uses: * 100% saw an improvement in texture** 100% agreed skin felt softer and smoother** 100% agreed skin had a healthy glow and looked less dull** 100% saw an overall improvement in the look of skinIf you’re looking for a brighter, even complexion with a healthier look of skin while remaining smooth without the harsh effects of a retinol or glycolic then these products are for you. nan
