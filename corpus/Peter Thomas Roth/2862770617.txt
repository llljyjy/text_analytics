I use to like these when they first came out. It was similar to their spot treatment which they no longer make. But nowI have had dark spots on my forehead for 2 weeks where I placed these dots. To be clear I had small zits that I wanted to get rid of n my forehead. In the past the dots would reduce the size of the zits over nights. This time when I removed the dots they left dark spots on my forehead. It has been 2 weeks and the dark spots remain AND the zits are still there. I will never use these again. NEVER AGAIN
