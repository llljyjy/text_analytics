Peter Thomas Roth gifted me this Vitamin A/C/E Retinoid Treatment for my honest review. I just started using it so I won’t see results quite yet but I like the way it feels. There is a very slight tingle when I use it.  There is no smell that I notice.  It’s gel like and is absorbed quickly. My skin feels soft after use.  I’m looking forward to seeing results in 4 weeks. nan
