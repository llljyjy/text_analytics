I waited so long for this product to be back in stock and sadly I am very disappointed with the results. While it does temporarily tighten your skin, I have not found a way to use it and wear make up. I tried a variety of different moisturizers and primers and once I apply foundation, the chalky residue forms & makes my foundation (that has serum) into flakes & clumps. If anyone has found a way to wear make up and use this product at the same time, please share your tips! Unfortunately this was not worth the investment. disappointed
