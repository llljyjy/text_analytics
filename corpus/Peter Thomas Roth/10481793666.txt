To address other reviews: I felt there was enough serum w shaking and turning upside down; I don’t understand why ppl had so much trouble putting on the patches; they stuck to my face, but I just sat down and relaxed; I wore them every day for a week, they pop out one of my wrinkles for a few hours; didn’t notice an improvement in undereye circles; have sensitive skin, but no reaction from these; they’re really relaxing, like, I have anxiety, and I actually found they helped; very cooling, even at room temp., would be great for hot weather. Overall: I don’t know if I’ll buy again, but soothing and fun to pretend to be Kyle Richards Didn't do too much for me, but soothing and fun
