Finally, a sunscreen that works well for dry and sensitive skin and blends well with makeup. I used to buy many sunscreens for sensitive skin, including mineral sunscreens, but they were usually tinted and looked too orange on my skin, leaving orange streaks. When I got non-tinted sunscreen however, it would make my face look nasty and oily. This however works great because it’s matt enough not to make my skin over shiny (it does still have a bit of shine) and I can mix it with my own matt foundation since it’s completely transparent (I use Dior backstage 0CR) and make my own tinted sunscreen with the color that actually suits my skin. When layered it with my foundation however (put the sunscreen on first and then the foundation on top), it did rub off easily and formed into rubbery little balls on my face. I was able to fix this problem by applying the foundation before the sunscreen dried or mixing them up beforehand. The application was smooth covering my dry spots and blurring my fine lines and the color went on evenly. This many not work well for everyone or with other types of foundation, but I found this to be the best sunscreen/foundation combo for someone with dry and sensitive and very pale skin. Sometimes I just like to wear this without any foundation because it provides a blurring effect and makes my skin look smooth and young just by itself. Works great for dry sensitive skin
