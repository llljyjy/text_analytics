Good but not my favorite. The gel-like formula needs to be worked into my skin, so a longer application, really massaging it in (admittedly that feels very luxurious). It’s very hydrating, but I felt better after putting in a heavier moisturizing agent it oil on after. That felt like it kept the hydration in and my skin was fed for longer.I would be even less satisfied if I paid full price, but I got it half price during a Black Friday sale, so to me it’s worth the price I paid. After I’m done with it, I will return to a creamier formula, not the water/hyaluronic acid style. nan
