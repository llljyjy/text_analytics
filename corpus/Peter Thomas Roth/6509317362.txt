If your someone that suffers from hyperpigmentation and texture, I highly recommend these pads along with the use of the serum. However, use sparingly and only a few times a week to avoid more oil production or drying out your skin too much. You do see quick results which become more permanent over time. Save the pads for use between the serum 1-2 a week! Quick results but use sparingly
