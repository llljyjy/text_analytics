I’ve really enjoyed trying this project! I’ve never tried a product with retinol but I recently turned 30 and thought it would be a perfect time to implement it into my regimen. I expected to have some sort of purging process & sensitivity to the sun but I haven’t experienced any of that! I’ve continued to use my sunscreen as normal and I’ve noticed my pores and a lot less visible and hyperpigmentation from acne scars are much lighter and it’s only been a few weeks that I’ve been using it. I received this for free to review but I will be purchasing this once it runs out. nan
