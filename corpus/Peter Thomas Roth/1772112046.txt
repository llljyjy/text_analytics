Great product -- feels light and fresh and I love the SPF. But the packaging is flawed. The pump refuses to dispense the last 10 ml. (1/2) of the moisturizer. One must unscrew the top to access the remaining product. Unfortunate, because otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Fix the pump to dispense all the product
