I’ve tried both the pads and the serum and I prefer the pads out of convenience. They’re both extremely effective for bumpy, textured, congested skin. I’ve been struggling with clogged pores from traveling for the holidays and nothing was working. One use of one pad made it so much better overnight. I am hesitant to use it super regularly because it is a powerful treatment but I will absolutely continue and repurchase when I’m out for those segments when your skin just feels blah and dull. I’ll likely use it once a week or once every two weeks to keep my skin poreless and soft! Magic.
