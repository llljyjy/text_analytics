I like the idea of this serum but unfortunately it irritated my skin. First of all there is alcohols in this and I am not sure why, that can be very drying to the skin and that is the last thing you want to do if using ahas and retinol. Secondly, retinol and a strong AHA like glycolic acid, especially at such a high percentage should absolutely not be paired together even using encapsulated retinol, it is far too irritating and pair that with the alcohols is a recipe for disaster. That is just my opinion, but if I am using glycolic acid it is going to be on a different night than retinol. I got this for free through influenster and while I’m grateful to try it the product didn’t work out. nan
