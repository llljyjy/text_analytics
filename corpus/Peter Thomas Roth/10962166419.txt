Definitely will be implemented into my nightly routine. I have been using retinol for 3 years now so I didnâ€™t have an extreme dry reaction from these, however moisturizer is a must with this to prevent flaking. This is a great long term skin care product that I noticed more even skin-tone after a few weeks. Definitely recommend trying! Great long term product
