I’m so thankful that I discovered this product. I developed sebaceous hyperplasia on my forehead. I’ve had in-office treatment ( electrocauterization ) done and they just come back. My dermatologist prescribed me Tret 0.05% and it did nothing. I recently purchased these pads and my forehead is clearing up. I think that the combo of Tret 0.05% and these pads is what finally did the trick. Thank freaking goodness! Magic
