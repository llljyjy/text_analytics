Gamechanger! I have hormonal acne along my jawline and neck, usually bad when it’s that time of the month, as well as some acne along my forehead. I started using this two months ago, morning and night, and I am still on the same bottle, but I have had maybe three zits total in that amount of time, where as I normally have about 10/month, and that was because I started cutting back on how often I was using it, I was getting spoiled with clear skin. This has also helped fade existing scars and marks, which means I cut down on the total products that I need to use. My face has looked so good, my roommates have stolen my bottle a few times because they also want clear skin. My skin is slightly sensitive, and it does not get irritated or break out when using. Has no scent, which I like, because I don’t need my skin to smell like oranges or roses or anything. Leaves my oily skin feeling matte, which I also like. This has also helped treat the blackheads on my nose, I have very few since I started using this. It’s a little pricy, but when you get to skip using multiple products, you actually save a bit of money. Gamechanger!
