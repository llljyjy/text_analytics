I really like this vitamin C cream. It definitely helps even out my skin tone and helps with little expression lines. I actually enjoy the aroma it gives off. Effective vitamin C is supposed to have that kind of smell and I’m weary of vitamin C products that don’t have at least a hint of that fragrance. I only took a star off because the packaging isn’t the best and makes it oxidize faster. I put mine in the fridge and it significantly helps slow down that process. It also has a slightly gritty feeling at first, but that’s expected with effective vitamin C creams. It’s perfect for summer and works wonderfully under sunscreen. I’ll definitely be repurchasing like I have been. One of the best!
