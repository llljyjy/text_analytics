I really love these peeling pads. As soon as I started using it I could notice a difference! It goes on so well, and you can almost feel it going to work immediately! It did make my face feel a little tingly but I actually enjoyed it becauseit felt like it was working lol. My face felt really moisturized the entire night and even the next day! I definitely will be continuing this peel, even once I run out! I would definitely recommend it. Love this peel!
