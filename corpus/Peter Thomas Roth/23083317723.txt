I am happy with the results I have seen so far from using PRO Strength Vitamin A C E Retinoid Treatment. This product was gifted to me from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare.  I have very dry skin that is showing signs of aging like wrinkles and dark spots. I was interested to try this product to see if it would help my skin look and feel better.I really like the silky, creamy texture of this product.  It easily spreads over the skin. A little bit goes a long way so you don’t have to worry about running out very quickly.  The cream feels just a little bit warm in the skin when you first apply it.  It is not uncomfortable at all, I actually really like the feeling. The cream soaks in quickly leaving the skin feeling very soft. It does not leave residue or a greasy/sticky feel.As soon as I began using this product I could see little changes in my skin. At first it seemed less dry. After a couple of days my skin definitely felt a little more moisturized.  My skin became smoother and softer. I have been using this product for about a week now and I see a good change in the level of hydration in my skin. I feel that the general look to my skin is healthier. The general tone of my skin appears more even and the wrinkles are a little less deep. It gives me hope that with continued use my skin’s condition will continue to improve so that I can have softer, smoother, more attractive skin again.I am very glad that I tried this product and will be purchasing more in the future. Works great for me
