This is a moisturizer that felt great at first , then ended up drying me out in the long run. I think it may be due to the high concentration of hyaluronic acid. It feels like water bursting on the skin which feels nice. It ended up drying me out and causing flakey skin. It also is that gel texture that leaves my skin with that shiny film. I have combo skin. Didnâ€™t work out in the long run
