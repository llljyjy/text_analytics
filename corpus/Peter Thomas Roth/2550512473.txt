This is a great HYDRATOR.  As we age, our delicate eye skin gets the brunt of it.  Dry skin = extra fine lines and wrinkles skin.This is one of about 4-5 eye products I use.  It’s sole purpose is to hydrate the under skin (for me).  It’s not meant to combat signs of aging (though by hydrating the under eye skin, it can reduce the appearance).I wear make up just about everyday, and am in my mid 30s.  Make up can get drying, and I love that it’s a gel that’s quickly absorbed, and does the trick for hydrating my under eye (which also keeps make up from forming in my crows feet too!),4 stars instead of 5.  I love it, but it kinda congeals in the container - and i sometimes get more product then I actually want/need.  I wish the consistency was a bit smoother and less gelatin like. nan
