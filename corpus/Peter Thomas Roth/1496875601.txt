It works when used right. I have to use just a small amount if not skin feels tight. I don’t try wiping off any white reside if I get any (from using a little too much) because I use this mostly under make-up and I do notice that it does remove the product. I’ve also tried an under eye primer and it’s compatible with that primer. nan
