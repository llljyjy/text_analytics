I’ve used plenty of chemical exfoliants and am a fan! This is my first time using one with retinol and I had noticeable results after 3 weeks! I used the pads 3 times the first week with 2 day breaks in between, the second and third week I was able to use them every other day. The fine lines on my forehead and neck are visibly improved and my skin is glowing and definitely smoother! Can’t wait to continue to use them to see more improvement! I also like that these do not leave my face feeling tight like some other chemical exfoliants. Smoother glowy skin!
