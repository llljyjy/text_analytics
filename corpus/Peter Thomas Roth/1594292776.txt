The smell of alcohol is overwhelming so I donâ€™t know how they can say it smells like a Bellini. I used these for a couple days and started noticing these red bumps on my cheeks. Then I started breaking out around my chin. As soon as o stopped using them the bumps went away and my chin cleared up within days. Not worth it
