This is literally the perfect sunscreen. I have tried almost every sunscreen in existence (including some imported from Korea, Japan and France). Mechanical blockers are the only sunscreens I will use, most of which leave you looking pasty white and feel awful on the skin, but they work the best so I settle for it. However, this product doesn’t do either of those unpleasant things and works! It is comfortable to wear, so comfortable I don’t hesitate to wear it, and the tint eliminates that ghosty white effect; it actually wears like a foundation and smoothes the look of your face while it protects you. It doesn’t crease or collect in fine lines either, which is generally an issue for my oily skin, it just stays put looking fabulous until you wash it off. This is the only sunscreen I will be buying from now on, it’s worth every penny. The PERFECT Sunscreen!
