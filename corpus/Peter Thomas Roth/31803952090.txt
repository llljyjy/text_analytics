I love how this looks and feels on my skin! I use this as the last step in my morning skincare routine, usually on days where I decide to not wear makeup. I prefer to use this rather than not have anything on my face because it blurs my pores and helps to even out my skintone. It’s one of the only sunscreens that I’ve ever actually liked for my face. It’s super lightweight and you can’t see it or feel it once it’s on. Definitely going to be my go-to product all summer! Perfect lightweight SPF!
