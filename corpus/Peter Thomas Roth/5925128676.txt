This sunscreen melts into your skin with no white cast or pilling. The formula is a little thick and can be tough to squeeze out of the bottle but it spreads nicely on the face! I love that it doesnâ€™t have a strong sunscreen smell, and that it creates a smooth surface for makeup to glide on top! nan
