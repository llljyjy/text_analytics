These peel pads really pack a punch! Glycolic Acic + Retinol is like an anti-aging dream team. The pads are drenched in serum and it sinks in quickly and leaves skin feeling hydrated without being sticky or tacky. They work quickly too; I noticed my skin looking smoother and more even within a few days of use. If you have sensitive skin Iâ€™d take it slow with these as these peel pads are no joke! I really love how convenient they are. nan
