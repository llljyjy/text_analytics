I received this compliments of Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Week 1 I LOVED it. Almost instantly smooth skin. I also used the pads, which I really loved. Full disclosure though, I broke out like crazy week #2. Now, I will tell you that is the reason why I typically don’t use retinol. I have stuck with it though and I think I’m on week 3. My skin is clearing up nicely and even looks more even. It’s also the first retinol that didn’t immediately turn me bright red. My sensitive skin has tolerated it almost every night. I use the pads 2 times a week now. I will definitely continue to purchase this Great Product!
