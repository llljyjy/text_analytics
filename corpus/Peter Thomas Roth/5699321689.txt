I was sent this PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. This expert-level retinoid treatment contains 10% granactive retinoid Vitamin A, 10% vitamin C and 5% vitamin E. This unique intensive formula is designed to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, brighten skin tone and moisturize and soothe the skin. This treatment has a creamy lotion texture, pale yellow hue and no noticeable scent. It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly. My skin is left feeling hydrated and moisturized and I have not experienced any tingle or irritation. The directions indicate that this may be used nightly but I alternate with other actives in my evening routine so I have used it about every two to three days in the evening. I would recommend this for experienced retinol users. nan
