Love this brand and of course I had to try this collagen patches set. What iv noticed it does help to reduce puffiness and make my face look visibly more firm and younger. I use it every morning as a new mom it kind of helps me a lot to look not overly tired even if I didn’t sleep all night. I use two under eyes and two on my chin and forehead area. So far it helps with my deep minims wrinkles on forehead, I guess it fills it up with collagen and visibly it they not that noticeable. The patches are cold so it refreshes my face too.  Overall, good set and I’m going to use it again. It works
