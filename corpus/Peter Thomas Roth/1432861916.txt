I am obsessed with this stuff and use it religiously. I use it more as a preventive measure than anything as the ingredients help protect from sun damage and increase sunscreen efficacy. I have very fair skin and need all the help I can get!I’ve tried several other similar products — mid-range and higher end and I always come back to this one. It has the best texture by far. It isn’t oily or sticky like some serums, but goes on smooth, feels silky on, and absorbs well. It is easy to layer under sunscreen, primer, moisturizer, etc. Compared to other products, it also has better/more powerful ingredients (THD vs L Ascorbate and a higher concentration of Ferulic Acid — 3% vs .5% in most products). It is pricey but so are many other products or inferior quality. obsessed w/ this high quality serum
