Highly recommend!! Even after one use see improvement in skin texture and how diminished wrinkles are. I use under eye and around the corners of the mouth when you smile. Definitely recommend refrigerated, I find it works best in the morning the coolness of product wakes up skin and provides hydration. I use different patches for night routine. These are best ones Iâ€™ve tried so far!! best AM patches ever
