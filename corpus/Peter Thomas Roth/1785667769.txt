EVEN SMOOTHER™ Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum• How would you describe the texture of the serum?  I have uneven, hyperpigmented with minimal pores. Well the texture of this product applied evenly over skin and blended in seamlessly. I noticed some changes after the first week and my skin appeared more refined and brighter. I haven’t seen any significant changes with any fine lines as I do not have many to begin with. After the first week of use, I can say this is product I would recommend to others they have similar prone skin. Absolutely a must have
