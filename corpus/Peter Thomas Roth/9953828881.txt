I am a HUGE fan of these peeling pads! Glycolic acid has been a go-to of mine to help reduce texture on my skin and give my face a much softer appearance with makeup, & these pads deliver! Every time I use them, I wake up to super soft, clean, & a lightly glowy complexion. It is a go-to of mine the night before an event or date night. What I love even more is that they also include retinol, making it a dynamic duo for my skin. The pads carry a lot of liquid in them so you definitely get your money’s worth on top of the convenience of the product being in a pad. If you’re looking for something to help with texture, I highly recommend using these 2-3x/week. Helps with texture & to soften skin
