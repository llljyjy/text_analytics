These peel pads are very well saturated and I loved the waffle texture on the pads. I use twice a week and it really helps in reducing and clearing blemishes as well as evening the texture of my skin. After I use the pads, I followed with the PTR Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum. This combo really helps to smooth my skin and give me a beautiful glow. Glowing Skin
