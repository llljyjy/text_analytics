I have very hooded eyes and I am always trying any and everything to help. This helped! It took a few tries to master the application (I use a damp concealer brush) and let it dry for at least 5 minutes before moving my eyes at all. I am super happy with this! The 4 stars is only because after a few days in a row, I have to take a break because my skin is super sensitive. Helps hooded eyes
