I’m an experienced retinol user, so I wasn’t expecting to be wowed by this product, but WOW, I’ve been using these peel pads, along with the PTR Even Smoother™ Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum, for a couple of weeks. My skin texture is smoother and brighter, without irritation or dryness. My only complaint is that I feel like these one use pads aren’t sustainable/good for the environment; I’d prefer a product I could use on my own reusable pads. nan
