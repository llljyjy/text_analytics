This Invisible Priming Sunscreen is really lovely. It is a thick balm that soaks in easily. It doesnâ€™t leave the skin feeling greasy. It does provide a nice blurring effect. I like that it is a multi use product that combines two steps into one. I will probably be using this on no makeup days during the summer. Great for Multi Use
