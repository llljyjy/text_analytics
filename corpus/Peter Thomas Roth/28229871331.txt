I was very disappointed in these patches. Assumed I’d like them since I liked the hyaluronic cloud moisturizer but as other reviewers said, there’s very little serum. Even after storing it upside down for 2 days there was barely enough serum to reach the top. I’ve tried other cheaper HA patches that hydrate much better. Don’t waste your money. Wish I’d read reviews first.
