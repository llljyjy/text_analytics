I found these Resurfacing Peel Pads to be so convenient and easy to use. I ended up reaching for these more often after noticing how smooth my skin felt the next morning. I never experienced any irritation from them, despite not following directions correctly and using them nightly. Whoopsie! But they honestly are awesome and will be repurchased in the future. So easy to use
