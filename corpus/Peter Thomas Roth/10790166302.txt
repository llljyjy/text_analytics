Let me start if by saying that I love the product itself, I feel as though it reduces the blemishes but it doesn’t make them go away. The issue I had at hand was the packaging, it’s not travel safe and do no spill or let the product leak. Firstly, the paint or coating used to cover the glass product peels off and would get on my hands. Also, the product leaked when I took it to travel (even though it was sealed) and more of the paint came off because of it. Good product, bad packaging
