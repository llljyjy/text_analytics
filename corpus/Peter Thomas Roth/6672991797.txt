I have very dry skin due to the acne cream I use at night. I also have very sensitive skin. (I Recommend buying aloe vera leaf from the grocery store, cutting it up freezing it, put it on your face after you cleanse and before your regimen, at night time, for sensitive skin, it’s made a huge difference for me) Peter Thomas Roth exfoliating peel gel is so gentle and feels so good. My skin is drastically more smooth takes away all and any dry skin flakes( that sounds gross lol ) also helps with blackheads and makes me look and feel so fresh faced. I use it every 3-4 days. Highly recommend. Even if all you can afford is the mini. Get it. ✨ she’s he’s gays and theys. Everyone needs this. ✨ i can’t say enough good things about this gel peel
