I have only used this twice so far. I havenâ€™t noticed a huge difference in my skin (I have combination skin). I broke out last time after using it, but I believe that it was an unrelated break out due to stress and hormones. At the very least, this mask is very relaxing, especially if you refrigerate it before using it. Very refreshing and relaxing
