This product by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical skincare, I’ve only been using this for a week now. I live in Texas and the weather is super hot even in October. I’ve used this product under my makeup and my skin felt happy. I doesn’t make my face look caky, it leather up on your skin so well. The texture is very consistent and not running at all. I see a difference than my regular sunscreen. I would recommend this product. A must have!
