I’m actually kinda obsessed with this moisturizer tbh. I have dry skin and hate the feeling of thicker moisturizers cause it’s like I have to drag it all over my face but this feels like satin. It’s almost hard to describe but it’s sooo silky when you apply it feels wonderful. It leaves my skin actually feeling soft for once. I sometimes wet the tips of my fingers with it to make it even better. Obsessed
