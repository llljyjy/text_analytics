I was really excited to receive the complimentary PeterThomasRoth resurfacing peel pads for testing purposes. The peel pads along with the resurfacing serum are said to help with fine lines, aging, and breakouts. I was actually going through an active breakout when I began using the peel pads along with the serum so this was a perfect way to test all the claims. When it comes to softening the skin and the textural appearance of it, the peel pads and the serum worked wonderfully. My face always felt very soft upon waking up in the morning. However when it comes to the acne/pore block aspect, they did not help. If anything, I think they may have actually broken me out a little more. The peel pads smell good and I had no issues with a bad reaction on my skin while using them. I do typically have sensitive skin, so that says a lot. I had to go back to my regular acne control system (using La Roche Posay products) which cleared my entire face up within a few days. So now Iâ€™ll continue using these PeterThomasRoth peel pads for the fine line target areas I want more control on. Works on fine lines!
