I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth the PRO Strength Vitamin A, C,  &  E Retinoid Treatment I have been using it for about two weeks now. I  have seen a reduction in my lines in my forehead and smile line areas. I use it about three times a week not to aggravate my skin.  I also have used it in my under eye area and gentle use it to try and plump up my deep wrinkles. I have  yet to see a lot of results but I don’t use it every time I apply to other areas as I don’t want it to become to sensitive in that area. I do not get to close to my waterline as to prevent an accidental irritation their. But overall it is a great product to include in my skin care routine. nan
