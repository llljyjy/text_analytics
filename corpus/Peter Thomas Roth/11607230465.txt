I received these patches complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. I have really enjoyed using these patches. They come in a beautiful jar and include 2 different sized patches and tweezers. So far I’ve used them under my eyes, on my forehead, and around my mouth. They feel very soothing and cooling, and comfortable no matter where I apply them on my face. They stay put and don’t slide off when I’m moving around. I haven’t noticed any major results,  but I can say they have helped my fine lines start to fade a bit and they definitely have plumped my skin. They are also moisturizing too. I will have to use them longer to see what other results I get. I’m loving what they are doing for my skin so far. Love these patches!!!
