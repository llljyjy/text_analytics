I followed directions, but still have to find a way to stop this product from creating that white residue. Not to mention I didn’t see a difference. I don’t have huge bags, and I’m thinking this might be for individuals who may have bigger bags, for it to make a difference. I have barely forming bags, and I thought this might fade them, but that was not the case at all. I’m disappointed, because the product is a little pricey and just didn’t work out for me at all.. nan
