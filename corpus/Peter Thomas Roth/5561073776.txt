It pulls terribly. I’ve tried it over moisturizer, without moisturizer, waiting 15 minutes after skincare to put it on, and immediately after skincare. It doesn’t matter. It pills. And not just a little bit. I look like I have dry skin flakes all over my face. Not a cute look. The only reason it gets 2 stars from me is because the product itself doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or look oily like a lot of sunscreens do. I don’t recommend. There are way better options for a lot cheaper. The Pilling!
