I really loved using these in combination with the serum and my skin is much smoother then before. I can now go outside with minimal makeup as this has reduced the spots on my face to quite some extent. I have glycolic acid products from other bran as well but this by far is the best. No irritation burning or redness. I loved it Amazing results in just a few days. Loved it
