I really wanted to like this product after LOVING a discontinued product of PTR, their CC cream with 30spf and vitamin c, but sadly this was just far too heavy for my preference. Unless you have extremely dry skin, this would be too heavy to layer under moisturizers, and I definitely wouldn’t bother using in the mornings unless you want a greasy look. Personally, I didn’t notice too much results other than a little brightening and I’ve used most of the bottle. If it was a thinner formulation I probably would’ve enjoyed the product’s results more instead of feeling shiny Too heavy for a serum
