Upon application it felt fine and then immediately right after it started to sting and burn. I’m not sure if that’s what it’s supposed to do. I use both products the pads and serum together and it started to burn even more. I’m not sure if I was supposed to use them on they own. My skin started to feel tight right after. I tried only uses these pads and unfortunately same reaction. I’m not sure if the acid feeling on my face is supposed to happen but it’s not comfortable and makes me feel nervous about what’s being applied to my face. So for that I do not recommend. I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Burning Sensation
