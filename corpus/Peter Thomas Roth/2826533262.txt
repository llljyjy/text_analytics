Love it when brands focus on barrier care and this moisturizer from PTR will be your skin barrierâ€™s bff! Initial texture looks like your regular cream but once it blends and sinks in, it provided my skin with an immediate moisture burst. Left a silky and soft finish with some plumping effect. Not a dewy effect but I feel the hydration it provided. Very impressed with this moisturizer. I can use this day and night. Will work best for dry skin like mine, for oilier skin type maybe be cautious with the amount you apply. Supports my skin barrier
