I received this retinoid treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth and I was amazed. My skin felt so soft, smooth and radiant. The cream is thick in texture but very lightweight on the skin. It is non-greasy.  My skin has never felt this good. I’ve been using it every night and it’s very gentle on my skin. It’s very nourishing and moisturizing. I wish they sell a bigger tube. Overall, I highly recommend and this will definitely be part of my skincare routine. WOW!!!
