Peel pads are my JAM and this one is a powerhouse for nighttime. I use peel pads as a toning step and I like how this has glycolic and retinol. The retinol seems high quality bc of the yellow color of the pads. I alternate this with the serum bc I am afraid to double up on those ingredients. This is a great peel pad to add to your nighttime regimen! Powerhouse nighttime peel pads
