This sunscreen reminds me a lot of the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen but with higher SPF. It’s light weight, non greasy, and doesn’t leave any kind of white cast. Still smells like a sun screen but not overwhelming like other sunscreens are. It works great under makeup or alone. I love that it’s made by a skincare brand that I already know and love. Highly recommend if you are looking for a good facial SPF! nan
