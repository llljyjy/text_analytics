I received this as a sample and love it. I’m a big fan of Peter Thomas Roth’s products. I currently use the glycolic pads 3x/week, peel pads 1x/week and have used the sulfar mask and SPF in the past. I’ve always felt his products give great results and think he’s one of the better skin care brands at Sephora. This is a very light moisturizer, I would not suggest if you have dry skin. I found this works well in the morning/daytime but would not use in the evening, I personally prefer a more hydrating and thicker moisturizer at night.I’m giving 4 stars mainly because of the price. I find there are similar products, maybe just as good for less expensive. I like Laniege and Belief for a similar daytime moisturizer, both are more affordable. Good daytime moisturizer, steep price though
