Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. I love the various sizes of the patches. I use them in the morning for my eyes. It helps me look more youthful and refreshed. The patches are very easy to apply and rich with collagen. They also helps to reduce the apperance of fine lines on forehead. The skin is hydrated and revived after the patches. Love it!
