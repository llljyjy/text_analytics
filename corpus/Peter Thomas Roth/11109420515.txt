Peter Thomas Roth gifted me their FIRMx Collagen Face & Eye Hydra-Gel Patches. I like that these include not just eye patches but also a patch for other areas of the face. There are 90 patches for 30 total uses if all three are used at the same time (two eye patches and one face patch). The face patch is great for the forehead but has to be cut if using on lip and nose creases. There is a lot of serum so these are very hydrating. The gel is refreshing and the package comes with tweezers so they can be removed individually. These are packed with various forms of collagen. They have been great under eyes but I need to use them longer in other areas before possibly seeing results since those lines are more noticeable. nan
