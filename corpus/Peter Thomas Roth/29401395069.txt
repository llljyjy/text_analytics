I’ve enjoyed trying the Peter Thomas Roth Collagen Hydrogel Face and Eye Patches. I love the cool temperature under my eyes. I also put them on my forehead. You really can put them anywhere on your face. They are thin and stay on easily. They contain Marine Collagen, Plant Collagen and Hydrolyzed Collagen. They also contain Hyaluronic Acid, squalane, a peptide complex, fatty acids, and an amino acid complex. They come with cute little tweezers to help separate them out. They are easy to pick up and place onto your skin. If you want to move them around, they still stick. This is the first Peter Thomas Roth product that I’ve tried and I really love my first impression. It is attractively packaged. It’s upscale looking. There are so many patches in the container, so it lasts a long time and is a good deal. Would recommend! Use them nightly!
