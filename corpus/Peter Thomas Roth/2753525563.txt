The texture was good, no irritation and it left my skin hydrated but not at all greasy.  The one problem is that it did not play well with makeup and will pill up regardless of the makeup or application technique (tried with fingers, brush and sponge).  If not for the pilling I would definitely buy it again because I liked the finish and it felt good on my sensitive skin (my eyes are very sensitive to SPF and this one did not bother my eyes at all and I did not feel any tingling on my skin which is also a common thing with SPFs).  If I’m not wearing makeup then it works wonderfully but doesn’t work on days when I wear makeup. Nice finish, no irritation but pills under makeup
