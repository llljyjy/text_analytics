Tiktok made me buy it. I REALLY wanted this one to work. Here’s what DID happen....i put a light layer under my eye as instructed as well as a light brush on my 11’s (if you know...you know) and I waited the 5 minutes. The result was FOR ME was completely unnoticeable and i dont have huge bags so I thought this would be perfect especially after the way i saw it work online. It left my under eye and “11“ area (in-between the eyebrow area ) a thin white crusty “paste“? i guess you could call it. If I needed to put anything on top of this like a foundation or concealer it would have flaked off and left me with a patchy area. Just awful. On to the next please. leave this one on the shelf kids. Disappointed.
