I wanted to find a moisturizer with a high SPF for those lazy days when I do not want to do my full routine or wear makeup. After trying every option that Sephora sells this has been the clear winner. It’s hydrating, cooling, and does not pill like so many of the others. It’s perfect to throw on before a morning run or for errands. It also absorbs well for layering other products. Love It for Easy Skincare Days
