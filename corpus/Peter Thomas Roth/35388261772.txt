lets just say for a $90 vit cream C that is unstable the packaging is unacceptable considering the state of vitamin C oxidation status but it is a deravitive so its not all that bad but yes the ingredients in this cream dont get any better just not sure thatâ€™s enough to overcompensate for the disappointing packaging. i answered no on recommending just because theres cheaper options and the product shouldnt be exposed to air otherwise the product is great. nan
