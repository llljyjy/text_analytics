I wanted to like this product, but it does not like me. My skin was very dry and this was recommended to me at the store, but this made it worse. After my skin cleared up (using calendula), I tried this again. The next morning my eyes were swollen and my skin had scaly patches on it where it was used. I’m so mad because this was expensive, but it’s not worth the month long damage control I have to do after using. Swelling and Dry Patches
