I love the concept of these patches - two different shapes included allow you to target different areas with just the perfect shapes and sizes - half moons for your eyes and the oval patches, located in the middle of the jar, for the lips, forehead and nasolabial folds. And, of course, you get a better value since youâ€™re not wasting large under-eye patches on other areas and the entire jar is filled with usable patches without a gap in the middle. I love how hydrated and smooth they leave my skin in just 15 minutes and these patches stay in place the entire time without slipping and sliding all over your face, so definitely keeping them in my routine from now on. nan
