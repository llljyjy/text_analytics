I’ve been using these pads for about a month now, and I have been enjoying it. I’m no stranger to chemical exfoliants, and my skin isn’t sensitive, so I had no issues with the concentration of actives in it. They’re effective, but still very gentle. I have noticed brighter and clearer skin after an initial small purge, but no breakouts after that. The product being on pads makes this very easy to use. I enjoyed this product and I’d definitely recommend it. nan
