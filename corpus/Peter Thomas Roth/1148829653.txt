SPF is a must all year long so I always love trying our different formulas to see what suits my combo skin well. This gel sunscreen is one of the best I used! Its hydrating, doesn’t leave a white cast on my tanned complexion and blends nicely.. it doesn’t feel greasy either and I like the primer-like formula! Moreover, it’s got a high spf of 45!! I will be using this often!! Nice sunscreen for combo skin!
