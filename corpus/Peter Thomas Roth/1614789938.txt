Used in tandem with the serum so hard to distinguish if the serum, this product or both worked well. I think this helped to let the serum penetrate the skin better and helped to exfoliate. All in all both products combined are cheaper than the 1 product that I use from my dermatologist office! If this continues working and does not make me break out then I will definitely continue using! nan
