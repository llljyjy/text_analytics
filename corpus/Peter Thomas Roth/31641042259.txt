I’m not used to getting a breakout now that I just hit 50…. But I use his other products and love 95% of them.  This is a great product. I can see a blemish coming in, apply this in the afternoon and be makeup ready for the night! It has not dried out my skin. I only use it on the blemish area and be sure to moisturize the surrounding areas well. Amazing and quick results!!
