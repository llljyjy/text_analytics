I love sunscreens like this in the summer! It’s completely clear and feels a lot like supergoop unseen which is a go to for my kids and I in the summer. It provides a semi matte finish which is super flattering. Peter thomas Roth makes amazing sunscreens and I’m so excited for this one! Very Smooth!
