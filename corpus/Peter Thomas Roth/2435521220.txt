Very nice sunscreen. I have dry-combo  skin and I find this formula hydrating. It also feels very lightweight and dries down to nothing on the skin. It also doesnâ€™t mess with makeup. Out of all the face sunscreen I tried (which is quite a lot), I rank this within the top 5. Highly recommended to the drier skin types! Lightweight and hydrating
