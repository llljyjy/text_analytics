Complimentary from PTRWhoo wee this product packs a punch with Vitamins A, C, AND E. I’ve only ever used 2% granactive retinoid before, so this one is a huge step up. I’ve been slowly introducing this into my night routine by using it ever other night, over my moisturizer. So far, haven’t noticed anything too significant, but I will say my skin looks a little more even in color, which is a big plus for me. Overall, a bit expensive and wouldn’t last really long with daily use, but it works. nan
