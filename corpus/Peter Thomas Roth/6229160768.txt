These patches are a relaxing and luxurious experience. There’s two shapes for different areas of the face. I mostly use the under eye patches and they fit comfortably under my eyes. They’re packed with beneficial ingredients that temporarily tighten and plump the skin. I enjoy using them but the price is a little costly so I’ll save them for special occasions. nan
