Love this!  I have combo skin and this was perfect!  Good SPF protection,no whitecast, used it after my skincare, solo, and under makeup and feels velvety smooth and glides across the skin every time.  I use the amount I would for a sunscreen, not a primer, and have experienced no issues with it disrupting my other products or wearing down throughout the day.  Itâ€™s a new staple in my skincare for days when I wear makeup as it allows me to skip using a separate primer. nan
