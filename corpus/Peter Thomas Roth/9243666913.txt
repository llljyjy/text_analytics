So I was worried about suing this product because it had sulfur in it but it didn’t smell like much when I opened the container. I liked the texture and it went in pretty smoothly but I can’t say if really did much for me. The worst part about it is when I went to wash off the mask I really started to smell that god awful sulfur smell and now I can’t seem to escape the smell! I re washed My face and put my yum smelling glow recipe serums * moisturizers on I washed my hands atleast 4 times and I am still stuck with that smell! Ugh just not worth it at all. I should’ve known not to use this. Not worth it!
