I got this complimentary  from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare, it is a yellow orange color with no scent. You put it on at night, and it gives you face a great glow in the morning. I usually use retinoid at night so it doesnâ€™t irritate my skin, but also ads vitamin c  and e into my nightly routine. I love this! nan
