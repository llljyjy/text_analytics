I cannot live without a hydrating moisturizer and this is IT! It leaves my skin feeling so plump, I have really dry skin so during winter it goes through the ringer. It doesn’t dry down super quickly like other ones I’ve tried which I appreciate because usually my skin feels tight afterwards if it disappears in seconds. Amazing for dry skin
