These retinol pads are a lot more gentle than retinols that I have tried in the past. I noticed that when I use these, they make my skin very very slightly itchy, and also make the skin under my chin very dry which I hadn’t experienced before. I think my skin still needs time to get used to retinol. As far as fine lines and such go, I have not noticed a visible difference yet, but hopefully with longer use of this product I will. I’ve only been using the pads once a week so far to ease my skin into this addition to my routine, along with the PTR retinol serum. More gentle than other retinol products
