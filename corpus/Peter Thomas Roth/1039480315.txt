I Peter Thomas Roth has always put out solid skincare across the board and Vital-E Eye Cream should not disappoint, but the melt aspect can take time to get used to and it is a different feel than a typical eye cream, it is not for everybody! Being a Le Mer user I knew what to expect in texture and feel. They may have samples here or in store that is how I found it and then bought it.I only had this a little over a week but I do see subtle difference in dk.coloration under my eyes and the skin most certainly feel more hydrated. I am really surprised to see Waxy used in reference to the consistency of this product. Maybe they have not melted it enough? To me it feels like water has been dropped on my fingertips and tapped into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated most of the day and always through my sleeping hours.It does absorb quickly so no issue with pillowcases absorbing it more than skin. I haven’t had any issue with foundation , concealer or powders on or around my eye. I have Charlotte Tilbury at the moment. Mostly wear Marc Jacobs, Laura Mercier Bobbi Brown and Dior on my eyes. Perhaps there is a conflict with ingredients. I just haven’t experienced it, yet. On The Way To Loving
