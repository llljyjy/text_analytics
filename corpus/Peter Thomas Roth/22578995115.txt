I received the Pro Strength Vitamin A/C/E Retinol Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. I love this brand, it’s one of my favorites because it actually works. I just started using this retinol treatment in place of my previous one and it’s amazing. I really like that this formula incorporates Vitamin E, it nourishes my skin which is great because retinol usually dries my skin out. This retinol definitely leaves my skin feeling softer and looking brighter. Amazing Formula
