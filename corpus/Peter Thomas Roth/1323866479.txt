Definitely tightens and super fast. But “temporary” is true. As soon as you put any other skin product or makeup on top, the effect is pretty much gone. Also stings when I apply, leaves a white residue, and causes to peel, redness and dryness. When I tried to fix it reapply just made it worse. 100% not worth it! nan
