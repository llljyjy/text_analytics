I’ve been using this for about a week and didn’t notice really anything at first. A bit of radiant shine in the mornings but that was it. About 5 days in I did start to notice a more evenness in my tone and less texture. This stuff is great. Love this brand. Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare nan
