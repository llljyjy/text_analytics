I having been using the new Peter Thomas Roth Max Invisible Sunscreen for about 2 weeks not and I have never been more impressed with a sunscreen formula! I wear a full face of makeup everyday so I have to have skincare that allows makeup to be layered smoothly on top and this new invisible sunscreen is a game changer! It has a smoothly, primer-like texture to it that melts into the skin and helps blur and even out texture to allow foundation and powders to be applied flawlessly on top! There is no white cast and it doesnâ€™t break out my sensitive skin! I cannot recommend this sunscreen enough! nan
