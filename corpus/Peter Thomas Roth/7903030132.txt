If you like a dimethicone feeling product, this is for you! Absolutely does add a soft blur effect to your complexion that reduces look of pores and uneven skin tone. I was skeptical about it not leaving a white cast, but it’s doing a really decent job on my light-medium complexion.As for the formula, this isn’t my personal preference of an experience since it makes my skin feel kind of gritty, but that’s a me thing. I prefer to use this on no makeup days personally, but it does look nice under makeup! All in all, this is a great option for those who don’t mind the dimethicone experience, otherwise I think go for their matte spf instead. nan
