I absolutely love the resurfacing pads.  They have a higher percentage of glycolic acid in comparison to the serum.  They’re also slightly textured so feel like the glycolic acid and retinol are really worked into the skin.  I’ve been using these twice a week and have noticed a big improvement in my skin’s texture and fine lines. Love these peel pads!
