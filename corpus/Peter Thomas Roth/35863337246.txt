Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. For a while I’ve been curious about retinoid products and was excited to try this. I’ve applied it every 2-3 nights to help ease my skin in. So far I’ve noticed no irritation or dryness. It absorbs quickly and has a subtle scent. I can’t say too much about the long term effects as I’ve only used this for a few weeks and it’s too early to say. This is on the expensive side and not something I’d buy but I’m happy for the opportunity to try this. Excited to see the results at the three month mark. nan
