This is such a great formula ! I happen to really love using less products on my face and can typically get away free of foundation but I do enjoy applying things like cream blush and what not . The primer feel of this spf really makes this a great fit for me because it gives me a good base not just for spf application but also as a makeup primer which holds onto the cream blush nicely . A must have for me
