Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. These gel patches are new must have for me. I love how they come in different shapes and sizes for various areas. I use them under my eyes, on forehead and nasolabial folds. The skin feels so hydrated and enriched. The patches help to reduce the puffiness and darkness around eyes in the morning. Amazing patches
