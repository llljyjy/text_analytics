I was so excited to try Even Smother Peel pads by Peter Thomas Roth because I know what a great brand it is but unfortunately the pads were too intense for my sensitive/reactive skin. At 45, I’ve been looking for a a product to help with the crease I’m starting to notice between my brows and I thought this might help. As I applied, I noticed a stinging and a tingle but no heat or burning so I thought I was good. The next morning I woke up with a red flush all over my face. Unfortunately, this product is not for me. Womp womp! nan
