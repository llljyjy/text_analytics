I’ve been using this product for a few days now. That fact that it doesn’t leave a cast on my brown skin is a plus. However, the moisture retention and the soft dewy look of my skin is fantastic. It’s doesn’t feel oily or sticky after application. Brown girls don’t forget you need the SPF. moisturize and sun protected!
