Ive been using retinol for a while now, so I used it every other night, and I had no issues. For the records, i have oily skin and not very sensitive. If this is your first time using retinol, use once or twice a week at first, and you can definitely use it every night if your skin is ok with it. And donâ€™t forget sunscreen (unless you apply it right before bed)! I used these along with the Even Smoother Serum. I noticed a change almost immediately. I definitely recommend this product, I love these peel pads! Immediate results!
