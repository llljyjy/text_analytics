This really works. This is one of those products that you’re like WOW… how did you do that to my face!?? It seriously plumps those wrinkles and fine lines right up.  No it didn’t take all of them away but it drastically diminished the look of my really large wrinkles I have due to exposure from the sun. It smells really good and it’s very easy to use. A little goes a long way! I will continue to buy this once I run out. It really works. Just make sure to use it at night if you are out in the sun a lot, you will get burned.
