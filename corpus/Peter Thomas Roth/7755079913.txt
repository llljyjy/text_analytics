I believe skin care is the best foundation you can have. I’m 61 and bought this set on sale. I have normal skin but after menopause lost my glow. This product smells like cardboard, doesn’t blend in well and definitely does not leave my skin moisturized or hydrated. I also drink plenty of water for hydration. I’m very disappointed in this product. It’s expensive and does absolutely nothing for my face. disappointed
