I was given this product to try and write an honest review. After using this product for three weeks it has definitely helped with cell turnover and shedding of old skin.. I did use it the first week a little too much and had to back off because my face got really red raw and irritated. Once it got better I did every third night and really liked my routine. I think this is a great product and I love the idea and will be using it again in my future. I do believe it’s worth investment … Retinol in a pad??
