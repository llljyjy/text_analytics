I love the Max Clear Invisible Priming Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 45.  It’s hard to find a sunscreen with a formula that works for my skin. It glides on easily and doesn’t require lots of rubbing and my foundation layers well with it too.The gel formula is so good, it absorbs quickly and dries pretty fast. I didn’t experience any irritation. So good
