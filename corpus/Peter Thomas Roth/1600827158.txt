I’ve been using this for about 2 or so years and love it. I have combo skin, kinda leaning on the oilier side, so I try to steer clear of products that are going to feel too heavy. This is the best lightweight formula I’ve found so far! Highly recommend. I haven’t actually tried anything else from this brand so I need to explore it more. nan
