These are the best eye product i’ve tried so far.  They are expensive, but it does come with a generous amount of the product. I’ve tried a few different eye creams and serums, but nothing reduces my dark circles/puffiness as much as these do. They feel so cooling on the face as well. I usually leave them on for about 30 minutes. Best eye product I’ve tried so far
