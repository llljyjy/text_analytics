This retinoid does well on my skin. I did not experience any flaking, which I sometimes do with retinols. After application, my skin is brighter and softer. It also feels a little smoother and evened out. This isnâ€™t a greasy formula. I am happy so far and look forward to other benefits as I use this longer term. I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. nan
