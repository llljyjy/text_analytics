This sunscreen has a really lightweight feel to it. It has a consistency very much like a silicone primer. It goes on completely clear and does seem to blur my skin, leaving it with a matte finish. Makeup goes on top of it beautifully and you can apply it right after the sunscreen since it dries quickly. I even like how it looks on my skin without makeup on top. It protects my skin either way so thatâ€™s the important thing! Great sunscreen!
