I have a love hate relationship with this. The price is hurtful for what it is but I love the texture and how it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and somewhat protected from the sun. This alone out in direct sun it does basically nothing, but it layers well with actual SPF (I use the glow recipe SPF). I love that it does offer some sun protection for my day to day life (windows, running out etc). It does sting the eyes once you get your skin wet in that area, but it doesnâ€™t bother my eyes otherwise.  Overall I like the layer ability, and will probably continue to use it into the fall and winter love/hate but mostly love it
