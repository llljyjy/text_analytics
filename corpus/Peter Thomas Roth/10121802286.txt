I love this product and the ingredients. I have sunken eyes, basically I have a lack of fat in the under eye area that can only be fixed with fillers or surgery. This product won’t “fill“ in eye hollows but it definitely made them more plump and hydrated. Keep in mind the effect is only temporary. I also noticed some fine lines and creases looked a lot less prominent after using. This product is on the pricier side but I think it’s worth it! Good for plumping and firming!
