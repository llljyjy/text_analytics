These are my heroes on the days I wake up with puffy eyes. They are so soothing and hydrating for my undereye area and best of all they do not sting or irritate my skin. These come with the face patches ith I have been using around my smile lines ND they seem to be helping with smoothing the area a bit, will definitely continue to use. nan
