I am loyal to Peter Thomas Roth. Love most of PTR’s products but this really irritates my eyes. It is light weight and feels good on my skin but the eye irritation is unbearable & is why I will not buy this again. To be clear, I don’t even put this once close to or around my eyes but somehow it still gets irritated. Irritates my eyes- dealbreaker
