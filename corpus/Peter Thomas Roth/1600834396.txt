This is an AMAZING deal, I have always loved the eyepatches for travel. When I saw this duo I thought it would try it considering it is basically just getting the eyepatches free, well now I think I like the moisturizer even better than the eye patches. The feeling on my skin is super light and almost airy and it dries quickly. I really feel like it locks in moisture especially around my eyes. I have sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t bother it at all Two awesome products
