Finally, an excellent performance hydrating gel/cream hybrid that doesn’t eventually clog my pores. I love hydration and moisture, but my 45-year-old combo skin is prone to congestion if I’m not ultra-picky about the products I apply. I picked up the travel size of this Water Drench cream on a whim at Sephora during a two-month visit to Thailand. Voila! It worked perfectly under my sunblock, worked great by itself and offered just enough bouncy hydration without getting greasy or making my skin feel heavy. Best of all, I’ve since purchased more jars of this stuff, and I’m happy to report it doesn’t clog my pores. Give this stuff a try if your skin is finicky like mine. This is it!
