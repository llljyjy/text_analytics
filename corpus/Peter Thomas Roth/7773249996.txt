This is a great sunscreen that doesn’t break me out and I have oily sensitive skin so that’s hard to find. Its also absurdly priced and I usually buy it during a sale or promotion. Its lightweight and absorbs nicely into the skin. Be warned it stings the eyes which is something to be highly aware of and I don’t mean because I rub it on or near my eyes, I mean on hot days it can slip near the eyes or if you touch your face and then accidentally touch your eye it will sting. I wish it was more affordable because I really do like the way it works. Also the packaging is very misleading. there is a soft plastic pouch on the inside of the plastic hard case so pull it apart when you think its empty because there is definitely more product in it, it just isn’t pumping it out anymore nan
