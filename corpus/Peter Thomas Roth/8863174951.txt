Okay this product really delivered for me! This moisturizer has such a gorgeous and unique texture. Be careful upon opening, as it’s thick and almost has a slight goopiness to it (think of a dialed-back cosrx snail 92). It applies in a thick way and yet absorbs nicely, while still leaving the skin plump and moist. It’s a huge hit for my dry skin, as I need my moisturizer to hydrate but to also stay on the surface of my skin, locking in moisture. This did both of those things. I also am so happy this is fragrance-free, as my skin is both dry and sensitive. This helps knock the risk factor down for me!If I had to name some gripes, it would not be with the product itself at all. Instead, it would be that I find some of the wording PTR uses to be confusing. Hyaluronic acid is a solid at 30% (note the word: “complex” - it’s not 30% HA, it’s 30% hyaluronic acid AND whatever else is in the “complex”…could include water, for example). They also disclose patented ingredients, for example “Hydrafence” - but it’s not super helpful information to me personally.Alas, I’m not going to deduct a star as the product quality is a solid 5 stars. It’s a beautiful, luxurious moisturizer that very effectively relieves dryness! nan
