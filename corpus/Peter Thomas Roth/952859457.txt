Very hydrating for my skin!  I have normal-dry mid 40s skin with some minimal signs of “aging“. :)  My main goal was for soothing purposes.  Any time I use these, my under eye area is smooth/hydrated literally for days!  I’ve lived in humid & arid climates - & regardless, my skin loves them! Love Them
