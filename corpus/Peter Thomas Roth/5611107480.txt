I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. I have been using this as a part of my nightly routine. It really seems to help even out my skin tone and with wrinkles I have been getting. It absorbs nicely into my skin and it does not irritate my skin at all. Overall I have had a wonderful experience using this and would love to try other products from this brand. I can really see a difference!
