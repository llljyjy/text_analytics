It’s an okay SPF of 45 yeah, but matte tho? Where’s the matte? My face remained shiny from the very beginning. So I waited another 15mins for it to really do it’s job, and still, I look very shiny. I mean I already have oily skin, so idk. This just didn’t really work for me. However, this didn’t irritate my eyes, so that’s a plus I suppose. Would I buy this again? Maybe not. But I’m gonna use this until it’s gone. Oh! And yes, it does pill on your skin. Oh well. nan
