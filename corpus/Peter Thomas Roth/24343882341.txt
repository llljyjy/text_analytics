I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. These new eye and face patches work great with collagen to help firm, smooth and give youthful appearance. They have just the right amount of solution to keep they in place and not slide down. These have a nice cooling effect that I love and really helps plump and hydrate. Come in a convenient container with a twist off lid and tiny tweezers for more of a hygienic application. I recommend these 10/10. Hydrating eye patches
