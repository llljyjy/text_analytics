I thoroughly read all the reviews prior to buying this product.  I had high hopes.  I was worried about the white flakes I kept reading about.  The first time I tried it I used about a pea size dot, half on each eye, dabbed it with a brush.  Love that it tightened, though yes I did get some white spots.I figured I just needed to keep trying with different amounts and different techniques.  I halfed it to half of a pea.  I take half of that and dab right below the lower eye lid, then I stoke down with the brush.  That worked wonders.  No more white residue.  I use it most days, I only wear eye makeup and put my moisturizer on after avoiding that area.  So try it, experiment with it, be sure to shake it.  If you get the white residue use less.  Once you get the hang of it, it will be a product you use all the time.  I am 57 and have puffy circles under my eyes. Practice, Practice and find technique that works
