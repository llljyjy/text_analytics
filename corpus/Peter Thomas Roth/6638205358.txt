This sunscreen has an interesting texture. It feels like a primer and it is super smoothing on the skin. I canâ€™t tell if it actually is protecting my skin but I do like how it feels underneath my make up. I wish the texture was different because it is a little bit weird. Like the applicator and the amount that is given. Works well
