This product starts as a thick, occlusive texture but as you start to rub it in it melts into a thin, watery cream. It’s nice because it feels lightweight but leaves my skin uber hydrated and nourished. It’s one of those that I love using both in the morning and evenings. I think if you have dry or dehydrated skin you will LOVE this product! nan
