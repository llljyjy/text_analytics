In love with this sunscreen! It definitely lives up to its name as a clear and invisible sunscreen. The number one thing I look for when buying sunscreen is whether it leaves a white cast, and I’m so glad that this doesn’t. It also is easy to spread, and doesn’t leave any sticky feeling. I think this would be great for all skin types! I also don’t typically wear makeup, but can see it being great as a primer as it leaves my skin feeling smooth.  Would recommend! No white cast!
