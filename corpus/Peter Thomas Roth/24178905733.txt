Kinda loving this sunscreen right now. It really is clear and if you are like me and have super oily skin you can feel safe with this. It looks nice under my liquid foundation and doesn’t make me look or feel oilier than I already am. It doesn’t necessarily absorb oil for me but most sunscreens give my sebum-making a boost and this doesn’t do that. I also love that it’s waterproof and doesn’t smell offensive. Gives my skin a very slight soft focus effect. I haven’t tried it under powder foundation yet but so far I’m very happy with this spf. Love that it’s clear
