I’ve been loving this moisturizer.  My skin feels noticeably softer and moisturized after using it and very soft in the morning.  I’ve been using it in my evening skincare routine.  The texture is wonderful and this moisturizer wears beautifully under makeup.  My makeup looks flawless when I skin prep with this.  It’s a perfect moisturizer for dry winter months. My skin feels so soft!
