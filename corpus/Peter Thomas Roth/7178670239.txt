So far I am very happy with it, and with the results Iâ€™ve seen during the past week I have been using the Pro Strength Retinoid Treatment. I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts, so I do find it difficult to use certain types of products, but this specific Pro Strength Retinoid Treatment by Peter Thomas Roth has caused me no adverse effects or reactions.  On the contrary I do see some improvements when it comes to skin clarity and dullness.  I also feel my skin is more supple and rehydrated. I am very happy I received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. love it
