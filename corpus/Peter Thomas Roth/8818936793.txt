One star off for the price. I’m halfway done my first jar of these. They feel wonderful and for soothing, cooling and de-puffing the under eyes they’re lovely. I’m wearing a pair right now, before my other morning skincare and makeup. But I haven’t noticed any lasting effects yet. No harm either- no stinging or milia just a cool soothing sensation and de-puffing my eye bags a bit. I got them for $10 more in a dual pack with the Cloud cream which is a constant repurchase. I bought another 2 dual packs and when I run out of those I will consider more but only during a good sale. cooling & soothing
