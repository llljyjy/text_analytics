This product was gifted to me from Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. I’m so excited to see a product with not only retinol but vitamin c and e! I’ve always thought you weren’t supposed to mix A and C but I love the benefits of both so I’d typically use C during the day and retinol at night. I was concerned after reading the instructions that it would be harsh on my skin but it wasn’t and left my skin feeling smooth and soft the next morning. I can’t wait to keep using and seeing the results after a few weeks! Love that it has retinol and vitamin c!
