These don’t… do anything? The only thing I’ve noticed these eye patches do is be moisturizing, which isn’t enough in my opinion when there’s other products like moisturizers and eye creams that can do the same thing, if not better. If anything I find that these take too much effort for the results that I get. My fine lines are the exact same, so is my under eye darkness, so what exactly is the point? I’ve gone through nearly the entire pack and have the same under eyes as the ones I started with when I first got the product. I would purchase this if you want to moisturize your under eyes a tad bit, but nothing other than that. Big yawn
