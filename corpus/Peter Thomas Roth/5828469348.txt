These really are amazing in my personal opinion - I break out easy and these did not make me break out. I used on the off days with the retinol cream (which did make me break out a bit) but the pads are just super refreshing, easy to use, and I definitely see a difference the next day even - it just gives my skin a cleaner/less patchy look. Highly recommend! Worth it
