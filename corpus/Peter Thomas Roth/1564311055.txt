I received this from Influenster along with the Even Smoother serum in exchange for my honest review. These peel pads are the best I’ve used. I’ve used First Aid Beauty and Dr. Dennis Gross, but I get better  results with the PTR Even Smoother. They don’t tingle or burn, and don’t cause redness. I may even like these better than Drunk Elephant Baby Facial. I also like these because there is enough product left after applying it to your face that you can put it on your chest, neck, and backs of hands. I have super sensitive dry autoimmune reddened skin, and these are great. The serum is too strong and makes my redness worse. nan
