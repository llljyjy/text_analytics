I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes, but I love it all the same! I have used other versions of PTR’s peel pads, and they are equally as great. I have sensitive skin, but these don’t bother me at all - no breakouts or sensitized skin. I always put something soothing and hydrating on after using these at night (once a week or more if your skin feels particularly congested and textured) and I wake up the next morning with smooth, radiant skin. Highly recommend! Always a winner!
