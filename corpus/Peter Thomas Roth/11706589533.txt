It works, but it does leave a white residue. It says to just use less, but I’m using the tiniest amount possible. You can’t put anything else on it, so not makeup or other moisturizer. I’ve used it about 20 times. I’ve gotten it to work well about 1/4 of that, and it does look great for about 3 hours. Overall, it’s just not great and most of the time, I have to wipe the residue and restart. Works okay but...
