I have always struggled to find a good sunscreens for my extremely oily skin. I absolutely loveee this gel texture, it’s so smooth and silky. It somewhat reminds me of Supergoop sheer one but this one is more perfect for oily skin type. It doesn’t make my skin feels heavy or greasy at all, and sets the makeup flawlessly. Perfect for the oily skin in the summer!
