I was so excited when I got this product in an Influenster box, and was eager to try it out. I do have very sensitive skin so that could be why my skin reacted the way it did. So i only used it a couple of times and it made my skin break out very bad. I don’t usually break out unless a use something that triggers it. So unfortunately I won’t be using this product again. Huge bummer! But i absolutely love Peter Thomas Roth products! And the packaging is amazing. My skin just didn’t like this one. Bummed
