I know how important is sun protection, but honestly I have a love/hate relationship with most of the sunscreen, some of them can burn my eyes, I can taste some of them all day long, some have too intense fragrance, thankfully this one doesn’t do any of that and that is why I like it, it’s invisible which is important to me since im in the medium/tan skin tone category and act like a primer for my makeup so good, leave my skin so smooth and I can barely smell the sunscreen fragrance in it, love that it has vitamin e and shea butter which can improve uneven skin tone by use, I really love it. All I want in a sunscreen
