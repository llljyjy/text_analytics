The pads are easy to use and a one stop shop for me with Glycolic acid, retinol and hyaluronic acid. Using these combined with the serum has made a visible difference in my skin. I did not feel any tinglingbut wake up with smoother and brighter skin. I have also noticed my sun spots and acne marks fade considerably. I use them twice a week or before a big eventI would highly recommend it! Great product
