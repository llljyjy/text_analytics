I have struggled with dry skin all of my life. Now that I’m in my late 40s, even more so. This product is phenomenal. The moment I put it on my face my skin felt relief. When I run out, my skin can tell & no other hyaluronic acid comes close. I imagine that if your skin isn’t painfully dry, you may not feel the same benefit, but this is my one must-have beauty product. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Best skin product I have ever used
