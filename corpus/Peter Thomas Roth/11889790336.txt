I am grateful for this Collagen Hydra-gel Face & Eye Patches complimentary of Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. I’m a long time user of PTR and have been a fan of its products. I heard great things about the Firmx eye gel, but this is a better packaged version of it. It’s really easy to use in the day. I instantly saw firm skin that lasted most of the day. I recommend the patches specifically in regions with fine line for temporary firmness. nan
