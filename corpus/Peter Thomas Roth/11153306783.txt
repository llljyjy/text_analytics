I have love these pads for years, even before this reformulation. They helped me with my moderate acne in the past, both clearing breakouts and helping to prevent new ones. The only issue is that it’s very easy to overuse them, actually hurting your moisture barrier and making things worse. So it’s important to know your skin and not overdo it. I use these 1x week at most. nan
