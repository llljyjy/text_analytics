Superstar ingredients! With niacinamide, glycolic acid, hyaluronic acid, and retinol I knew this would be a good product. It’s been really great for keeping my pores clean. I know it’s main purpose isn’t acne, but it’s helped keep my acne at bay really well. My only complaint is that I don’t love using pads for skincare. I just feel like pads are more expensive than they would be if the product came in a bottle as a toner/serum. But other than that the product is awesome! Great ingredients, helped my acne!
