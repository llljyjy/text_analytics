This is a very mattifying sunscreen that is like a primer, it comes out of the tube completely clear and leaves a very matte finish on the skin which looks beautiful, especially on aging skin.  I will only use this on occasion though as it contains a lot of silicones to make it so smooth, and those give me breakouts when used regularly.  In short - a special occasion, but not daily sunscreen if youâ€™re acne prone. nan
