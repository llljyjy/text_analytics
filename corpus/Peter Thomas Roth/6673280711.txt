I love that these come in pads opposed to spray or pump toners. It makes them easy to use. I also love that they aren’t dried out like other face pads usually are. My skin can tolerate these for everyday use and I really feel like they’ve been balancing my skin’s texture pretty well. I received these complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. Honestly I am very impressed with these. nan
