These pads seem great! It’s well moist and a lot come in one package. I think these will last me a while since I’ll only use it once a week since I have sensitive skin. I do use these along with the PTR serum (but will alternate on a different day) as it’s too much for my skin to handle if I use it the same day. I highly recommend as it’ll be a good bang for your buck. I think you can use it as a stand-alone as part of your skincare routine or you can pair it with the serum. If you have normal skin you can probably using both products together or more often. I like it!
