I’ve used plenty of AHA and retinol products, so I don’t know what it is exactly that is responsible for the magic of this product, but it’s the only thing that has significantly smoothed out “orange peel“ texture I’ve been experiencing around my t-zone as I’ve moved into my late 30s. I have experienced some mild purging as I’ve increased to daily application, but my skin still looks way smoother over all. Worth it. This truly works on rough texture!
