It took a while to learn how to use this individually I think it will be dofferemt for everyone.You CANNOT take a cab and put it on your under eye. It will leave a white film that get worse the more you wet itI recommend putting your eye cream before using like you normally do if you use an eye cream. You dont have to. But once your eye cream is set in I put a really thin layer of clinique all about eyes before using this (its very creamy and moisturizing) then can a tiny bit of the eye cream on the back of my hand then add the tiniest bit of thos product and mix it a little bit then can right on tge under eye areaIt took weeks to figure out what works for meHope this helpsThis product does work it takes a learning curve to learn how to use it without getting a lot of white film Have to experiment and learn what works for you
