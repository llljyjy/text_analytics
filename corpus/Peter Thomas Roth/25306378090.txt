I received this PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare  for my honest opinion and Iâ€™m so glad I did! This cream has actually helped to brighten my skin. You only need a cery small amount but it goes a long way. It has started to dry certain spots out on my face but it does say it could and if so go to every other day which I will. For me, it has been great and I will continue to buy this! This stuff is great
