I was happy to try this as I often use pads on my face after I workout or to exfoliate. These are a little rigid, so good for those of us with dry skin to help exfoliate and resurface. I did find they left my skin smoother after using. I donâ€™t like to use it I have a sensitive blemish, as they can feel irritated. Thanks to influenster for sending me this product in exchange for my honest review! nan
