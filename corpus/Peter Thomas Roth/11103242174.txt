I read reviews prior to buying this, so when I got it I tried it twice with two different moisturizers underneath. it does pill a lot with a cream moisturizer, but i found that with gel moisturizer underneath (elf superhydrate) i was mostly able to avoid that. blended in well and texture is nice, doesn’t feel heavy although it is thick. it does not leave me matte but rather with a skin finish, not greasy but looking moisturized. my biggest complaint is that the bottle seemed like it was barely full before using. i tested this by looking at the packaging with a flashlight, and weighing it. it only weighed 2oz on a scale, and the packaging likely weighs about 1oz alone, so the amount of product advertised was misleading. not sure if this was the case for anyone else or just me but i don’t feel it’s worth repurchasing. Okay product, came half empty
