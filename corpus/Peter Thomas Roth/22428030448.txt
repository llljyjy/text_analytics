I have received this product as a gift and honestly, I love it. I love how it feels on the face, its like a makeup primer and it dries matte so definitely a good base for makeup. It doesn’t have any scent to it and it doesn’t leave a white cast on the face either since it goes on clear Good spf for makeup
