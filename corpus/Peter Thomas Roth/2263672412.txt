I love Peter Thomas Roth masks. And this one is my second favorite (my fave is the cucumber gel). After one use of leaving the mask on for 30 minutes, the annoying fine lines on my forehead disappeared (i’m 33 with no botox). It’s not a permanent fix but it definitely helps in the short term. Definitely recommend. nan
