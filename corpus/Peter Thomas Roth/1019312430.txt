I am a loyal user of this product since it doubles as a sunscreen and face primer! This product is the ultimate in multitasking for sun protection and a flawless complexion. On the sun protection front, it provides broad spectrum coverage with SPF 45. It also includes Vitamin E and shea butter to keep your skin soft and hydrated while you enjoy the sun. The consistency of this sunscreen is really innovative and mirrors its dual role as a primer. It’s a bit thicker, with a silky feeling; but, it blends into the skin effortlessly and completely. A primer-like gel, with an invisible blurring finish. For me, this worked well as a primer under makeup— no white cast, no pilling, great blurring effect. If your skin tends to be more oily, this might be too slippery or a finish for your skin, and especially to wear under makeup. Thank you, Peter Thomas Roth for developing this product. It is amazing, I highly recommend it, and I am a loyal user! The best in multitasking— sunscreen and primer
