The texture is very hydrating but sometimes needs to be shaken because it separates, which is annoying because it come in a pump and I like keeping all the product at the bottom. Feels really good when I apply since my skin get dry/tight. Only negative is the smell, almost like old play doh Great formula, weird smell
