I have oily/combination skin, and this is the only moisturizer that actually keeps my skin hydrated while not breaking it out. I’ve tried plenty of replacements (e.g. Belif, Tatcha, Laneige, Kiehls) and I keep going back to this one. This moisturizer does tend to go on 50% off sales here and there so I’d keep an eye out for those. Great for sensitive skin
