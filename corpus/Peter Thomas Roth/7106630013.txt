I love love love the hydra gel patches. Whenever I woke up in the morning my under eyes would be so dry and putting these on the night before for like 15 minutes, when I wake up the following morning, my under eyes don’t feel dry. Definitely need to stalk up. I like that they have the bundle because you’re basically getting one product for free. Since the gel patches are like $55+ by itself. Sooooo hydrating!
