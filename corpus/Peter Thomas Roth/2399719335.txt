I received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. I was a little nervous to try this retinoid treatment even though I don’t have a history of sensitive skin. I wound up using the smallest amount possible to test and will continue to do so on an infrequent basis until I’m sure it’s not too powerful for my skin. Overall, I haven’t noticed any irritation or discomfort and am excited to see the results of long term use. Start out slowly and gradually increase amount
