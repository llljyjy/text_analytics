I love this moisturizer and needed a new one, so the addition of the eye patches was nice!The moisturizer is the best I’ve ever used! (Semi-affordable, at least) it feels light, non-greasy/sticky, perfect for warmer months where I don’t need something heavy.I love the eye patches for when I’m puffy. I put them on and use water globes to cool down the area more. Great value!
