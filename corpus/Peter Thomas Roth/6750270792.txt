I received this product from Influenster and Im in LOVE! The pads sting a little but no more than any toner or astringent pads. I felt that my skin that was once bumpy became VERY smooth and I believe it had an affect on my fine lines and wrinkles. It never dried out my skin, in fact it feels very moisturized and looks better than ever. The pads themselves were very soaked but not too much that it was dripping all over or was sitting in it inside the container. Im very satisfied with this product and will definitely be purchasing this again!!! Amazing Stuff!!!
