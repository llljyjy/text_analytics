Really lovely moisturizer. It’s so hydrating and light on the skin. It soaks into the skin quickly and makes my skin look and feel wonderful. Would recommend this as a moisturizer especially during these drying winter months. And I like that it’s more gel like than cream which makes makeup apply nicer for me. nan
