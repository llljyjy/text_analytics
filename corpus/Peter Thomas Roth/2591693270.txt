I got these complimentary from Influenster in return for my honest review. I swapped these out for my Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads. The pros of these are it’s only one pad and you get a lot of use from it. Takes off all the extra grime and dirt I didn’t get off from washing my face— and leaves a nice layer of products on the skin. However I feel they fall a bit short of DDG’s 2 step peel pads. I will probably continue to buy these as I love that it’s one step for nights when I am tired. Great product for improving face texture Easy to use!
