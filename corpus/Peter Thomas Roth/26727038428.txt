I absolutely love this moisturizer! It’s so hydrating and makes my skin feel so refreshed. I have super dry skin (especially during the winter), so this product has been an absolute lifesaver! Its name fits it perfectly too, because when you apply it it literally drenches your skin in hydration. My skin always looks so healthy and glowy after using it too. I love this product, and can’t recommend it enough. Love it
