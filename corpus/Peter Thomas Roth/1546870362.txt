This lightweight sunscreen blends into the skin quickly and instantly hydrates the skin. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my medium skin tone and blends in seamlessly. It leaves the skin with a hydrated but not greasy or oily feeling. It sinks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling soft and silky. The sunscreen has a high protection factor, which is super important to me because I am very prone to dark spots. It also leaves me with a fresh, healthy, and glowing finish to my skin.  The packaging is also really beautiful with the holographic label. I can’t recommend this enough for every skin type and every skin tone! Your skin deserves to be protected and the formula is totally invisible! This is going to be my new everyday staple! Completely Invisible on Medium to Dark Skin Tones
