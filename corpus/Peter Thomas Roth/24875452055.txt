I received the PRO Strength Vitamin A C E Retinoid Treatment  complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Skin Care for my honest opinion. I have been using for a short while now and It really seems to be helping to even out my skin tone.I am so happy that I can have the  chance to try This product. I love putting on it every single  night.  Just be sure to use sunscreen during the day. This treatment  comes in a little tube and absorbs quickly. My skin adjusted pretty well and  look so much better and radiant.I like the combination of ingredients in this one product. I know products like this do take a while so just be patient and be very consistent! I  will continue to use as part of my daily skincare regimen.Iâ€™d recommend this to anyone! This stuff is great
