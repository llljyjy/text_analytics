I was gifted this by Peter Thomas Roth for my honest review! I love that it came with little tongs to grab the patches instead of me struggling to grab them with my hands. I love the different shapes of patches too so you can use them on different areas on your face! They have a cooling sensation, kind of stings a bit. But then work amazing! They de puff and really firm my skin! I love using them for my under eye bags! Makes me look and feel refreshed! Great product
