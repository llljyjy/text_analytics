I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth for testing and reviewing purposes. I have used other products from them and loved every one of them so I was excited to try this. Because it’s a retinol treatment you have to go gradually to avoid irritation and wait at least 6 weeks to see the results, but because it’s mandatory per the brand and the reviewing program I had to do my review in advance, so here’s my first impressions. To the product itself, looks like a creamy product slightly yellow like other retinol products, doesn’t have a noticeable scent and spread easily on the skin with no pilling of other treatments. My face looks bright right after applying and it dries quite well on my skin. Yet it’s too soon to say if this actually works, just wait and see. nan
