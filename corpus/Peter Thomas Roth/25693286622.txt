I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. Sadly I couldn’t see as much as improvement as I was hoping but just because I had to review this product before 14 days and my understanding is this promises results in a little as 4 weeks. I liked the way my skin feels and absorbs the product and I’m glad I didn’t have any allergic reaction I would continue using this product till the end just because I’m really curious if it can get rid of my forehead fine lines Interesting product
