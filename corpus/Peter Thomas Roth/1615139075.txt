I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. I have been using this product for the past two weeks and my skin is noticeably different. I just apply it at night before bed, after cleaning my face just before my moisturizer. The product absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy. I have somewhat sensitive skin and at first I could feel a little sensation but over time it got better. The fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth have improved. Being in my 40’s this is a product I will continue to use because of the results. Works well!
