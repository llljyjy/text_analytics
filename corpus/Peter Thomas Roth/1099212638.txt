I received complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare! This is NEW FIRMx Collagen Hydra-Gel Face & Eye Patches Packed with 7 forms of Collagen and collagen-supporting ingredients, these face and eye contour gel patches help targeted areas appear firmer, smoother and more youthful. When I open this patches, it come with a small tweezers, which is quite clean, so that when I take the patch out, It might not afraid of contaminating other patches! I follow the instructions, I use that tweezers to gently lift and separate a delicate gel patch. Apply onto clean, dry skin. I use the half-moon patch shape for the under-eye area and oval patch shape for the forehead! I leave it on for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then discard it and gently pat remaining serum into skin. After I used it, the dark circles really seem to be a little lighter! So hydrating! The fine lines seems firming, supple and plump with moisture! I put it in the refrigerator after open this jar, This way can keep it fresh! when I use it next time, I feel cooling my eyes! It is so comforting! So relaxing! I like it! So refreshing
