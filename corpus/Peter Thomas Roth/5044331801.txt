I really love this moisturizer and am happy I tried it. My skin is feeling really sensitive from tretinoin especially around my chin and mouth area lately. I use this in combination with a hydrating moisture barrier essence and it feels so good and doesn’t sting or irritate even the raw parts of my skin that are healing. The texture is like a smooth whipped gel that sinks in easily and doesn’t feel greasy. I definitely do feel like my skin stays hydrated for awhile after using this. It also doesn’t pill with my makeup. As someone with drier skin in general, I would definitely use this through winter and even as a night cream in warmer months as it feels rich but still lightweight. Loving this
