These peel pads are amazing in pair with their Even Smoother serum. Both work like a dream! Even when used alone, it works wonders. I use a pad on clean skin a couple of times a week at night, and it has helped get rid of dead skin, minimize skin bumps and skin texture. It also leaves the skin feeling smooth and nourished, not drying at all. YES!
