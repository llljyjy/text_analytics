This is worth every penny — and you get a lot of cleanser for $30. I bought this four days ago and have been using it twice daily. My skin not only looks better — clearer and with fewer red spots — but it feels so soft and hydrated. The texture of this cleanser is delightful and it’s a joy to use. I’m not 100% sold on how the cleanser smells, but that’s a minor detail compared to how well it works. This is my first PTR purchase and I’m looking forward to trying more products based on how effective this cleanser is. A transformative cleanser
