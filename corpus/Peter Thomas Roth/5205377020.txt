I don’t normally buy face patches like this but these really interested me when I came across them. I love that there’s three different types of strips. I think that these are nice to give you more of a variety of how you can use them to help with your fine lines and wrinkles. I find myself cutting these into smaller pieces so that I can fit them between my eyebrows for my 11s which is my major wrinkle area on my face. I found these to be moisturizing, they typically last me around 20 minutes on my face to soak up that serum. They’re not slipping and sliding all over my face which I really like and they’re not extremely hard to handle. I’m a big fan of Peter Thomas Roth products, to date I have not found one that did me wrong. I would recommend these to somebody looking for some hydrating face patches that will help with fine lines. I did not notice a tremendous difference in my fine lines immediately but I know that these things take time. Nice variety & easy to use
