I received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. The hours of sleep I get vary as I am a really light sleepy so I need all the help I can get when it comes to my tired eyes. I love that these patches however are not just for the eyes but you face as well. I can put them on my forehead or laughlines as well. The gels are comfortable and make me feel like I’m pampering myself. It makes me feel like I’m in a spa which I love. They did leave my skin feeling hydrated and more awake in a sense. I can’t wait to see what happens long term. nan
