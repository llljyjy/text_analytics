Wanted to try out a mineral sunscreen for the first time and was hoping to love this product but unfortunately it made me break out :/ I got little bumps all over my forehead & cheeks so this just wasnâ€™t the product for me. I did like the slight tint to it though which evened out my skin tone a bit which I gave another star for! Wanted to love it but broke me out
