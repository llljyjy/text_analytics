I wanted to give it a little time before reviewing this product to test it out. There are mostly good and just one little con. It is extremely moisturizing, I like the thickness of the product and how great it sits under the eyes as well as how it doesn’t smell. The little con is at time it irritated my eyes (maybe I was adding too much lol) but overall a pretty good product. Looking forward to continuing to test it out. Pretty Good… will continue to try
