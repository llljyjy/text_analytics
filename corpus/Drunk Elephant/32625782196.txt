I love love love this stuff. It took my dry flaky skin to silky and glowy so fast. It’s a must have for winter for me. I feel so hydrated everytime I apply this. I use it at night because it does go on kind of thick. But a little bit goes a really long way! It’s a little pricey but I think one bottle will last me four or more months so for as long as it lasts and the fact that it actually does the job it’s more than worth it! I’ll definitely buy more when I run out. Bonus is how luxurious it makes me feel! Hello moisture~
