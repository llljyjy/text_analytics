I love this cleanser, it isn’t as foamy as I usually like but one use and I was a convert. Safe for use on eyes, no stinging and removes stubborn mascara with ease. Rinses clean and my face feels so soft, smooth and squeaky clean but without tightness! Not sure I can use anything else from here on out. All other face washes are in the trash bin. Recommended! My face hasn’t been so clean in years!
