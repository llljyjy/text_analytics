This eye balm is thick and creamy! It is hydrating and contains ceramides as well as omega-rich oils.  A little bit definitely goes a long way. I don’t know that I noticed any immediate results, hopefully over time I will see changes around my eyes. My only complaint is there have been a few times where it has caused my eyes to sting. It’s not every time, so maybe it is a reaction with another product. Creamy eye balm
