I repurchased this serum multiple times until they switched where you mix the powder with liquid yourself. Now no matter how much i shake it (I’ve bought it twice with the new formula) it just stays gritty and feels like I’m exfoliating my skin while applying it. Super bummed they changed it, now i have to find a different vitamin c serum nan
