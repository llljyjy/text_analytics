I have normal skin. I can use pretty much any product without reactions. This product is super hydrating for me as I live in a desert climate. I use this and the B Hydra and the Protini cream as my regimen.   I love these products and they hydrate my skin and don’t pill under makeup.  Those who complain about the amount of product vs. packaging need to learn how much product .5oz actually is. I’m impressed that the packaging allows me to get ALL the product out of it with just the pump. Holy Grail For Me
