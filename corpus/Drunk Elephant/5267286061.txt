This is the best eye cream I’ve tried in awhile. I received this to test, and I will definitely be repurchasing. It’s super hydrating on my dry under eyes, but I can still wear makeup over it. It makes me look more awake just with deep hydration. Also, a lot of eye creams or frangranced products make my eyes burn, but I had no burning at all with this one. It may be a little thick for someone with oily skin, but 5 stars from me!! nan
