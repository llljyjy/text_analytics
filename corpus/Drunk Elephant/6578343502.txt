I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. While this packaging is beautiful, I’d worry about product waste since there doesn’t appear to be a way to open it to scoop out remaining product when necessary. Within one use I did notice that my skin’s texture was much softer. After about a week of using it at night, I did notice that my skin had a bouncy, super hydrated, and well rested look to it. I also felt like this product was very gentle and easy to mix into anyone’s regular skin care routine. Would recommend! Bouncy well rested skin!
