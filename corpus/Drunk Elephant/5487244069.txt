I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion from Drunk Elephant and Influenster. This eye cream is amazing as it actually hydrates. Iâ€™ve tried a ton of different eye creams but this one of my top 2 favorites. It has a soft pleasant scent, feels milky on the skin, leaves it looking hydrated, and feels moisturized for a long time after applying. Trying this makes me want to see if they also have an overall face moisturizer that hydrates so well. VERY VERY PLEASED!
