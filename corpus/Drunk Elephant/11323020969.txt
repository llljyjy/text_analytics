Purchased this oil twice, first the smaller size, then the bigger size. I feel like it’s a hit and miss with my skin, but for the dry winter months it is very helpful and looks really nice on the skin. I would reccomend putting this on a few hours before you go to sleep as I find it takes awhile to set in on the skin and doesn’t immeadiatly hydrate. I do feel as if you could find a dupe for this as it is quite expensive, but if you are willing to splurge, this is a beautiful oil and feels very “luxurious“ on the skin. Also have used this on the ends of my blonde bleached hair and found it to actually eliminate some of the frizz. Overall a decent product. nan
