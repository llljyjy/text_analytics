I received this from influenster and was a little hesitant to trying this because of my sensitive skin but I surprisingly loved this. I do use an additional oil for added moisture along with this serum and love how moisturized my skin feels. It takes about 6 weeks to start seeing actual results and Iâ€™ve been using this for almost 3 weeks and notice my skin is more calm and glowly my skin is. I definitely would recommend wearing a suncreen with this as retinol can make you more sensitive to sun exposure but i love it and love what its done for me so far! Love
