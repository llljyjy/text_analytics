The new formula is not the same. I have been told multiple times that the new formula is the same you simply have to activate it yourself. I cannot believe that this is the case. I used the old formula for a year and loved it! Since the new formula hit my texture has worsened and my tone is no where near what it was before the switch. Also it is so thin that when you dispense it from the packaging it ends up all over the walls, mirror, clothing etc. and it takes bleach to remove! The photos I posted are after scrubbing my walls multiple times! The amount you receive for the price just isn’t worth the new ineffective product. I hated to shelf this one but I’ve moved onto a new brand. Why fix what wasn’t broken?
