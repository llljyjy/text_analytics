This is my new holy grail!!! I’ve never had a successful run in with retinol. Retinols tends to make my already dry skin even dryer, and causes flakiness and irritation most of the time. BUT this product is a retinol in OIL form so it can take away wrinkles AND hydrate the skin all at once (: the oil they use is Marula oil which has so many amazing benefits. It’s also only a 0.5% retinol so it’s very easy on the skin. It’s not a heavy oil as many might think. It’s very lightweight, and absorbs SO well into the skin and won’t have any of thar sticky residue most oils leave on the skin. I’ve been using this for over a month now and the difference in my fine lines/wrinkles has improved tremendously as well as my skin glow!! It has your skin feeling tight yet plump and hydrated. If you struggle with finding a lightweight hydrating retinol, this is definitely the one for you! Hope they make it in a higher percentage in the future <3 Amazingggg!!
