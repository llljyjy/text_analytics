I got the small size and there is nothing to mix or add like the large size. This stuff gives me a little glow but is very sticky in the face and very dark orange. I have fair pale skin so when I put it on it turns my face a color as if I put a turmeric mask on for too long or like I have on a self tanning serum. it makes my face very shiny. Im not sure why its considered a day serum bc of that? I think this would appear way better on someone with more melaninated skin, it would give a glowy shine. I’m not sure if this serum has given me any benefit or not, either way I’ll keep using at night until it’s gone bc why not?? Lol would look pretty on more melanated skin
