I received this free for review and have been using it for about a week. So far my skin has had ZERO dry patches however I have noticed some breakout around my chin area. It could just be that my skin is breaking out, and it’s not due to this-time will tell. As long as this isn’t causing the breakout, I will definitely purchase in the future over other moisturizers. Pretty good!
