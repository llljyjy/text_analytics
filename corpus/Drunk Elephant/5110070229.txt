I really enjoyed the design of this bottle, the top of the bottle swivels and then you’re able to use it as a pump but it’s convenient so it’s not always in that pump mode. I like the formula I think that their suggested one full pump is a bit much for my eye area so gauge for yourself what you can use. I really enjoyed the quality of the moisturizer. I thought that the moisturizer offered a lot of hydration and was very nice and creamy. nan
