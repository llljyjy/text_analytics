Amazing makeup remover!!! I was using Lancôme Bi-Facil but it’s too oily. My contacts were suffering. E-Race removed my mascara (UD Wild Lash) & eyeliner (Lancôme 24H Drama Liqui Pencil in Matte), no tugging or rubbing. I just kept wiping (3x) my eyes to be a 100% clean. The smell is amazing & it feels so nice on your eyes. It didn’t sting my eyes or make my contacts cloudy. It also didn’t leave my eye lids or under my eyes dry. Lancôme Bi-Facil always left my eye area dry after use. Definitely worth purchasing!!! This is my new go to make up remover. Thank you Drunk Elephant! My first purchase from this brand & I’ll will be going back for more! THE BEST MAKEUP REMOVER!!!
