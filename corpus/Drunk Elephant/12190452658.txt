I’ve been mixing in this product with other products for the past few days, wanting to see how it works with foundations, moisturizers, sunscreens, etc… So far I love it and think it’s definitely worth the money because you only need a few drops (2-3) to get a really nice bronzed glow! I find that this works best mixed in with something rather than using it alone (at least on myself). If I were to use it by itself, i’d probably use it sort of like a bronzer and blend it in using a brush. In the wintertime, my skin colour is very dull so I find that this really helps make me look like a living being and not like I’m on my deathbed. I have a light-medium skin tone and I find that mixing it in with moisturizers and sunscreens works better than mixing it in with a foundation because I find that it darkens my foundation (maybe I just add too much of the drops with my foundation but I usually just do 2 or 3). I haven’t had any troubles in terms of breakouts or irritations with this product! Overall, I would recommend this product if you’re looking to get a nice glow to your face during the winter time but also if you’re using self tanner, or want to look alive! A must have for the winter and for dullness!
