I received this product complimentary from influenster and drunk elephant in exchange for my honest review. i’ve been using for almost a week, and so far this eye cream feels great under the eyes. it’s thick but not in a greasy way so it feels like it’s giving you like a second layer of moisturized skin. it hasn’t been long enough to tell if it makes any big changes, but i do feel like it helps my under eye concealer apply a little smoother. smooth
