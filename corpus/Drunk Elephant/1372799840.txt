This was my first Drunk Elephant product. Honestly, I’m so glad I got the mini of this. I typically use micellar water products to wash my face without water at night time and on lazy mornings, and this just does not make my skin feel clean - and I don’t even wear make up. So it literally just does not make my skin feel clean when I’m using it on just my skin. In fact it dries up into my cotton round and also in my fingers causing me to use more product because otherwise I’m dragging my fingers or the round across my skin. Horrible!It also takes a lot of product to do your whole face. I am halfway through this bottle and I’ve had it for 2 weeks. I’m not impressed. It gets 2 stars for the packaging and for being fragrance free, I would never buy this again. I have to use a second micellar water afterwards or straight up just wash my face - what’s the point? High hopes, terrible micellar water
