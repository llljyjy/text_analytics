I was excited to try this product after hearing all the recommendations by beauty influencers. I had never had bad breakouts like this until I started using this product. It took me a few weeks to realize, but I’m sure this is the cause of my acne since it’s the only new skincare product I’ve tried recently. Pricey and not very moisturizing either. Broke-out!
