I have a hard time with trying new products because of how reactive and sensitive my skin is, but drunk elephant is one of the brands I really trust so when I saw they dropped this I picked it up. I had tried there other retinol cream and it is the only products from drunk elephant that didn’t work for me so I do want to note that I was a little nervous to start trying this after I bought it. I have no regrets at all. this is one of two products I’ve ever use where I actually see a difference when I wake up. It has really evened out my completion and I’ve noticed a big difference in the frequencies of break outs when I use this. The only issue I have is that my bottle came with the dropper yellowed and the product is super Yellow and I feel like that may be a mistake, however, it works and I have had a great experience with it. If you’re looking at trying one of drunk elephants retinol serums, and you have dry sensitive skin, try this one. best retinol for dry sensitive skin.
