I wanted to like this. It sank into my skin and made my skin soft. However next day after using it I started noticing tiny bumps on my forehead. Also got some acne on my forehead and cheek. I thought maybe it was from the last product I was using that I exchanged with this. So I gave my skin a break, let it clear up, then started using this again. Each day after that my skin started getting worse and worse. I have extremely smooth skin with no texture and this not only gave me a random zit here and there but tiny bumps on my forehead and texture on my skin. I read this oil also has comedogenic rating of 4! Returning this tomorrow. Caused tiny bumps on forehead and acne
