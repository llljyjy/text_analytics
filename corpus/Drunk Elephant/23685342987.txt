When I received this in one of my VoxBoxes, I was so excited. Drunk elephant is one of my favorite skincare brands. This new product feels so silky on my skin. I mixed it with my Polypeptide Moisturizer and it mixed very well. Iâ€™ve been using it in the evening after cleansing. I have not seen any change in the appearance of my skin, however I do enjoy how my skin texture is following use of the a-gloei. nan
