Received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for this review. The packaging was the coolest part - never seen a pump that also spins closed. Also the outer packaging was just cute. As for the actual cream, felt a bit thick to me and I wished it were scented. It did make my eyes feel more awake though nan
