The product itself is meh at best, not moisturizing and hard to massage into skin without drying out. The packaging is a disaster, it is all over super messy with a single pump. Two days later its just leaking all over. Tossed, never again. (To be clear, iâ€™ve used other drunk elephant serums and never had such an awful experience) Useless product in a garbage container
