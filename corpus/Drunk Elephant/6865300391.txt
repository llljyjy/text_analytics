I wanted to love this product. I am 55 and have dry skin.I wanted to try something new and decided to try this companies products. I also purchased their retinol oil.I used it for a month at night and did not see one change in my skin.  I am thinking this brand is more for the younger crowd that dont have hormonal skin from menapause.  Will go back to using my tried and true Paulas choice. Dont buy if you have older skin.
