I bought this product and right around the 60 day mark I noticed the pump was leaking and then a few days later the pump just broke off making it impossible to get the product out.  I was able to convince Sephora this wasn’t my fault (I was outside the 60 day window) and they sent a replacement.  Now the exact same thing has happened to the replacement after about 60 days of use.  I have used three of their other pump bottle products for years and this has never happened before.  Now it’s happened twice in a row with the same exact product and Sephora won’t replace it again.  If you search “leak” in the reviews you will see several saying the same thing, the packaging is faulty.   Only purchase if your ok with paying $80 for the ability to use about half the bottle.  I do like the product so it’s a real shame that the pump is continuously faulty. Faulty packaging, pump leaks and breaks
