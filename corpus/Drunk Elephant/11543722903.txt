I was a bit reluctant to buy this because it’s quite pricey, but I’m so glad I did! It just gives you the perfect, subtle bronzing glow. I also found it really evened out my skin tone!It doesn’t feel heavy, you can’t even tell you have it on. A little goes a long way when you mix with your moisturizer. Definitely a staple in my morning routine now!If you’re questioning it, this is your sign, YOU NEED THIS!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!
