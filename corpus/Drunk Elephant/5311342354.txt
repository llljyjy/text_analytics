so far I only used it once, was expecting to take it off after 10 minutes because I have very sensitive skin (and the reviews scared me a bit about how strong it is) but I ended up leaving on for 16 min but could have gone longer. when I first put it on I felt minimal tingling for the first 2 minutes then it went away. After taking it off I had minimal tingling but no redness or harsh burning. my skin felt soft but will give another review after using it for 2 weeks. Iâ€™m hoping this will clean my pores out and tighten skin. so far I gave it 4 star because of the price, $105 before tax is to much for such a small bottle *febreze bottle for size comparison* love drunk elephant products
