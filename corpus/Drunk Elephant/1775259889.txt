I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. The product claims “A rescue cream infused with six African oils and a plant ceramide complex for intense moisture and replenishing barrier support.“. It is no doubt moisturizing and feels great on the skin. The sample was too small to be able to adequately give the product a rating. nan
