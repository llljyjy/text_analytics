I really liked this moisturizer the first few days, but didn’t see much of a difference as I kept using it. If anything, my skin started to look dull after switching moisturizers. I have normal skin and I felt like this wasn’t moisturizing enough. Not saying it’s terrible, just feel as if you can find something much better at a lower price. Not worth the money
