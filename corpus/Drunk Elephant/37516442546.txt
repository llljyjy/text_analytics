I am someone with normal/dry skin type and I am not at all prone to have acne. Using this product for a week, I’ve notice my cheeks getting extremely dry and red. It’s pricey and not moisturizing at all. It might be because it’s currently winter and if that’s the case, only use this during summer. How to ruin ur perfect skin.
