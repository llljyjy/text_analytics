This was recommended to me by an acne-focused brand. I have tried a ton of daily SPFs, both high end and drug store, but none compare to this! I have acne prone skin and SPFs usually break me out, but this stuff never does! Its very lightweight and doesn’t have a weird SPF smell. Everyone’s skin will react differently, though, so get a sample at first. I will be repurchasing this! Perfect for Acne Prone Skin
