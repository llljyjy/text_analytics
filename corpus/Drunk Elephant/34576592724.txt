I have been using this cream for 4 months and my skin has never been better. It is so lightweight but also deeply nourishing and firming, making it perfect for all skin types. My skin was inflamed recently because of perioral dermatitis, and I applied this cream to the irritated area. After a couple or minutes, the redness and irritation ceased. If I could give this product more stars I would. amazing moisturizer!
