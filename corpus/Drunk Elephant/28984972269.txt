I have been using this since a few weeks and i left all my other oils tbhh! This works so good for the skin and doesnâ€™t irritate at all although my skin is sensitive to retinol but this product gave amazing results!! Absolutely recommend this for people trying to incorporate retinol in their skincare routine and looking something for hyperpigmentation. Obsessed!!!
