This eye cream is great to use in the am and pm. I always include an eye cream in my skincare routine. I was very excited to try Drunk Elephant’s latest Ceramighty AF eye cream. I live the packaging because it is classic and trendy. The formula is not sticky and not too thick. It’s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. The area around my eye looks smoother and even. Great everyday use!
