This is an excellent product for upping ur lactic acidosis game. I have used Good Genes forever and swear by it but this ups the percentage from 7% to 10 which Iâ€™m guessing my skin needed. There is plenty of peptides and squalene in here to moisturize and no irritate ur face, that is if u r used to using lactic acid which I love for my older skin bcuz it exfoliates and adds moisture. this product is a winner for my 58 year old face
