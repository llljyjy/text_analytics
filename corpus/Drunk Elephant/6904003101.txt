I did see a reduction in dullness and texture when using this product, but I did not find it particularly pleasant to use. As many reviewers pointed out, I found the serum to smell weird. I also am mixed on the packaging. I appreciate the packaging in the sense that it keeps the vitamin c fresh for longer; however, I found that since this is such a runny liquid formula, every time I tried to use it a bunch would splash into my hand. Sometimes I would lose the product and I’ve had it a few times where so much came out at once that it splashed in my eye. The serum works but I really did not enjoy using it. I’ve used other vitamin c’s that did the same thing but were more pleasant to use. nan
