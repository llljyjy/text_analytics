I get better results with gentler products this mask left me looking sunburned and I only left it on for less than 10 minutes. For $80 I’d expect more than that, I’m really glad I I did this at night I’m not sure what the results were supposed to be but when your bright red even if your skin is smoother or clearer it kind of cancels those benefits out. For the price tag HARD PASS I wouldn’t even use this for free ever again. Mad I wasted points but at least I didn’t buy the full size, I guess the rest will be going on my butt or feet lol Left me looking sunburned
