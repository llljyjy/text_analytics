The product itself is good. Works well as long as you are careful not to use it too often. I liked the sample I had of it so much that I dropped $80+ on this, but was very disappointed. The packaging is awful. Even when closed and standing upright, it leaks everywhere. For this price point, it’s unacceptable to deal with the product getting wasted like that due to a design flaw, not to mention the mess and sticky hands. I ended up returning it. There are also much cheaper exfoliants that will get the job done. I recommend The Ordinary’s lactic acid one. Packing sucks
