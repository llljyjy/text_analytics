I love using face oils and was so excited to try this out as the winter has been wreaking havoc on my skin. The oil did a great job moisturizing my skin and preventing the dry, chapped feeling I usually have on cold days, but if you arenâ€™t used to using a retinol regularly, I would suggest skipping a day between use. I had no issues with breakouts when starting this product, and I plan to incorporate into my regular skincare routine. The cute packaging is an added bonus! Great Retinol Oil
