The first time i tried this product years ago, my skin loved it. It must of been the perfect balance for my skin’s levels at the time (mid/late 20s), i am now in my early 30s and this moisturizer just doesn’t cut it. It still seems to strengthen my skin with the peptides, but my surface dryness isn’t improved after using this. It seems to just not sink in how i need it to (even after exfoliation). This could be a 5 star product for the right person, but i would give it 4 stars based on how overpriced i think it is compared to other products that have appeared on the market. My Skin Moved On
