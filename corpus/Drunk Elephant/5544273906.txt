I really love how it feels on my skin, it’s very gentle and can be mixed with others Drunk Elephant serums and moisturizers as well. If you are new to retinol I think this product is a great one for you to start introducing it to your skin with as it is formulated with only 0.5% retinol. I have a very dry skin and it makes it so smooth, hydrated and heated glow!  But don’t worry!! A-Gloei was created with all skin types in mind, so it will work for you even if you have oily skin! Highly recommend it! Love it!
