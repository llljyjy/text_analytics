I received a free sample in exchange for my sincerity review for the influenster. It’s the firts time i’ve used a retinol-based product, so I used it for a few weeks to bs able to write honestly. When I use the retinol for Drunk Elephant my skin feels brighter. I use it twice a day and when I wake up I have the feeling that my skein is soft as a feather and eith a sensational natural glow. Its approved by me and I would Like to try more of Drunk Elephant products. Thank you influenster, sephora and drunk elephant. Skin like a feather
