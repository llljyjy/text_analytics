I bought a sample of the this product, and it felt good on my skin for only a few minutes and then my skin started feeling like rubber, nice and moisturizing, I really wish my skin cooperated with this cream but it didn’t. Recommend this product to people with dry skin because it moisturizes your skin and makes it feel more alive. I won’t be repurchasing, i’ll find something else. Good for dry skin but not for me
