The packaging in this product is phenomenal. The top twists to dispense - so cool! In addition, the product works.  The glycolic is just enough to resurface the skin without drying it out or irritating the skin. I used with the whipped creme as the top barrier to let it really set into my skin overnight. Very happy with the look and feel of my skin. Iâ€™ll be back for more! Drunk Elephant passes this Breathalyzer!
