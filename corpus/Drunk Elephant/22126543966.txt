This is amazing! I’m very pale so I was worried it would make me look funny or orange but it just adds that little extra glow to your skin that looks super natural and sun kissed. I add two drops to my drunk elephant peptide cream and it goes on naturally. I find that my makeup blends better on my face and I don’t need to use foundation. Highly recommend this product! sun kissed without the sun
