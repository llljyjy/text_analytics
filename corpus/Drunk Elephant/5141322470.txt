I have been enjoying this product so far. It’s super hydrating and I feel like the percent of retinol is a great start for anybody in their 20s wanted to dabble in retinols. I found the results I’ve seen using this oil is that I haven’t had any blemish appear and I feel that my texture is disappearing. Great for Beginners
