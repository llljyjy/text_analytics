I received this product free from Influenster in exchange of my honest review. I’m super happy I received this product! It’s definitely moisturizing, especially because I have eczema. I get nervous trying new products because of my dry skin, but also excited. I’m glad I got the chance to use this because it has done wonders for my face. The texture is smooth and soft and a little goes a long way. I can’t wait to purchase this. I highly recommend this product. Super hydrating; soft skin
