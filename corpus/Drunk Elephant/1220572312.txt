I received this as a sample a few years back with the Bday gift option.  I have purchased it e every few months since. It helps with moisturizing my skin and feels great, not too greasy.  IMO it makes my skin look better. Itâ€™s a little pricey but worth it IMO. A must in my skincare regimen. Love this stuff!
