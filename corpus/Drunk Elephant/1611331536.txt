The Slaai Butter is a pretty decent cleansing balm. It does take a bit of massaging to really melt your make up though. I use this as the first step in a double cleanse but I definitely would not use this as a solo cleanser. It doesn’t feel as if it rinses clean to me. It’s fine, however, if you are double cleansing. I do really like the bamboo charcoal powder. It does not take much. Just a little sprinkle and it really does a nice job of exfoliating. I would say if you’re going to get this then use it as the first step in a double cleanse and you’ll be fine. Pretty good cleansing balm
