Terrible packaging, especially considering the price. The smell is tolerable but not great, as others have pointed out. I could get past the smell if it didnâ€™t feel like putting a thin layer of plastic on my skin. It feels caustic and overly chemical (in a bad way). On top of that my skin is unchanged after using this for months. If this were $20 I would be willing to let it slide, but for the price this is a rip off. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY
