my skin has no particular concerns. but when a friend gave this to me as an x mas present, I decided to try it. well, it stung horribly. I know that that’s normal, and I kept it on for half the recommended time as a result. I tried this a few times over a few weeks, and my skin keeps getting worse. dry and textured. I’m going to stop using this and hope my skin goes back to normal. nan
