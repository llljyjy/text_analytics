This is my favorite lip balm. Although a bit pricey, this is the only one that works for my chronically dry lips. Instead of just sitting on top or rehydrating my dry lip skin, it actually exfoliates and allows the dry skin to flake off and reveals smooth, new skin underneath. I apply it nightly and wake up to smooth lips! The best lip balm!
