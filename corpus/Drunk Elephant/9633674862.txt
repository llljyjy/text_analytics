This moisturizer isn’t bad but it isn’t holy grail either. It is INSANELY overpriced for what seems to be a mid-tier moisturizer. I used this for several months wanting to love it because I paid so much for it but it didn’t do anything special. It moisturized my face but I’ve had other moisturizers that did way more for way less money. Not to mention that this moisturizer would give me tiny pimples from time to time. I would pass on this one if you have acne-prone skin or very flaky dry skin. Moving on from this
