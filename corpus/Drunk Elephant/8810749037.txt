I am usually not a huge fan of oil-based retinol, and I generally prefer cream-based ones, however I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I will admit I do not have a lot of experience with drunk elephant products, but I have heard of their reputation. This product definitely lived up to the company’s reputation. The smell of the product wasn’t off-putting, and a little bit of product goes a long way with this one. I would recommend this to others who are concerned with fine lines and wrinkles. Excellent Retinol Product
