Unfortunately I didn’t really enjoy this product. I’m relatively new to retinol and have sensitive skin so I was excited to try this product out. It’s marketed as a gentle retinol and comes as an oil. I mixed about 2 drops into my moisturizer to reduce irritation but still experienced a bit of irritation when I first started using the product. After about a week I didn’t get any irritation anymore but even after using for about 4 weeks I havent seen any brightening effects. The oil has a natural scent that I don’t really like unfortunately. I may have to ramp up my usage to 3-4 times a week but I’ve seen brightening effects with other brands’ retinol using them 2-3 times a week. nan
