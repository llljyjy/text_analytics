The serum itself is not bad, but the bottle design is horrible. I’m struggling with the issues most people are having with the top part getting jammed or coming off. Quite a lot of the product goes to waste when I try to fix the top by aggressively shoving it back in... I’m truly baffled at the poor quality of the bottle for something at this price range, it has clouded my judgement on the serum itself. Not sure if I want to purchase this one again unless I see a change in the bottle design. Horrible Bottle Design
