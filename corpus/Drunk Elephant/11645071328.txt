What I like about this product is that itâ€™s very moisturizing perfect for those who have dry skin. A good thing is that it is 100% free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. Including Vegan and cruelty-free perfect for those who looks for these type of ingredients. It definitely makes my skin moisturizing through the whole day. Overall I recommend this product. nan
