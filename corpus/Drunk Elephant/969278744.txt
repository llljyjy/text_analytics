This is a lush moisturizer! I’ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin is so much better. I’ve been using this at night. It pairs really well with my Retin-A. I don’t wake up with any dry patches like I normally did before. This is a great creme. I do think I would benefit even more in the fall/winter. It is expensive though. It depends if you want to spend this much on a rich creme. You do get results though nan
