I really wanted to like this product. It’s one of the very first products I tried from drunk elephant because this brand is just praised on but this is not it. My face never felt clean after using. I NEEDED to wash off with cleanser. It left a residue behind and the smell is slightly odd I didn’t like either. I love the spatula though it’s amazing how it attaches to the top and the bottle of volcanic beads I thought was a great add on. I wish I could get my money back but ohh well. Won’t be buying again Nope
