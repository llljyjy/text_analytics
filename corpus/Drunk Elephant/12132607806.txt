I added this product into my skincare routine for a week before reviewing, using it once in the morning & once at night. I see a very subtle difference, but not enough to make me purchase it. It’s kind of thick and makes around my eyes a little oily. Also really burnt my eyes after applying. I do see a tiny bit of a difference in the elasticityaround my eyes and it has brightened up my dark circles a bit, but nothing drastic. It’s alright
