I’ve honestly been surprised at how much I’ve enjoyed this. Drunk Elephant’s retinol cream is very concentrated and I’ve had issues with it in the past, so I was skeptical trying this oil. It’s actually very mild, has a lovely texture, and I have noticed a distinct brightening effect without peeling or major sensitivity like I sometimes expect from retinol. I will definitely continue to use this! nan
