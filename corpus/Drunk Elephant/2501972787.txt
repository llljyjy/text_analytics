I have combination acne prone skin that tends toward oily, especially on my T-zone. This gel cleanser foams up nicely and it doesn’t run into and sting the eyes. It does what it says in that it thoroughly removes impurities and build up from the day, but just don’t expect it to be your every time every day cleanser. They even recommend not using a cleanser in the AM if you used this in the PM so as to not strip your barrier and make your skin overly dry (but I always cleanse both AM and PM due to my acne prone skin). My routine right now is to use Cetaphil or ProDerm gentle cleanser in the am and apply serums and moisturizing sunscreen. Then I use this in the PM with my Foreo Luna. If it’s been a really long day or I know my face is really dirty from sweat or I’ve actually worn makeup for once, I’ll double cleanse with DHC oil cleanser in the evening to loosen and push out dirt from clogged pores before using this. Overall, this is my second mini and I’m very happy having this in my cleanser rotation. It’s always a good idea to have a thorough cleanser in the mix. great for oily/acne-prone skin used in rotation
