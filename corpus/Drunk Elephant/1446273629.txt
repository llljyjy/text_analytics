I bought this eye cream as I was hunting for the perfect eye cream. I have eczema/dermatitis on my eyelids that makes it pink, raw, scaly and itchy. I tried another brand from Sephora and it wasnâ€™t as hydrating so I gave this a try and within days my eye was hydrated. No more redness and everything felt so much better. I hands down recommend it to anyone who needs extra hydration for your eyes. Need hydration for your eyes
