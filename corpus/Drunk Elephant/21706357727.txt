First of all, I’m a huge Drunk Elephant fan and loyal customer, this brand NEVER disappoints. The product I was gifted is an oil-serum retinol. I’ve been using this oil serum for about 3 weeks now every night on its own than an oil free moisturizer afterwards, and boy has my skin changed in the best way possible! I have acne prone, oily, discoloration, along with acne scarring. To be honest I was very hesitant to use this oil when I first recieved it because I’m very oily to begin with and don’t use oils too often, but boy was I wrong. This beautiful oil-serum literally melts right into your skin within minutes! Not to mention has given me such a beautiful glow that lasts all day. It did not irritate my skin at all whatsoever either. It has dramatically improved my scarring and discoloration! I’m so happy to have been gifted this because my skin was in such a horrible place 3 weeks ago and now I’ve never been so confident without makeup! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐#gloeidays #complimentary @drunkelephant @Influenster Drunk Elephant never disappoints!!
