I am surprised this product doesn’t have a higher rating. I find it delivers all it promises. Any mineral sunscreen is going to feel thicker than chemical sunscreens, but for a mineral sunscreen, I find this to be lightweight. It does provide a dewy finish, consistent with the look most of DE’s other products give my skin. I have not had any issues with pilling. I wear my other DE products underneath this, and it layers beautifully. nan
