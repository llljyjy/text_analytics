I found this to be the tiniest bit drying, but it gently cleared my skin up during a break out. I was a little skeptical of paying so much for such a small bar, but the smallest bit goes a long way and this ended up being more cost-effective than the usual gel cleanser that I would buy. Added bonus: itâ€™s easier to travel with than a giant bottle! nan
