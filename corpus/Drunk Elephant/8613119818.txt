Itâ€™s a very rich cream, I applied it after the Drunk elephant night serum and the texture is heavy for everyday use. It would be nice to use it occasionally when skin needs hydration, but it clogged my pores when I used it 2 days in a row. I think I will like using this cream in winter more. Heavy texture
