I have been using the A-Gloei for almost a month now. I have been using it almost daily, once in the morning and evening. I use the A-Gloei after I have toned and before I moisturize because I want to sandwich it in. Overall it is a gentle retinol and great for those with sensitive skin, new to retinol or have dry skin. This keeps my skin hydrated. I feel like my pores look smaller. Gentle retinol that hydrates dry skin
