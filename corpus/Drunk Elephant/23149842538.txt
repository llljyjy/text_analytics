I am very thankful that I was able to try this retinol oil thanks to Influenster, Sephora, and Drunk Elephant. I absolutely love this oil it’s not too greasy, it smooths out my skin, it gives my skin a nice health glow and provides excellent hydration. I think this is a great oil if you want to start incorporating retinol in your skincare routine. A-Gloei ✨
