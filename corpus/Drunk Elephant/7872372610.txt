I love the texture of this . It doesn’t make add to my oily tone, but it adds the right amount of moisture to my cheeks. The only thing I have bad to say is the bumps that I developed over time on my forehead . They do not have anything in them ,but they are hard/itchy like and I found out that it was not a typical acne, but a type of fungal acne that a typical acne treatment will not treat. Not sure what ingredient that causes this, but when I quit using this they went away and then I purchased again not long ago and they came back. I used this for months so I had plenty of time to experiment and see . I so wish that wasn’t an issue because otherwise it’s so perfect for me . Mad because I haven’t found anything like it that doesn’t add to my oily ness, but also perfect for dry areas. hard bumps on forehead
