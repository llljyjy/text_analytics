I received this product to test and I LOVE IT! I did not use a retinol before but I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It does feel a little oily when you put it on but I have normal combination skin and it doesnâ€™t feel that way the whole day. My skin is looking better than it ever has with this retinol! Love it!
