I love love LOVE this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel hydrated immediately. It goes on smooth, doesn’t feel oily at all. It doesn’t have a very strong smell, which I also love. Most moisturizers I’ve tried make my skin feel oily as the day goes on, this one didn’t. I usually end up with dry spots on my face like my nose that kind of peels a little, but when I used this my skin didn’t feel dry anywhere. I have combination skin, so moisturizers are always hit or miss. I would definitely recommend this one! Love love love
