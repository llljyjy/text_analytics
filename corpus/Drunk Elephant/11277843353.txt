My skin is so dry that I usually avoid products that claim they are “for all skin types“, especially in the winter. I tried this product out because it looked like a good size and claims it’s an intensely hydrating serum, but it’s incredibly light weight to the point where it seems to soak up into my skin but leaves it matte and dry. My goal is the dewy look, so this serum didn’t give me the desired effect. Didn’t work for me but I can see someone with oily skin really liking this product for the reasons I don’t. I’ve tried other Drunk Elephant products and I can conclude they are not for dry skin people looking to achieve a dewy glow. Meh for dry skin....
