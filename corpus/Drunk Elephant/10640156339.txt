I was gifted this product from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. I am a Drunk Elephant lover so when I heard I was receiving this product, I was super excited. I love the consistency of this eye cream. It reminds me a lot of the Lala Retro Whipped Cream from DE. It leaves my eye area with a lovely layer of hydration and moisture. It contains ceramides and plant oils, like oat kernel oil and vitamin F to soothe skin and improve texture. Perfect for before bed or daytime. I haven’t tried it under makeup so can’t speak to that. Although it is pricey, a little goes a long way so I think it’s worth it. Also, because its from Drunk Elephant, it’s free of silicones, parabens and formaldehyde. I love it and would def recommend. nan
