Every single Drunk Elephant product has given me terrible acne consisting of horrible and painful cystic pimples. I didn’t think that this would do the same for my skin, but it unfortunately did. Even the smallest amount broke my entire face out. I’d recommend just using a tinted sunscreen/moisturizer or a normal bronzer because the color of this wasn’t even that good either. Broke me out :(
