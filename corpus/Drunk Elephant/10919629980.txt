Perfect retinol product, not too harsh and leaving the skin glowing and moisturized. Improves my skin texture and brings out the glow within a few hours of application. I use it as night as my last skin care step following the serum/moisturizer application. No scent, very quickly absorbs into the skin, no irritation due to the low levels of retinol. A perfect way to build you tolerance to retinol products with 0.5% retinol content. Would recommend to anyone, although a bit pricey but totally worth it! Ideal intro to retinol
