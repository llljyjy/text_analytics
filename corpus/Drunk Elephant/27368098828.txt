I received this from influenster for free to give an honest review. It was a bit heavy feeling for my liking. It took a little to soak into the skin. It also made me break out for a little bit, but as I kept using it my skin got used to it. I did notice it did help to smooth overtime. And some of my darker spots from blemishes got lighter. So overall, I think itâ€™s a nice product and works. If you have really oily skin like me, you might not like the feeling much at all though. Nice product
