So , like the headline says , this product is amazing . I am 40. And for some reason my skin decides it still wants to break out . This oil helps with the Hyper pigmentation of the blemishes afterwards. I have combination skin and very dry patches on my cheeks. The oil is amazing at keeping my face looking and feeling soft and supple all day. I mainly use it in the morning. And occasionally incorporated into my nighttime routine. But I have definitely seen a difference in my skin and fine line appearance . A little goes a long way . This is definitely worth the investment of adding to your beauty routine . Drunk Elephant did not play! Amazing
