This is a perfectly good face oil. It is nourishing and great for dry skin. That said there was nothing special about it that made it better than other oils. I have used others that work better for similar price points, or better for less. Thereâ€™s truly nothing wrong with it at all as a product, but there is better out there, and as such will not be making it back into my cart. nan
