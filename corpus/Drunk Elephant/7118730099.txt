This is pretty expensive, but I took a chance, and I’m so glad I did. I started getting hormonal acne and scarring, so I bought this on a whim. The next day, I woke up with clearer, glowing, softer skin like a baby. It’s been almost a month and my skin has never looked better. It saved me! My scars are way lighter, skin glowing, makeup applied better, and pores are a little smaller. My forehead wrinkle is smoothing out too!! (I’m 27 for reference) I’ve seen a huge difference in my skin and I highly recommend for my sensitive skin acne girls, especially POC. SO worth the price. I will be buying again. I break out from everything. So happy I finally found a night product that works so well and doesn’t break me out. Start by using every other day first! Best for acne/texture/dark skin
