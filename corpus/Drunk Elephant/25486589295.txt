I know some vitamin C serums can smell bad but this one was the worst I’ve used. My hands smell awful throughout the day even after washing them multiple times. Also for a serum, this can out really watery and then leaves your skin feeling really sticky. First time using Drunk Elephant and I won’t be trying other products. I liked mixing the serum yourself but this wasn’t for me. There are better Vitamin C serums out there
