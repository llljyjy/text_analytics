Serious glow!! This oil is my new favorite skincare staple! I mix 2-3 drops with my moisturizer a few nights a week and wake up looking so dewy and refined. My only wish is that it would help to speed up the healing of my acne faster, but a higher dosage of retinol may be needed for that.. Overall I love the hydration and glow this product gives me! Would definitely recommend. GLOWING!
