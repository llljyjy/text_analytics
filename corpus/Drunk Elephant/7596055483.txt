I received this product as a gift for my honest review. This lotion was nice, but not that exciting. It had a medium watery texture & left my face a bit sticky for awhile. Truly it just felt like it did nothing. No tingling or fresh feeling. No hydration or dryness. No my favorite product. An okay moisturizer
