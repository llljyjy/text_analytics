I’ve heard many good things about DE, so I decided to try one of their most mild formulations with this cleanser. The cleansing aspect of it is great! It leaves no film on the skin and doesn’t dehydrate at all. The only downside or negative I see about it is I find the scent to be strange. It smells like chemicals and it smells a bit too sour for me. Also, please make sure it goes nowhere near your eyes! I scrubbed over my eyebrow and when I rinsed, some of the water got into my eye and it was horribly painful for about twenty minutes. Overall, I would buy it again despite its cons. Decent cleanser, but smell is a little strange!
