I hate to say that I really like this lip balm. I think that the price is a bit much for the amount of product and I don’t like the shape of the tube. But the product itself works really well and has not cause me any issues (not sure what I’m allergic to but other chapsticks have cause my lips to crack/peel/bleed). Minus one star for the price and the tube shape but overall a very good product. nan
