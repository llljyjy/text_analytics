This product was great! It made my skin glow and kept it clear. I was nervous it would dry me out, but it definitely didn’t. The only thing I didn’t love when I used this product is that it would sometimes feel like my skin would rub off when using it. I’m not sure if that’s because I was using other face product below it. Every time I use it my skin feels like it’s glowing. I got this as a promotional item through Influenster and I plan to continue it as part of my skin product routine!! Great product, made me skin glow!!
