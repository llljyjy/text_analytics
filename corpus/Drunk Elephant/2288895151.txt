I was really excited to try out this product. I have been using a similar product that is more expensive so I was hoping this worked and it partially did. I have sentive skin so I had to start every other night in the beginning but eventually my skin was ready for every evening. I also learned that when I put the produce between my eyebrows or on my nose I would have a a few blemishes pop up. Other than that the texture of my skin was extremely smooth and it definitely gave me a glow. Sensitive Skin Recommendation
