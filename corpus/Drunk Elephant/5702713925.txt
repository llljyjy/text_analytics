Would give 5 stars, it helps heal my skin when I pick at my breakouts. It definitely works and moisturizes properly. However, I cannot pay this amount of money for a moisturizer anymore, the bottle is big but vs the amount of product you get, its just not worth it unless money is not an issue. Good stuff but expensive and bottle isnt full
