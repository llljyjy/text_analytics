I like leave on masks because you don’t need to worry about washing it off your face within a certain time. However, leave on masks can tend to not absorb well into your skin. Making sure your skin is prepped for the product to properly absorb is important. While you put this product on last, you need to be mindful of what you’re putting on before to ensure it will work to the best of its ability.I don’t use my BHA/AHA toning solution before this product and make sure to emulsify the product in my hands well before applying. I haven’t used this product long enough to notice a true difference (three weeks is the suggested time period), however, I do notice immediately after use that my skin is brighter and the texture is smoother. A good addition to my routine
