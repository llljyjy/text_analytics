*I received both of these products kindly from Influenster and Drunk Elephant complimentary in exchange for honest review. •no scent•don’t need a lot (which is great since this is only a small sample) because it has a super creamy and thick consistency •didn’t get the best impression for this product because this was only a tiny sample and I like to try out skincare products for at least a month before forming an opinion •i would say it’s pretty moisturizing nan
