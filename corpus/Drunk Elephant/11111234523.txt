I was skeptical about this product as a user of Apassioni and I am very impressed with this retinol. My dry skin is typically full in the winter and this formula has got me Agloei(ing). I incorporated this into my routine without expecting to see results and am truly shocked at the results this product delivers. I’ve tried most Drunk Elephant products and have not repeat purchased any of them (except Salaai) but this might be their best yet! If you’re kicking around purchasing this or incorporating retinol give this a shot. Impressive formula
