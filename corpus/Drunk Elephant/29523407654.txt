I love the actual product itself, I have been able to tell a difference in the way my skin looks (brighter and more clear) since I started using it. When I first initially started using this the smell was very odd to me but since I’ve been using for a couple months now I do not notice a smell when putting on my face. I saw the reviews saying people were having trouble with the actual packaging I am very careful with all my stuff so I thought it possibly could be the way people were handling the bottle. But one morning I went to use this and the bottle wouldn’t pump at all. I had to put the product completely out of the actual bottle and now just have the inside part. Lucky the pump has still been working but still frustrating to pay so much for a product and have the bottle break not ever halfway through the product. I hope they fix the packaging since I love the product so much. Faulty Packaging
