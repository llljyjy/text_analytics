The price tag is big, but so worth it. After I use this treatment my face feels so velvety soft and clear. It’s literally like getting a $200 facial every time. I notice blackheads on my nose surface after the treatment, I typically follow with the LANBENA plants pore strips mask on only the nose to clear those out. Then I follow with Marula Oil. (I get mine from Trader Joe’s instead of the DE) I am addicted!
