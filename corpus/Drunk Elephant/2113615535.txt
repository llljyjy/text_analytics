This used to be my favorite...then they changed the formula. I have been through about no joke, at least 20 containers of this stuff. I had backups for a while that I had purchased and finally ran out. I had heard about them changing the formula to replace something in it a little while back and I was like ok they just replaced an ingredient - shouldn’t be that big of a change, right? Wrong. this isn’t the same. it doesnt do the same job and actually started to irritate my skin a bit and not be as hydrating so im now finding myself in need of a replacement of something I’ve used since literally the week it came out which is such a bummer. I used to recommend this to everyone as it didn’t interrupt my foundation but was so soothing to my skin and now I feel left without it. not what it used to be
