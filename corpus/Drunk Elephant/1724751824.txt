I have an oily T zone and this made my face look greasy all over immediately once I put it on.  It also didnâ€™t really blend into my skin, so the tint was kind of patchy. My face felt like it has heavy makeup on it by the end of the day. I ended up returning it and going back to Alastin tinted sunscreen. nan
