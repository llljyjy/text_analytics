I have been using this moisturizer for months. I have dry skin, and this is the only moisturizer I have tried that I can see working for both people with oily or dry skin. It is so deeply moisturizing instantly, but unlike many other moisturizers like that, this moisture stays. I wake up in the morning and my skin is plump and refreshed. If I want extra moisture or if my skin barrier is compromised, I throw on some type of ceramide based moisturizer to really lock in that moisture. Great for Oily and Dry Skin
