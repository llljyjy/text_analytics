I have sensitive acne-prone skin and have used the DE marula oil for 5 years - it is a HG item for me. I worried this item would break me out bc of the soybean oil which is why I held off on it - but it did not. Instead of irritating my skin like most retinols, this actually calmed it down! I can tell a positive difference in my skin in the mornings. I also have used A-Passioni retinol in the past, but it caused irriation so I would gradually stop using it despite the antiaging benefits. This gives me the retinol benefits at a level my skin can tolerate as a sensitive person -- and because it’s so gentle I can use it every day <3 I don’t like fussy routines, so being able to use it everyday I love. It’s an absolutely incredible product, I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to try it!!! Incredible
