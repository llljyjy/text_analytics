I got this as a sample in the Sephora monthly subscription! And a tiny amount went a long way!!! yes it’s pricey.. but since u only need a small amount it lasts u a good amount of time mine lasted me 4 months! I love it because it’s so moisturizing but also doesn’t leave your face greasy. Plus I love the little elephant form that comes out when you pump it! I’m on my way to purchasing my third bottle. I’ve tried so many other moisturizers and by far this is my ultimate favorite! might be pricey, but good things aren’t cheap lol
