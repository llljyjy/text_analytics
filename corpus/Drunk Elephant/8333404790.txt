Honestly it’s funny reading those reviews complaining about mixing the product together, it doesn’t even take 2 minutes to mix it, second complain from reviews is about stickiness, you only need one pump, and I believe you should always mix it with another Drunk Elephant moisturizer or oil since it’s a serum to avoid the stickiness. I don’t mind the smell either because I feel more confident that it has no added chemicals to it to make it smell good. I don’t know what people are complaining about!!
