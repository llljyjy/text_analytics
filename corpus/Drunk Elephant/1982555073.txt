I’m absolutely in love! This oil does exactly what it says and gives you glowing, beautiful skin. While I haven’t seen any reduction in fine lines yet as it’s only been a couple weeks, I am very hopeful. My one complaint with this is the price. There are other retinols that do the same thing at a more affordable price with the same % of retinal might I add. This is a wonderful oil though and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Absolutely Lovely!
