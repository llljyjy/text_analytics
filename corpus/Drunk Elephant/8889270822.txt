Okay, so I love the formula and it did make my skin feel clean. However this product didn’t really match my skin type and it caused me to breakout pretty badly. I have tried drunk elephant in the past and it did the same thing. - it sucks, because I LOVE their products :( my skin just doesn’t feel the way I do mentally haha. I’m kinda sad
