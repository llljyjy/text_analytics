I actually really like this and have been enjoying using it. I have found it to be more gentle in comparison to the a-passioni which is where I think this just shines. This is the perfect starter retinol in my opinion. I have found my favorite way of using this is to mix this in with my moisturizer. It does layer very nicely with other serums but not sure if I would recommend doing that especially depending on the other active ingredients. A great place to start
