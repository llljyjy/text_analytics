I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review of the product. Even though this was a sample container, I got several uses and I was shocked at how well it moisturized my skin. I typically have very dry skin that becomes oily throughout the day but this did not add any additional oils to my face. It was a light creamy product without the overpowering scent that most moisturizers have.  I loved this product so much that I ended up going to my local Sephora and purchased. nan
