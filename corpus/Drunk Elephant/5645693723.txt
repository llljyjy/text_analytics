Heard a lot about the benefits of vitamin c serums but was never able to find one that worked well with my skin. This one didn’t break me out, and it did help even out my skin tone and fade a few dark spots leftover from a previous breakout. But I noticed that my skin was considerably less plump and dewy during the day after applying this serum and after two weeks of using, noticed increased sensitivity around my nasolabial folds which seemed deepened. I was really careful about applying sunscreen and a thick moisturizer after using this product, so I’m doing everything right. I have no wrinkles and would like to keep it this way, so I’m going to stop using this product and vitamin C in general. I’ll look for something else to help with fading my dark spots. Does what it says but use with caution
