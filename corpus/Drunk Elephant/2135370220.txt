The product itself is fine. I wouldn’t say I saw any noticeable change compared to my normal, Biossance, eye cream. I just can’t stand how wasteful the packaging is! There is way too much plastic and they don’t offer a refill option. I also go through it in nearly half the time I go through the same amount (15 mL) of Biossance. I think it has to do with the pump dispensing too much product and not being able to put the excess back in the container. I would consider buying it again if they completely changed the packaging. Too wasteful to be worth it
