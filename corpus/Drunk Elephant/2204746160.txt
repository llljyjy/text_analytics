I held off on buying this for the price as long as I could but stayed missing my sample. I am obsessed with the way this feels. I don’t know if it’s preventing aging but this feels extremely hydrating. Because it’s free of the harsh chemicals and no fragrance, I use this after exfoliating/peels and it feels amazing. No burning. Literally whipping cream
