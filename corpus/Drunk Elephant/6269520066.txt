I received the #ceramighty #mightyeyes #complimentary from @drunkelephant and @Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  One pump is sufficient eye balm for both orbital eye area.  The Ceramighty AF Eye Balm Formula appears to be thick but it applies on smoothly leaving your eye are deeply hydrated. Iâ€™ve utilized twice per day, during the am and pm. My under eye puffiness has diminished. The only down side is that if the product gets in your eye it stings. I recommend not putting the eye balm too close to your eyes.  Overall I give the product a 3.5 out of 5 stars because it did make the skin on and around my under eyes/eyelids feel soft and hydrated. Puffiness begone
