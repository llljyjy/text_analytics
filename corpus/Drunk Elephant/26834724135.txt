I got a facial from the Sephora skin expert. I told her all about my concerns; I have started to develop smile lines and wrinkles. I’m 26 years old. She told me about this cream and I started using it daily. It’s light weight, absorbs easily into the skin (no white caste), and has improved my skin. I’m happy I took a chance on this product.
