I received the complimentary Ceramighty AF eye cream by drunk elephant/ Influenster review for my honest opinion.￼￼ I have been using the cream for about five weeks and I love the way my under eye feel. My eyelids feel smoother and it’s easier to apply concealer without creasing, and eyeshadow has been that easier to apply as well with a flawless finish. I have definitely noticed that my skin feels more plump especially the under eyes. I love all ingredients. The packaging was incredible and different. I love the twist off cap makes it feel unique and innovative. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for any clean skin care. Must have for under eyes and much more
