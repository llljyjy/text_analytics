I received this product for free, in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I really enjoy it—but there’s a learning curve. This is definitely more of a balm and less of a moisturizer due to the ceramide content and heavy texture so it works well as a barrier cream. I discovered very quickly that it worked best at night and I really liked it over a thinner eye serum. It didn’t work well for me during the day because it was really evident under makeup.  I think it’ll work really well during colder months or for those with dryer, more delicate eyes. Also, the packaging is pretty—it twists up to open, so it’s impossible to lose the lid. :) Great night time eye cream
