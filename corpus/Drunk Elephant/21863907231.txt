It’s like a DIY project to assemble the pieces together but nothing too challenging. It’s thick and leaves a strong smell, though this did not bother me as I grew used to it. It does get everywhere as the pump is not ideal for this type of serum and will dry sticky around the opening. If these don’t bother you though, it’s wonderful and does the job!
