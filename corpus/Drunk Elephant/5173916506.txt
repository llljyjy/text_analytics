I wanted to love this product but after a few days of using it, I noticed my skin was very dry.  It stung when I first apply it, but I thought that’s normal.  It wasn’t until a few days later I noticed flaky skin and it’s spring time so there is no reason for my skin to be dry.  I stop using this product and my skin went back to being bright and not flaky.  Back to looking for a new brand, very disappointed. Dried out my skin
