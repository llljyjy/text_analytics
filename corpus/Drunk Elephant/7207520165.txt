I tried the mini size when it first came out and came in a tube. I thought the consistency was too thick for a serum, it felt more like a moisturizer. I think people with dryer skin would like the consistency. I didn’t feel like I saw any progress with my acne scarring compared to a brightening serum.I feel like this was a pass for me, I’m not gonna buy again. Not bad but not good either. But I still would be willing to try the new DE retinol oil. I think people with dryer skin would appreciate this product more than I do (I have oily-normal skin) Decent
