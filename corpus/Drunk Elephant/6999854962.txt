This product is so expensive, but pretty worth it imo. It helped clear these little whitehead breakouts I get and keep them a bay. I only use it every second to third day and mix it with my moisturizer and that works for me and the bottle has lasted me about 8 months and I’m still not at the bottom ! I didn’t get the irritation or purging that other people experienced, but definitely saw results pretty quickly :) nan
