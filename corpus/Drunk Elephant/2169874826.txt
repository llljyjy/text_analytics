This love story is early in the making, and the honeymoon isn’t over yet, but so far, this cleanser is a keeper! My skin is super-finicky and has ultra-high standards when it comes to finding compatible partners - like cleansers that rinse clean without making my face red, exfoliating toners and serums that don’t make my pigmentation worse, and moisturizers that don’t clog my pores. You could say my skin is a total diva! I took a sample of this cleanser cabin-camping with me for a week, and WOW, people! This little elephant delivers! My previously rashy skin with T-Zone breakouts is now so smooth and supple that I’ve been leaving my house without makeup. It’s the only thing I changed about my daily skincare routine, and it’s paying off in spades! I start my routine by removing SPF and makeup with micellar water, followed by this cleanser. Then I use Paula’s Choice Niacinamide Booster (green + white bottle), La Roche Posay Tolerene Fluid, and ZO SPF Primer. This cleanser is key! I love that this line carries small, experience sizes before committing. I also love that they help elephants! Hardcore Love!
