I received this product free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. I loved this eye cream so much! I used it for a month and noticed it helped a lot with my dark under eyes and wasn’t irritating at all. The texture is perfect and no scent! My only complain would be the pump. I don’t like that it gets clogged when you close it and you have to pump out the hard stuff. I’d purchase with my own money. Perfect under eye cream!
