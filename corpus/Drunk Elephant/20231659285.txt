I received this product in exchange of honest review. I’ve never tried drunk elephant cosmetics and was very excited to test it because I heard tons of positive reviews. So first of all I really like the package. It makes you feel there is a lot of product inside, but I love this twist motion anyway. Cream texture is buttery thick, but doesn’t make you feel oily. It absorbs pretty quickly. I noticed it helps to reduce minor wrinkles around my eyes, but it’s cosmetic effect because after I washed my face all wrinkles become visible again.
