I’ve been using this in my nightly skin care routine for almost 3 weeks now and I can tell an improvement. My skin appears brighter, smoother, and less splotchy. It feels good on my skin and isn’t drying or pore clogging. I do use moisturizer over it just because it does make my skin feel a bit tight. Bright and bouncy!
