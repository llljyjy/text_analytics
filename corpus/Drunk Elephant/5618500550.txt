I received this free from Influenster to try for a honest review. This stuff is so good! I always slack on my skin care, but I really was excited to try this, so I stayed with it. I have noticed my texture has decreased some since using it. My overall skin looks more glowy and healthy. It’s a light weight cream, with no scent. The packaging is so cute, but all of drunk elephant’s products are cute. I’m excited to keep using this and see the benefits. SO good
