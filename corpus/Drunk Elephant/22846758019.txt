I received this product for free from drunk elephant and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. After a few weeks of use, I went to review and rate this product. I had planned on a three star rating because I didn’t think it did anything. But looking at the side by side photos, I can definitely tell that my eyes look smoother and more awake. I don’t have the deepest under eye lines but what I do have seems to have been softened. I really enjoy this eye cream but I don’t know if I can get behind the $60 price tag.   #ceramighty #mightyeyes #complimentary @drunkelephant @Influenster Beautiful product but worth the money?
