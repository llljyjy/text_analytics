Does Drubk Elephant make anything that doesn’t work? I have a combination skin type and this oil definitely is a game changer. It’s very lightweight, it penetrates great on skin and doesn’t leave my t-zone area greasy at all unlike the other brands I have tried. It’s quite expensive but it definitely works for me. Would love to try all their products! Holy Grail Face Oil!!!
