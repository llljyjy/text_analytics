I started using it almost consistently day and night as soon as I opened the box. Which got here one day after receiving the email to inform me of the voxbox! I know it sounds crazy, but I immediately noticed improvements with my skin. You could tell just by looking, but even the texture felt much smoother and it has been brightening my whole face up in this cold Christmas weather. I don’t know if I’ve ever said this, but I’ve certainly (Jk) never meant it when I say I would repurchase the product(s) I received to review. With this though, I would definitely search for a cheaper dupe lol. It really is great and I also love the component and the pump. Love at first (or third) pump
