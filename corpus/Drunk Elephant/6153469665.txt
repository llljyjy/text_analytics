I almost wish I never tried this so I wouldn’t have a new staple I’d have to repurchase. The glow this gives !!! I mix it with my moisturizer every morning and I don’t know if I will ever stop. You can control how “tan” it makes you by adding more or less product. I have an oily T-zone and dry everywhere else, so this is a perfect combo with my matte finish moisturizer (I use CeraVe w/ spf - matte finish). This product is making me super into using skincare as makeup. Blends like a dream. I love it so much. too good.
