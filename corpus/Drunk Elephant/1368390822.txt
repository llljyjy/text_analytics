LOVE this sunscreen! The texture is amazing. I can apply and reapply multiple times throughout the day (as you should!) without any pilling or issues. I haven’t tried it under makeup but with the tint I don’t think you need any additional makeup. It gives a great glow.I have white skin that’s kind of a light to medium tone. I love the color! Most other mineral sunscreens (even tinted one) have left a white cast on me and this does not. It also does not break me out and I have acne prone skin. I could see how this might not work on really fair skin or dark skin. For really fair skin I think the sheer would be fine. It leaves a very slight white cast on me but still MUCH better than other “sheer” mineral sunscreens. Great texture and color!!!!
