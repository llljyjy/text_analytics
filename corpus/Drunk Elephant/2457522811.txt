You really only need 3 drops to cover your whole face. It did not aggravate my very sensitive skin. I have been using it every other night for 2 weeks and have not noticed a difference. I am now going to use it every night since I know it wonâ€™t cause my very dry skin to peel. Nothing wrong with it
