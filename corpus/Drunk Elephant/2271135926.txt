I received this product for free in exchange for a review. I’ve bought and tried pretty much every product by Drunk Elephant, even their other eye products. I’d say this one is my favorite. It’s very hydrating, it can be layered and it doesn’t peel, which is great. My under-eyes tend to be very dry and this product has helped solve that for me. Will be buying once I run out! The best of the DE eye products!
