you don’t really see results right away, but after about three weeks acne definitely improved, a lot less texture, smaller scars, and less oily skin. originally was pretty worried that it was an oil and I do have more oily skin, but it’s so lightweight and works wonders I don’t think I will go back. work fast though because it absorbs into the skin very quickly, but fantastic first retinol. a little goes a long way
