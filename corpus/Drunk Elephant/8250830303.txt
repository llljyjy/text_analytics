3 stars because I love drunk elephant but this product could be better - from the packaging to the formula. Like others, my bottle became defective after a couple uses which was frustrating. Also, I feel like something in the formula doesnâ€™t mix well together over time. Was fine first couple uses, then after a bit the product started to really irritate my skin. Def not a win for me, especially for the price. nan
