Love! This has got to be one of my favorite retinols, it also plays nice with my other skincare that I like to put under it. It left my skin looking refreshed. My skin can only tolerate it for about 3-4 days in a row before it starts to burn (that’s normal for me when it comes to retinols), so I just back off for a few days before I restart again. It leaves my skin looking so fresh, it’s definitely worth the burn since those side side effects go away in a day. I’d highly recommend it! I received this for free from Influenster to test out! Favorite retinol!
