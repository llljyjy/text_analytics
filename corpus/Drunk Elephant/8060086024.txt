I was so excited to try this I have oily skin and very sensitive skin. Unfortunately I had to stop using this because it made my skin break out. I’m not sure if it was because of this so I’m trying to use less and see a difference. I use glow recipe  moisturizer so not sure if mixing those two was what cause my skin to break out. But I’ll give it another try later on. nan
