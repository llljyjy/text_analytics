Got this today and I’m obsessed! I mixed it with my Nars tinted moisturizer and it gives me a natural sun kissed glow. I recently started using DE’s APassioni retinol and with it I had to up my sunscreen game. Having darker skin, I was a little worried these drops wouldn’t give me the result I wanted. But I do love a nice natural glow and had been using Ole Herniksen’s Banana bright primer either by itself or before my tinted moisturizer or foundation. (I also tried Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter but it was too shiny for me). I have only tried these drops once and so far I can definitely say I will be buying these again. I feel like my face matches my body (after two months if summer I’m pretty tanned) and looks natural on me. Tomorrow I want to try it by itself for a no make up look and can’t wait to see the results Sun kissed glow that looks natural
