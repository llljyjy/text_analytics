I honestly LOVE this. I already use this brand, so I was fortunate enough to receive this product. I love skincare and especially retinol because early 20s is the best time to start reverse aging. I love the feeling of the oil based retinol and no bad smell! I highly recommend this to anyone with any skin type (I have normal/oily skin, my mom has dry/sensitive skin) Our skin is thriving! Really great for starters!
