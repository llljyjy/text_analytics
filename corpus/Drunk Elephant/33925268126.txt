I received this product from Influenster in exchange of my honest review.I was really excited to start using this product, and I was actually pretty pleased with the results at first. I would use it at night after my shower and after a couple of days my skin felt so smooth and moisturized. The only bad thing was that my skin around my nose started peeling. Like really bad. I stopped using this product and only use it every now and then. Which did stop the peeling. But keep into consideration I only use it like once a month now. nan
