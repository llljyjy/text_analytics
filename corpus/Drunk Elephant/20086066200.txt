I was super excited to try this product. I bought it at the Sephora inside JcPenny in my town and I was a little disappointed. Although, I do think it is cool that you mix it yourself so that the product can last longer, the ’life’ of the product starts when you mix it when you get home, not while it sits on the shelf. But I used this product every night and the only issue I had with it was that it felt sticky on my skin, and it smelled a little weird. Otherwise I think it’s a good product and I don’t let this product define what I think of the brand. Sticky Serum
