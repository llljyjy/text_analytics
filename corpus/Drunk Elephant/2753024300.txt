I needed a new Serum and was recommended to this product 4 months ago. I fell in love! The firmness it makes my skin feel is absolutely stunning! I have never had a serum work so good! I have then used it on family members prior to doing their makeup and every person that I used it on has fallen in love. I don’t care if I have to do a step by mixing the two ingredients together, it’s a one time thing! As long as I am receding the product I need and it works beautifully, I can take three steps if needed. I fully recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great serum, with vitamin C and enhancement on the firmness of your skin to feel like your protecting your skin from creating wrinkles. Amazing product!
