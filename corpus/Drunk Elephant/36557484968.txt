I received this product for free via Influenster. I liked this product especially the packaging. It is cute and smells good. Worth $60? I wouldn’t say it is but it’s a fun product if you love skincare and like the rest of drunk elephants products. Nothing bad to say about it. Fun product, not necessary for the money
