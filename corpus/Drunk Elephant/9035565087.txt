I absolutely adore this product and think it works exactly as intended. I’d say that this is comparable to the Sunday Riley Good Genes, but better. After the first few uses my blackheads literally fell out when I went to wash my face. I had an initial purging phase but now my skin is really clear and I only need to use once a week or so. I’m really impressed with this and will most likely be repurchasing. Good Genes Dupe (but better)
