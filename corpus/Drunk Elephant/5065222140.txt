This one has a tad bit chemical smell to it I didnâ€™t like. It a heavy moisturizer so I suggest keeping it light with usage. I have combination skin so I would suggest this for winter season or someone who has really dry skin. I would say it feel nice and smooth with application but have not yet notice anything different compared to other moisturizers. Not for oily skin
