I received this product as a complementary Product from Influenster and Drunk elephant in exchange for review. I am probably not using it daily as directed on the product, but can say after using it for a couple of weeks 2-3 times a week my skin has improved a lot, I am currently a big fan of this serum, will now try it daily, wanted to start with a couple of days because I have a very sensitive skin, but after not seeing negative results will increase the dose to what it says on its directions lol. I feel like it helped clear some acne and my face felt plumper and more hydrated than before, which is awesome. Helps to even skin texture. I really recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, I have also realized my pores are not as showy as before the serum. Love this product. Love this Night serum, Perfect for sensitive skin
