This product works ok. Didn’t make me break out, but purging would be normal with product of this type. They should add that as disclaimer because many people aren’t aware. I use acids in my routine daily (including neutrogena glycolic exfoliating wash). Because of that, I can’t say I notice any difference with this product. My face wasn’t any smoother or brighter and at the price it is, I expected more. I’m not sure this contains the percentages it says it does. Either way, not worth the money. nan
