I’ve always struggled with eye bags since it runs in my family, so I’m usually always wearing concealer. I have been using this product for about a week now (applied nightly before bed), and have noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my eye bags! I haven’t even been wearing concealer lately when I don’t have a full face of makeup which is a big deal since that was always a part of my daily routine. I love how this product is lightweight and doesn’t feel sticky at all. I would definitely recommend to anybody that struggles with dark circles like me. Love this!
