I love a good eye product! I love using this for night time as it is a bit thicker. However wearing this during the day under makeup works perfect too. I love the great ingredients this has, and the packaging is cute! Haven’t noticed a big difference in eye wrinkles or anything, but I didn’t have many before starting this. we all love a good eye cream!
