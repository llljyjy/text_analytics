Don’t know what’s in this product but this has bin my 5th repurchase as well has the (Drunk Elephant polypeptide cream) The Jelly cleanser after using it, my face has not broken out and I have very sensitive skin! Also made the texture of face super soft after washing! Super hydrating for a cleanser. I live in Canada so the dryness is real! Buy it! You won’t regret it trust me! Hydrates/Perfect for Sensitive skin/No breakouts
