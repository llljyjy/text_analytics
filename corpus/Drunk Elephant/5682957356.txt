I think they changed their formula. I’ve used this product in the past and I liked it but this second time around it’s making me break out bad. I thought I was crazy and then I see on the reviews it’s made someone else break out in the same way I’m breaking out. This product is NOT non comedogenic. Need to return this asap. NOT non comedogenic. NOT for sensitive skin.
