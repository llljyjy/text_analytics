I’ve loved every product I’ve used from drunk elephant, they always deliver high quality products. I really liked this product but I wouldn’t say I loved it. I like that it’s a low dose retinol that’s combined with a high quality oil for maximum impact. I combine it with my moisturizer and feel like it’s helping improve my skins texture and overall appearance however I have noticed some breakouts. Is it a direct result of this, I can’t say for sure, however it’s the only new thing that’s been introduced to my skin. I hope with more use, I will see positive results without breakouts. nan
