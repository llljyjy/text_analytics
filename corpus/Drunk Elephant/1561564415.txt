I love the way this feels on my face! I can visibly see a difference in texture after using it for about a month. The only downside to this is that it’s super expensive. I got mine for free from Influenster and I’m not sure that I’ll be repurchasing because of the price tag! It’s a great oil if you can afford it. luxurious
