I usually use the original micellar water from the drugstore but decided to switch over to this one because I love Drunk Elephant. This consistency is a little thicker than most micellar water brands but still does the job. I like it but it’s nothing too special. I do like how it’s ingredients are a lot better but it is pricy. Great Makeup Remover, nothing special though
