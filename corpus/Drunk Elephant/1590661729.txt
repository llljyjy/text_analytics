I understand the logic of having to mix the product ourselves because vitamin C is not very shelf-stable. I had never tried the original serum before they changed it, so I can’t speak to whether it’s changed. The bottle where we mix the powder and liquid had a narrow opening, so I almost spilled the liquid. I shook it for 1 minute but it still looks like powder is on the bottom. It’s now a complete liquid, it’s not a serum. I applied it after mixing and it was very sticky and tacky on my skin, which was a little disappointing considering this product is expensive. I’ve tried similarly priced vitamin C products that are not tacky or sticky at all, like YTTP. That plus the bad smell, I am not sure if I will continue to use this product even if I see brightening results. nan
