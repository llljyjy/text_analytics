Super hydration coming to you. When using this my eyes look slightly more rested in the morning. I love the container if comes in with the twist up pump. I didn’t notice a scent. It feels creamy and it’s definitely not thin or watery feeling. I would warn against crying after applying bc it will only make things worse for your eyes. Also don’t rub your eyes too soon after applying. Don’t cry
