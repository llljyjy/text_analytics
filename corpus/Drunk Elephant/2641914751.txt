Since I have combination skin, I’m usually very cautious and avoid using face oils. But I have used retinol in the past so I nudged myself to finally start using it last month. I use about 2 drops and mix it in with my moisturizer, then another drop just for my neck and décolleté area. After about four weeks of using this, I do notice that my skin is more even tone and smoother, freckles slightly lighter, no breakouts so my skin seems to be loving this. I’ll continue to use to see more benefits, so in summary, if you use retinol and love using it, try this since it’s made of clean ingredients (the retinol is vegan!) and it’s also a gentle one so for those who have sensitive skin might be able to use this. nan
