I have acne-prone skin and was struggling to find a good skincare routine for years. I was stuck in a cycle of buying acne cleansers that didn’t really make any difference. I decided for once to try a cleanser that has skin-loving ingredients instead of one that’s made to target acne and the difference was incredible. I’ve never been in love with a cleanser like I am with Pekee Bar. Unlike other bar cleansers, it doesn’t make me sensitive or dry me out. It feels great on my skin and I definitely noticed an improvement in my acne. I know the product description says it’s good for fine lines and dark spots but believe me, it does so much more!
