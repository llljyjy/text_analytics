After using this product for a couple week I have found my skin to be more hydrated. However, I feel it doesn’t absorb the greatest? My face felt sticky which I didn’t enjoy. There isn’t really a smell so it didn’t smell bad, the packaging was cute.I received this product for free for product testing purposes Meh
