The Drunk Elephant Ceramighty AF Eye Balm is pretty impressive. My skin felt instantly smoother and more moisturized. After a few days of consistent morning and night application, my under eye area looks brighter and the wrinkles are less noticeable. It does not have any noticeable scent and seems super gentle on my skin, nourishing it every step of the way. It is a great value for the price. A little goes a long way. The bottle itself is very unique. I love that the kid closes by twisting, so I donâ€™t have to worry about it spilling when we travel. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and will be certain to include it in my beauty routine from here on out! nan
