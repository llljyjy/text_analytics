LOVE LOVE! This product is so amazing. Not only is the packaging super cute but it makes my face feel so soft. I usually put it on before bed and then it works wonders. The only downside of the serum is that the smell is not the best. I wish it had a slight smell of something instead of a more chemical smell. Worth it!
