I’ve spent the last several years trying different moisturizers for my extremely dry skin. My skin would get so dry that it would crack and peel in some spots. I’ve tried all of the major clean brands and did so much research online - I’ve tried Tula, SkinFix, youth to the people, and Drunk Elephant’s Lala retro and Protini moisturizers (I thought the texture of this moisturizer was more creamy compared to the Drunk Elephant Protini moisturizer, which felt a little more gel-like). Out of all of the moisturizers I’ve tried, this one is by far the best! I used each one for 4+ months and this is the only one where I did not have any dry patches or cracked/peeling skin. The creamy texture feels really nice and absorbs really well - I think my search for the perfect night time moisturizer is over! I've done my research, this is the BEST
