this is my favorite beauty product i have ever bought. I use it with my favorite moisturizer. I take my moisturizer in my fingers, add a few drops of the Bronzing Drops, and rub into my face. It seriously looks like you just got tanned on the face. I love it because it is so natural, and lightweight, but it makes a big difference and lasts a long time. LOVE
