I bought this because I was experiencing dryness around my eyes for a few months. I didn’t have any wrinkle/fine line/dark circle concerns, so I can’t tell you if it helps with those, but it’s completely gotten rid of the dryness and I haven’t experienced any issues — no stinging, no milia. It’s been great! I generally have pretty sensitive skin, but DE is a very reliable brand for me. Does what I want it to, without any issues!
