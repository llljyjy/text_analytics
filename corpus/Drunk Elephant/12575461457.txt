Honestly I just started my face routine journey because I didn’t believe I needed anything due to the fact that my face is normal but I started cleansing and moisturizing on top of adding vitamins to my face I need something new and this was the perfect thing to add in the end because it does something that my other products don’t. In one drop of an Oreo so many good outcomes come out of this treatment. As I applied to my face for the first time, it was super soft and very light way to my skin. It smelled great and after 2 weeks I saw results. Remember to stay consistent TikTok review @ tiff._.mari3
