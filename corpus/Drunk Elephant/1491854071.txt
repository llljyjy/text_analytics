I love this so much! Retinol typically makes my skin red and itchy (even when applying a lot of moisturizer over it), but not this one. The retinol and oil combo seems to be the key to not irritating my skin. My skin looks glowy and feels so soft after using this. Itâ€™s pricey but will be a staple in my skincare routine. I received this product complimentary from Influenster, but all opinions are my own! Love it!!!
