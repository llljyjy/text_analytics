LOVE THE NEW FORMULA, the old drunk elephant vitamin c was always very orange and felt out of date, goopy and had a strong smell. Now I mix it so I know it’s fresh (it’s very easy to mix) and I love how it helps with my skin texture and discoloration. It has noticeable improved my redness and some dark spots. Absolute love it!
