The winter has left my face so dry that this was just what my skin needed. I was looking for a good facial oil to help moisturize my parched skin, when I found out that Drunk Elephant had just released this oil I was super happy. I love my other Drunk Elephant products, especially the Babyfacial. I am conscious about the ingredients in my skincare products so I’m happy that this one is clean of harmful substances. The 95% marula oil has antioxidants like omegas 6 and 9 that are great for radiant glowing skin! Ceramides helps with the skin’s elasticity and moisture. I’m glad that it also has .5% retinol in it. I don’t need to apply my retinol cream when I use this, my skin just soaks it in. I’ve noticed that my skin texture is less visible and skin tone is more even. These days whenever I want extra hydration I reach for this oil. One of my fav retinol oils!
