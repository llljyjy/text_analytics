so basically u put this on after u wash ur face and do you4 ritual if u have one. it says 3 pumps thata about the perfect amount. I noticed it removed redness made my skin seem more even I have a datk spot over my lip it helped blend. u rilly don’t even need to use a primer when you use this. I usually use on a no makeup day. n I’m sure if I used this every day like I should the dark spot would lighten up. a must if u have uneven skin redness etc
