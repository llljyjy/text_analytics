To start, I am a huge Drunk Elephant fan and I was super excited when I saw this item. I have tried retinols before and had tons of issues with purging and peeling skin. This product seemed like the perfect solution for me but I wanted to wait until I had used it for at least a month before I left my review…Ok… I love it. The application felt really nice and my skin looked nice and plump afterwards. I also didn’t have any of the irritation or other issues that I normally do with retinol! This is a great product for someone who wants to start using retinols or someone who has very sensitive skin. I’m still waiting to see what the long term results will be but I’m very happy so far! nan
