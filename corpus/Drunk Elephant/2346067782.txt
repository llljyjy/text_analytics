This duo is so underrated and has been my go-to cleanser for the past few years for my dry/sensitive skin. The pekee bar is extremely gentle and soothing, while the juju bar provides some light physical exfoliation. These are pH balanced cleansers and anytime I try another cleanser and come back to these, my skin gets its healthy glow back. I tend to use the pekee bar in the AM and the juju bar at night (Iâ€™ll skip out on the juju bar if I do any derma-planning/physical exfoliation). Another bonus is these travel sizes last forever. I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a basic no bs kind of cleanse! Holy grail cleansing bars
