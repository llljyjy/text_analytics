This stuff is really good!! It is super hydrating, it is truly like an oil. It makes my skin feel so soft, and have such a natural radiant glow to it!  Many of my blemishes lightened, and I had very little acne while using this. The only thing I get a little worried about is how heavy/thick the oil is- I donâ€™t want my face to be too oily and result in acne. I use this oil very sparingly, like a half of a drop on each cheek, and it has worked out well. I definitely like it enough that I would purchase this again. nan
