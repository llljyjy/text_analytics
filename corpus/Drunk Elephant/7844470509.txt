I am not someone who takes good care of their skin. I never sleep, I used to sleep in my makeup, never wore sunscreen, etc. So obviously that catches up with someone and now I am almost 30 and look like a pizza faced grandma. I have hormonal acne from having PCOS and ever since I’ve had to wear masks ( I am an ER nurse) daily my skin has additionally taken a second beating. I got this stuff a week ago and have used it twice and my skin is already showing a huge improvement! With this bad boy and a consistent skin care routine I’m feeling like a normal looking human again. Can’t wait to see how I’m doing after a couple more weeks Helps with PCOS acne
