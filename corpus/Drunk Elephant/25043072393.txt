The product is fantastic - you feel its action right after you apply it. After a few weeks, my skin looks great.  I like that they find a solution to the oxidation problem: it’s easy to do and not messy at all. Let’s talk about the bottle for 1 sec: I would definitely prefer another solution than a pump. I used to apply Vitamin C serum with a pipette and I like it better as you have more control over the amount of product you put on your skin and there is less drip/waste. At this price, waste is not an option.  The only reason why I remove 1 star. Fantastic product but please change the pump
