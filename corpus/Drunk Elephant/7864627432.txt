Pretty decent moisturizer, but itâ€™s way overpriced. It does a good everyday job, but wasnt the best option during extreme cold dry winter weather (the only thing that worked in those conditions for super dry peeling skin from cold weather was the clinique intense moisture surge). my only qualm with this protini moisturizer is that the bougie packaging pump makes it extremely hard to get out the last bits when running low; you have to pry off the lid and risk it flying everywhere, or just throw it out with your money still in there. Decent but Overpriced for Quality
