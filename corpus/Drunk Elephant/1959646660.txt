I canâ€™t do without eye creams in my routine, as I suffer from a very dry under-eye area and need all the help. The whipped texture of this balm is very nourishing and moisturizing and feels wonderfully soothing under the eye. I use this in my night routine, and it helps me look well-rested. The twist-up pump packaging is always appreciated and gets bonus points. nan
