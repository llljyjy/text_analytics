I use this about once a month. Every time I use this, my skin peels for days on end. I last used this product 8 days ago, and my skin is STILL peeling! (See photo) I canâ€™t wear any foundation because it looks very cakey, no matter how well I moisturize. I use this as instructed (leave on for 15-20 min), use oil afterwards, and apply spf 50 everyday. Skin has been peeling for days
