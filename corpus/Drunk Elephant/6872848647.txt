I’m very very new to the world of vitamin C serums. However, I don’t think this is an enjoyable product. The package leaks at the top, and when I put one pump onto my hand which is how it is directed. I feel as though I can’t get an even spread onto my face. Maybe I’m doing it wrong? I think using a dropper to put directly onto the face and then smoothing in seems much more affective.I’ve used it for 4 days now and I don’t want to waste 100$ but I’m thinking I need to try a new “user friendly” product. poor packaging
