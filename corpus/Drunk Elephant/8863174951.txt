This moisturizer is excellent for dry skin! Itâ€™s on the heavier side, and yet cosmetically elegant, and features a blend of ceramides that targets both relieving dryness and improving the moisture barrier. I prefer it as a night cream personally, but it can also be worn during the day. Great night cream
