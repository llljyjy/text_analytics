I like it. It’s what I’d consider a medium viscosity moisturizer, not at all greasy. Because it has that slightly lighter feel it seems as though it wouldn’t be too hydrating, but It makes my skin look and feel nice. I can’t describe it, but I do notice a difference in my skin when I don’t use it. I’d recommend trying it at least once if your on the fence. Works for MY sensitive skin
