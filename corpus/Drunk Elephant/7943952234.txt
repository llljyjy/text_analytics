This eye balm exceeded all my expectations. It is intensely hydrating and brightening, and has noticeably minimized the fine lines around my eye area. I believe I look more awake and youthful now, with and without makeup, and this is the only new skincare product Iâ€™ve incorporated into my routine. Drunk Elephant is a cult favorite for skincare products, and after using this eye balm, I can clearly see why! Hydrating, Brightening & Wrinkle Fighting!
