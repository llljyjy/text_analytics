This product is hydrating and soft on the skin which is the reason for the two star but would not re-purchase this. I feel like I need a lot of product to get my very minimal makeup daily off. It says to hold product on tougher makeup and not scrub but I feel like I need to scrub in order to get my eye brown pencil to come off. To me this product is not worth the money at all. I would not buy againâ€¦
