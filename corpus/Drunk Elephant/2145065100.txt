I tried this out on a whim. I have dry skin and used this during late fall into winter. The texture is somewhat creamy, but also somehow kind of dry - kind of like a cream cheese texture. I used this after toner and serum and it didn’t fully hydrate my skin in the long run and found myself applying to my entire face a few times a day during winter as it feels like it doesn’t last on my skin long enough to feel hydrated. I do like the pump mechanism however unnecessary. Perhaps it’s because of the viscosity of the cream. I did pry it open so I could get the last of it. I would recommend this for summer if you’re looking to just hydrate without feeling too oily. nan
