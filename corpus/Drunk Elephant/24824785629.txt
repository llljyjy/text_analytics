While I do like the idea of mixing the formula myself to avoid the old oxidizing issue this product had, the pump was completely defective and judging by the reviews, it’s not a one-off problem. Wouldn’t feel comfortable repurchasing without confirmation from DE that pump issue has been resolved. It worked pretty similar to old formula, it’s a good product in a crap bottle. needs work
