Let me start out by saying that I believe this oil stands true to its claims. However, I would advise those with sensitive skin to use cautiously first to see how your skin reacts and how frequently your skin can handle this serum. For myself, I’ve found that this oil doesn’t work well in combination with my other serums so I wait awhile to let it soak in before finishing my skincare routine. I’ve definitely noticed some dryness and peeling after using this product everyday so I’ve decreased to every other day. I definitely think it works, a little too well on my sensitive skin for everyday use but it’s definitely a great product overall and I really love that it’s a retinol oil and absorbs quickly. It definitely works!!
