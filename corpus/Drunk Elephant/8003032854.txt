This was an impulsive buy, and im so glad i got it. It is very expensive for the amount you get, but i would definitely say treat yourself when it comes to this. It blends BEAUTIFULLY, it does not get all patchy like some other glow products do. I also love how it is glowy but not in an overwhelming way, it doesnt make me look oily or metalic which again, a lot of other glowy/bronzing liquid products do. I love putting this in my moisturizer/sunscreen/makeup, and its perfect to wear on no makeup days. I will be repurchasing this 1000% Absolutely love
