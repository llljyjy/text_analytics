I must admit, I’m generally of the belief that moisturizers are all basically the same. I use tretinoin, I use SPF, and those are the heavy hitters that are proven to make a difference, so really any old moisturizer should be fine, as long as it doesn’t irritate your skin. So over the last year or so I’ve been using drug store moisturizers over my prescription tret at night.  But I looked at a picture of myself a year ago and I realized my skin looked better then. Smoother, less red, plumper. I had to think about what the difference was, and realized I was using DE protini over my tretinoin a year ago.  I saw this value size and thought, ok here goes, let’s try it again. Expecting nothing. But a week in and I can already see the difference. My skin loves this stuff. It drinks it up. And I’m already starting to look like I did a year ago - smoother, less blotchy, and well hydrated. It makes a difference
