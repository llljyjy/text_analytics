I am glad I got a sample with a purchase because this product is not for me. for reference, I have medium skin tone, aging skin with texture, fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation.PROS:It leaves a beautiful very subtle luminosity on the skin (but no color on me)It has great skincare ingredients like vitamin F and peptides.Clean at Sephora Vegan and cruelty-free.It has no fragrance.It comes in a recyclable package.CONS:It lacks pigmentation: it is so sheer that once applied, it just disappears. It does not leave any color on my skin. In the enclosed picture, I have applied A LOT to show the color. It is not properly spread on the skin. Once spread it just disappears leaving a beautiful luminosity but not color. It may work on fair and light skin tones but not on medium (and I assume tan and deep) skin tones.It is quite pricey.It disrupts my foundation. Applied with fingers, brush or sponge, and a lot of care, it disrupts my foundation. I never go without foundation so this is a big issue for me. I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Too light for me but it may work for you
