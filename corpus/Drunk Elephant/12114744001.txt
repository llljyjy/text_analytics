After using this for a month I’m not sure if it helped much with my skin texture and dryness or if it contributed to my new breakouts. As much as I wanted to love it (I use other drunk elephant products that I love!) I can’t say I’d buy this product again. I normally don’t break out around my hair line and after starting this I got a lot of acne around there, when I stopped the acne reduced. The consistency is thick and takes a little time to absorb, but once absorbed I didn’t feel it on my skin. Could go either way
