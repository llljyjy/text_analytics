The bacon smell is tolerable for some (my boyfriend hated it, but I didn’t mind). The application was pretty good (absorbs quickly and layers well with other products) until it’s running out, which is when I start to notice the packaging breaking more easily, little weird dried granules and the product getting stickier and harder to absorb. I won’t recommend this, but God speed if you use it. It took me about 2.5 - 3 months to finish but that’s because I only use it during the day. Weirdly sticky and dried bits towards the end
