I was super excited to finally get to using the sample I got of this from Sephora but was let down by the mediocrity of this cleansing balm. Here’s what I did like: it didn’t irritate my skin when it was uncomfortably dry, makeup removed very easy, I liked the addition of the exfoliation booster since you can control how much exfoliation you can use, I actually liked the scent, I felt it smelled like a very green banana.What I didn’t like: it is way too oily for me, when it’s rubbed on the skin I felt that there’s too much slip and I always had to double cleanse when using this to make sure it all washed off. It’s not a bad cleansing balm but also isn’t life changing either. nan
