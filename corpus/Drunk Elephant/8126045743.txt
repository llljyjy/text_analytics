This product is nice overall but definitely for mature skin. My skin is very sensitive and I also have rosacea so this product didn’t help my skin whatsoever. It dried out my face a bit but could probably be fixed with a moisturizing cream. I don’t feel that this certain oil targeted my problems so for that reason, I don’t love it for myself. I’m sure it’s great for those with the skin it’s made for! I want to love it but I can’t :( other products from this line are amazing though!! nan
