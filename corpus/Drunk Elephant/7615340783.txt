This oil has now been added to my nightly routine. I love Drunk Elephant products in general and this did not disappoint. It is very hydrating and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Especially with winter being super dry and damaging for my skin this is a big remedy for my dry depleted skin. Great retinol oil
