I got this to mix with a few sunscreens I have that give me white cast. It works pretty well and gives a glow when you mix them. The bottle is pretty small but you only need a few drops so it would last quite a while. Definitely going to be a staple for me during the summer.only need one to two drops so it will last you at least the whole summer. nan
