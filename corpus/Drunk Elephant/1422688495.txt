(3.5 stars - I received this eye cream free from influenster and drunk elephant in exchange for my honest review): I found this rich, thick eye cream to be super nourishing for my eyes. I’ve used it for a few weeks now. The first week I found I was applying it too close to my eyes as a few minutes after applying my eyes would start to water a ton! I noticed other reviewers mentioning this (and worse side effects) so justwanted to note that. Since then I’ve just backed away from my lashes a bit and that has helped. It’s pricey but you don’t even need a full pump for both eyes so I think it will last a while! The jury is still out whether I think a dedicated eye cream is necessary but I seem to keep acquiring them and this is a decent one! Nice &Thick
