I love the way my skin looks after I use this product. I’ve been using for a few weeks and do see lightening , yay! The smell is not awful. If you’ve ever used Skinceuticals, you know that many describe their CE formula smelling like “hot dog water.” This smells similar which tells me that it’s actually potent Vitamin C serum. I do agree it’s pretty runny which could be improved. So far, I really enjoy this product and plan to stick with it! Quality Serum
