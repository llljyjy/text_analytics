I’ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I originally purchased it because I needed something to help fade my dark spots but I wanted something that would double as a hydrator at night. This hit the nail right on the head for me. It’s not a super heavy oil, my skin is combo and I haven’t had an issue with it feeling built up or breaking me out. It’s slowly fading my dark spots, I am noticing a big difference! Love it in combination with my Elta MD tinted sunscreen. Highly recommend! nan
