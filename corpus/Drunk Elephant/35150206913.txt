So I got this as a sample when I was purchasing a scrub. I looked at the reviews which were mostly about the formula of the serum not being the same, which isn’t helpful. So I started using the serum and just patting it on my cheeks. A week later I broke out terribly. Two pimples on my right cheek and one on the left, I broke out on my chin as well. Most of them were white heads. I have never gotten a reaction like that before so I was surprised and stopped using the serum right away. I kept on with my usual face routine and in a few days the pimples were gone. So if you’re acne prone do not purchase this product. nan
