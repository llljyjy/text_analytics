I received the Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos voxbox from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. I have extremely dry snd sensitive skin. I am in a constant search for moisturizers that do not irritate my skin. I received this sample and have been using it religiously in my nighttime skincare routine. It is so luxurious and creamy. I also like how it is does not have a scent to it. I can already tell a difference in my skin after three weeks. My skin feels more hydrated and moisturized. There is also a more youthful appearance to my face. This product is a must have ! Soooo luxurious l
