I have been using this facial oil for a couple of weeks now and I absolutely love it. I have acne prone skin and it has not made my skin break out at all. When applying it feels so nice on my skin, almost as if it melts into my skin as opposed to sitting on top of it like other facial oils I have used. My only complaint is that for an oil it is a bit drying as opposed to moisturizing, likely due to the retinol content. Love it!
