I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I had actually used this product before and had debated buying it for years. My issue is how expensive it is. It’s really so much for a small face cream. However, I will say that it’s extremely gentle and nourishing. I actually think it wasn’t thick enough for my particularly dry skin. Mostly I can’t justify the price for what it is. I’m willing to drop $$ for great skincare but this just doesn’t impress me as much as other things have. Is it a good product? Yes. Is it something I feel like I need to have after trying it? No. Creamy and gentle
