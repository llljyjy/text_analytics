No matter what I do this sunscreen gives me a white cast. I have tried applying it alone, applying it and waiting 15 min, and mixing it with lotion. Every single time I end up looking like a ghost. The only time it has even looked half decent is when I applied moisturizer on top of it, and even then I looked ashy. The sunscreen also pills and the white cast is visible under makeup. The formulation of this sunscreen is very nice; it is moisturizing without being oily and feels very nice when applied to the skin, but the white cast is horrible. Very bad white cast
