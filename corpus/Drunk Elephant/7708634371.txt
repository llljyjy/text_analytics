I feel like I’ve spent years 29-31 trying to find the greenest, best products for sensitive skin, with as few irritants as possible, and I come back to DE, but then I convince myself that this new company might offer something better. No more. I’m firmly convinced that in this price range DE is absolutely the best for my particular skin type. I wish DE used glass or recycled its caps. If they did that I would be less inclined to keep trying some of the newer brands with glass packaging that simply lack the perfected formulations that DE offers. Sigh. Protini is the perfect moisturizer. Blend it with the Framboos glycolic a few nights a week. Use sunscreen over it during day. Add in a serum for some extra fun. Boom. Perfect easy routine. Perfect
