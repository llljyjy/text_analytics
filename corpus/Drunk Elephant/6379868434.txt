This product has truly been the only topical solution for keeping my chronic adult acne at bay. I have been using it nightly for over a year now, and I mix it with LaLa retro Cream, B-Hydra Serum, and F-Balm. This combo has completely transformed my skin! When you wash it off in the morning you can feel how baby soft your skin is. Itâ€™s amazing how powerful yet non-irritating/non-drying T.L.C. Framboos is. It has worked so well for me that I never skip a night in fear that my acne will return. The results were seen immediately for me. I still get a few pimples here and there, as I am a flight attendant and my skin is put under a lot of stress, but their turnover rate is quick and I manage them with pimple patches. Please never discontinue!!! A Miracle for Chronic Adult Acne!
