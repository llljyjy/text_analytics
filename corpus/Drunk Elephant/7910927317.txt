This is my first introduction to micellar water. I only wear make up for special events so this is not a regular use product for me. I actually bought it for those occasional lazy days when I get home super late and don’t feel like washing my face. If I don’t do something to sorta get the oils off of my face before bed, I am guaranteed to wake up with acne. This stuff is definitely creamy and moisturizing. Which is great. But at the same time, I wonder how good it is at actually getting the oil off my skin because it doesn’t feel any cleaner. It hasn’t left me with acne in the morning so I guess that’s a positive. But again this my first try with micellar water so I have nothing to compare it to. I like it ok, but not sure if I will repurchase for the price. Very Moisturizing
