I think I am on my 8th bottle. I love this stuff! I tried other products from time to time, to see if I can find something cheaper, but I keep coming back to this product. It’s moisturizing, improves my texture and let’s my makeup apply beautifully. I definitely recommend for anyone needing a great hydrating moisturizer that’s not too thick and not too heavy. I keep coming back to this product!
