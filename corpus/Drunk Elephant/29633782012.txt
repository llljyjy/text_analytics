I love this eye balm! The packaging is cute, colorful, and unique with its pop-up-twist top. The formula is thick and creamy, but can be worn under makeup as long as you allow it a couple of minutes to absorb properly. It replenishes and strengthens the skin around the eyes with ceramides & omega-rich plant oils that help deliver moisture, reduce signs of fatigue, and returns elasticity to the under eyes as well. As with all Drunk Elephant products, this eye balm is biocompatible cruelty-free &  vegan and contains NONE of “The Suspicious 6” ingredients; essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreen, and sodium lauryl sulfate. I have noticed improvements in my fine lines, dryness, and overall appearance of my under-eyes. This one is a win in my book! Its Giving!
