I got this product free from Influenster for an honest review. I was SO excited when it came in the mail that I immediately went into my house to complete my skin care routine. When I applied the product it left my under eyes feeling hydrated, awake and my skin was glowing. It is a balm texture so it sat nicely on my skin but absorbed just as I needed it to and didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. I have very heavy under eye bags as I’m part Cherokee and out of all of the products I’ve tried, this feels like it’s actually HELPING! GREAT PRODUCT! WILL REPURCHASE!
