I have sensitive skin, so it’s so hard to find a skincare regimen that doesn’t bother my skins balance. I found the perfect trio (Cleanser,Serum & Moisturizer) from the brand ‘The Outset’ but still needed a god hydrating eye cream and I’m so glad I found this one! It’s amazing for sensitive skin and has done wonders for me! Deff recommend! Great for sensitive skin!
