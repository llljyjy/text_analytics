I used to think I would never find a solution for my dry sensitive skin but oh man I am so glad I found this baby. I got the DE Sukari baby facial with the tiny bottle of this stuff and I knew I would be buying a the bigger bottle as soon as I tried it. I used to have dry flaky patches on my cheeks and chin but no more! I can finally use my retinol and other skin treatments without irritation. If your skin barrier is messed up you definitely need this stuff in your life. I haven’t tried other face oils so there is probably other cheaper options but this feels like a luxury product and I think it’s worth it for how long it lasts. There’s virtually no smell, no stickiness, and it’s colorless. Glazed donut look activated. Glazed donut game changer
