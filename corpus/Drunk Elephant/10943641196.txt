Please go back to the old formulation! This mix it yourself version is a nightmare! It doesnâ€™t mix. It says shake for one minute, but after shaking for three and tapping on the counter like crazy, the powder is still not displaced. It also turns out super thin, like water, and shoots all over the place every time you try to use it. nan
