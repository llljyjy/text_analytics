This cleanser was very surprising. I only used this cleanser and a basic moisturizer, no toner or serum, and my skin became very smooth after a few days of using it. I only used it at night and when I saw the difference it reinforced me to continue washing my face at night cuz I always get lazy at night. So, I really liked this cleanser and I would buy it again to get rid of any texture. It smells weird though like cantaloupe. Surprisingly effective face wash
