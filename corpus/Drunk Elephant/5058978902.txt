I purchased the previous version of this many times and was always able to justify the price because it lasts for months. This bottle is terrible, constantly gets clogged, can’t get the product out, and it leaks all over the bottle. When it DOES squirt out, it’s random and goes everywhere. I was somewhat relieved to see other reviews saying the same thing. I e-mailed drunk elephant and they immediately refunded me (even though I bought this months ago); it seems they may be aware they’ve created a terrible, defective product. Seriously, don’t buy this! I hate that I have start a new search for a Vitamin C serum. New Formula is Awful
