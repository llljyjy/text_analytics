Who knows if it really works...you need to get past the Beef Jerky smell on your face.  It’s just wrong to put something that smells like meat on your freshly washed skin.  My dog thinks it’s great.  After putting this on he won’t leave me alone.  This product’s smell is so odd it’s almost comical.  I could see this in a Seinfeld episode. Greasy bacon on your freshly washed face!
