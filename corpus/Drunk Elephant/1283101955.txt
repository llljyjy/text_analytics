I have been using this product for about a month now and could not be more pleased. I have very sensitive skin and my main concerns are dryness and aging. I do have a little bit of experience with retinol products, but I have to be very careful with them due to sensitivity. Since I have started using this product, my skin feels so much more hydrated and glowing. I noticed I wear foundation/concealer a lot less. I find a lot of retinol products to be super harsh and I was so surprised to find how gentle and moisturizing this oil is. I love its ceramides and anti-aging properties as well. Sometimes I mix a drop or two in my regular moisturizer in the morning and my skin feels soft and healthy all day. I also found that it eased the redness/discoloration issues I sometimes have in the wintertime. Overall I highly recommend this product! A welcome addition to my skincare routine!
