I love this cleanser, it’s my every day cleanser. It’s super simple and has no fragrance which is important to me with sensitive skin. Cerave is also something I tried for my skin but that made me breakout. This is the only one that does the job for me! My only problem is the packaging. If you shut the lid too fast, the nozzle cracks and then when you place it on the counter, the product leaks out. Further, if you store your cleanser in the shower like I do, water will runs over the bottle and the water gets trapped inside the cap! So if it’s cracked water will get inside the bottle and makes the product super runny. It is my favorite cleanser and I just try to take care while using it so I don’t waste any. nan
