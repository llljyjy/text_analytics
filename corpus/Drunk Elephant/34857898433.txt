I received this product free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. First of all I do have to say I’m a bit disappointed with the ml/oz of the trial/sample size of the moisturizer cream, but in all fairness I guess that would make this $6, having taken into consideration that a 50 ml container prices out at $60. Now with that out of the way, this whipped cream moisturizer is very smooth and rich helping your skin feel softer and more rejuvenated. Likewise, this cream is truly good for all skin types, whether you have combination skin, excessive oil, or even dryness…This cream helps all to achieve a healthy pH, whilst also fighting against aging and helping to restore overall elasticity and moisture. Furthermore, while I do appreciate Drunk Elephant’s commitment to NOT using unnecessary ingredients, focusing on only the direct benefit to the skin, I would definitely appreciate some sort of scent. I have read TONS of complaints in regards to this very bland, Play Doh like smell that can be a little off putting. I’m certain that Drunk Elephant can find something natural that can also even serve as a beneficial ingredient to help the overall aroma and vibe that this whipped cream moisturizer gives. Perhaps Lemon? Coconut? Thankyou Drunk Elephant for the opportunity to test your product. Moisturizer for ALL SKINTYPES
