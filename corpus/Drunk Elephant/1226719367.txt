This is non-greasy, unscented, and helps smooth out rough areas, BUT it irritates my skin too much, so I would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin. Not sure if it was due to some sort of allergic reaction, but initially I used it at night on my whole face and woke up looking really bad - skin had a weirdly tired appearance. Since then, I have only used it sparingly and avoided sensitive areas. I got a sample size to try and will not be purchasing it. nan
