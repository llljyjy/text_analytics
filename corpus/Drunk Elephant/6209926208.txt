First impressions “cute packaging” then… “oh my gosh what an innovative pump!!” Being able to twist the top and have the pump lock is perfect for someone who wants to store this in a drawer, bag, or for traveling. I love pump products for the ease of use but hate them for the inability to lock the pump without having to pump out product to close pump back into the twist lock mechanism. After using the product for a few weeks, I do feel like I have a good timeframe to detail my results. It did cause some dryness/irritation for a few days but after a few days of use, my skin tolerated it well. I did see some improvement in skin texture and reduction in breakouts after a few weeks of use. As for application - absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky texture. Cons- I did not love the scent, would have preferred scent less or something fruits.  Large packaging to compensate for the pump design. Costly. Costly but nice
