product works very well. It is very hydrating and goes on well. My only issue is the packaging/pricing/amount. Some of the product is below an internal plastic ring so you are essentially paying for some product that is difficult to access. I also wish that there was more product. I used this in just a week or two, wish there was more product. good product, packaging/pricing issue
