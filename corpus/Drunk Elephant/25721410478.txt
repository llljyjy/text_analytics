I’ve been using this product for awhile now ever since I received it as an exchange for my honest review! This eye cream does soothe and hydrate my under eyes well but I wasn’t very wowed by it. But after a couple weeks I’ve seen a difference on my under eyes looking more firm and less puffy! The packaging is very travel friendly as well! Great!!
