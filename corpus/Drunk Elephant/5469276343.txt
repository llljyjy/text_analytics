I started using this cream two months ago and I really like it so far. I usually break out a lot during summer time whenever I use a cream based moisturizer. Ever since I started using this cream, I could notice that my skin got so much better and the small oily bumps are gone on my upper cheeks (below the eyes). The texture is perfect, I would say it’s a mix of a gel and a cream. The only downside is the packaging!!! I bought the biggest format and unfortunately the pump doesn’t work all the time especially when the moisturizer is at the bottom of the jar. I recently dropped it on my sink and the entire lid came off, now I can’t even put it back in place. nan
