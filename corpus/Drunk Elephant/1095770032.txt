I have been using this product for years. Since the pandemic, I usually mix it into my sunscreen and bypass foundation altogether since I’ve been wearing a mask at work anyway. It gives the perfect sunkissed glow and you can adjust the intensity very easily. I’ve also used it to save foundations that have ended up being slightly too light for me. This is a winner in my opinion. Love it
