I really enjoy using this product. I use it when I get out of the shower by itself. I’m sure it would be great to add into a moisturizer as well. I like how it makes my skin feel at night, and I can feel it working on my break outs. My skin almost looks and feels firmer and a bit more of an even glow across my face. So far, any drunk elephant product I’ve tried, I’ve enjoyed! Their brand is definitely worth looking into to and adding to your skin care routine! love
