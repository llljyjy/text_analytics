I have dry sensitive skin that also has a lot of redness and uneven texture and this stuff has made such a difference in my skin, even more so with it being winter and being so dry out. I layer this on top of my moisturizer every night and I wake up with glowy smooth skin. I do this so I can use it everyday without it being too harsh. Iâ€™ve also worn it under makeup and it worked well. The price is a little much but depending on results over the next month I would consider purchasing as a normal part of my routine.
