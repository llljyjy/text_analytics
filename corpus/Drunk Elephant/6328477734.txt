Ok…so this does smell like charred hotdogs as another reviewer mentioned and at first it really threw me off. I am about a month in using this product and honestly the smell doesn’t even trigger me anymore. I can see a visible difference in my skin’s tone and texture, but one thing I miss that other vitamin c serums I have used in the past give, is that glowy, vibrant look to my skin. I have been needing to pair it with another serum (Glow Recipe’s Plump Plump) to get that hydrated feel. It’s also VERY runny. Overall, I like it, but not sure if I will purchase again. Even tone - but not in love.
