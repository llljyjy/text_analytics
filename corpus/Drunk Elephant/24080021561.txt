First of all I just want to say that I received this product in exchange for a honest review from Influenster. I have been using retinol for a year or so now and I like the results they produce. This one is also no exception. I feel this one feels super moisturizeing and less oily than others. I find it easier to apply mixed in with my moisturizer. However you can apply it directly to the skin if you prefer. glowy smooth skin
