The moisturizer was lovely! Although I was concerned that it may be too heavy for my particular skin, it actually went on like butter and absorbed very quickly - not greasy whatsoever and not overly luminizing. I found it to be hydrating and, perhaps, a very small bit too moisturizing for myself personally (just my skin/preference). Overall, though, it’s a smooth, soothing, hydrating and moisturizing cream - perfect for nighttime, if you’re looking for a cream that’s on the lighter-medium side of heaviness! . Overall, big recommend! (Moisturizer is the bottom “swatch“ in the photo.) lovely whipped cream
