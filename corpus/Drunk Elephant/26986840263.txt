My first impression after looking up this product was definitely the price. This product is worth $60 in the Drunk Elephant page and to be honest I thought this was a high price for the size of the product. But after using this for just a few days I can say that I really like it! I have never use any eye creams and this is my first time trying one and I like how is making my eyes look more awake and refreshed. I can definitely see that this balm is giving my eyes a lot of moisture and I am really exited to keep using this product! very MOISTURIZING
