I already use the Drunk Elephant A Passioni retinol so I was excited to receive this free to try for my honest review. My skin in combination and I get dry on my cheeks and oily elsewhere. My skin was already used to retinol but this was a nice change because it acted as a barrier to keep the moisture in my skin. My skin surprisingly reacted well to it being an oil and has been less dry. This has been great for reducing texture. I am excited to keep using it! nan
