Amazing moisturizer- feels so nice and soothing on. Has good stuff but even more importantly is missing all the bad stuff like fragrances and irritants. Even if my skin is over-sensitized I can use this moisturizer without any stinging or burning and I’ve had great results from it. The container is awesome at keeping the product fresh and protected. Only drawback is the price- it’s expensive and I’d love to use more but don’t feel like I can because of how pricy it is. I’m not sure why drunk elephant or a competing brand can’t create a very similar product for a fraction of the price because so much that’s good about is due to what it doesn’t have like perfumes and irritating chemicals. just the best dang moisturizer ever
