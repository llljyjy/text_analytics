I waited so long to write a review on this product. Bought this product on 07/22/21 and used the last bit of this product on 01/25/22. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin. I’ve only used this in the evening to cleanse my face and just water in the morning since I have dry skin. This product is very gentle and I really recommend this to anyone with any sort of skin issues. As you can see in the picture, it forms a very nice lather. I have used so many cleansers including Vanicream and I’d prefer this over anything else. It didn’t bother my dry skin at all and after cleansing I always follow up with an essence. Unlike Biossance cleanser, this has no fragrance at all. Overall, great product that last a long time. Very well worth your money. nan
