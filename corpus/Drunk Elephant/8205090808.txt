Unlike most of the reviews, I actually paid for my bottle of “A-Gloei”. It doesn’t do much of anything and my skin is the exact same as it was 6 weeks ago with daily use. I think Drunk Elephant is running out of ideas and are just putting out combo products now. Certainly not worth $72+tax!! Not Worth It!!
