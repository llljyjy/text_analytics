Honestly this moisturizer was pretty good! I’m only deducting a star because it’s pretty overpriced for seeming to work the same in comparison to other cream moisturizers I’ve used in the past. It’s nothing special, but it’s a great moisturizer nonetheless! It also does smell like play doh a bit which can be off putting for some but this was not an issue for me. nan
