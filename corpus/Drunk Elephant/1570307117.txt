I must admit that lately I havenâ€™t been using eye creams because I used my regular face moisturizer to apply it all over my face, but this cream is here to stay. its texture is light, it absorbs quickly and the moisturizing results are immediate. My skin is sensitive and I use it without any problem. Works perfect under sunscreen, makeup and night creams. I recommend one hundred percent this wonder made by drunk elephant. Excellent eye cream
