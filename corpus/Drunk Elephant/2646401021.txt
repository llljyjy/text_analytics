This is one of those items I won’t live without! I deal redness as well as aging skin! I use it before I put on my foundation. Not only does it help with my redness, but it also creates a natural looking tan! I’m one of those who doesn’t like my natural skin color. And the sun, or (shudder) tanning beds, are concerning when you are trying to make time do as little damage as possible to your skin. Love love love!!! Must have product!!
