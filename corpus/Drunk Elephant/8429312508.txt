I wanted to love this product so badly. I had been looking for a hydrating serum at a reasonable price point and tried this based on success with other Drunk Elephant products. I live in the Northeast so winters are rough on my skin (perpetually dry with flaking). I honestly feel like this made my skin worse. It felt like slight burning during my first few uses but I decided to give it more time assuming my skin needed to adjust. Nope, I feel like it made my usual winter irritation worse. Would not recommend. nan
