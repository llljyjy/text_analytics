I received this item complimentary for my honest review. Honestly, this is not my first DE product and once again I am less than impressed. I found the Marula oil to be heavy and pore clogging. I like the idea of the product but I do prefer a higher percentage retinol product that I can combine with a good evening moisturizer instead of an oil like this one. A flop- but my skin is complicated
