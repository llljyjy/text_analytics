This eye cream feels like a really good, thick hand cream (but for your eyes). I can tell just by the texture that it holds moisture in. I love Drunk Elephant products, so I was excited to test this one! Some people mentioned a slight burning, I do feel that, but not necessarily in an uncomfortable way. The one downside to this eye cream, for me, is that is leaves my eye area really shiny and Iâ€™m not a shiny girl. I like matte. It has a Vaseline type shiny-ness to it, which again, I can see why it locks the moisture in. Rich and Creamy
