I absolutely love this oil. I was previously using the DE Marula Oil for added moisture on top of Protini - but this oil has more skin benefits and has eliminated winter bumps from dryness and acne from mask wearing. I love that it is hydrating without feeling greasy - I wake up with glowing and perfectly hydrated skin that is smooth and plump. Drunk Elephant hardly disappoints. I recommend this for people who want to start using retinol, but arenâ€™t looking for something too strong that may make their skin react poorly or peel excessively. This is going to be a staple in my nightly skin routine. holy grail face oil!
