I been using this for about 8 months and I’m now on my second bottle. I really should have stopped at the second bottle but I know it takes time for your skin to adjust so I assumed I needed to use it consistently before I did. I really wanted this for my finelines on my forehead. While, I did see some improvement, It certainly wasn’t what I had expected and a little disappointed. It did do well with forming my skin. I used a different retinol brand before and was so pleased with the outcome that i didn’t think I needed it anymore, even though I know you’re no suppose to. Anyway, I decided to start back again because I had an event that brought back my stress and anxiety and with that came the fine lines. So when using this compared to the other brand, I realized this one was not worth it. I will be chiding choosing another brand after this one. nan
