I am surprised by how much I am enjoying this product. I don’t typically go for pricey / viral brands and products, because there is typically cheaper products that are just as good, if not better… but because I received this product for free to try out and review, I have given it a fair shot, and I genuinely enjoy the way it hydrated and plumped my under eyes. It is very hydrating and the packaging is perfection. I enjoyed the experience of receiving it and the entire package was fun to open and use. Not sure that it does more than just provide moisture or that it’s worth the money, but if you are looking for a very moisturizing eye cream with great packaging, this one is a great option for sure. absolutely love the bottle / pump!!
