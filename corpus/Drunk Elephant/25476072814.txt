I love Drunk Elephant products so I was super excited when I received their T.L.C Framboos Glycolic Night Resurfacing Night Serum complimentary to try and review. I started using the serum 3-4 times a week at night time and after a few weeks, I can see a such a difference. My skin is looks brighter and has a nice, even texture. It feels smoother, tighter and hydrated, but the best part for me is it really helped clear my skin! I struggle with slight acne, that seems to be getting worse now that I am 40. This night serum really helped with tame those breakouts and clear my pimples. It works wonders as a spot treatment, too. The functionality of the bottle is great. The serum itself has a light, gel like texture that absorbs into my skin easily with no greasy feeling. A single pump is all I need for my face and neck! It is on the pricey side but, it is definitely worth it because it has given me brighter, smoother and clear skin! Night Serum
