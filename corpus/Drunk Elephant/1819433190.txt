Exhausted boy mom and this is what EYE needed! Iâ€™m constantly looking tired with dark circles and bags. This eye cream does an amazing job at moisturizing under my eyes while also reducing the look of fatigue and and helps me look like I actually got 8 hours of sleep. I put it on my eye lids at night but found it stung my eyes so I prefer to apply a small amount under my eyes and on the side near my crows feet. When I wake up in the morning, I still feel moisturized and look well rested. I also love that the cap twists on and off so there is no worry about misplacing the cap and having your kids get into it! Definite addition to my skincare routine! Boy Mom Must Have!
