This is a lovely moisturizer. It wears well under foundation and provides all day hydration without being greasy. I took this product apart when it was near the end to see if there was product left behind and I am impressed with the dispensing mechanism! There was just a smudge left behind, meaning you will get 99.9% of the product out. 10/10 for me. I love!
