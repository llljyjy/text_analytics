I wanted to love this moisturizer cuz I LOVE so many Drunk Elephant products **(HELLO—> TLC Baby Facial anyone!?!) but i honestly didn’t see any difference/improvements over other moisturizers I use that are half the cost. I do like the texture~ it’s very lightweight, feels refreshing when putting on & yes a little goes a long way, however I prefer a thicker moisturizer that throws a punch! Keeps me hydrated throughout the entire day. I would definitely recommend for people with sensitive, normal/combination skin! Love DE this was a miss!
