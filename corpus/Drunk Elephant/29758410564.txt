I received this product to try and I’ve been using it for a week. Overall, I’m really happy with it and it leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshing. The only “problem” I have is the consistency of the moisturizer, it’s a little thick and it’s easy to use too much if you don’t. A little goes a long way and I look forward to keep using this product in the future! nan
