I wanted to like this but it just doesnâ€™t cut it. The tube is weirdly wide so it was difficult to apply compared to classic sized tubes. The formula is not super moisturizing. it feels oily and just sits on my lips while underneath the coating my lips feel drier and wrinkly. I feel weird about returning used products so this is just going to be used on my cuticles. Not worth it
