I love this retinol oil, I received it in my Influenster box but I have come to love it and quickly added it into my nightly skincare routine. I use this after I cleanse my face and before I put on my moisturizer and it makes my face feel very hydrated and plump.  I have only been using it for a couple weeks so I have not been able to see the long term effects but Iâ€™m hoping it will help to clear my dark spots and fine lines. Would purchase again Daily skincare essential
