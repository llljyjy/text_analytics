I love to try new skincare products, but this one is here to stay! I have been using this moisturizer for 2 years now and it has done wonders for my skin. It is a thick, whipped texture that really helps with dry skin. The best part about it though is it never leaves my skin oily. I have combination skin of both dry/oily and this stuff is gold. Alittle goes a long way. I use it both morning and night and the big container will last me a couple of months. This is a must have buy from the Drunk Elephant line. You wonâ€™t regret it! The Best of The Best!
