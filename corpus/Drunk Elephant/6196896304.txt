Really great way to start retinol without the irritation you can get from traditional serums! The oil is a thicker consistency which I personally prefer as I find it actually sinks into the skin as opposed to just sitting and creating an occlusive layer. I havenâ€™t had any irritation from this and I wake up with glowy skin! Plus, the bottle will last a long time as you only need a few drops at a time. Gentle but effective
