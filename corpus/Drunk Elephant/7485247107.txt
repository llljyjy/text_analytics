i received this product from influenster for my honest review. i’ll start out by saying i took off a star because of the scent, but i’ve never been huge on the smell drunk elephant products give off. but the product itself so far has been really nice. it’s really hydrating and would be good for anybody with dry/ sensitive eyes, as well as for people who experience a lot of texture and aging under the eyes. it wore nicely under makeup and helped a lot with the look of creasing. i would definitely recommend this product to others and will definitely be pushing it in my sephora really enjoyed this product
