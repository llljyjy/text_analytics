I received this product to try and boy was I pleasantly surprised. I saw results in just a week and I’ve been using this product since I’ve received it. It does what it promises to do, in the first photo (skin age 16) you can see that I only scored a 72 for wrinkles and 73 for spots but in the following photo (skin age 17), those two scores went up to 84 and 80 respectively! The point is, this product does what it says it does! I do suggest you to go easy on the amount you start to use because a small amount really goes a long way!! I like to apply less on my T-zone and more on the rest of my face. Also, heads up it does take a little longer to soak into your face and it has a strong scent for those who does mind that stuff. All in all, it’s one of my new favs in my skincare routine! Works like a charm
