I purchased this because I love DE as a brand and because Stephanie Marie on Youtube said it was moisturizing and helped to define her vermillion edge after regular use. I was less than impressed. It isn’t as moisturizing as my drugstore lip balms and I did not notice any improvement in my lip line. The taste is supposed to be almond, but it isn’t particularly pleasant on the lips. When the product starts to run out, it sinks below the plastic edge and makes application to the lips scratchy and uncomfortable. And as much as I struggled to use this up, I got to that point relatively quickly. Overall, I will not repurchase and would not recommend because I don’t see any situation where this would be a better alternative to a less expensive lip balm like Chapstick or Vaseline. No benefits to justify the cost
