I have very sensitive skin/ mild rosacea, and most products cause irritation and redness.  I’ve used this for years and it works amazing for me.  It’s really creamy, and super hydrating.  Also fragrance free.  My face immediately prickles if I use anything scented. Even if you have perfect skin and no sensitivities this is a great moisturizer! Both my sisters use it now, too, even though they were very skeptical at first. Great for sensitive skin!
