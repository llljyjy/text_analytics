Ok. I was gifted this #complimentary product from @influenster & @drunkelephant in exchange for my honest review…so here we go!.I must admit, at first I was not a fan of this eye cream! Upon first application I felt like it was irritating my eyes, and I had an almost uncomfortable tingling sensation happening. After that first encounter, I changed my routine a bit…I applied it in a thinner layer, with eye patches over the product, and not so close to my actual eyeballs! && soon fell in love. My poor tired eyes, only getting about 4 hours of sleep a night, looked more refreshed and less zombie-like. The more I used this product the more I noticed a pleasant change in the way my concealer would sit under my eyes as well! There was less texture and lines for the product to sit in, and my under eyes weren’t looking as crusty when I applied this BEFORE makeup application. Yes, I pretty much use this product night and day with no complaints!.Needless to say, I will purchase this product after trying it…and I will continue to use it before I stumble across something better. I’d give it a 8.5/10 👏🏻 A must try if you have crusty under eyes!
