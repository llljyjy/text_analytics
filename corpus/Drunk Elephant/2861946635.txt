I’m a huge DE fan and was excited to try out this eye cream. My main concerns are wrinkles and freckling around my eyes and unfortunately, I found that this cream did nothing for them. I have been using it consistently in the morning and evening for about 2 months and I haven’t noticed any difference. Not great for my wrinkles
