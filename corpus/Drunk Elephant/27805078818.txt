After using this product multiple times I would not recommend. I have to use 2-3 pumps to cover my face. It burns for the first couple minutes but then it goes away. If it did not cost $80 I would just throw it away but I am using it since it was so much money. The oil that came with it is good as it does helps soothe afterwards but there is not enough I used up after 5 or so uses. It does make my skin smooth so itâ€™s not a total dud. Not worth the price
