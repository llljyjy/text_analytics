Was only wearing my moisturizer and this, and had been crying earlier that day, but got compliments later about my “glowing skin”. I have bought this full product size three times. I love it because it can work like a skin tint and leaves me “glowing”. Maybe it just works really well with my skin color. Only downside is it does transfer. (I have combination, very sensitive skin.) Am told I am “glowing”
