Thai product is expensive and I didn’t want to like it as much as I did but I loved it. I usually use The Ordinary which is a fraction of the cost and was always satisfied. I received a sample of this cream and it was fantastic. My skin is glowing, it feels great and remains moisturized throughout the day. The smell is light and fresh. Nice ingredient list. My sensitive skin didn’t break out at all. Would highly recommend. Great for my sensitive skin
