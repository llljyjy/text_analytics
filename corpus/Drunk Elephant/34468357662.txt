This adds the perfect subtle tan/glow to your face. It looks very natural and mixes great with my face moisturizer! I have a feeling I’m going to go through this bottle very quickly because I’m using it daily! I saw some other reviewers write that this product was giving them breakouts… I have had one pimple since I started using this, but I’m attributing that to hormones lol I pray this really doesn’t cause acne for me. perfect glow
