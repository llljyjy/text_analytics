I have extremely sensitive skin. I originally bought this to try the Lala cream before committing to a full size. I expected the serum to be too strong for my skin, most AHA products are. I bought this set and the small protini moisturizer to see which I would like better. The protini moisturizer gave me horrible breakouts. I was surprised how much my skin reacted to it. I waited until my skin calmed down and tried the Lala cream. My skin loves it, just drinks it up. I wake up with the softest skin. I got brave and mixed a drop of the serum in with the moisturizer one night. It stung a little the first time, but only for a few minutes, and it cleared up a tiny hormonal breakout that I had. I have been using the Lala cream every night and mixing in a drop of the serum twice a week. This is the best my skin has looked and felt in a very long time. I’ve purchased a full size Lala and have gotten another one of these sets. I don’t need a ton of the serum, so this baby size is working well for me and my wallet plus the travel sized cream comes in handy. nan
