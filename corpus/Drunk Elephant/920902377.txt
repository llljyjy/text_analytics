My favorite day eye cream. I love the texture - it glides under eyes perfectly and hydrates all day. The best part is how well it works under makeup. It’s flawless and actually improves the way my concealer looks under my eyes. I also really like the pump. You only need a little bit of product so don’t be deterred by the price. There is a lot of value with this product if you use the appropriate amount per day. Hydrates all day and improves under concealer
