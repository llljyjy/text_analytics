This product is not a daily night must have since I am a combination type skin. I usually use it on my dryer skin areas. But this was wonderful, the consistency of the whip is actually very soothing to my skin when it is irritated, and the serum smooths over my skin very nicely and doesnâ€™t leave me feeling sticky after putting it on. I would say the product is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but either way I would say it is worth the purchase due the freshness of my face when I woke up in the morning. wonderful, absolutely wonderful
