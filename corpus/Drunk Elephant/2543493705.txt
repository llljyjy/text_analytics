I’ve been using this serum for at least 3 years. Once it was changed to the customer-mixed formula, I found that it became sticky, doesn’t fully absorb, and doesn’t mesh well with other products. The most frustrating part is that it makes my makeup pill even after I’ve let it sink in for 5-10 minutes. I’ve also found the serum dries up and becomes crystallized inside the sprayer which causes it to go everywhere. This is easily fixed by taking the sprayer off and running it under hot water. Overall, it’s no longer worth the price and sadly I’ll be finding a replacement. Unfortunately not the same anymore
