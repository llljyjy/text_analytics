This is one of my favorite bronzers. Just a little bit (at least if you have a light skin tone) is all I need for my cheeks and this looks quite natural and blends easily. One of my favorite uses is also to have on hand just in case I order a foundation shade that is too light. I also use this to mix into those foundations to darken them up a little and it works well for that too! Itâ€™s useful because I can then use my winter shade into the summer without having to buy another bottle of foundation. nan
