This product is amazing and worth every penny. I’ll say right off the bat I was deterred for a very long time to purchase any drunk elephant products due to price regardless of being a clean skin care product junkie. I’ve had problematic skin ever since puberty and now I’m 27. My acne has always been a huge issue. I have combination oily acne prone skin that’s also sensitive. The Sephora employee at the store was actually super understanding about the price but still wanted to give me the best advice, which I appreciated. I was looking for something to exfoliate my skin. Something not too harsh but gets the job done and also has clean ingredients. I had tried physical exfoliants and chemical exfoliants including the ordinary aha-bha mask, alpyn beauty aha face wash (which I still love but only during certain seasons and that was before I tried this), as well as some physical face exfoliants like caudalie’s exfoliating face wash (which both me and my husband like but he has dry skin, which is very different from mine so it worked better for him). The Sephora employee gave me a free sample of this. If it wasn’t for that free sample I would have never bought it. It changed my skin for the better. I have way less acne these days it’s amazing. I don’t like the packaging. The top has become unattached and it’s a pain to get the product out of the bottle now. I don’t like the slide top packaging. I wish for something more simple. But the product is honestly so amazing, it still gets 5 stars. This is the only drunk elephant product I use. nan
