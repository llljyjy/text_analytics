I’ve been using this product for over a month now, and let me tell you… it’s amazing!!! I’ve always been intrigued by drunk elephant products, but the price had always thrown me off. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you this pack is worth every penny! The T.L.C. Serum is absolutely amazing, I use about a pump of it  (this cleared up my acne & blemishes super fast) and a bit of the Lala Retro every night. Hands down the Best skincare duo I’ve ever purchased! One thing to note is that the serum runs out quite fast. Worth EVERY penny.
