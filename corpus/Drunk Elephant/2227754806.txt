Does anyone else struggle with the packaging? The top press part often gets jammed and pops off. It’s such a pain, especially because you can’t easily remove the entire top to access the serum. I wish Drunk Elephant would simplify and improve the cheap dysfunctional packaging. Otherwise, I really like the serum! Debating if I should purchase again merely because of packaging issues. Nice serum. Bad packaging.
