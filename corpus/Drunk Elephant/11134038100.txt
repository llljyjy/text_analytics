It’s surprising to me that people are saying this is too strong. I have very sensitive skin and retinols usually lead to redness and irritation, but I had no reaction with this. I used it directly on my skin without sandwiching it and it did absolutely nothing. I don’t know if the product I received is defective or what, but I am skeptical that it has any amount of retinol in it. And it’s overpriced as all of drunk elephants products are. I will definitely be buying a cheaper retinol in the future. Not effective
