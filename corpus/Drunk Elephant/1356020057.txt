I don’t think it’s a moisturizer, but for my 40-year-old “maturing” oily skin, it’s a dream. I use tretinoin, Vit C, AHAs, so this protects my skin barrier, makes my skin look plump and smooth, while not triggering T-zone swamp. I use it almost nightly rather than as an occasional overnight mask and, while it’s pricy, I think it’s worth every penny. HG “moisturizer”
