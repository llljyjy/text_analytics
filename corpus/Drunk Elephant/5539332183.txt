1st off, I LOVE Drunk Elephant. I use their products religiously. So when I bought this cleanser, I had high expectations. With my experience, itâ€™s gentle and removes my sunscreen great but definitely need a cleansing balm 1st to remove any makeup. Overall I think it does pretty well, however, it burns my eyes something horrible. I did not repurchase this cleanser when I ran out, for that reason. Simple formula
