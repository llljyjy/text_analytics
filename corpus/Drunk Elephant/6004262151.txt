I bought 2 or 3 DE value sets containing the C-Firma Serum, and I can say after several months of using this brand almost exclusively, I think DE is way more style over substance.  Most of their products are super tacky on your face, with the C-Firma being the worst offender.  I too had the previous version before the new mix it yourself version and that older formula was not half this sticky.  While my fine lines did not get any worse, overall Iâ€™m not seeing a huge difference in the look of the slight sun damage I have nor am I seeing any huge improvement of my overall complexion, which after this many months, I would expect.  At this point, all my DE products are very close to being empty and I am just waiting for that day so I can move on and try other skincare kits I have bought in the meantime - Biossance, Glow Recipe and Sunday Riley.  At least I can say that I definitely gave DE a good try, but never again! After 7 months of use, DE is officially overrated
