I love this cream! I recently switched to DE. Side note: I never leave reviews, I do not work in any beauty store and I did not get this as a gift, I bought this myself. I did a lot of research and came across these products and let me tell you, it’s the best thing I’ve done for my skin! These products are amazing! I’ve been looking for a night cream that doesn’t leave my face greasy (I have combination skin) and I FINALLY found it! for the first time my face doesn’t feel greasy or like the product is just sitting on top of it. It absorbs quickly and it leaves my face so smooth, and has no fragrance; it is nothing short of amazing! I love all the DE products! Such high quality. I definitely recommend this! best night cream ever!!! love this!!
