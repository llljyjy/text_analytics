I initially had an issue with the smell. It kind of reminded me of playdoh. Now that it has become a staple, I donâ€™t mind the smell anymore. I do feel like I see a difference in my under eyes and I will be buying more when I run out. I was given this product as a gift to review and I am sad that I fell so much in love with it, only because of the price. nan
