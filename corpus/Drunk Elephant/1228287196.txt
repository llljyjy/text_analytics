This fabulous cream was gifted to me courtesy of @drunkelephant  and @Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. If you have dry skin, or if you have overdone the sun, or had a little too much exfoliation, this cream is for you!  It is a rich, yet airy whip of African oils, ceramides, and antioxidants. Its mission is to protect your skinâ€™s acid mantle, and to replenish its moisture barrier. For oily girls like me, this would be more of a cold weather cream. Perfect for those dry winter days. This formula is rich, but not greasy. It sinks in quickly. It has no scent. nan
