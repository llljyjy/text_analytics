I’ve been using this product for a month now. Since the weather got much colder, I’ve needed more protection around my eye area, and this eye cream is just the right fit. It’s a great consistency- a solid creamy texture with a super soft feel on the skin. It’s very hydrating and comfortable to wear. Within a week it reduced tightness and a few dry patches that were forming. Wears well under makeup too. Would absolutely repurchase! Great for Cold Weather Dryness
