I realized that somehow I’ve never gotten around to writing a review on this. It’s time to correct that:I’ve been using this moisturizer for years—four and a half, to be exact. I got it when it was first released in 2018, recently added in the new serum, and have decided I’ll use both until I leave this mortal coil. Now, it’s not like I haven’t tried other moisturizers; I’ll sometimes be wooed by an interesting formula or see a new release that looks like it could be great, only to regret it when my skin isn’t as soft, balanced, or smooth. I inevitably find myself crawling back, because this formula is an actual goldmine. If you disagree, you haven’t seen the INCIDecoder breakdown on this thing. There is no dupe, no alternative, if that ingredient deep-dive makes your eyes sparkle like mine did. Between the amino acids (it’s like they couldn’t pick, so they threw in all of them) and the *growth factor cocktail?!* Go ahead and check the prices on the SkinMedica, NeoCutis, Biopelle, and Bioeffect EGF serums and creams...I’ll wait. I’ve used 3 of them and the Protini duo makes my skin just as flawless for less $$/oz.-Yes, I bought this with my own money (repeatedly.)-Yes, I DO wait for VIB sales to stock up (I’ve got bills to pay.)-No, I’m not incentivized in any way (but I wouldn’s say no!)I just really believe this moisturizer is worth its weight in gold, and feel genuinely sad for every person whose skin doesn’t tolerate it.tl;dr - If this formula ever changes or is discontinued, I will go through ALL seven stages of grief. Holy Grail
