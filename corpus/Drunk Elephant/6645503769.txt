My go-to! If I am deserted on an island, I would ask for this to be in my survival kit! Iâ€™ve been using this item for 5 years & yes the packaging did change but the quality of the item did not. Each bottle lasts me almost a full year. I use it daily mixed with my face moisturizer & do not need any foundation after using it. A staple item
