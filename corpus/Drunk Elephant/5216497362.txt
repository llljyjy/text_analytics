I personally am not a skincare guru. I like simple regimens that treat my skin delicately and also provide your typical maintenance and results over time. I began using Drunk Elephant after a bunch of reviews and research and this oil, coupled with a few of their other products have done wonders for my skin. My skin glows, both when I have it applied and not. I compliment this oil with a moisturizer more heavily over the winter and a light mixture over the summer. I honestly wish they had something like this for body but I can’t see myself spending that much bank for my body oil. It’s a must have if you have acne prone skin due to hormonal changes or a sensitivity to other oils and allergies. I am a darker skinned girl (420 in fenty) and my dark spots have also reduced.For anyone wanting to know what I couple this with, read below!I use this oil daily with my moisturizer (not from DE) and with a once a week T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial™ AHA + BHA Mask, once a week, A-Passioni™ Retinol Cream with Intensive Hydration Serum with Hyaluronic Acid. I also wash my face daily with a face wash not from DE. Necessary for any skincare routine.
