Love this cleanser so much!! It leaves my face so soft and clean without drying it. I have normal to oily skin/ sensitive and omg this takes away the oilness on my skin without making it dry. I got a little sample of this years ago and I loved it so much I had to buy again. Been using this since. Removes make up like a charm! Love love love! Totally recommend. Amazing cleanser!
