Used “old formula” for years and loved it. I was so disappointed to see the reviews about the packaging, but needed to see for myself. Luckily, I had no issues with pouring, mixing, and pumping it out. It came out much like the old formula. I also have not noticed it being “thinner” as others claimed. The color is different (but I do not care) and it smells exactly the same and feels like I remember (sort of sticky when as it sets into face). I do not know if they fixed the bottles or what, but I would be pretty upset if my product was squirting all over. Will continue to purchase! no issues
