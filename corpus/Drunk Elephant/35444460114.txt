I have officially been using this amazing Drunk Elephant is one of the. BEST AHA/BHA SERUM let alone a Night Serum!! I’ve been using it every other night for the last 30 days and I can truly say My skin looks brighter, smoother and the texture has smoothed out any visibly fine lines or wrinkles. I loved how it help lift away my dead skills cells without actually drying out my skin. It’s very refreshing on and I love waking up to a more even-looking complexion! I highly recommend this night serum for all skin types looking for a moisturizing night serum that resurfaces and exfoliates your skin! Amazed by the results/Best Night Serum AHA/BHA
