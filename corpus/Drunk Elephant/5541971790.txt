Honestly I’m surprised this product doesn’t have a higher rating. It’s fantastic! I’m an avid micellar water user. I’m too lazy to do a whole routine at night after a long day at work and have to wash my face, so this is a great alternative. It takes makeup off without you having to scrub and rub at all, it’s non greasy and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean afterwards. It’s great on sensitive skin also, which is a huge plus for me. No irritation or break outs at all. I’ll continue to buy this product every time, it’s by far the best micellar I’ve used to date. Best Micellar water I’ve used yet.
