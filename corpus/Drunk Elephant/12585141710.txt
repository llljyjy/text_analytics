I use this product to get makeup, sunscreen and motor oil off of my face every day. It does work, but it has a higher melting point than some other balms do, meaning you have to rub it in more to get it to melt which means more pulling on the skin. Iâ€™ve never used the exfoliator that comes with it that stuff is horrible for you. Works but pulls skin a lot
