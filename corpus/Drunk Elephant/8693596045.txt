I got Ceramighty AF Eye Balm as my second VoxBox and i have to say it’s the bomb not only did the packaging and color get me but the consistency and texture of this eye cream is absolutely perfect. Before using this product i was recently noticing that half way through the day my makeup under my would sink into my fine lines and up close it was not pretty. The day I received this product was the day i was going to visit my dad for a few days I started using AF Eye Balm every night and by day 5 this cream has put more moisture and brightness in my over all appearance and i am so thrilled!! Can’t wait to purchase this item when i run out it does wonders, literally!! hydrating must have
