❤︎ Complimentary i’ve been patch testing this for about 2 days (thankfully with no negative reactions whatsoever), & today is the first day I applied it to my face ☺︎ as a retinol newbie, i don’t really know what to expect, but I really feel amazing about this gorgeous little bottle so far! I think the low 0.5% vegan retinol concentration makes it absolutely great to begin incorporating retinol with, & that luscious moisturizing marula oil (which is literally 95% of the formula) feels so gentle + hydrating on my skin! @drunkelephant ‘s inclusion of ceramides also makes my skin just love it even more, especially since it doesn’t include the #suspicious6 ;) I’m so happy this product found me, & I think it’ll be a fantastic place to start retinol with ! Great start to retinol :))
