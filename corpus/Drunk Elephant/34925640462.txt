Love the packaging. The dropper applicator is very easy to use and to distribute the right amount of product that you need. The formula itself is pretty oily but hydrating. Love that it contains retinol but a low enough concentration that you can use to start out. I would suggest doing a patch test to make sure that the retinol doesnâ€™t irritate your skin. It does help with any sort of fine lines and is great for those with dry skin. nan
