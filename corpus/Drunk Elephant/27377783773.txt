2nd time purchasing this product and the container leaks every time I use it wasting the product.  At this price, I expect a container to work properly and not waste/expose the serum to air.  Sephora wouldnâ€™t exchange past a 60 day window for a faulty product even though it was just opened - will not be purchasing again. Faulty container/product case
