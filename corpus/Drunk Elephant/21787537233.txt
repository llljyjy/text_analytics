Iâ€™ve been looking for a deep exfoliating mask for a while. I went the budget option with Curologyâ€™s red AHA peel and that one made me so ill each time- my face would burn so bad and it was so u comfortable that I would feel sick to my stomach. I tried this am Iâ€™m so happy with it! I have combo skin- more towards oily, with mild rosacea- and use Retin-A, BHA and curology. This BabyFacial mask didnâ€™t burn one bit for me. In fact, I was only meaning to keep it on for 10 minutes, and It felt like nothing and I accidentally left it on for 30 minutes. ðŸ˜… I was hardly red after! I couldnâ€™t believe it because I have normally sensitive skin. I used the marula oil and It made my skin soft. I was afraid it would clog my pores because any oil usually does. I only used it once and it made my skin soft. Hopefully more good to come! Made my face smooth with no stinging!
