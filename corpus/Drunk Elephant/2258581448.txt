This product is simply amazing! I add it to my moisturizer and it gives me the best bronzy glow for days I don’t want to wear makeup, almost like a light Cc cream! It won’t cover pimples but if you have some discolouration it will help with that. You could get away with using this+color corrector(s)! The smell is nice and so is the consistency. However, I preferred the old packaging since it was easier to control the amount of product dispensed (it came out in drops-vs. now you squeeze it and you don’t know how much exactly is a “drop”). Depending on how bronzy you want to be, add more drops! I’m not sure if it can be mixed into sunscreen, but definitely serums and moisturizers (one review by Hyram said it could, but I think he posted another later video saying it could not). But if you do want to mix it with sunscreen, it will eliminate the white cast of super white sunscreens (e.g. Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50). Don’t hesitate to buy-it’s a holy grail if you prefer to not wear makeup even 20% of the time!! Holy Grail-Become a Bronze God(dess)!
