This is my favorite cleanser I’ve tried. It’s super light weight on your face and washes off smoothly. As stated on the bottle, it can be used on a dry or wet face which makes it super easy to use this without any hassle or mess. It washes off my makeup well enough, but sometimes I’ll still have mascara left under my eyes. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. I love that it’s composed of clean ingredients too. nan
