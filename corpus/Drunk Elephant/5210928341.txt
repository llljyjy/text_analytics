I have used this for over a year now. I do not generally have sensitive skin. I started with 10 minutes, and now use the full 20 minutes without any problems. I had my grandmother try it for 10 minutes and my mother who has sensitive skin for 10 minutes and they both tolerated it fine. It works hard, keeps skin smooth and decongested. highly recommended. this is one of the top products in my skin routine. really works
