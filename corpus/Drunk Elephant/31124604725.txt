Despite the name of the product is “whipped cream”, it’s actually a pretty heavy product. It’s not light and airy. I feel like you need more product to cover the face, instead of a little going a long way. It does the job to moisturize but I don’t notice anything special that it did for my skin compared to other cheaper moisturizers. Not sure why it would be worth it’s steep price. nan
