While I quite like the texture and spreadability of the product, along with its moisturization, the smell (not bad or raunchy, not perfume either, but almost an ’old’ smell) is hard to get by. Especially as this product caused me to breakout, necessitating ceased use of it, I wondered if the smell wasn’t more indicative of a bigger problem. And I see I’m not the only one complaining about the smell. Thankfully I received a sample of this, and did not purchase the full-size, as I WOULD be returning it had I. I don’t mind Drunk Elephants, but this one just isn’t for me. Disappointing outcome.
