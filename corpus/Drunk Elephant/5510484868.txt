It’s a good oil! I love drunk elephant’s products. I’m also always trying different oils because my skin is really sensitive to oil. This one does the job really well, and a little bit goes a long way. Your skin may feel really oily after using this if you have oily skin like me, so only use a little bit. I did receive this product complimentary and I’m really enjoying it. It’s Good!!
