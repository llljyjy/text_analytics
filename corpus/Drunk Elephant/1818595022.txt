This is a good moisturizer that I have found light and non greasy enough to use either under make up in the morning or at night. The texture is light and fluffy and it is unscented (although the texture kind of makes me want it to smell sweet!). It has not caused my skin to break out and provides enough moisture to protect my skins natural barrier when I’ve been trying new products. It’s a good option with clean ingredients!
