This was my first time using a drunk elephant product and I can honestly say itâ€™s worth the price. The packaging itself is very pretty and I like the pump design. A little goes a long way for this one. It has improved my eye area which gets a little dry when I wear retinol products. I loom forward to using it more during winter. Overall I would recommend this eye balm. Love it
