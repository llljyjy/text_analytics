Been using this cleanser for over a year and recently ran out but i never noticed how well it works compared to other ones i have. ive been breaking out since i havent used this cleanser in a month now. super excited to have my go to cleanser back and how fast it works with getting rid of all my imperfections!   it is a bit drying if you have dry skin like me but nothing moisturizer cant fix!! nan
