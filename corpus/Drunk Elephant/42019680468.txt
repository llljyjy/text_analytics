I bought this mainly out of hype, seeing it everywhere and thinking it was a cool idea. It’s EXTREMELY small, and for almost 40$, its not practical. The tint you get is extremely light and shimmery. Is it easy to use? Sure, you mix it with your moisturizer. Overall, it’s not an awful product that will break you out of anything. I’m extremely cautious of what I put on my skin. Bottom line your paying for name-brand and the packaging, not the product. Extremely Small
