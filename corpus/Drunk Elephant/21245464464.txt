I have combination acne prone skin with some spots for which I was hoping the but c would workI don’t have anything against the product except for the scent (very chemical like) and the consistency which is super liquid. That kind of throws off how much you need to use since you may over dispense the  product. I didn’t notice a major lightening of my spots yet. Really wanted to love it
