This is definitely more of a night time moisturizer because it is a little thick but my skin is very moisturized in the morning and helps with any dry spots I may have! Although it is a little heavy, it settles in pretty quickly and is not greasy which I really like as well! I just which it was a little bit cheaper. Very moisterizing!!
