I love trying out sunscreens but always come back to this guy. Every time I have used this consistently I start to notice my skin calm down, my skin texture start to refine, and my skin tone even out (and this is my bare skin im referring to). My skin is extremely oily and naturally very glowy, and although this sunscreen is nourishing it has a balancing effect on me. Truly my holy grail sunscreen. I keep coming back!
