I don’t know what some of these reviews are talking about. I used this product a couple years ago and really didn’t like it. I then used Summer Friday’s CC me serum for over a year and it did absolutely nothing for my skin. A couple months ago I was looking for a better Vitamin C serum and a Sephora employee recommended this to me because Drunk Elephants is one of few that is an active vitamin C. I’m so happy I decided to give this new formulation a try. I absolutely love that you mix it yourself because Vitamin C is known to go bad quickly so you know you’re getting it fresh. Yes it is on the runnier side but I feel like that’s because it’s not filled with useless additive ingredients. I pump it straight on my face instead of into my hands and then it rubs in nicely. No bad smell and no inconvenient stickiness. I can easily apply makeup over top. I absolutely love this and have definitely noticed it brightening my skin in the last two months and healing some of my old acne spots. I use this every morning on my face, neck, décolletage and hands and it’s definitely worth it. A holy grail Vitamin C for me! nan
