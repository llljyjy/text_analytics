In general, I enjoy and have had success with Drunk Elephant products, although I usually stick to their moisturizers. I’ve tried this product multiple times and “it’s gonna be a no from me dawg.” It causes my forehead to break out! Not deep, cystic breakouts but lots of teeny tiny whiteheads and clogged pores. I already use a retinoid and other exfoliating serums in my skincare routine, so I wouldn’t attribute the breakouts to purging. I think maybe the high percentage of lactic acid in this serum, or some other ingredient, causes irritation for me. I didn’t feel any burning or stinging upon application, but after using for a day or two, I would wake up with small bumps on my face. So, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to be careful with this product. Aside from that, I found the texture to be somewhat sticky and tacky, which was tolerable but not ideal. Also, the price is pretty…pricey! Sticky & Caused Breakouts
