The drunk elephant ceramighty AF eye balm is a moisturizing eye cream that left my eye area soothed and smoother. The cream was luscious and easily absorbed into my skin leaving a soothing cooling feeling. I easily wore it under make up and at night before bed. It has a very light to no scent and I had mo reaction to it. The packaging was cute thatâ€™s always a plus. This eye balm helped me with fine lines and eye area dryness and I enjoyed using it. Luscious eye balm
