Very hydrating eye cream. From the first application, my eye area feels highly moisturized and supple. It layers well on top of eye serum and does not pill. I also find it makes a great primer for my underage concealer as I don’t have to reapply it! Great for use twice a day. I haven’t used it long enough to comment on improvements to bags or darkness. Hydrating and keeps concealer on!
