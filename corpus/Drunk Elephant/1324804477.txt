After 3 months, I have seen absolutely no improvements - rather I feel like this did the complete opposite and caused my skin to look dry, dull, flaky, red and distressed. It also caused me to break out. Not new to retinol - so I understand it takes some time to get your skin acclimated to a new product and go through a “purging” period with retinol .. I used it once a week at first, then twice a week at most, and even paired it with DE’s B-Hydra serum to mitigate potential drying side effects, and also used their Protini Cream, but after 3 months of using Passioni I’m so done with this. My skin barrier has been destroyed for 3 months, my face feels and looks like a hot mess. I would not recommend Passioni at all, especially at this price point. Going to search for a less potent retinol. No Improvements - Destroyed Skin Barrier
