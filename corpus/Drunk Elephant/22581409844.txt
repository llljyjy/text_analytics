This product has become a staple in my skincare routine. With using retinol and AHAs, I need a good moisturizer that does not break me out. With using the DE LaLa Retro moisturizer followed by this F-Balm mask (leave it on over night) before going to bed, my skin has stayed hydrated a glowing over the winter. I have repurchased F-Balm and will continue to as it really is an excellent product. Thanks DE! Please, please, never change this product! I use nightly with my moisturizer and I love it!
