Drunk Elephant has been a part of my daily skincare routine for years now, so when I received this complimentary Ceramighty AF Eye Balm in the mail the other day, I couldn’t wait to try it out. This couldn’t have come at a better time, as I’ve been focusing more on my eyes after learning that it’s one of the first areas of your body to show aging. And well, I’m OBSESSED. The formula for this eye cream is creamy, absorbent and leaves your eyes feeling silky and smooth. My face is glowing! Can’t wait to add this to my morning and evening routine! Drunk Elephant Does It Again!
