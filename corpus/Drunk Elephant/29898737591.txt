I honestly did not want to use this but I got 2 mini ones from a promotion sale & 2 came with what I really wanted to try which was the TLC, Sukari & peptide one (wish it had A Passioni bc I really wanted to try that too but that one didn’t come with). Anyway, instead of wasting the Vit C’s I started using one of the bottles a week ago & wow I can’t believe this actually works this well!!!! I have been using Strivectin’s Vit C/Retinol & I swear by that!!!! I love that Vit C so much that I bought & have 2 bottles of it waiting for me to use but I think I just found my holy grail Vit c & I’m happy but kinda mad that I have 2 big bottles of my other Vit C waiting for me. But WOW WOW WOW! These past couple days I keep seeing such a huge huge difference & improvement on my hyperpigmentation & also acne marks fading. I suffer greatly with acne & every last thing that comes with it & this is actually helping soooooo well & fast af!!!! Like really really fast!!! I know for sure I’m going to purchase the big one of this but ugh what am I going to do with my other Vit C’s :( yes, this does smell kinda weird & it does feel kinda sticky after I put it on but I always put my moisturizer right on top after a few mins so I don’t have to deal with it for too long. Plus, it just works so dang on good that I don’t even care how bad it smells & how sticky it is… if it works, I’m going to pull on through it. I didn’t really like the mixing either bc the powder or suck at the top a little but like I said, it’s all for a reason. To keep it longer & as for the smell, at least we know it’s all necessary ingredients & not fluff. & for the stickiness, use moisturizer afterwards when dry like you’re supposed to!!! It’ll all go away! But for real, coming from someone who didn’t want to use this… this actually works sooooo well & fast & I used a lot of other high end Vit C’s out there & gotta say… this one I’m sticking with. Til I can afford & try Skinceuticals lol TRY THIS! I didn’t even want to use this but…
