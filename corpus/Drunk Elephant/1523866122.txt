I love this product. It took about 5 weeks for me to notice a difference by look and feel but consistency is key. It smells like hot dog water for sure lol but there is a noticeable difference to my skin texture. Itâ€™s smoother, even and firm. I can even tell when I am cleansing my skin with cleanser- my fingertips glide over my skin like butter. I personally will be purchasing another after finishing this one. I found the product mixing to be quite easy and straight forward. I was lucky enough to have a bottle that dispenses the product just fine. im more confident walking out with no foundation on- just spf and mascara :) nan
