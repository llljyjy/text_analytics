The eye cream that is getting job done - smooth, brighter and firmer. The formula is lightweight, even though is containing oils and ceramides, absorbs very fast and hydration lasts all day. It wears good under concealer and eyeshadow, doesnâ€™t crease or crack. After a couple of weeks using it my under eye is smooth and plump. Love the package, easy to manage how much product you get from pump. nan
