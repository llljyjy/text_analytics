I have combination skin that’s leaning more towards the dry side as I get older, and I still suffer from consistent breakouts-ugh. Being a first time “Drunk Elephant“ product user, I really wasn’t sure what to expect. I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer and it feels so nourishing and lovely when I apply it. I currently only use it at night, but it’s light enough for me to use in the morning, as well. I will definitely continue purchasing this moisturizer and will be looking into more “Drunk Elephant“ products! Great Product for my Aging Skin!
