Iâ€™m not sure why this has such good ratings. For the price and reputation of the brand, I expected this to perform better. I felt like the serum just sat on my face and did nothing but move my makeup around the whole day. It feels oily and tacky. At some point during the day, the product got into my eyes and they were stinging. I definitely do not recommend if you have oily or sensitive skin. Might just try to use it at night and not the day time at all. Very disappointed. Serum does not adsorb into skin
