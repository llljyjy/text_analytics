love this product however there are copper peptides in this, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14. Copper and L Asorbic Acid (LAA) negate each otherâ€™s effectiveness. I wish DE called that out as this is a great daytime moisturizer, however there are concerns that it should not be paired with your LAA in the AM. nan
