First time ever trying this product and Iâ€™m so confused! It is IMPOSSIBLE to apply the product on your skin.. It gets a little bubbley when you are applying then dries in 1.5 seconds and is just a sticky mess! You can feel the sticky layer just sitting on top of your skin and it makes it impossible to put anything else on top. STICKY!
