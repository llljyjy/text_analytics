Absolutely loved the velvety texture of this eye balm! Very light/minimal scent. Great combination of skin loving ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised by the added Omega-rich plant oils. I’ve been using it in the mornings to fight off my under eye fatigue & it’s been a gamer changer so far! Definitely worth a try if you suffer from occasional morning puffiness.
