First off— I received this product for free through Influenster in exchange for an honest review.If you’re new to Drunk Elephant or a vet, you won’t be disapponted. I have combo skin that’s dryer in the winter, more oily in the summer, and have issues with texture, especially when my skin is dry. I am only about a week in incorporating this into my skin care routine and this knocked what I was using in place of this before outta the park. I cleanse, tone, and applied this alone without moisturizer afterwards and with, and I don’t mind the feeling of either. This minimized my cheek texture and got rid of the dry flakes on my nose that just seemed to be getting worse the more I messed with them product wise.I am very happy with this product so far and will update my review if anything changes. Goodbye Winter Flakes
