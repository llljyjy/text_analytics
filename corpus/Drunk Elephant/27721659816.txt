Wowza!!! Okay I was hesitant about this because I received Drunk Elephant shampoo and conditioner 2 years ago and it was the worst thing everâ€¦. But this product is AMAZING.  Entirely changed my mind on the company.  This will 100% be my new staple in my skincare routine.  My skin is very oily and my pores always seem so visible, but this stuff genuinely made my skin not only feel amazing but also looked so much smoother!!! The feel is similar to how I feel after applying Elf Putty Primer (and I love that stuff).  I highly recommend this!!! $68 is a great price for this product.  My only worry is that the bottle seems light and I hope the product lasts me awhile. Wowza
