I’ve used this product for years. I’ve already been through a few packaging changes through the years but assembling it yourself takes the cake. This will be the last Drunk Elephant purchase for me. Product has always performed well for me. I switched from SkinCeuticals and have always been pleased. This is unrealistic for some of us who aren’t steady handed. And I’m sorry but if you expect me to finish your job it should be reflected in the price. Plus, it creates unnecessary packaging that immediately goes to the trash. Unbelievable. Back to SkinCeuticals and yes I’ll pay double. Terrible Packaging
