I originally found out about this cream when Sephora had it as a birthday gift and I have not stopped loving it since. I use it twice a day and my face always feels moisturized and supple. On the times that I don’t wash my face (I have insanely sensitive skin and washing too frequently dries it out), I rinse with just water and put this cream on and it doesn’t clog my pores! I will buy over and over and over again!! Amazing Daily Moisturizer
