I had surgery on my sinuses & nose & had a cast on my nose for a week (which meant l wasn’t allowed to get my face wet) & needed something that I could put on a cotton pad & “clean” my face. Picked this up & it was perfect for what I needed it for. Gave me a skin refresh + it was hydrating & didn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dehydrated. Did not irritate my sensitive skin either. Nice milky consistency & you get a good amount of product for the price (especially since it’s DE).Haven’t used it as a makeup remover (obviously) but I’m not sure it would be the best for a primary cleanse. Maybe as a secondary cleanse after a cleansing balm to get the residue off (which is how I’d use it). I think it’s too gentle to be effective (especially for removing eye makeup). But for my cleansing purposes it worked really really well. good for post-surgery cleanses
