The pump sends out just the right amount of product, and it really helps keep my pores clear and I have not had any milia, which I am prone to getting.  I have been using this for awhile now, I don’t think I’ve ever had any stinging or burning sensation  and I do have sensitive skin. I love drunk elephant and I love supporting a cruelty free company with products that actually works. Third time buyer!
