I stumbled upon these entirely by accident, one day in store. Am I ever glad- this is easily the best bronzer I’ve EVER used. It blends out so beautifully and gives that “glowy” look when used with a skin tint or foundation. Can be used entirely on its own to add some depth to fair complexions like myself. It wears flawlessly all day long and doesn’t break out my skin. I will re-purchase this forever! Amazing product!
