I been using Drunk Elephants A-Gloei Retinol Serum for over a month now and Its been working wonders for my skin. I’ve noticed my face has a decrease In red spots and uneven textures. The only negative I would have to say about this product is the smell. It’s not a bad it’s an unscented product that smells like an oil that I’m sure can turn someone off. I don’t quite mind it and it doesn’t leave any residual smell or anything once the product is applied to your face. Overall I think the product  is worth the money. The packaging is very nice sturdy feeling and doesn’t look cheap. nan
