This moisturizer is my ride or die. I’m on my third bottle of it and my skin looks and feels incredible because of it. But I’m giving it 4 stars in the hopes that someone from corporate reads this to know the packaging is seriously flawed. It’s impossible to tell how much product is left so coming to the end is always a surprise. And I can’t find a way to open it to double check that I’ve come to the end or the pump has gone out. Please fix the packaging! (FWIW, I have the exact same love/issue with DE protini serum. ) please fix the packaging.
