This product exceeded my expectations.  I chose to try this as my first retinol product as I read it was a more gentle.  I did need to have a bit of patience as the first week I had the purge with no visible results.  After 2 weeks, however, my skin looked brighter, smoother, and had a glow.  After 4 weeks I saw a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin as well as completely stopped any small breakouts I regularly get.  This is a powerhouse product that does a lot.  I wish I tried this sooner. nan
