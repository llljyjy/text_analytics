This serum is uncomfortable - it is thickly viscous, and remains sticky on your face for hours. It does not absorb, and I’m unable to forget it’s on my face because my skin feels smothered by it. It’s got a bright oily shine, thus I don’t see how you could wear it in the daytime. It’s also highly overpriced - the active ingredient, vitamin C, is itself inexpensive - so you’re not getting a good value from this product. I didn’t use this long enough to gauge its efficacy, though I can tell from the acidity there’s a decent amount of ascorbic acid in it. Nevertheless, there are too many other good vitamin c treatments out there, which are equally strong but offer much better application and value. Intolerably sticky
