I quite liked this balm for the contour of my eyes since it has given it elasticity and in less than a month it has minimized a little the expression marks that I have and I have been able to see the little changes.  And although it can be used during the day or night, I prefer to do it in my routine before going to bed since it leaves a bit greasy. Minimize the expression lines around my eyes!
