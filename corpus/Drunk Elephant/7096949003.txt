I used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and absolutely loved how it felt on my skin after the initial application but noticed it actually dried me out quite a bit. It also caused my rosacea to flare up very badly so if you also struggle with that, stay away from this product. I wish I could’ve fallen in love with this and used it as a staple but unfortunately it just isn’t for me! Wish I loved it
