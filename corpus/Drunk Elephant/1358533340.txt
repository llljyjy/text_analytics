Loved the moisturizer but question the price to value of this product. When it seemed to run out, I opened the container and found out that although it comes in a very large bottle - the space with moisturizer is actually VERY small. I guess this is for the pump - but it is very deceptive and also a waste of plastic. I would rather purchase a bottle that houses only the moisturizer with option to buy a larger bottle where I can see what Iâ€™m actually paying for. That being said - I do like the product so will probably end up buying it again in this format. To Drunk Elephant - please consider changing your packaging. Thanks good moisturizer / deceptive packaging
