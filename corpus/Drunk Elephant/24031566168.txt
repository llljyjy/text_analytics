This product really comes through for when my skin needs some extra calming, while continuing to fight my day-to-day skin concerns.I quickly noticed an improvement with texture and evenness in tone…especially around my nose and chin during (and after) a breakout. For added customization, this product layers really well with the other DE serums and moisturizers (I love a mix and match skincare line). I also have to mention that this smells SO different than the rest of the products I have from this brand. A lot of the DE products smell more “hygienic” or “medicinal” but the combination of oils in this product makes it smell like a hint of fall—without any harmful fragrances! Highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, but still wants to combat uneven tone and texture while maintaining their skin’s natural hydration! This one will definitely be replaced when I run out. Incentivized, but honest (sensitive skin friendly)
