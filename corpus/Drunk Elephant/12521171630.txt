I love this serum its amazing but their new packaging is THE WORST, the lid cracked and it leaks everyone and this is expensive. Tried to return to Sephora but because it was past 60 days they do nothing for you, reached out to Drunk Elephant and they won’t do anything for you because it wasn’t bought direct from them. Don’t recommend buying this because Sephora or Drunk Elephant don’t care about helping you. Horrible packaging, great serum but it leaks!
