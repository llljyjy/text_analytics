I received this as a mini in a Sephora favorites that I purchased, I used this every day until it was finished; I have dry skin and this did absolutely nothing for my skin. It still left my face dry. In my opinion not worth the money. Very thick consistency which was misleading, I was hoping that since it was a thick cream that I would be moisturizing for dry skin. I would not recommend this product. very disappointing
