I had the opportunity to try this product for free through Influenster. Honestly I think it’s all right. If I got this as a gift, I’d love it. For the price I’m not sure … the smell like another reviewer said is similar to cooking oil. I didn’t really think much about it but after seeing that review, I agree. I only use a little bit cuz too much makes it oily. I don’t really like using serums that make your skin look “wet” and this is one of them. I think it’s a decent product but there are other alternatives. At the end of the day, it depends on your skin time. I have oily skin so I’m not sure this fits my skin time but I do see it being a bit tighter. nan
