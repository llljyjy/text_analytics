This is my holy grail cleanser. I enjoy trying other cleansers but I always go back to Ms. jelly!! I have hormonal acne with combination skin and I’m an active make up wearer. After I use an oil based cleanser, I go in with this and it helps clean my skin of any excess make up and sunscreen from the day without stripping my skin either. The formula is like a gel but lather really well and doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes. It also has a light refreshing fruity kind of scent and a little goes a long way. My favorite!
