Is it worth the hype? No. The packaging make it impossible to get all the product out unlike the old packaging.. it’s also incredibly warm… much warmer than the old version. I’m naturally a bit warm and olive and it can definitely disconnect my face from my body with even a slight bit of product. Also transfers to clothes very easy really really average and warm toned
