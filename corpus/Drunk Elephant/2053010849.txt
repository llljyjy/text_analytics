This felt like the perfect product for me to start incorporating retinol into my routine, which I have been wanting to do for some time now. Being new to retinol, I was very careful to start out using this product only once a week, then twice a week, working up to every other day. I also buffered this with moisturizer underneath, using this oil as the last step in my night routine. I didn’t notice any sensitivity using it this way. As with any retinol product, regular use over a long period will likely deliver great results, but I haven’t noticed much of a change yet (as expected). Overall, I would definitely recommend this for first-time retinol users who are beginning to introduce their skin to this powerful active ingredient. Seasoned retinol users will probably find this to be gentle and irritation-free. As always, SPF in the mornings is a must! Great intro to retinol
