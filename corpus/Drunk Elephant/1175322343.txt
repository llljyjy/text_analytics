Received the sample size. It initially mixed well and felt smooth but very runny. First, the pump stopped working. When I opened the top to pour out the serum, it was all grainy and felt like a sugar scrub. Interesting that, once you combine the ingredients and mix them up, the solution “lasts for six months.“ Why not just mix it at the factory and turn it over more quickly with an expiration date printed on it. Seems too gimmicky and not worth the hassle. The old formula went on much nicer and seemed to do as good a job if not better. No thanks
