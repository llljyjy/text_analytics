I like this mineral sunscreen. Yes, it has a white cast. Yes, it is thicker than non-mineral sunscreen. These are the characteristics of zinc (mineral based) sunscreens. Mineral sunscreens reflect the UVA/UVB rays, and don’t absorb/disperse them like chemical ones. That’s why the product is so different. But when comparing 100% mineral sunscreens (there are a lot of mineral/chemical hybrids out there), this one really stands out. To help with the white cast, I apply a medium coverage foundation. just bought my second tube.
