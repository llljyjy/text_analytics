Okay! So, I’ve been buying this product for 2 years! However, I ran out and decided to stop by Sephora to buy more. Sadly they had ran out so I decided to use a different product, BIG MISTAKE! You know that moment where you realize how good you’ve had it? Well, let me tell you that I felt it big time! Before my skin wouldn’t break out unless I went a couple days off my face routine or had been eating really bad. My nose used to be clear of any blackheads and I hadn’t had nose pimples in years! So, I literally spent $34 dollars to learn this sad lesson. NEVER buying another face wash that isn’t this! Pros:Makes your face feel nice and cleanBlack heads freePimple prevention Nice textureA small amount goes a long waySmells goodSkin feels clean but not tightHoliday special promo where they have the jumbo size at a good dealCons:Goes out of stock quickly so just buy it online Holy grail of face wash
