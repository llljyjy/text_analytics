This moisturizer feels SO GOOD!!!! I don’t know how but it’s always cooling on my skin, and smells heavenly. It’s that subtle citrus scent Origins does best- it’s never overwhelming! The gel consistency is really refreshing and a little goes a long way. My skin looks so bright and bouncy after using it. Yas queen
