I stopped using toners and lotions as they don’t do anything for my skin. This was no exception. This dried out my skin and also made me break out, even after getting used to it. It felt like my skin was stripped as well. I don’t think I would have purchased it on my own. I’ve seen it on sale at various other retailers as well so I don’t know if it’s being phased out. Nothing special
