The origins original skin matte moisturizer is the smoothest moisturizer I’ve ever had. It left my skin feeling very moisturized and soft. I have a combination between oily and dry. It didn’t make my face super dry, scratchy, nor irritated. I received this sample through bzzangent. I would highly recommend this to all of my female gems with oily skin. I’ll be buying one every year from now on. nan
