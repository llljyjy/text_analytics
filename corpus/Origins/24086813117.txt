I was so excited to try this product, yet after the first time using it, I knew it was not for me. If I had not spent the pandemic watching dermatologists and skincare enthusiasts online I may not have known what I know now about how your skin should feel after washing, and the way this cleanser leaves my skin is not right. My skin is literally squeaky clean, as in, it actually squeaked as I washed it. I like that the packaging is simple and clean, but it also looks a little cheap and not as premium as it is. On using the cleanser foam for the first time I was already unsure about the texture as I moved it around on my hands, but I gave it a go and even though I knew I didn’t like it, I gave it a fair go. When moving it in circular motions around my face it did feel smooth and leave my skin feeling soft, but I found it difficult to dissolve from my skin and I felt that I almost had a film over my face for the first of the morning.I think it did an okay job of removing minimal make-up but not so good at removing full nighttime glam make-up. It just smeared it across my face.I also really didn’t like the scent. It just smelt a bit ’off’. I wouldn’t purchase it myself, nor would I recommend it. It reminds me of something I would have used when I first started using skincare as a teenager. I think there are much better products on the market for the same price. Squeaky clean - not what you want from a cleanser
