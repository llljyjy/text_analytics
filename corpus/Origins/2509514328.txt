I have super sensitive skin that is generally dry (especially in the winter), but gets oily fast around my nose and forehead. This product was perfect in handling both aspects. I like that it foams (but doesn’t feel like its not doing anything) and it surprisingly lathers up really well. I find that only a tiny bit of this goes a long way to leave me feeling like my face was cleaned. I have extensions on so I haven’t had it near my eyes, but based on the minty feeling I imagine it might burn a little around the eye area if you were to get it in. I’ve used other origins products and out of all the face washes from them that I’ve tried, I would definitely rate this as their #1 nan
