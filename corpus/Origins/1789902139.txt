I’m going through alot these days ever since discovering my kid has to start chemo. My skin was totally out of control with breakouts non stop and didn’t help that I kept picking my skin out of stress. Was happy to try out the Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion. It really helped soothe my skin when I needed it the most and I noticed my pores started shrinking. Love the ingredients aswell especially since I’m making an effort to go cleaner these days. Highly recommend this lotion. Must have for stressed out skin
