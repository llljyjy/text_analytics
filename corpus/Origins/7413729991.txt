This product is very lightweight and goes on very matte. Unfortunately my skin didn’t get the moisture it needs, and the essentials oils in the ingredients irritated my skin making my skin feel like it’s burning. I think it would work for someone with oily but not sensitive skin. Not for sensitive skin
