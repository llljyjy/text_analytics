I follow a 4-5 step Korean skin care system that involves me using different products (Asian and American) in layering the products to achieve my skin goals (hydrated and healthy), AM and PM. My skin care process usually involves layering multiple toners (Korean) to get the hydration I need, so this product being similar to a treatment lotion, it was simple to follow directions and use. This lotion gives an earthy, mushroom, patchouli scent, which I felt like was unnecessary given the pretty decent ingredients list. It was just surprising to see that mushroom was a little bit further down on the ingredients list, but I was more surprised at the other great ingredients listed on the product packaging. As an essence or treatment lotion, it does provide that initial step of hydration and possible soothing of the skin. However, I don’t think it packs enough of a punch (in terms of hydration) to be used on its own before moisturizer if you have oily skin and don’t use cream moisturizers (I.e. gel). It would need to be layered with yet another item, another toner or another serum, before moisturizer. It’s a viscous treatment lotion that is easy to pat into the skin for quick absorption. It’s not tacky or sticky. The scent might require some getting used to but it’s okay, but for some people who may be more sensitive to scents, that may be an issue. I feel like this treatment lotion would be great for someone who hasn’t incorporated any treatment lotions, essences or serums in their skin care routine and are looking for an additional boost to increase their skin hydration and improve their skin barrier. I will use up all that I have but I will not be purchasing this product again because I feel like there are other options available to to me that may do the same job, if not more, but would cost less. Great, but wouldn't purchase again.
