The packaging is cute, and when opening it, it’s a grayish charcoal color with gold glitter infused throughout it. The consistency is on the thicker side and it has a scent that’s a little strong but I cannot find something to compare it to. It terms of use I would have loved it came with an applicator to apply, but it was easy to apply with my fingers or a silicone brush. It feels sticky on the skin but my skin feels smooth and hydrated after. To me the gold glitter is to replicate what honey would look like mixed in the mask. It’s a mask I would use on a self care night, to give some hydration to my skin. I’m hoping with more use I’ll see some significant changes, however until then I have just noticed a nice shine, and hydration to my skin. If you enjoy a mask on a self care day this one is nice to apply. If you don’t like scented skincare this may not be the mask for you. nan
