This was my second time trying a Ginzing product and it was pretty good! I love when my skin looks healthy and glowy and this product definitely did that. It’s a gel formula so it isn’t too heavy or greasy so it’s perfect for oily/combo skin! Also if you are not into fragrances then I would skip on this because it smells very citrusy. Great underneath makeup!
