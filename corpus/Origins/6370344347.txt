I was fortunate enough to try this out and it saved my skin from being overly dry! My skin has been suffering and I haven’t been able to find a product that’s hydrating enough and also doesn’t make me break out. I apply this twice a day after my spf and it helps my skin stay hydrated. Although it’s marketed as a lotion, it has more of a toner kind of consistency which I don’t mind. It’s very lightweight and works well with other products. The scent isn’t overly powerful either. If you’re looking for a boost of hydration, I would highly recommend this product! nan
