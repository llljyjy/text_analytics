Pairs well with the super moisturizing serum/moisturizers I use and preps me well for retinol with a deep clean! I can use really dewy products without breaking out thanks to this cleanser… the only one that’s helped me calm breakouts and I’ve tried everything… a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time too, so the price feels super reasonable. nan
