Wanted to try something new because I’ve been using the ole Henriksen banana bright eye cream for years now. this was not good. I thought this type of applicator would be nice and easier than the pots, but it was a mess. the cap is SO difficult to remove, and you can’t even use the applicator to distribute the product. also, once you get half way done with the product, its so hard to squeeze to get more out. secondly, this is not as good as the ole Henriksen. its not moisturizing and after 2-3 hours my eyes felt dry again. the micro glitters in this are also much more noticeable than ole’s. nan
