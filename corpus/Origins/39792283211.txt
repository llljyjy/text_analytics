This product is my go-to everytime I go to the store. I always want to switch it up, but I can never find the means to do so. This face wash clears my acne in days. If you have dry skin I wouldn’t reccomend, but other  than that it’s a must have! When you use it I suggest to put it in the palm of your hand and mix some water with it to give it more of a milky texture rather than a paste. I noticed it works better. Best cleanser I’ve used.
