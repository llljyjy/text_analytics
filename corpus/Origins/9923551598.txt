This is a lightweight gel that goes on smooth. It took a minute to absorb but my skin did feel noticeably soft and smoother. It’s loaded with natural oils, plant extracts and some acne combating ingredients like salicylic acid and Willowherb too. I can feel what they mean by matte as I’m used to the dewy look that other gel moisturizers give. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing but that could be because this is the first time I’ve tried a matte moisturizer. I appreciate that my skin doesn’t look oily or shiny after application but feel like this would be work best for oily skin types or in the summertime for combination skin types. You can use this moisturizer under makeup as well to provide a smooth canvas. Smooth and soft
