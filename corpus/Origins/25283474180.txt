I absolutely love this product & won’t be going without it! The product has a “natural” smell and is a light gray color. The texture is light and allows for easy spread upon the face. Due to the light texture of the product, you don’t have to worry about over usage of the product! My favorite thing though is that you see results within a few days. My acne has cleared up and I haven’t had any worries about new acne popping up. Every single time I use the product, my face glows and feels baby soft. I highly recommend this product to those that need a moisturizer, want to keep their youth, and to those that suffer from acne! You WILL see a change! Quick Results & Leaves Me Feeling Soft!
