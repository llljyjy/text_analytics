This gel cream is lightweight and has a lovely texture. It really hydrates the skin without feeling heavy- perfect for warm weather. It absorbs nicely, however, it is highly fragranced, to the point where it I cannot wear it on my face. I will be gifting this to family member, as the citrus scent is too strong for my preference. Too fragranced
