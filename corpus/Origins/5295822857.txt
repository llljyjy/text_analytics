So, I’m not sure yet how effective this product is, but what I do know is that it feels so good on my skin. It’s called a lotion, but it’s watery, which I’ve grown to love! It dries instantly and soaks into my skin, doesn’t leave a film and isn’t sticky at all. Just leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated. This is definitely becoming part of my skin routine. So Clean Feeling!
