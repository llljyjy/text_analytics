I love this mask. Compared to Active Charcoal Mask to Clear Mask, this one adds golden wildflowers and fermented honey to help nourish skin. It minimizes my pores as well as hydrates my skin. It doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. My skin feels refreshed, soft and smooth. Because of its ingredients, it has a strong scent that somewhat bothers me. I prefer a version that has lighter scent.
