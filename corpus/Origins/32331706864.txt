I had a pimple on my nose that popped up 2 weeks ago and didn’t go away -like a family member who shows up at your door and overstays their welcome.  I tried salicylic acid from The Ordinary, but that didn’t attack this pimple.  So, I bought this Super Spot Remover and let me tell you, it does work.  It is a really thick serum so a little dab goes a long way.  I applied it and I could feel it tingling straight away.  It dried up so the serum doesn’t stay slick on your face.  This  pimple is finally going away!  Hurray!  This is now my new go to whenever these darn pimples want to pop up on my skin.  Thank you Origins!  My nose thanks you too. The bottle is tiny, but this will last for quite some time. This really does work!
