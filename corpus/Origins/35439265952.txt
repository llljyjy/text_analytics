I used the mask this very morning after a bad night, as I wanted to really put it to the test and see what it would do for my dull and tired (4 hours sleep) complexion. I already used some last week on an evening and didn’t see much of a difference. And today, just like the previous time, I did get that tiny bit of luminosity but again my cheeks were left feeling slightly dry and tight (for reference I have dehydrated, oily skin). What I did like about it, and not seen in many other masks before, is the tone of the mask...it’s got a gold/bronze hue in it and actually looks pretty stunning. Definitely not the plain black charcoal I was expecting! A little goes a long way too and it washes off fairly easily. Smells like honey meets ’citrus coke’, unusual but I like it. However as a mask it doesn’t do anything significant for me, for texture, blemishes or for pores, and that’s surprising considering there are a number of good ingredients in here. Results were just average to good. ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
