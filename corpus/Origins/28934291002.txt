This product feels rich, hydrating, and works like a charm. I like the smell of it, and the packaging is nice and heavy, without being bulky. My skin feels really hydrated after usage, and doesnâ€™t get oily throughout the day like other moisturizers so (especially on a makeup free day). Overall, great product! nan
