Love love love this soothing lotion! I had never used a facial lotion that was quite so liquidy and wasn’t sure how well it would go. It was fairly easy to apply and left my skin feeling refreshed and prepped for the other skincare items in my routine. It didn’t leave my face feeling oily or dry, but rather left it feeling nourished! It has a mild scent which I liked. My skin looks and feels softer and the pores on my cheeks and nose less noticeable. nan
