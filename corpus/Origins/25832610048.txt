I was worried this product would smell bad because of the mushroom title, but it smells amazing! I have loved adding this into my morning and nighttime routine. It is more of a toner than a lotion. It has made my skin look more bright and even looking. I am a fan! I would definitely recommend this. :) I really like it!
