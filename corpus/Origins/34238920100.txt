I received a FREE sample of Origins Check and Balances Face Wash in exchange for my honest review. I guess it’s a soap-based facial cleanser, whose foam is quite dense, with pleasant mint scent. I always use it in my nighttime skincare routine. My combination and sensitive skin had no acne after using it for several times. It also works well as removing light makeup. You can clearly feel the cleaning power of the product, which means it’s a perfect face wash for oily skin. Good face wash overall. Face Wash for oily skin
