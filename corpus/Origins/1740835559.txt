I think I have been buying for at least 7 years, likely longer. Everything about this is fantastic. A little bit of product creates lots of foamy cleanser. I can stretch the 5oz bottle 6+ months. I have oily/oily combo skin that is still acne prone at 37. This has helped a lot, even though its not an acne cleanser. my skincare staple.
