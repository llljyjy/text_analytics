LOVE this product. Even after the first couple of uses, it made my skin so soft and definitely lessened the red that is naturally in my face. I have recommended to so many of my family and friends just for the way it makes my skin feel! I use it after I cleanse my face and then let it dry. I put my moisturizer over top and it is chefs kiss! LOVEEEE
