This is SO drying. It foams like crazy, and the small amount I used was enough in the shower to also wash my chest and shoulders. It’s menthol-y, I assume because of the spearmint oil and other essential oils which can be irritating and frankly are unnecessary. This cleanser stripped my skin, making it tight, squeaky, and red. This is one of the worst cleansers I’ve ever used; I’m reluctant even to use up the rest of my trial size as a body cleanser. So drying and irritating
