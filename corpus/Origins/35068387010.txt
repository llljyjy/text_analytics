So I was so confused when I first put this on. This “lotion“ is actually a liquid, and it’s not a moisturizing liquid. It feels like a toner, but it really does work for soothing skin conditions like eczema. I haven’t seen a ton of calming with my rosacea, but that could take a while! Sometimes my skin feels like its crawling, and the feeling spreads to another area after I scratch. I put this on my body, and it felt great! There’s no worry about it being greasy either! nan
