I really do enjoy using this product, but the fragrance in it is way too overpowering and strong for me to stand sometimes. It does a good job in lightly moisturizing my skin to prepare for make up or my other skin care products that I would like to use. If this can be reformulated into a fragrance free product then I would continuously used this in my skin care regimen. I do find that if you have any sensitivity to your skin this could cause breakouts. I did receive this product in return for my honest review. Too much fragrance
