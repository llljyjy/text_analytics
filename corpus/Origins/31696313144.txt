This has a light gray color to it, but disappears when rubbed into the skin. It feels very moisturizing at first, but when it dries down to a matte finish, my skin feels a little tight. I have dry combination skin, so it could just be due to my skin type. Upon the first sniff, this has a minty scent to it. However, after applying onto the skin, it has this strong, bamboo-ey (hard to describe) scent that doesn’t dissipate after a few minutes. I can’t say whether or not the salicylic acid in this has helped or not (since I haven’t used it long enough), but this would probably suit people with oilier skin types. Overall, it’s an average moisturizer, but the scent is really off-putting. It doesn’t necessarily stink, but the scent is just a little too much. Feels moisturizing, but smells off-putting
