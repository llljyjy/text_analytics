I am loving this Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask! It feels great on my skin,dries quickly and is only needed once a week which is great for how busy I am! My skin feels so relaxed and refreshed afterwards and looks radiant! Iâ€™m just obsessed with it and it smells like honey! Delicious! Wonderful purifying face mask
