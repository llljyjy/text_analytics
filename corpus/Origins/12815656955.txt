The product smells just like black licorice, so yummy. Besides the scent, it has a nice texture and is easy to apply, as opposed to some masks which are extremely messy and/or sticky. It left my pores feeling cleared out. I do definitely recommend using a warm towel (as said on packaging) or hot shower before applying it so your pores are opened up. nan
