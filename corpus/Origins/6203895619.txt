This moisturizer resembles a water cream and my combination skin loves it because it makes it feel balanced and hydrated without being too heavy or greasy. It delivers that refreshing feel of a water cream with its lovely gel texture. It is so bouncy, lightweight and will make you feel awake imediately upon application. It also gives instant radiance. The delicious and soft citrusy scent makes you feel uplifted. I truly enjoy this cream. A little goes a long way yet I love to be generous with it to really appreciate its hydrating and reviving luxe texture on my skin. I also do appreciate the lovely, simple yet well thought out packaging. Refreshing and reviving gel cream
