I have used Dr. Andrew Weil in the past, and had great results. As with so many other products I’ve tried since the pandemic, this is just not for me. My skin is dry and sensitive, and this dried my skin out more. Also, you will see your skin age while using it as it contains no anti aging properties. For some reason, every single product I try with hyaluronic acid is horrible to my skin and breaks me out. It’s hard to find any without it. This also contains a lot of essential oils, so beware. I just cannot recommend it. This dried me out more than I already was, sadly.
