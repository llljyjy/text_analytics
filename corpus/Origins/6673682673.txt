ve been using Plantscription youth serum for 3 weeks now. I put it after after I have washed my face then I follow with an Origins moisturizer. The fine lines around my eyes have reduced which it amazing! The serum itself has a light smell and goes on matte. No oily residue or melts my makeup off. I’ve used other serums in the past and didn’t love them but this one had changed my mind! I got this as a free sample Revives skin!
