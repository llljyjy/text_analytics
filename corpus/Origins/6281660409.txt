I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but I cannot get over the intense citrus smell! I don’t mind products that have some fragrance, but this is really potent. However, I like the moisturizer itself, as its a perfect daytime moisturizer. Not too heavy, sinks well into the skin, and works well under makeup. I also love the caffeine and niacinamide because it really plumps your skin up in the morning, I just can’t get past the smell. I also don’t love that it uses essential oils, as people with sensitive skin may have issue with it and I tend to break out from them. I wish they could make a similar product without the oils! nan
