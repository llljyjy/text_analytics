The smell, the texture, and clean feeling after - all amazing. I keep coming back to this one. While many might dislike the smell, I adore the minty fresh smell and feeling on my skin. It cleanses my combo skin without stripping it, and I felt itâ€™s truly helped me keep my acne at bay. Highly recommend. Keep Coming Back To This
