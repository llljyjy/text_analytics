I received the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion for reviewing purposes. I find the lotion to be an overall good product. It helps cleanse the face for your serums and moisturizer. The smell of the product isn’t my favorite but it not overwhelming. I do feel like it gives a plumps to my skin. I use it morning and night. With my skin being on the more sensitive side it doesn’t upset my skin. I find the price to be fair for the amount of product you do get. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try it. nan
