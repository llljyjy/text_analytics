I received this product and exchange for my honest review. I was looking for a toner so I was very excited to use this. I have dry skin with a lot of redness. I use this more like an essence and then I poured it onto my fingertips and tapped into my skin. I feel that using a reusable cotton round would work very well. Overall it definitely made my skin feel more hydrated and it smells very lovely. It is a very good product. When I use a toner I prefer to have more actives in it which is why I likely will not be repurchasing it once I am done. However if anybody is looking for a hydrating toner this is a very good option. very lovely hydrating toner
