Typically I prefer a glowy finish when I apply my skincare but this moisturizer gave me a glow with the matte look. This is the first moisturizer I’ve had that does that. I really enjoy the fact it settles into my skin and doesn’t just sit on top. The scent is pleasant which is always a plus for me. Definitely recommend! nan
