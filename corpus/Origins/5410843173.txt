Points for delivering a mattifing skincare product. Oily and combination skin types often need more matte products and they delivered that.The scent wasn’t strong, just a slight scent of roses; which was pleasant. While the moisturizer doesn’t have an oily or greasy base to it, it also doesn’t seem to have a very hydrating effect either. It’s very basic in that aspect. So if you’re a combination skin type like I am, it can be a bad thing, if your a dry skin type stay the away from this. If you’re oily, this is definitely for you. If you’re more combination, use in your oily areas and maybe treat your dry areas with another moisturizer. It’s not a bad product, it’s just different and you need to know how to use it for your skin type. Definitely matte!
