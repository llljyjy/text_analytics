I haven’te been able to extensively test this product so not sure on the actual benefits. I did receive this free to review however the company keeps hounding us to review only after having the product for a few days. This has a spa smell, doesn’t irritate my skin but keep that in mind if you’re sensitive to smells. The box it comes in is nice, what I’d expect from this brand. However the actual bottle feels extremely cheap. The texture of the “lotion” is like water or Paulas Choice BHA exfoliant. This makes it hard to apply & not waste product. Again cannot speak to the benefits, I’ll continue using but I wouldn’t purchase with my own money due to the ugly bottle & texture of the product. It doesn’t feel moisturizing or comforting while it’s been applied or after. nan
