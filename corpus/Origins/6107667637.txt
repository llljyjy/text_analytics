I gave this product a try, this product feels much like a toner but SO gentle on your face. It has a pleasant smell. I applied the product with my clean hands. My face felt so soft right after! It did not make me break  out or become sticky on my face, which is great! It did just what it was supposed to. It is a large bottle and will last A long time! Such a great skincare lotion. clean and clear âœ¨
