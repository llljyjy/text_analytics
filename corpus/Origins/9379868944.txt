This is an absolute yes for me. I have tried a variety of serums/vitamin c (drug store to higher end) and this product is the only one that has really helped me out and helped significantly with my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. I am seriously the worst and pick at my pimples. Over the course of the pandemic, I had bad maskne, picked them and got left with scars and hyperpigmentation. I have used this product for a little over 2 months now and not only has it helped (can’t say that enough lol), I love the scent, it’s not sticky, and my skin has a nice glow! I usually do about 2-3 pumps so this has lasted me quite some time. Just stocked up on my 2nd bottle and will keep this in my morning skincare routine. significantly helping my hyperpigmentation!
