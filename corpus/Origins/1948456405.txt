Iâ€™ve used this product over the past few days and I apply it with a cotton pad. I use it as the first step of my skincare routine after cleaning. The product itself does not irritate my skin, no strong smells which are good. It helps to keep my skin moisturized through the day, but not sure how good it is with minimizing fine lines since I had not used it long enough. nan
