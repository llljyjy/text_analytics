The Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion comes in a nice dark green plastic bottle. The lotion has a light, refreshing scent but the viscosity of the “lotion“ is very thin, resembling more of a toner consistency than a lotion. Once applied to the skin, the lotion is quickly absorbed with a matte finish. My skin felt hydrated for about half a day, Overall, I would recommend this product to others if they are looking for light hydration. nan
