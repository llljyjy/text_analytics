I love it! I bought it about 3 weeks ago and been using since. I usually use the Ole Henriksen banana bright eye cream but decided to switch it up and try this. This feels more lightweight but it works great and is a little bit less expensive. It definitely makes my chronically puffy morning eyes appear awake and bright! * Bright Eyes *
