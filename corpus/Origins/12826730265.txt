I’m pretty neutral about this lotion - I really wanted to love it, but for a few reasons this product was just ok for me - not bad, but not great. I have sensitive combo skin and I live in a very dry climate so this lotion seemed like exactly what I needed (note - while it is called a lotion, it has  more of a watery, toner-like consistency). While it did make my skin feel a little softer, I really haven’t noticed any of the other benefits it claims. It did sting a little when I first put it on, but that faded quickly and didn’t cause any redness. It also didn’t really help with my existing redness either though. The smell of this product is pretty strong, so if you are sensitive to smells I would steer away from this. Overall, while this was not a bad product for me, it wasn’t great and I think the results I did get from this lotion are too small to justify re-purchasing this, especially with it being on the pricier side. nan
