I have dry skin and even though the website says it is suitable for dry skin, I found that it was too drying for my skin and left my skin feeling a little bit tight. I like the light gel consistency of this moisturizer and it absorbed easily into the skin. It may work better for me in the summer- so maybe I’ll give it a try again then. I don’t mind the matte finish as sometimes I don’t want to go for a dewy look. I could see this working really well for those with oily skin. There is a slight floral scent but I didn’t find it to be too strong or unpleasant. nan
