I have combination skin, more dry than oily this winter, and I used this mask for about 10 minutes. At first, there was a stinging but I found that to go away after a minute. There was a cooling sensation and I really liked the smell of this mask. I noticed my skin feeling really smooth and pores were smaller after washing off the mask! My skin also didnâ€™t feel dry afterwards. Pores be gone!
