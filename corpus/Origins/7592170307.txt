I me typically never use the term “Holy Grail” but here we are.  The Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion has brought new life to my skin.It applies very much like a micellar solution, best used with a cotton pad. It’s thin but a little bit goes along way. I applied it after my shower routine which involves washing my face with soap then face wash. Even after two washes, the treatment removed further makeup/debris from my face. I was shocked when I looked at the cotton pad. I applied my typical moisturizer and serum after. My skin felt smooth and a new kind of cleansed. I was surprised on how hydrated my skin felt even hours after use. The kind of hydration that I don’t typically experience without the Mega Mushroom. If you have dry skin like me, I highly suggest this product. It honestly made a huge difference for my skin.Also, I love the olive green packaging. It’s very earthy looking and makes my heart happy. Happiness in a bottle
