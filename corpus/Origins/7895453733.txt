I’ve used other exfoliators but none compare to this one. The coarseness is perfect for my skin and easily gets off dead skin, oil, and even gets rid of the blackheads that show up on my nose. I haven’t found anything that could get rid of my blackheads this well. It’s gentle enough not to cut up my face and makes my skin so soft after. Would highly recommend to anyone that wants a physical exfoliator instead of a chemical one. This stuff works better than I could have hoped!
