Loved this mask. Applies and dries down like a typical clay mask, but was a lot more moisturizing than anticipated. Cleaned out my pores, exfoliates gently, and doesnâ€™t strip skin. Wasnt irritaring or drying like some clay masks that purify and exfoliate, so i was able to use this more often in the week. Skin felt baby bottom smooth. Will repurchase again. Favourite mask from the brand!
