I have used this mask for a couple weeks now and have nothing but good things to say about it. It’s easy to apply and you don’t need much so I can see this jar lasting quite awhile for me. It’s rinses off easily too, leaving my skin feeling tighter and refreshed. There is a nice light honey scent to it too which is pleasant. Skin loves it!
