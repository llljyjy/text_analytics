I’ve been looking for a good eye cream for awhile now. There is something about this eye gel that I just love, maybe it’s the caffeine that’s in the product. I love that it’s smooth and hydrating. My under eyes seem more alive after applying this gel and that’s what I need. The scent isn’t too over powering either. I quite enjoy the scent. Very nice
