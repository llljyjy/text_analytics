I’ve been loving this serum. Even though it’s called a serim, I’ve been pretty much using it as a moisturizer and it has fared well so far. I have used it for 3 weeks now and find that my skin feels very hydrated and supple. The serum has a nice earthy fragrance to it which isn’t overbearing at all. I also love that my skin has fewer visible pores and i’ve been able to confidently go out without much makeup! Hydrating and earthy
