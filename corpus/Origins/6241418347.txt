I was excited but nervous to try the solution. I am very impressed with the Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion. It has a nice smell that is not too overpowering. It also melts into the skin very well. I like the consistency. It did not feel oily on my skin and took away a lot of the redness. I will definitely be re-purchasing this lotion when I run out.
