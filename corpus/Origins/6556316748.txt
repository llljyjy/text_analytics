Totally great face wash, only marked it four stars because it’s nothing spectacular. Can be a bit drying for already dry skin. Very frothy which makes me use less which I love. Can’t speak to the long-term effects as I’ve only used it a week but so far so good. Definitely a fine choice for a face wash that does the job. All good
