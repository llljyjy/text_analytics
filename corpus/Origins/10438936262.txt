This mask is great if you want to help clear your pores and acne. There is a little bit of a tingling type of feeling when you first put it on, but itâ€™s not too bad. I think this does a better job with pores and leaving my skin smooth, compared to the Glamglow Supermud mask. The Glamglow mask also helps purify my skin and lighten dark spots, but this Origins mask is better with helping my pores. I would probably buy this product in the future. Great Facemask
