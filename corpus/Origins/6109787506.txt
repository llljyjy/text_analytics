As much as I hate to admit I don’t moisturize as much as I should. I hate the feeling of my skin being sticky. When I got a chance to try this product I was pleasantly surprised with it. I have combo skin that’s also very sensitive. My dry areas have already started to come back to life after a few short days. I will continue using this product from now on. I definitely recommend this for anyone with dry skin. It’s a holy grail! Holy smokes!
