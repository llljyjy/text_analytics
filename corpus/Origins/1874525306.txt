I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and love it as a refreshing toner that also hydrates. I enjoy the scent of the product as well, as it reminds me of lavender and herbs, in a soothing way. I splash the toner on my hands and pat on my face, down to my neck and d√©colletage. I especially love this product when I apply of after a hydrating mist and before a serum i feel like it really sandwiches in the moisture! Plus it feels lightweight and it perfect for summer! refreshing!
