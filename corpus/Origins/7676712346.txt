I have sensitive irritation-prone skin and I think this product helped with that. I would need to use the product for a longer period to see results with my eczema but on razor burn it worked great. I applied it the night before on inflation that was pretty bad and the next morning it was like it never even happened. My skin is dark so I tested this on my roommateâ€™s sunburn to see how it does with redness and she said she felt a lot better after using the product but there were minimal changes in redness. I think this product work but requires continued use to see results over time. I like it
