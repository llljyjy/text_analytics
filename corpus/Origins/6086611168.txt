I really like this lotion. I’m not the type of person who likes thick, buttery, and heavy lotions. Maybe it’s a texture thing? This location goes on smooth. It feels light. I can’t speak to its long-term effects, but I’m really enjoying it. It almost feels like the consistency of a toner. Silky and Smooth
