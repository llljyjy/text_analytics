This lovely lotion from Origins comes in sustainable packaging. It contains benefits of mushrooms with hyaluronic acid. My skin felt soft, smooth, supple and nourished after every application. I have dry skin and it really helped with hydration. Itâ€™s watery in texture and can easily be used in summertime. I loved how sustainable the packaging is. Good for hydration
