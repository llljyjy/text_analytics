I have combination skin which can be very tricky to deal with because products will either dry out my skin entirely or leave it oily. This is the first lightweight moisturizer I have used that actually hydrates my skin AND gives it a matte finish! Plus the grapefruit scent is lovely and refreshing! This is also my first time using a product with Willowherb and I am super impressed with the improvement of my skin tone and texture! Overall, I am so happy with this product and I will continue to purchase it! Original Skinâ„¢ Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb
