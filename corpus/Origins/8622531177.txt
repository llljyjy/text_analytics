The Serum is good. This is my  First time trying out the PLANTSCRIPTION Multi-Powered Youth Serum. The serum is easy to apply . I’ve been using it for 2 weeks now. I use it in the morning and at night time. So far I do feel a slight difference in my skin which feels more moisturized and softer. Though I still need more time trying it out to see if there is a big difference in my skin . The scent has is similar to scent to the adore skin product. I think it’s better than other brands so far. nan
