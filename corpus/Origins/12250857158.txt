I already love a few products by Origins and was super excited to try out this honey charcoal mask. I like to use facial masks at least once a week to help brighten my dull skin one and to purify my skin. I love this texture it looks glittery and is very smooth. A little can go a long way spread out evenly. I just apply and wait about ten minutes and proceed to wash away with just warm water. After each use my skin is softer, smoother and looks refreshed. I reach for this Origins mask over all of my other sheet and clay masks. Great for combo skin type oily to dry. Highly recommend!! Great results
