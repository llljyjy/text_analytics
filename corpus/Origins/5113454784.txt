I was so excited to try this product as I heard great things on TikTok. I went in to grab a little and just before I put it on I noticed the glitter/mica. WHY is there glitter in a product used for the thinnest/most sensitive part of your face?? I used another eye cream for the first time not too long and didnâ€™t realize it had glitter. I stopped using it because my eye area was peeling very badly, then it took two weeks to recover. I just dont understand how something with glitter can be hydrating. nan
