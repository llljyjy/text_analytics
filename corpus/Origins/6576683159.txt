I absolutely love this product, I have very oily skin, after using this I’m so dry and my pores feel very clean, add a moisturizer and I’m set all day. I couldn’t be happier; I’d recommend this to anyone who has similar oily skin. I used origins zero oil for many years till it was discontinued, was hesitant to even try this, and now I’m in love. Acne and blemish free, so happy. Best Ever
