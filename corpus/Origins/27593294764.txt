Really didn’t like this product. The actual content of mushroom extract is very low, it’s mostly just essential oils which didn’t help my skin. Left my skin with some breakouts and just wasn’t the hydrating toner it’s advertised itself to be. I guess the only benefit it did provide was smoothen some texture around my nose. Currently using it on my neck and décolletage to finish up the product, and haven’t experienced any issues but just doesn’t seem worth it honestly. essential oil galore
