I received this free in exchange of my honest review. This treatment lotion is pretty awesome it works great very affective very affordable it definitely showed a difference in my skin went on very smooth lightweight and left my skin super soft the only thing I didnâ€™t like was the scent but other then that everything else was great id definitely recommend Origins
