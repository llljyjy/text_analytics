So when I initially began to sample this product I was very hesitant that it would be something that I would enjoy. I said that only because it’s marketed and listed as a lotion but it very much so has the consistency of my seller water. After about a weeks time I was very happy With how this product helped titan and minimize pores in my T-zone tremendously. Although I do not suffer from red sensitive skin it did help my pores more than almost any product that I’ve ever used. It hasn’t been even two months and I still have a little more than half of the bottle left. This will last me for a long time because it doesn’t take much product. give this a try!
