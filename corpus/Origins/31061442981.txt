This dry skinned face APPROVES!Let me say after having my son my face became so dull, discolored & just my pores were so huge. I’ve used this for a couple weeks early morning and let it dry & my face looks so awake & clean. Because it is a dry finish mask I thought it would be drying to my face but it definitely isn’t. It’s not thick and sticky texture either like I thought. I over all am impressed with the results si far. Add to your routine!
