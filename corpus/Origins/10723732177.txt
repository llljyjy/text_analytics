I used this product for about a month & sadly I just did not see any of the anti aging benefits that it’s claimed. I have combo skin & since it’s winter my skin is on the drier side. This actually made my skin drier. It has no moisturizing benefits at all so I ended up applying this, waiting a bit & then applying moisturizer right over top. The serum also has a bunch of floral & citrus oils in it which can be irritating & drying to peoples skin. I loved the ginzing eye cream I got from them but this one is a pass for me. Maybe for oily skin?
