This reminds me a lot like or almost feel it’s influenced by Asian skincare lotions. The difference being in texture. It does not have the texture of a cream or moisturizer, but more like a milky hydrating toner. Which I enjoy. Perfect to use right after cleansing to replenish the skin. It’s hydrating, softening, and claims to have soothing properties too. I like the flip-top bottle packaging and how it can be opened with just 1 hand. nan
