I am a HUGE fan of Check and Balances! I am 51, and my skin looks amazing.  i use this morning and night with my other products.  I have combination skin, you donâ€™t need a lot, a little goes a long way.  It feels like silk in my skin, and my face feels so clean, without that tightness that other brands give you.  My boyfriend is obsessed too and uses this twice a day as well.  Highly recommend for all ages and skin types. highly recommend
