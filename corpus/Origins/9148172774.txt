I loved this product! It has a lovely not strong scent, it is very light weight and has refreshing feeling. It is not oily at all and leaves my face feeling very hydrated. I noticed a reduction in redness the longer I continued using the product. It feels like more of a toner than a lotion. I highly recommend! Love!
