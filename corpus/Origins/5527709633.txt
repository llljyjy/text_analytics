I really have enjoyed this lotion. I didn’t expect it to be a liquid when I first got it, but it has surprised me how well it moisturizes and soothes my skin. I literally use it everywhere. I have very red, bumpy, sensitive skin and this stuff is like putting a non greasy baby oil on. It makes my skin so soft but doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I love the natural smell of it also! I would definitely recommend this product if you have skin troubles like me! nan
