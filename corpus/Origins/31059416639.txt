I wanted to love this product, but the smell was overwhelming and it left me face sticky. The smell overpowered and stayed with you. The product did help calm my face but I couldn’t get past the smell. My redness did improve and my face felts calmer. If you don’t have an issue with scents it might be great for you. nan
