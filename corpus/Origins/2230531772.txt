I love this moisturizer! Iâ€™ve struggled to find a moisturizer that keeps my skin hydrated while keeping the oiliness at bay. This moisturizer does just that. It hydrates but has a smooth, matte finish after it settles. My skin feels great and looks flawless. No greasy face later in the day. Perfect for combination skin. nan
