Origins Clear Improvement Moisturizer is a very mixed product to me. It works fantastic, but the downfall is the very intense smell. If you get this product you will have an amazing moisturizer that will exponentially help with troublesome skin issues such as zits and blackheads. Be prepared for the very intense smell of peppermint and charcoal and other related scents though as there are over three essential oils in this product. Based on the price tag for this item in most stores I would buy this very rarely, but I wouldnâ€™t rate this item as an every day item either. As for recommending to family and friends, I would personally be a little more cautious as this does contain Witch Hazel and Salicylic Acid, but would still say yes to them getting it. Amazing but Intense Scent
