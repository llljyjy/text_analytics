I was so excited to try Origins Matte Moisturizer. I have combination skin so while my chin, mouth and cheeks are on the dry side, my t zone is oily.Upon first opening it I was upset because I don’t like the scent at all. It is extremely strong in my opinion and I am not a fan. However it wasn’t bad enough to make me not try it. After doing my morning routine I applied it and it feels great on the skin. It has a velvety smooth texture which can probably be attributed to the dimethicone. I was impressed with how matte it made my skin and how long it stayed that way. I will say that it did not do much for my pores but there was a bit of a blurring effect. Also if you have dry skin this probably isn’t for you. Anywhere that wasn’t oily  was made so dry by this. I want to stress how important it is to read the ingredients before purchasing or using a product on your skin. This moisturizer has quite a bit of essential oils in it. While they may provide some possible benefits, they can be irritating to the skin. nan
