I have had this mask/moisturizer for years and always thought it was just OK until the last few days. I accidentally got the worst sunburn on my face that I’ve ever had. My face was painful, borderline ready to blister. I applied layer after layer of my regular Tatcha moisturizer to no avail. Finally I dig out my Origins Drink Up Intensive Overnight Hydrating Mask and applied a thick layer, then fell asleep. I woke up with my face fully healed and moisturized. The red sunburn tint was gone, my painful skin was gone. This saved and soothed my skin. This still probably won’t be my go-to every night moisturizer, but it saved my sensitive skin when I needed something beyond my regular moisturizer, so I’ll be keeping this product around. saved my sunburnt skin
