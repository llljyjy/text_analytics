This is a great everyday moisturizer it’s lightweight and gives my skin a nice glow and I do feel it keeps my rosacea flare ups to a minimal blush especially since i keep it in a mini fridge. I love the pump and that you can twist to lock it, my only problem is It does take a while for it to fully absorb into my skin and when it finally does I feel the need to apply another layer for more hydration so for that I’m glad it comes in a 3.4 oz bottle. nan
