The Origins Mega Mushroom Relief and Resilience soothing treatment lotion work great on my skin. My skin complexion is of darker pigmentation, and I have combination skin with some oily and dry spots. This soothing treatment lotion is light like a toner but is more hydrating. This lotion helped bring life to my skin and calm down the irritations from other products or the daily pollution from the air. The only thing I was surprised by was the fragrance but I also notice that the fragrance doesn’t linger for long. Overall it’s a good lotion and I feel like it’s sensitive enough for sensitive skin or trying to put it after your retinal routine. The Origins Mega Mushroom Relief
