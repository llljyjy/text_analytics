I have used this face wash before and I remember liking it because my face always felt really clean I got this face wash again and it smellssuper refreshing and foams really well. While I still like it, I recently started a skincare routine with active ingredients and it is a bit drying and when using that in conjunction with this cleanser was a bit too drying forskin.I think need more of a moisturizing cleanser when using my other products (esp. in the winter). But I think that if you have oily skin or just want to get that clean feeling & the dayâ€™s oils and build up washed away, this is great. Refreshing, clean face wash
