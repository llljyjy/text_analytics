I have been using Origins Plantscription Multi-Powered Youth Serum for about a month now and can already see results! I use the product primarily in the morning and also use it in the evening a few nights a week. It doesn’t have any unpleasant scents or cause any issues with my face which is something I was worried about since I have sensitive skin. It dried soooo fast after applying but keeps my skin feeling really hydrated which was a surprise. I can see a difference in the tiny little lines under my eyes; they definitely appear to be diminishing and I am hopeful this added step in my routine helps slow down signs of ageing. Definitely a must have in anyone’s skin care routine! Works Wonders!!
