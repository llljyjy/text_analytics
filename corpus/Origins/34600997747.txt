This product was lovely! After a few days of use, I could visibly see results. My skin gets pretty dry, and only a select few products work since my skin also gets oily. This lotion absorbed quickly, leaving behind no oily residues or sticky feeling. I also really loved the smell of it, even though I am usually not a fan of fragranced skincare products. I reccomend it, and would include it in my daily skincare routine. It is very refreshing and moisturizing. Refreshing Lotion
