I really wanted to like this product. I have combination skin that is prone to oily t-zone as well as a dark complexion. I get self-conscious about my forehead seeming to always be glistening so I was excited to try a matte moisturizer. I didn’t expect it to be deeply hydrating but I was hoping for at least a little bit. This moisturizer somehow dried out my skin completely. Even after using hydrating serums before, within a short time of using this matte moisturizer, my skin would be parched. One morning I woke up to find my face flaking from dryness. I use an occasional retinoid but have never been this dry immediately after using a moisturizer before.It is a light, smooth texture that does have fragrance and does leave a film-texture behind. The fragrance isn’t too overpowering and smells a bit like floral soap or conditioner. I like the texture, just wish it were more hydrating. It dries down fast and because of the film it leaves, there is not way to add moisture as it just sits on top of this product.I hoped to make this a body moisturizer instead but even my hands get dry after using this. I hope to find an oily skin friend that may be able to use it because it was a big no for me. Not for my Combo skin
