Between winter weather & the hard water here in LA, my skin has been having a rough time lately. This serum has been a god-send. I’ve noticed my skin looks much more lively and rejuvenated. The serum is very light in texture making it a welcome addition to my daily skincare routine. It does have a slight scent to it, but it is very light, pleasant, and hasn’t given me any headaches (I often have to be careful of heavily scented products as they tend to give me migraines). I also love the size and how travel-friendly the packaging is. Overall, I’m very pleased and would definitely recommend this product to others. Wonderful Addition to Skincare Routine
