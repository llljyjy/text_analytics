The texture of this is really nice - it’s whipped and very silky. Feels luxurious. But I couldn’t stand the smell of this. It’s herbaceous but very pungent. They added way too many essential oils to this. A lot of people’s faces are more sensitive to essential oils, so it could cause some flare ups for some. I used it a couple of nights and did not have any breakouts. Too smelly for me
