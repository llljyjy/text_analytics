I first used this in my late 20s and it helped immensely with closed comedones on my forehead. At some point over the years, I changed products - I like variety! - and forgot all about Checks & Balances. I recently rediscovered this product when I received it as a sample and immediately remembered what I loved about it - a fresh, clean, subtle scent, and a luxurious foaming wash. My skin feels super clean but not dry. It’s a classic and my favorite. It’s also very reasonably priced for such a  large amount of product. nan
