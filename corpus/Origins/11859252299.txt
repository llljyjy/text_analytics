I originally fell in love with the mask from this line, and have now fallen in love with this! It is super hydrating, smells amazing, and doesnâ€™t leave any sort of film on your skin! It feels super refreshing if you apply it after keeping it in a skincare fridge. I prefer gel consistency creams over traditional and cannot recommend this enough! nan
