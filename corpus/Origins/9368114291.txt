For reference, my skin: fair, combo/oily, adult acne, some rosaceaI received a sample of this in a gift bag, so really had no expectations for it, but turns out I absolutely love it. It’s very watery, more of a toner than a lotion - I use it nightly under any serums (usually vitamin C or a retinol) and a night cream. It provides the perfect boost of moisture if your skin is naturally dry or simply irritated. I found it help calm my summer blotchiness/rosacea without breaking me out at all. It also seems to cut the burn/irritation of any harsher products applied on top. I’d say it’s slightly less hydrating than a pure hyaluronic acid serum, but much more calming, which is exactly what my skin type needs. It lasts quite a while, too. I put maybe a dime size squirt in my palms and rub it on my face that way and, with once daily use, the sample bottle I’ve had for months isn’t even halfway gone. Overall, if you want a gentle serum/toner to use under (or after) harsher products, or if you just need a boost of calming moisture, I’d highly recommend trying this. Just for comparison, I’d say the closest thing to this I’ve tried has been Glow Recipe’s Avocado Ceramide Serum (different ingredients, but same claims of redness relief and moisture) and I found this one more moisturizing and MUCH more calming (and more wallet-friendly!). Exceeded expectations!
