I believe the ingredients in this product changed. I used one bottle of it before and had no problem. When I purchased a second bottle after one wash, I had horrible break out on my face. I tried using a couple more days to see if my skin would get accustomed to it but nothing changed. I went and read on the ingredients and found that there is a possibility the ingredients change and I may have had a reaction to something. If you have sensitive skin, pay attention to the ingredients. nan
