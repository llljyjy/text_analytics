I love this face wash. First, it feels thick but in a luxurious way. The way it foams up gives it a spa-like feel and makes it almost more fun just to wash your face. There is a slight spearmint scent which is light and refreshing but not over powering. It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized, not at all tight or stripped. Must try! Must Try!
