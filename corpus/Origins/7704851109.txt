Its watery kinda consistency. Good sized product for the price. I use it as a toner in my night time routine followed by a moisturizer. I did notice that my skin is not as dry as it used to be in the mornings whenever I used this product previous night. I have sensitive dry skin and this did not irritated my skin , in-fact it felt soothing. I am not a huge fan of scents in skincare products. But this has earthy smell that is not too strong and goes away in few seconds. Good product, works great as a toner.
