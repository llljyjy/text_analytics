I have very stable morning and night skincare routines but love trying new products. I decided to insert this moisturizer into my morning routine for a week to see how it would turn out and it’s amazing! It made my skin look smoother and I was literally glowing! It smells really good (to me) but if you’re not used to charcoal it might be strange at first. It doesn’t feel greasy or sticky either. Love It
