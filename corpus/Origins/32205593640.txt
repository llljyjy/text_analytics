I have dry and aging skin (49 yrs).  I also live in a colder climate (Minnesota) and the winter winds can be brutal on my skin. I didn’t have confidence that an oil-free moisturizer would provide the replenishing drink my face needed. I am pleasantly surprised! Original Skin Matte Moisturizer not only is effective, but the mattifying effect also gives my skin a ’blurred’ look that reduces redness and light blemishes.  It also smells amazing.  If you like the scent of citrus (I pick up notes of grapefruit), applying will be a pleasant treat for you.  The formula goes on like a gel and settles into the skin quickly.  Note: I do use an oil cleanser as part of my skincare regimen. When I need a bit of extra moisture I apply it under the Original Skin moisturizer and no breakouts have occurred. Smooth and Refreshing
