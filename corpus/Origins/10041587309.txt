I received this face wash to try out. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin. I use just over a pea size amount cause a little goes a long way since it bubbles up with water. I massage it in for at least 2mins. This leaves my skin feeling soft but I have to tone/moisture right after or else my skin will get tight and dry. This doesn’t irritate my skin either. Though honestly I wouldn’t pay this much for a face wash. nan
