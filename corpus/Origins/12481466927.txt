If you have super oily skin, like me. This is amazing. It sinks into the skin fast & is great to apply before makeup. Doesn’t peel or ball up. Doesn’t leave a film feeling or anything. It disappeared on my skin & my skin loves it. Keeps oils at bay all day, so I can add glow in the areas I want them instead of my oils all over my face. I would NOT recommend this for dry skin AT ALL. You’ll hate it. Keep the bottle tight when not using it bc I swear it evaporates very easily. oily skin dreams
