The Origins Check and Balances Face Wash is a great face wash for any skin type, especially sensitive. I have oily skin and was able to use this to wash away the oiliness as well as it’s great for taking off makeup. I love that I can use a very small amount and it’s enough for the entire face and gives a very good froth amount. The texture is very soft, I would say it feels almost like a soft paste. It has a very slight minty smell but doesn’t leave any lingering smells. It hasn’t caused any breakouts nor left any other sensations. I love this face wash because compared to other face washes, this one doesn’t leave my face feeling dry. Instead leaves my skin soft, smooth, and can tell that it leaves it clean without leaving it dry. I recommend this for any skin type! Great face wash!
