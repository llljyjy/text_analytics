Origins is a wonderful brand! I’ve always enjoyed their products. This moisturizer is nice and hydrating, while also giving the benefits of clearing the skin. It’s also a decent price for the size of the product. If you struggle with little pop up break outs sometimes like I do, give this a go. It’s good!
