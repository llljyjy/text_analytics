This cleanser is my new go to. I’ve been trying to find something to help my breakouts and this is it. The formula is creamy and a little goes such a long way. It lathers really well. The scent of it is light and minty. Super refreshing. Leaves my skin feeling clean and not at all dried out. I’ve been reluctant about trying higher end cleansers because I was afraid of wasting money so I’m so glad I had the chance to test this product out. I received it as a sample but this is completely my honest opinion. Great product! Will continue to buy this cleanser. nan
