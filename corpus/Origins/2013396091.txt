This lotion is very soothing and doesn’t sting upon application like toners I’ve used. It has a watery texture that sinks right into my skin and it has already helped with redness since incorporating it in both my morning and evening routines. It has an herbal, almost medicinal scent but it’s not strong and it fades quickly. Great if you have sensitive skin nan
