I received a complimentary sample of Origin’s Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion from BzzAgent and Origins in exchange for my honest review. Origins never disappoint. This treatment lotion has restored my skin’s barrier by providing amazing hydration and rejuvenation. My skin looks and feels healthy and dewy like never before with a natural glisten. It has also provided amazing relief to my sensitive skin, such as reducing redness and irritation as a result of the current climate. This formula feels amazing and has amazing texture. It absorbs quickly into my skin, and has amazing, clean ingredients. I absolutely recommend others to try it out as well! Miracle worker!
