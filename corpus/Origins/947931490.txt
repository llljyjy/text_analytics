I have used MANY masks. I don’t like writing reviews, but I’m compelled. This is the only one that gently exfoliates and gives your skin a clean feeling, while looking brighter, without tightness afterwards. The only thing is that you need a washcloth to remove fully. Not a big deal. Also, I wouldn’t do this every day. Tip Top
