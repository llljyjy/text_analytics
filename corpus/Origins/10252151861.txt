I was looking for a foaming cleanser and this came up. I’ve been using this for over a month and in my personal experience it doesn’t do anything. This didn’t make my skin better or worse and for the price point I just wouldn’t repurchase again. I will continue to use until I finish it. Not my favorite, wouldn’t repurchase.
