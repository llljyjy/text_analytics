I’ve been using Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion to help smooth my fine lines and add some hydration to my skin. I use both day and night on a round cotton pad and have found that this is just what my dry skin needs. It makes my skin feel so refreshed and I see improvement in the texture of my skin. I love the packaging, the color is gorgeous and simple. This product does have a scent but it isn’t over bearing. It smells earthy and reminds me of a walk in the woods which always makes me feel invigorated.  Who new a product with Reishi Mushroom and licorice would be so nice? I love this. Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed I’m the results. Earthy scent but a hydration bomb to the skin
