I wish i could give this mask 10 stars. I have super sensitive skin. Anything new usually makes me break out. I’m super picky when it comes to my face masks. I was nervous because of the charcoal it would break me out more. But i use this 2-3 times a week and it’s changed my skin. My pores are smaller, my breakouts go away faster and leaves my skin hydrated at the same time. I just bought my second jar and it’s so worth the money. BUY THIS
