This mega mushroom relief resilience smoothing treatment lotion is truly magnificent. The formulation is very different and incredibly unique. This product is unlike anything I’ve used before. The lotion comes in liquid form. I love applying this lotion in the mornings and in the night. I apply this lotion on my face by pouring some of the lotion into the palm of my hand and then gently tapping it with my finger tips on my skin. I find that this lotion gives my face a refreshing feeling. Every time I cleanse my face, my skin tends to feel very tight. I would also notice a lot of dry spots. This soothing treatment has helped a lot and made a difference in skin. The dryness has completely disappeared. My skin feels very soft and smooth. I find this lotion to be extremely hydrating on my skin. I have a habit of developing eczema on my face and this lotion helps so much to relieve the irritation and the redness that can appear. I love that it feels light weight on my skin. I’ve also noticed that my pores have dramatically diminished in size ever since I’ve been using this smoothing lotion. I love that this product is vegan and it doesn’t have any parabens. This is definitely a skincare product that I will be continuously using and purchasing in the future. I love it so much that I find myself recommending it to all my friends. Amazing For Dry Skin
