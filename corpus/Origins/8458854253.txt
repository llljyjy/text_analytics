I’ll start by saying overall this is a really good face wash in general. A pea sized amount is enough to wash my whole face so I imagine it will last a long time. The consistency is very nice and I love the frothiness. However, if you get even the tiniest bit in your eyes it burns like crazy. I avoided my eye area like it instructed but when your rinsing it off sometimes that’s hard to avoid and I suffered the consequences of that. nan
