This is a lotion in the way that a lot of Asian brands classify lotions. It is more like a watery, runner toner/essence. It is super soothing and calming for my skin. It has a light herbal, earthy scent that smells really nice. I love using this when I have any irritation or redness. Soothing toner/essence
