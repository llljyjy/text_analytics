I had some breakouts happening on my chin and neck (sounded like hormonal acne) a couple of them were inflamed, large, and painful and not healing. I looked at some other products and this one sounded good. I got this tiny bottle and was thinking maybe I made a mistake but then I used it and a little bit goes a long way. I applied 2-4 times a day and within 1 day I could see the redness and inflammation calm down and by the third day it was gone. I do have the marks a bit still but skin needs time to heal up and overall I am pleased with the purchase and will buy it again in the future because it does work for me. Effective
