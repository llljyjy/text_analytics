Needing a moisture surge but have combination skin? My skin tends to get oily mid day and sometimes I get scared to use a moisturizer. All skin types need a moisturizer. This moisturizer hydrates my skin but was light and perfect for my skin type. A little bit goes a long way. It felt light and airy on my skin. I love the smell of the moisturizer which reminded me of something in nature. It doesn’t smell clinical like most smell it’s smelled very natural. Matte hydration
