I have pretty dry dehydrated skin even as an esthetician I always have to run to keep up with my exfoliation for my flaky skin. I sometimes get a couple of problem spots around my jawline and cheeks around my time of the month. I used this last night for the first time and it didn’t dry me out at all. It felt very nourishing and didn’t leave my skin tight or parched. It also helped minimize the appearance of a couple of spots that were already on their way out. It also washes off very well and smells like honey. Would definitely recommend! nan
