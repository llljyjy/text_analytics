In my skincare routine, I typically use essences every day. Despite not being advertised as an essence, I use the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion as an essence since it prepares the skin for other products. Upon application, my skin feels hydrated. I also notice that my pores are smaller than before using this product. There are also other good skincare products at Origins, including their face mask, which I highly recommend. nan
