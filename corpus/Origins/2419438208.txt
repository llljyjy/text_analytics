I have oily combo skin and this moisturizer works wonderfully for me. Most mattifying moisturizers give me that mattifying effect but not hydrating enough. However, this moisturizer gives me the best of both worlds. It’s super light, yet hydrating and actually keeps my oilier areas shine free for a full day. It has a soft and velvety texture and absorbs well leaving a natural matte sheen. It’s gentle enough to use around the eyes and doesn’t melt/migrate into your eyes like some other moisturizers. Also wears great under makeup. I love and highly recommend it to anyone with combo skin! Great moisturizer for combo/oily skin!
