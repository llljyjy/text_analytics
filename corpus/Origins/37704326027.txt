I’ve bought this eye cream very recently and I wanted to use it during a month before giving any review. I think this is a good eye cream, very moisturizing, brightening and the fact that it’s tinted works also as a great under eye corrector. I feel that it helped to improve my under eye texture by making it more smooth and it’s a perfect base for applying concealer. Love it ! For a smooth and moisturized under eye
