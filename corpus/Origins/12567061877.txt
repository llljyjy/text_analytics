I’ve been losing my mind a bit lately  over the excessive acne I’ve been having. It’s likely brought on by stress, but the acne and the resulting blemishes only cause more stress. I was so happy to have the opportunity to try this product in hope that it alleviates my struggles. And it came through! I followed the directions, applying a think layer on clean skin for about 10 mins. The mask dries up and then I wash it away with warm water. You could also use a warm washcloth. It’s even more effective if you do it when you pores are a bit more open (like after a shower). I feel like it also helped fade away hyperpigmentation from my blemishes. I have a medium skin tone and people of color tend to really struggle with hyperpigmentation. I will say, however, that I try to use it somewhat sparingly because charcoal can be drying for the skin. I also try to not leave it on my skin beyond the recommended time. Also, be careful when applying it because it can easily get messy savior for my distressed skin
