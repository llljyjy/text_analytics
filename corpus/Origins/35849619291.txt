I liked the texture of this lotion, it is very light and perfect for a summer skincare routine. I donâ€™t like to use products that are thick and heavy during the summer because I feel like they weigh down my skin and do more harm than good. My skin feels instantly hydrated when I use this and it leaves my skin feeling soft. Moisturizing, Light Lotion
