This is an excellent face wash to use to when you’re trying to wash off a lot of makeup. A little goes a LONG way. However, this is not a face wash I could use every day because it is a bit stripping (to be clear I don’t use any face wash daily). I have fairly sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this did not irritate my skin or make me break out. If anything, my skin improved while using this (though I have not used it long enough to be able to attribute that to this face wash). Overall, this is a great face wash option for days that you need a deep and thorough cleanse. nan
