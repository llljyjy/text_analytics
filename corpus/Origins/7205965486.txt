The Origins Clear Improvement moisturizer feels nice and light on the skin. I have many clogged pores due to my skin type. I have been using the product for about a week or so, I feel like to see the “clear improvement” it will take a few more weeks of usage. My skin is also stressed out so that may be another reason why it is taking me personally longer to see an improvement. I would recommend to see if it works for you, hopefully your pores aren’t as pesky as mine. Feels nice and light on the skin
