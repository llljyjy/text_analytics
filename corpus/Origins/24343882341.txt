I received a complimentary sample of Origins mega mushroom relief & resilience soothing treatment lotion from bzzagent to review for my honest opinion. I have been looking for a lotion with these great benefits that help with redness, tightening pores and hydration. I love the water like consistency that is lightweight and fast absorbing. This will be perfect for summer and winter. I am really impressed with this lotion and how well it works with my oily combo skin. I also love that it comes in a big bottle and will last me along time and alittle bit goes along way. My skin looks so much more resilient and plumper and I really enjoyed the relaxing and calm scent of mushrooms reminds me of aromatherapy Soothes redness
