I love the origins brand already and was so excited to try this out. I enjoyed the spearmint scent for a change, and the fact that it will also remove makeup. The only downside is you have to avoid your eyes. I do wish you could take your eye makeup off with it.  The face wash is moisturizing along with removing makeup and without being an oil base (not a fan). A little goes a long way with this face wash. So smooth
