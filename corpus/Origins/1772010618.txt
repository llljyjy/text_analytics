This was sent to me by BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review. Only being given seven days to use this means this review won’t be helpful, and I apologize for that, even though it’s what I agreed to. I usually don’t review any product of this nature until I’ve used something for 1-3 months, which allows time for the skin to turnover at least twice. That’s when you see what it can do, but seven days is a joke. Origins has a fantastic skincare line. I am addicted to their eye cream, especially, so I have to say that I could not see real performance in the seven days of using this serum. I would like to review it again when I run out to be fair to those who are spending hard-earned money on something and really need the community to keep it real with them. Application is nice, but did I see results immediately? No. Take your time with testing out skincare. Anti-Aging Serum
