I have combo skin that tends to be dry under my eyes and around my nose. For that reason I only apply this cream in my forehead (since it’s winter and my skin is sensitive). I’m not super happy with the ingredients but they don’t seem to make my skin feel worse. I’m waiting for summer when my skin is more oily to try this product. Great for summer
