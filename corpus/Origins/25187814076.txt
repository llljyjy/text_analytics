Matte Moisturizer With Willowherb is very hydrating thanks to glycerin and leaves my skin soft, silky smooth, and ready for makeup application. It provides a matte finish which helps to minimize the pore appearance and visibly even skin tone. I love how it feels on my skin, it is hydrated throughout the day for my liking. If you have sensitive skin you should be careful with this moisturizer because it has a large number of skin irritants and artificial fragrances. The fragrance is overpowering. Silky smooth skin
