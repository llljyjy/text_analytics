I really loved this mask a lot, I wasn’t expecting to. While I haven’t noticed much of a change in my skin, it does feel extremely nourished after removing the mask and for a little while after. Not to mention the mask looks beautiful in the jar and on the skin. I wish I noticed more of a difference in my skin to know if there really is any improvement. nan
