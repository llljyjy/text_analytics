This lightweight, VEGAN moisturizer works very well for my combination skin! It’s got a nice gel formula that literally melts into the skin to hydrate without looking greasy or feeling sticky … it just makes my skin glow!! I like using this in the daytime as it’s more on the lightweight side and works well under my makeup. I love it!! Lightweight and hydrating!
