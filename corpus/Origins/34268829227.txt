At first i thought it was doing well but after i was done washing my face i realized it didn’t clean well and then once my skin dried it started to kinda pill. I had to go in and exfoliate after because my skin didn’t look clean and was pilling up. Very good for people with sensitive skin because of no high fragrance and didn’t make my skin breakout or give me a rash . nan
