I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this moisturizer was a good product to fill the space of when my face needs moisture but is also breaking out. It wasn’t as strong as a SA or BP spot treatment, but my skin is too dry naturally to use as it as my nightly face lotion. What worked best for me was using it every other day, under my usual face lotion. I saw a difference in my pores and I’m sure I’ll love it even more when it gets hot out! Works well but too strong for everyday
