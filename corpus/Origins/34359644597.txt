It is very gentle to my skin and when it comes to facial skin it is indeed the top priority. I loves the sense of mint leaves that gives a soothing nature while applying. After use it has started making my skin even and all the dryouts are gone. I use it multiple times a days and very helpful. The most important ingredient broad leaf kelp extract with protein has a good cleansing level which cleans anything on my face be make up or dirts leaving my skin fresh and charming! I highly recommend this product. The foam texture is super awesome Perfect soft and best for all types
