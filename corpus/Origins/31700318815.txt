I absolutely love this moisturizer! I use it every night on my hands before I go to sleep. It absorbs really well without being greasy, and it smells beautiful…like oranges. I don’t use this moisturizer on my face, though. (I don’t think it’s meant to be a face cream). I’m deducting one star for over-packaging. The container which houses this moisturizer is an unnecessarily thick, non-recyclable plastic. (Shame on you, Origins! Please switch to a recyclable container. I feel terrible every time I throw one of your containers in the trash). Nightly staple
