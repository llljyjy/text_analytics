I’ve been using the Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I’m impressed! I tend to have redness on my face and this has really helped reduce it! this is essentially a liquid, kind of like a toner. It is very soothing, and not in an overwhelming way. The name makes it sounds like it would smell like mushrooms or something, but the smell is nice and light. I recommend giving this a try! Soothing & Hydrating!
