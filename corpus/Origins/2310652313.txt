Absolutely love this moisturizer. While it can be used day or night, I enjoy using it first thing in the morning to wake up my skin and give it a bit of bounce. Within a week I noticed improved hydration and radiance. I did NOT notice any pilling that others did. Origins suggests patting the product in versus rubbing it, so maybe that would help. This product did not clog my acne-prone skin and also smells amazing! I love that the new and updated packaging is recyclable, with a cap made from 100% post-consumer recycled material (excluding dyes and adhesives). Bouncy!
