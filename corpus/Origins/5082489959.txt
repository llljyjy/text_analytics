Despite being called a lotion, I think of this product more as a hydrating toner. Itâ€™s has a very lightweight and watery consistency that absorbs easily into the skin. I like to apply it with a cotton pad, or even a patting onto my face with the palms of hands. It gives me instant hydration while soothing my skin and making it more plump and bouncy. nan
