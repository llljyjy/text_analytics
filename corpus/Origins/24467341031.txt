I received this product for free from Buzzagent. I was not expecting a liquid lotion. This lotion has a consistency like water. I think I would have preferred the lotion a little thicker. Otherwise, I love the scent, which has a strong smell of lavender and patchouli. I also love how quick this lotion absorbs. This lotion doesnâ€™t leave any sticky or greasy residue. nan
