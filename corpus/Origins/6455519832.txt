I love this!! I am shocked at how much I like it. I have super sensitive skin with a lot of redness. It made my skin so soft and smooth. I also really like the smell, it reminds me of essential oils. I was taken by surprise that this was an oil/liquid product because it says lotion. I would definitely recommend! Love it!
