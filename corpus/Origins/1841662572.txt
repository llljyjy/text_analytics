I received this Mega-mushroom Relief & Resilience soothing treatment lotion as Complimentary from Origins in exchange of my honest review. I like this lotion, it can calm and sooth my skin, and leaving it hydrated. The texture is a bit sticky but can be absorbed quickly. The scent is not my favorite but it is not bad. I notice improvement on skin healthiness. Overall it is a good lotion. nan
