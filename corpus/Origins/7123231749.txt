I love this product! The following bubbles were extremely gentle and soft on my face. I love the way this product felt like it had cleansing power, but also was quite gentle. I washed away this product with ease as it did not leave an oily or sticky residue on my face. I also enjoyed this in the shower, as I used it on my back for acne from my bra straps. Although this is not an acne wash, I felt like I could achieve a better clean than my regular bar soap. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! Clean and smooth
