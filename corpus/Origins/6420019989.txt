I use Origins for some time now so I was excited to try this. I apply this after I have washed my face. My main concern is dehydration and visible pores. I love this so far! Very easy to apply, sinks into my skin, keeps my skin hydrated and makes my pores less visible. Will definitely be keeping this in my skincare routine. I recommend this product. Love it!
