The Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask is one of my go to masks from Origins. I really like the smell of honey and it leaves my skin feeling smooth. I also like that it does not leave my skin dry. I wish it was in a tube like most of the other masks for an easier application. I recommend it for those looking for a mask. Great Mask
