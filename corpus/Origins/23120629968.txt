I noticed a difference after the first night with this. I know it takes a while for any product to make a true difference on your skin beneath the outermost layer, but the AHAs also help you shed that layer for other products to do their thing. I am sad that I wonâ€™t be able to use this with my retinol serum after nursing, since AHAs and retinol are not recommended together, but I will honestly miss this when that time comes.
