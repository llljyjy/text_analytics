This serum seem like every other serum I have tried the texture is different it’s more of balance texture meaning it’s not too thin or too thick . The serum feels smooths and apples easy on the skin . This serum reminds me of similar serums I got like the Kypris anti-aging  serum . I do believe this serum is more price friendly but I prefer the my favorite serum . This serum feels more drugstore skincare . Some benefits are that the serum is better than most drugstore serums but that only is because of the texture and how smooth it feels on the skin . I honestly wouldn’t purchase this serum because I have serums that are my favorite and work best for my skin type . I would recommend this product for beginners and teenagers so they start using serums and know the benefits of using serums especially if you know which ones are the best for your skin type . Received this item from Buzzagent for an honest review . Not the best for oily skin .
