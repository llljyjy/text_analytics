I would not call this product lotion as it does not have the consistency of your typical lotion. It is liquid and reminds you a lot of water. The smell is nice in light. However, because it is so watery applying it requires patience. You canâ€™t rub it in. You have to dab. It does absorb very quickly into the skin. I did not experience the soothing aspect of it. nan
