I love this product. The formula is moisturizing: not too thick not too light. The smell is light but floral and citrusy. Not overpowering, I like it. No white cast so it would be great for darker skinned gals. Only reason I took off a star is because I don’t think it does that good of a job tone correcting. With spf it will automatically prevent dark spots, but I don’t think this would treat existing ones nan
