I have been using this moisturizer for years. Probably about 7 years give or take. Nothing moisturizes while keeping my skin hydrated and soft during the day. I’m giving it four stars because I’ve been using it for so long and there aren’t any improvements or alternative products. For example I wish this product had a color correcting alternative. I have a lot of redness and don’t like wearing makeup everyday so I wish this moisturizer came in a green tint to take some of the redness away while doing what it currently does. It would also be nice if the moisturizer had some SPF in it. I know Origins has other moisturizer with SPF but again this is the perfect moisturizer for my skin. It would just be nice if this moisturizer came in an alternative formula or two to fit a variety of daily skincare routines. Great Moisturizer! Wish there were more options.
