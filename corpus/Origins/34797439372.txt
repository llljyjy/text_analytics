It’s okay . I was excited to try this but once I did my skin wasn’t thrilled . Although it’s good for hyperpigmentation and other skin concerns it is not the best for oily skin. Which I have . I personally wouldn’t recommend it to anyone and because my face did not enjoy it I gave it away to a relative A little disappointed
