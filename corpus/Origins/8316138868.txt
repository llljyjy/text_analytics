Overall I think this is a really nice gel moisturizer, and although gels are my favorite kind of moisturizer having combo skin, I feel like this one in particular is lacking in moisture retention. It applies really nice and it dried out matte, but when I wake up the next morning my face feels tight and dry in certain areas. I have tried following with a thicker serum and that seems to work best, but if you don’t want to have a longer skin care routine this may not be for you. It has a pleasant and light scent and the gel consistency is not greasy at all. My favorite gel moisturizer is Belif’s Aqua Bomb and this one’s close but not as great nan
