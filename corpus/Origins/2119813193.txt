Left this in a hotel accidentally on purpose. I was gifted this and thought it would be great to try on a trip to Florida, Idaho then bank in Colorado. I know it has a cult following. It reminds me of those early 00s cleansers that left your face squeaky clean, dry and tight. I just don’t get it. This was terrible, especially when we have today’s amazing marketplace of products that didn’t exist back then when this junk first popped up. Two stars because it doesn’t smell like a 00s cleanser at least. leaves skin tight and dry
