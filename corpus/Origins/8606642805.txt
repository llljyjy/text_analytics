I wanted to love this product. Unfortunately it made me break out in tons of little pimples. I thought maybe my face was purging because I know that can sometimes happen, but it never stopped. I used it for about 3 weeks and returned the product. I tried Youth to the People’s vitamin c and it’s soooo much better. sensitive skin beware
