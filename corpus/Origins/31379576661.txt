I love this treatment lotion by Origins! It is super moisturizing and feels soo good on the skin. It is alcohol-free, so it doesn’t dry out my skin at all like some toners can do. This is called a “lotion”, but it’s a thin liquid so I use it as the “toner” step in my skincare routine. In my opinion, this is a lower priced alternative to La Mer The Treatment Lotion and works just as well! It has made my skin softer, more radiant and boosts the overall glow of my skin! I definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good toner/treatment lotion that is good for all skin types! This is definitely a holy grail product. Definitely going into my skincare rotation!!
