I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks now & It’s easily become my favorite day time moisturizer. The consistency is gel like, very hydrating, and leaves my skin looking brighter. I instantly love anything with vitamin C or Niacinamide so I’m a little biased. But this works well with my combination skin. I definitely recommend this moisturizer if you’re looking to have brighter skin. Must have !!
