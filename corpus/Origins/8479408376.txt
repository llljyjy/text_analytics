I thoroughly enjoy this face wash. A little goes a long way and my face always feels very clean after use. My only complaints would be the smell and it makes my skin feel strange when washing off, but goes away quickly. I usually only use in the shower because it is a little challenging to wash off but overall I really enjoy it. I will continue using this product. nan
