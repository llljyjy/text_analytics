I have rosacea and sensitive skin. This was nice during the winter, when a lot of moisturizers sting my dry skin (super harsh winters where I live). This was always soothing and comforting when my skin was super dry and tight. BUT it doesn’t do anything beyond that. It did not soothe redness or improve my skin sensitivity as promised. It just didn’t hurt my skin when it was at its most sensitive. So if other moisturizers hurt your skin when it’s dry, this is for you. I liked it, but didn’t love it and probably won’t order it again. Good for sensitive skin but doesn’t help redness
