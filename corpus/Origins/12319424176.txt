Unfortunately i did not enjoy this cleanser. I does a good job at cleansing the skin but the problem is that it is very dyrinh and strips the skin so bad. Even when you’re massaging the products in your hands to apply it on your face, you feel that your hands are also feeling dry. Wouldn’t recommend this! strips the skin so bad
