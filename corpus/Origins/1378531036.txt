I really love the Origins Checks and Balances Frothy Face Wash. I do have combination skin when it comes to my face, with some dry spots. This Face Wash really left my skin clean, refreshed and hydrated. I also love that it contains floral essential oils. This Face Wash is definitely a keeper, and I would highly recommend adding it to your skincare routine. Refreshing Face Wash
