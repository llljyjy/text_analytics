I am not getting any younger and winter has made my skin want all the moisture. This serum is so refreshing for my face. The smell is the only downfall. It’s not the best smell but it’s not awful. It honestly does smell like a plant.  It doesn’t linger on your skin once it is rubbed in. Can’t wait to see how mr skin looks months from now. Greer Serum!
