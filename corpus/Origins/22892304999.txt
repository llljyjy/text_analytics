I having been using this product for a week, I have to say I really love the way it made my skin feel. You would think since the main ingredient is  salicylic acid  it would dry out my already dry skin. However it does not, it keeps my skin hydrated all day and also the charcoal really clarifies my skin as well.  The first night i put it on I could feel a break out starting to come up, i woke up the next morning and it was completely gone. I was impressed it stopped the breakout! I have been using this every night to ensure my skin stays clear. Their is no sticky residue ,The consistency is light, absorbs well into the skin. Stopped a Breakout
