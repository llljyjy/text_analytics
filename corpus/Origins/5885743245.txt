I paid out of pocket for this product. I bought it without looking at the ingredient list just because I kept seeing it on social media. There are so many essential oils and fragrances in this product. Even though my skin did not react/ allergic to it, I decided to throw it away because I prefer fragrance free products on my skin It's a perfume
