I received this free for my honest review from Bzzagent and Origins. For the record my skin is dry, acne prone, and sensitive. Nothing has been working for my skin because Iâ€™ve been doing the most with peels and acne treatments. This Origins Soothing Treatment helps with hydration and soothes redness. I put this on overnight and woke up to my skin more plump and less red and irritated. It also works well in the morning and will be apart of my new routine. I will keep trying it out because it works well so far! Soothes Redness and Irritation
