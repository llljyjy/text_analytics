I loved getting to try this moisturizer. I have blemish-prone, sensitive skin, so it is a challenge to find products that work for my skin without drying out my skin. This product did just that. It feels super nice and was not irritating at all. While, I feel that I saw some benefits such as reduced redness, it would have to be used more consistently for best results. Received complimentary from BzzAgent. nan
