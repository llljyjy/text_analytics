I suffer from a lot of redness and acne and this product reacts with my skin like a dream. It’s super lightweight and watery, which can be alarming the first time you use it if you’re not expecting it, but once you get used to it it’s a very nice change from the typical heavy facial lotions. Within days I noticed a significant decrease in my skins redness, and while I haven’t noticed it help with my acne (which it doesn’t claim to), it definitely hasn’t made it worse and I didn’t notice any breakouts linked to it. Great for redness
