A little goes a long way. I squeezed too much in my pictures.This face wash leaves my skin quite soft. I wouldn’t use the word “frothy“ to describe it. It gets bubbly like most face wash. -1 stars since it didn’t remove my eye makeup very well. Overall happy with how the product works. It smells nice too. nan
