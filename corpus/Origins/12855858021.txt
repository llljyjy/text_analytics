Overall very pleased with this product. At first I wasn’t sure what to expect but my skin loved it. It feels very cooling when applied to clean skin. I used it both with a cotton round and directly with my fingers. It has a strong “earthy” scent but it really didn’t bother me. I would recommend if you have redness on your skin. My skin loved it
