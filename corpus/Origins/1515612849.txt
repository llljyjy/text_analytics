This face wash lathers extremely well, even with just a tiny amount of product (and the bottle is huge so would last a really long time!). It froths and foams very easily to cover the whole face and feel soft on application. My only complaint is the feeling after you rinse it off, the skin feels like after you use bar soap and need a lot of hydration. Nice face wash
