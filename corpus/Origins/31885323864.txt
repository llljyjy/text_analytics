I was really excited to try this moisturizer because I have a lot of sebum bumps and the only thing that helps keep it at bay is retinol or salicylic acid pads. The first thing I noticed is that it smells like toned down salicylic acid. It feels minty and it absorbs easily and quickly. It does leave a slight shine but I don’t mind it. I don’t see immediate results like I would if I were to use a salicylic acid pad but I do like that since it’s a moisturizer, I don’t have to use a pad and moisturizer separately. 2 in 1
