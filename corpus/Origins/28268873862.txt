My first impression of this mask had to do with the smell. This product STINKS! Before using, while using, and after using, this product smells bad. I thought it would go away but it doesn’t. This is easy to apply, but very hard to get off. At first, I tested this on my forehead, and even with a small section, I struggled to get this mask off. The efficiency of this mask is simply okay. I didn’t notice any drastic changes to my skin other than removing oils. I still had pimples on my face after using, and struggling to get the mask off didn’t help with redness. I wouldn’t recommend this mask to people. Stinky
