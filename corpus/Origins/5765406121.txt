Received this in exchange for review. I have purchased GinZing a couple times over the years, and this reformulated version is just as nice! I’m not a huge fan of essential oils in my skincare, but these did not irritate my skin and the scent didn’t linger. I’m pretty sensitive, so this was good to find. It’s a light refreshing gel that isn’t sticky and didn’t pill. Has, e.o's, but doesn't irritate my skin
