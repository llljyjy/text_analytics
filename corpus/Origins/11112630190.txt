The origins brand overall has been a good one in my experience. Testing out the Check & balance face was more than worth it. With a cute packaging it was easy to squeeze the product onto the tips of finger but note a little goes a long way. Compared to other face washes this was foamy just with a little and it was hydrating even after washing. My face felt clean and fresh after removing the product from my face. I would more than recommend this product It was checked & balanced
