Okay, so at first the texture of this lotion might seem odd, I’m not going to lie. It’s very, very thin compared to a lot of other lotions I’ve used so it threw me off at first. But once I gave it a chance I LOVED IT! I’ve suffered from Rosacea all my life so this was like a dream come true when I used it for a few days and noticed an actual difference in the redness levels of my skin, especially in the summer. It feels soothing, gentle, and is awesome for super sensitive skin like mine. I’ll definitely be making this a staple in my routine! Bye Bye Redness!!
