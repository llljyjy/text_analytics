I have somewhat sensitive and very acne prone skin and I love this product! I was surprised, however, to know that it’s not like a regular lotion even thought it says “lotion” on the bottle.. it’s liquid! Use it like a hydrating toner! It’s skin PH friendly which I LOVE!! My skin personally was less red after using it and it felt so much smoother and calmer! I usually get red when it’s hot and this helped soothe my skin! Most toners I have used in the past are too dry and harsh on my skin so I definitely recommend for a hydrating/refreshing toner/lotion! Great for acne prone and skin redness!!
