I have super oily skin, and live in HOT Texas heat. I’d skip moisturizer altogether if I could, but I have some combination patches that get dry, and moisturizing helps everything else go on smoother. Of all the oil-free this and that I try, I really like this moisturizer because it does on light and dries quickly. So many other “gel“ or supposed water formulas take forever to dry, especially if my bathroom’s hot, steamy and humid after my shower. With this moisturizer, I don’t have to wait nearly so long before it dries and I can put on my makeup. I can’t say that it keeps my face “matte“ during the day. But I use a combination of various products that all combat the oils on my face. This is one of the first steps in that routine. Dries quickly
