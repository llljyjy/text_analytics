I like the formula of this product but the packaging sucks and really takes away from it. The spongey applicator looks kinda gross after a while, it’s really hard to get the lid off, and it’s also difficult to get the right amount out of the tube when it’s about half used. I got this as a sample and liked it, which is why I purchased, but I would actually recommend the inkey list eye cream over this, I’m going to go back to that one once I’m done with this. ehhh it’s ok
