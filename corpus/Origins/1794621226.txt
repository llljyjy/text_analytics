Okay…I just bought this today and tried it as soon as I got home. I can’t speak to the “benefits” but I can tell this. product. is. GLITTERY. If that doesn’t bother you then you might like it but I do not like glitter on my face at all not from highlighter, bronzer or blush and so to find it in an eye cream and an absolute no for me. I will be returning. Glittery!!
