I hadnâ€™t tried a face wash from Origins. I love this face wash. I was surprised by how gentle it was on my skin. I have oily skin and I have to be careful or I break out and this is just perfect. It takes out any dirt from the day and I feel so clean. I definitely recommend. Gentle Face Wash for Oily Skin
