This thing completely messed up my skin. Ive used this moisturizer for about a month and I have breakouts all over my face. This is the only new item/brand that I’ve used, so I feel like it has to be this. I got this because it said it was good for redness, but I’d rather have red cheeks  than acne all over the place. I haven’t had breakouts like this since I was in high school. Very disappointed. Also, this moisturizer is a cream, but I didn’t feel like it offered that much hydration. I’m reverting back to my gel-cream/gel formulas and hopefully I can get this acne under control in the coming weeks. Immediate Breakouts. Don't bother.
