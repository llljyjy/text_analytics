I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from this or where in my skincare routine to put it but overall I’ve had a positive experience using it. It’s not at all a lotion, it’s more of a toner. Liquid consistency. Non irritating for my skin at all, and is very light. No stinging, tightness, or anything of the sort. Absorbs super quickly and my skin feels softer and fresh after using. I can see it toning down redness a little bit, but nothing extraordinary. I’ll finish the bottle (it’s big!), but I can’t see myself adding it to my permanent skincare routine. soothing/just ok
