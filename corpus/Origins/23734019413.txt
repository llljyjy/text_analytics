Iâ€™ve been a long time fan of gel cleansers that have foaming properties. As of late my skin has been dry and I gave this cream based foaming cleanser a try. My skin is thanking me tenfold. This cleanser has the most invigorating yet calming smell and sensation on the skin. It makes the experience of washing my face so enjoyable. A little goes a long way, and it build into a beautiful lather. It also easily rinses/wipes off. In addition to keeping my skin hydrated, it has all the good acids to keep my pores from clogging, increase cell turnover, and prevent excessive oil production. I am so happy this is now in my routine. Give it a try!! New Go To
