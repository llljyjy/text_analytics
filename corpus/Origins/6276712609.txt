This serum is more of a cream/gel hybrid, then gel. Unlike other serums, it absorbs quickly into your skin like a cream would and doesn’t drip down your face. I do feel like it could be a moisturizer if I didn’t know that it was not. There is no smell/fragrance and it didn’t make my face breakout or irritate it. It left my face smooth and the moisturizing aspect lasts throughout the day. nan
