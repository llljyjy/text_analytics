I absolutely love this product!! I use it as part of my daytime routine because I need the moisture without it being too heavy. I can definitely tell a difference after using this product.  My skin feels much more radiant and I can tell it helps my skin stay hydrated without it feeling too heavy or greasy. After just a week of use and only during the day,  I can tell my skin feels smoother. I love that a little goes a long way and that it quickly absorbs into the skin.  I had no issues with laying other products on top either. The smell isn’t unpleasant. It’s a very earthy smell but dissipates as soon as you apply it to your face. New staple!
