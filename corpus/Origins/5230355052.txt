I like this product a lot! Firstly, a small splash goes a long way- about 5-8 drops can cover my face and my neck which is perfect. It’s lightweight, and very very gentle. I haven’t noticed any overpowering scents or anything. My skin has been breaking out due to hormones, and this stuff has been soothing. I’m very much enjoying how radiant and soft my skin looks afterwards. I recommend this! nan
