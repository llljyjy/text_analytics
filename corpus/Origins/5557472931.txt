I have tried Dr. Olenhesker, Clinique, Vichy, Saturday Glow eye cream and none of them have worked for my under eyes. I have pretty dark under eye circles and tried this one and it INSTANTLY brightened my under eyes. Im not sure if it’s tinted but it’s perfect for when I don’t want to apply concelear or colour corrector and im just lounging at home.  Best eye cream I have used yet. Worth the price. instant results!
