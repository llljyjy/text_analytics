This mega mushroom relief lotion is so good. I use it morning and night as a serum to help relief my skin irritation. It helps smooth out the skin as well it serves as a hydrated lotion which is important because I can definitely get some dry spot on my skin. The lotion itself is lightweight and at the beginning it has a light scent that disappears within a few minutes. Overall Iâ€™d definitely continue using it. nan
