I am 53 years old with sensitive skin.  This is the ONLY face wash I have ever used that actually makes my skin feel clean, without it feeling tight and screaming for moisture.  It literally squeaks and feels soft and moisturized at that same time.  Magic!  I can even put Plantscriptions serum on after it and it doesn’t sting.  Then the anti aging face cream, and my skin is ready to go to sleep.  It’s pricey, but worth every penny. Squeaky clean without drying.
