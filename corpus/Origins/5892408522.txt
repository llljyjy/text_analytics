The first thing I look for in products is the ingredients and this product has very clean ingredients and is free of fragrance and other harsh ingredients that may cause dry and tight skin. The consistency of this face wash is nice and although it is gentle on the skin, it does a great job of breaking down makeup. Highly recommend Gentle yet effective cleanser
