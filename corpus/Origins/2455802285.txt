I stumbled across this at a Ross store and decided to pick it up. It’s truly the best beauty item deal I’ve found at any of those stores!  I put this on after my night serums and my skin is so hydrated and plump in the morning, and my skin tone looks great!  I went back to see if I could find more but there weren’t any. I’ll absolutely pay full price for this when I’m out.  It’s favorite night moisturizer! Amazing!
