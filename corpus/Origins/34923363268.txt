a no for me. it does clear up acne, just not as efficiently as other products. the size is definitely not worth the price. it’s difficult to apply especially if you plan on using other skincare products on top of it (ie. sunscreen). does not help with acne scars. it stings your skin, and it’s nearly impossible to apply on more sensitive parts of your face like under your eye. you’re better off using pimple patches than getting this product, as they basically do the same thing except the former is much more ergonomically sound than the latter. ehhh
