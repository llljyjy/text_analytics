I started using the product by applying some product on a cotton pad and applied it on my skin in the morning and nights. I have a lot of redness on my face and I’m always looking for a product to help reduce my redness. This product did work a little but not a lot. I didn’t see much results with my pores to minimize. It did leave my face hydrated which is important since I have dry skin. The smell wasn’t too overwhelming. Overall this product was okay since I didn’t see major results Good Product
