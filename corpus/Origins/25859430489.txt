Been using this for a year. I find the SPF 25 beneficial as you donâ€™t need to be worried about wearing sun-screen at least when you are home after applying this moisturizer. Find it a bit heavy on skin which will suit dry skins better that oily or combination skins. My skin feels good after applying it but next time I may try something lighter that absorbs better rather than feeling heavy on my skin. nan
