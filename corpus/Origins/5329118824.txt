This is a cloud-like moisturizing sunscreen. I was able to wear it under my makeup without it pilling. It moisturized without making my skin oily and it didn’t make me breakout. I don’t know if SPF 25 is enough in the summer for my fair skin, but it’s good for the winter. Good Moisturizing Sunscreen
