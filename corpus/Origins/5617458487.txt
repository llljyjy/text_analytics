I’ve tried origins product and the ones that I’ve tried worked very well with my skin type. This was a gift and trying out this line was very good. I like how it feels when applied. The only thing that was deceiving was the name. When I first got the item I thought it would be a cream face lotion but instead it is a serum. But other than that it’s very hydrating Origins
