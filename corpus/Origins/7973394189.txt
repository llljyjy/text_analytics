It leaves my skin matte! Oily T-zone gone. It matifys without drying out my skin. My skin is a combo of both and this works for everything it very moisturizing and non greasy it has a nice scent that goes away fast if your worried about that. Any other product that states it will make my skin matte will eventually dry it out and I will start to look like a dry chameleon. This does not do that. I will repurchase this moisturizer as soon as I run out. No shine here!
