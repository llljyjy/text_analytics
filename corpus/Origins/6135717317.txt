I wish it was just a LITTLE bit thicker, but of all the under-eye creams I’ve used since trying to find a replacement for Benefit’s Ooh La Lift, this is the best so far. It feels nice and is not cakey. The applicator could be better though (on the tube version), it is difficult to clean without wasting some product. nan
