Like many of the other reviews state, I haven’t seen much of a chance in the physical texture or feel of my skin, BUT it does feel so soft and soothed! This is really such a gentle product that doesn’t upset my sensitive skin in any way. I have loved adding this product into my morning and night time routines and can’t wait to to continue using it! Love this product!
