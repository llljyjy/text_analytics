This is a “just come back to it” kind of face wash. It’s one of my old reliables. I’ve used it on and off since I was a teenager. I’m now in my 30s, so that longevity tells you this is tried and true for lots of people! It’s just a well rounded cleanser. The smell isn’t over the top, it’s creamy, not too hard on my dry spots but still cleanses my oilier forehead. My acne has mostly faded away as I’ve gotten older, but when I had moderately bad acne this was still gentle, didn’t make breakouts worse (it also won’t clear them though, so if you have acne or very oily skin, I’d maybe look for something more specific to that need). Highly recommend for combination/dry skin. Gentle, light scent and good for combination skin
