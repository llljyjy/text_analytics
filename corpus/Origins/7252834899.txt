Overall I do like this product, but since it contains salicylic acid in it, it caused my skin to purge for a while. I think I prefer lactic acid over salicylic acid if I had to choose between an AHA or BHA chemical exfoliant, I would choose the lactic acid (AHA). I find that that is better for my skin type (dry). But the packaging of this product is super nice and high quality. The cream is pretty light weight and not thick at all. Nice
