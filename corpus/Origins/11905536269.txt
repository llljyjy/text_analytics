I have oily-combination skin and this moisturizer has helped a lot in my morning routine. I love how fast absorbing this is and that it doesn’t leave a greasy finish. I’ve noticed that excess oil production and shine have reduced. I will warn that this has a citrus fragrance and essential oils that may irritate those with sensitive skin. I typically use a toner, essence, serums, moisturizer, and then sunscreen for my AM routine. This really does leave a matte and smooth finish that creates a perfect foundation for my sunscreen since that formula can be too moisturizing. I received this as a gift from Bzzagent. Great for Layering Products
