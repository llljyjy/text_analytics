Origins Checks and Balances Frothy Wash Face feels so luxurious. It has a light mint smell to it that awakens your senses and makes you feel refreshed. A little bit goes a long way. I use about a pea size. It gets frothy, then foams up nicely after you add water. My skin didnâ€™t feel stripped or squeaky, just renewed.I have oily skin that is acne prone and sensitive. I get really oily in the morning. I use this after I wake up. I have used this for about two weeks now and noticed my skin glowing more and had less breakouts. I would definitely recommend!
