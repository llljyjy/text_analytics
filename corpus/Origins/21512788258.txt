This soothing lotion works great and leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The smell isn’t to great to me but the way it makes my skin feels definitely makes up for it. It’s not a strong smell also which is nice for me. I like the fact it isn’t a thick lotion and it’s not to watery it’s just right. My elbows are the toughest skin and my elbows feel amazing after using the lotion. Works great
