This is one of the first products I used with Origins. It was a very refreshing mask to use and it really helps make my skin feel smooth and nourished. Whenever I feel that my skin is bumpy and dry, this mask was great in solving my issues with swelling and redness. It also helps with not making my skin dry and more healthy despite it not being a hydrating mask. A unique feature to this mask that I noticed is that it has a cooling effect once you removed the mask after application. I liked it as it gives a refreshing feeling when I do my skin care. Refreshing Mask!
