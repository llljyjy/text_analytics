I received this product free from BzzAgent and Origins in exchange for my honest review. Now, I have been using this product for over a month now and I have really enjoyed it, but I have needed to make some adjustments in its use. I started by using it every day twice a day, in the morning after washing my face and at night before bed. Unfortunately, this was a little too much use of the product for my skin. The moisturizer does contain salicylic acid so overuse can cause irritation (and the definition of overuse can vary from person to person). Personally, I use this product at night after washing my face and I have absolutely LOVED it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized in the morning and I noticed a clear difference in my acne after continued use (a little over a month now). I love the way my skin feels after applying it, and I have to resist the urge to touch it! It smells very refreshing and light, and it never feels overwhelming. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to others, specifically, those looking for additional help treating their acne. Love it! But cannot use as suggested...
