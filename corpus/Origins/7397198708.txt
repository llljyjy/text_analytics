This is a very unique option for soothing lotion. The consistency of the lotion is of water and that surprised me, but when I put it on it was amazing. It is very moisturizing to the skin and is best applied with a cotton ball. I think it has an earthy type of smell which isnâ€™t unpleasant. A nice soothing lotion
