This is a toner, not really sure why they refer to it as a lotion. It’s supposed to balance your skin pH, everything all other toners are supposed to do. I haven’t noticed a difference at all between using it and not using it. It hasn’t changed my skins texture or improve any of the imperfections over the course of my 3 week usage. I haven’t noticed any downsides however. A lot of products cause me to breakout, and this product hasn’t. I wouldn’t recommend it, try another toner. Haven’t noticed a difference
