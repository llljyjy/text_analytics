This smells MIND BLOWING! Feels amazing on my skin, going to use as a nighttime lotion because it has no SPF in it even though it says it’s ok to use AM/PM. Although it says matte it gives me a subtle sheen which is simply perfect because you don’t want to be completely flat looking. Definitely recommend to anyone seeking a smoothing and hydrating feeling lotion, would most certainly purchase! holy mother of god
