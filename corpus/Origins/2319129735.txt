I received a sample to try and this mask is really fantastic—from the scent, texture and consistency, to the results. The smell of this mask really is of honey, and it has a fantastic consistency where it’s very easy to apply the product and a little goes a long way. The texture is also fine, not gritty, and it feels cooling on the skin. It took about 10 minutes for the mask to dry, and I put it on after cleansing my skin. The mask washed off beautifully and made no mess which I really appreciate. My skin doesn’t feel dried out but it feels calmer and clean and soft. My skin looked smooth and glowy with the first use. I will definitely continue using this and absolutely recommend this product for anyone with normal to dry skin, as well as sensitive skin like me. Great mask!
