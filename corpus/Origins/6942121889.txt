I’m always fighting my oily skin and enlarged pores. When you open the container the mask charcoal color with gold specks in it. It looks very luxurious. It does have somewhat strong honey smell so if you don’t like honey products, this will not be for you. It took about 20 minutes to dry for me. It went on easy and a little goes a long way. It washed away fine but it did make a mess (just like any other charcoal mask). My skin was hydrated and felt great. I’m hoping to see some purifying results with continued use. Great mask for combination skin
