This product didn’t work for me at least. I tried to give it some time for my skin to adjust but my skin just didn’t respond well to it. Maybe slight improvements but I’ve had better results with the Philosophy spot treatment, which I will be switching back to. It was difficult for me to purchase the Philosophy one in the US so I thought I’d give this one a try. nan
