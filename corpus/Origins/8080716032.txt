Let me first say how I love the minty scent that this face wash has. It’s not overwhelming but rather light which is nice. I love the consistency which reminds me of marshmallow fluff but smoother and not sticky. I tested it to take off my full face of makeup and it understood the assignment! my face was so clean after rinsing it off. I do recommend using a moisturizing moisturizer after using the wash. I found that it cleans the face so good it dries it out a little. Overall, I’ve had a great experience and it’s a must for me in my routine. nan
