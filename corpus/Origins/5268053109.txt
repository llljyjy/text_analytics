I liked this mask. The packaging is super cute and the mask feels good on my skin, not too tight. It does have a strong scent, but I like it. It’s a spicy charcoal scent and the mask is brown with a shimmery gold in it. My skin felt good afterward and it didn’t cause any acne or sensitivity. I’ll have to use it more, but so far so good! I like it!
