Love the packaging, it’s so cute and pink. Product is great for my skin and smells heavenly! I have sensitive skin so I usually avoid products with fragrances. In order to try this, I patched test on a small area and then proceeded to apply it on my whole face. Surprisingly I did not break out even after continuous use! It leaves a beautiful matte finish and I imagine would be great to use in the summer. It doesn’t feel thick/rich enough for the harsh winter in NY. The only reason I took away one star is it contains fragrance. Other than that, it’s a great moisturizer and brand! lightweight and beautiful matte finish!
