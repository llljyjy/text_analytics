Received as a sample. I really like it as a morning eye cream as it adds a slight highlight and brightness around the eye, because of this I donâ€™t use much or any concealer. I use a better eye cream at night, as I find any lights reflecting ingredients can be irritating if used too frequently. Either way I really like this eye cream and will be purchasing the full size during the next sale. nan
