I have been struggling with painful hormonal acne breakouts and used this to help. After my first time using it, the pain from the pimples was almost gone by the afternoon and some of the redness went away too. I was surprised to see these results since I wasn’t expecting much but I’m really excited to keep using the treatment lotion and see how it improves my skin some more. Helped with my breakouts!
