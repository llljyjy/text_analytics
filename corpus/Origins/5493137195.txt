This product works great to make skin firmer and smooth. I used this on my legs, arms, hands, face and neck. It immediately soaked in and started working. It has a nice subtle smell. The packaging and ingredients are all made from healthy materials. The only thing I would change is that the formula itself is super thin liquid, I wish it was a thicker gel or cream. Other than that I love it and will continue to use it. nan
