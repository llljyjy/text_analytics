I love this moisturizer. I have a oily skin and it’s hard to find a good moisturizer that won’t make my skin visibly oily with the makeup. But this moisturizer does a real good job of mattifying my face. Works great with makeup. I only recommend this product to anyone with oily skin otherwise it’ll make the skin super dry. Love it
