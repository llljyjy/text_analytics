This eye cream is pretty run of the mill to me, not really anything special. I need my morning eye creams to hydrate and also prep the skin for a fairly heavy under eye concealer routine, which I felt that this did. I donâ€™t like the sponge applicator as it soaks up the product (which there is not much of), but I think that this packaging could be useful for travel. Good for travel
