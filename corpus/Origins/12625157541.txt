I’m gonna start this off by saying yes I did receive this product free to test out… but holy cow am I glad I did. It has cleared up my acne SO much it’s not even funny. It’s left my skin so soft and glowy but in a healthy way, not greasy like it was before. This is a holy grail product for me because I feel like I’ve tried everything with no results. I’m so glad I decided to take pics before using it because looking back now at it and seeing that big of a difference is amazing. I will definitely continue to buy this product. Picture shows before and after 2 weeks of use, same side of the face. Truly Impressed
