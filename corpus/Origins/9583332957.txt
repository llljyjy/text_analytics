This Origins Clear Improvement Purify and Nourish mask is really nice! It applies so smooth and dries really quickly which I like. This mask contains a lot of oils so it smells A LOT like essential oils which could be a little overwhelming if youâ€™re sensitive to smells. After washing off it left my skin soft and smooth! I like using if after the end of each week to give my skin a little refresher. Gives a very clean glowy look. I highly recommend this product! Really nice!
