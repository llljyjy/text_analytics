I’m really fortunate to have found the right nightly ritual to keep my acne at bay, so I can’t comment on whether or not this clears skin. However, the GLOW I got from this was incredible. I’ve been looking for a product with salicylic acid as the main active ingredient, so had to give this a try. It was DEFINITELY DRYING I’m not going to lie, my skin peels and flakes when using this, a bit at first and then got better with time. But my skin is used to super rich/oily calming moisturizers like Weleda (love that, highly recommend too) but my skin brightened immediately when this one is on, something I haven’t found before in a moisturizer that didn’t totally break me out. It has that cool tingly feeling of when your skin is super clean, but without the tight dryness when your skin is totally stripped. You can see the hyperpigmentation I have naturally, my chin tends to be on the dry side so it’s still red in the photos even with the moisturizer. It doesn’t hide anything but it does make my skin look really bright and fresh. It’s hard to describe, I definitely recommend at least trying it as long as you don’t have super sensitive skin, which either this might not be for you or you have to take it extra slow. I’ve only been using it every other night for two weeks so I will update next time I break out on if it can clear it faster. Also, no face makeup in these photos, just eyeshadow, eye liner, mascara, and faded lip tint (and fantastic 7 pm sunset lighting to be totally fair) The GLOW is 10/10
