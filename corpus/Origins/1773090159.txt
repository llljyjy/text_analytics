I received this product complementary and exchange for my honest opinion.I like the way this mask smelled and felt on my face. When I apply the mask to my face it had like a little golden shimmer to it, I think thatâ€™s because of the honey. I like the way how my face felt afterwards. My face felt soft and hydrated. I noticed after a couple of days there was a few breakouts, but that is normal for me when I try any new product. Overall I gave this four out of five stars because it took a while for the mask to dry on my face even though I put a very thin amount. nan
