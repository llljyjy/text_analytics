I love it! It says its a lotion but i would say its more like a toner! I use it after cleansing my face and I’m surprised with how well it works! I’ve noticed my face is less red since i have started using it and its so easy to use! The scent is a bit different but nothing that’s unbearable! Definitely recommend and will be purchasing again! Works wonders
