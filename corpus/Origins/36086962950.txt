The Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion is one of the best skincare products Iâ€™ve tried. It has thin consistency (almost like water) and goes on smooth upon application. I have sensitive combination skin, this product moisturizes my skin perfectly without making it too oily. Just make sure to you shake the product well before use. I definitely recommend this product! Amazing skincare product!
