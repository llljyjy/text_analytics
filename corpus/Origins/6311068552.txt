I have tried several eye creams or serums. They either did nothing for me, caused an allergic reaction, or didnâ€™t work well under makeup. BUT THIS!!! I have loved using this from the very first day. It absorbs into my skin, depuffs under my eyes, smooths the fine lines, and wears beautiful under my makeup. Also this jar lasts a very long time with daily use. I have incredibly sensitive eyes to certain products that can cause a breakout or allergic reaction and this does just fine. I hate throwing holy grail product around but this just works for me. Th Best
