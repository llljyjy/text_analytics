I didn’t listen to the reviews and thought I could still love this despite the weird taste mentioned- I couldn’t. It’s kinda soapy or chemical tasting and it’s hard to get past. Also the tube is pretty small. The moisture wasn’t really absorbing into my lips either. Gave three stars just because it has spf. tastes nasty trust us
