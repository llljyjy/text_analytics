I have tried other SPF setting sprays, but this is the only one that does all of the following: 1) sprays well, 2) actually works as a setting spray rather than just something to apply SPF over makeup, 3) dries into a decent smell (like all spray sunscreens, it smells bad on application), 4) leaves my skin hydrated but not “dewy” which is a must for an oily face with fine lines, 5) doesn’t bother my eyes. I don’t recommend this for your main SPF, but it’s great for added protection and actual makeup setting. nan
