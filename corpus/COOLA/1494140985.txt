Weird applicator— can see what they were trying to do, but it didn’t work— also the oil doesn’t seem to have staying power so I’m unsure how practical it is at sun protection that lasts even after oil has sunk in.  I love SPF In lip care— but I don’t trust it in this formula. I’d rather the Fresh balm in spf 15. nan
