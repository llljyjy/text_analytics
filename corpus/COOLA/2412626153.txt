I purchased this elsewhere because it was on sale, but I figured I’d review it here because there are still no reviews. I have very fair, acne-prone, oily skin (sometimes dehydrated from Tretinoin), with mild rosacea. My skin can also be somewhat sensitive. That being said, this sunscreen doesn’t irritate my skin or break me out at all. It’s not greasy at all and doesn’t make me oily. It has a nice, light scent, no white cast, and sinks in quickly. It also has a really pretty pearlescent effect on the skin that is lovely on no makeup days (It looks nice on my fair skin, but I can’t speak to how this will look on darker skin tones). Also, the bottle is absolutely adorable. I haven’t worn this under makeup, so I can’t speak to pilling in that regard, but it hasn’t pilled overtop of my skincare. I plan on using this for days when I’m not wearing makeup so that I can get the full effect of the pearly sheen. The only things I wish were different are the price (so expensive for the amount to be used daily) and the level of spf (I wish it was more like 40-50 spf because I’m super fair skinned and on Retin-A). This definitely isn’t going to be for everyone because sunscreen, and skincare in general, is so personal. However, I’m really enjoying it and would suggest you give it a shot if you’re on the fence. Beautiful
