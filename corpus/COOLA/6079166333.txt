Not a big coola fan, not even a huge sunscreen fan, but I’ll buy anything with “dew/dewy“ in the name. I hate the feeling and look of most sunscreens but this is gold. It dried down eventually but made my skin look plump and amazing. I was worried it would cause a white cast due to the thickness but I patted it in with my fingers and it dissappeared completely. Im happy to be wearing sunscreen again. nan
