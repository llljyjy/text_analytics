I remember getting this as a sample and then buying the full bottle shortly after because it’s so good. It keeps my skin feeling refreshed and dewy looking. It’s winter so that helps. The scent isn’t overpowering. It literally smells like coconut and is clean. It’s alcohol free and VEGAN! Best part about this too is that it contains skin protectant (sunscreen) so you don’t have to worry about applying any prior. Definitely one of my go-to products all year round especially in the summer time when my skin is glowing. I’ll continue to buy this stuff for a while until I get sick and tired of spending my coins on it. :) FAVORITE THING ATM
