This is a great lip oil for summer! The applicator is a bit quirky and takes some getting used to, but it does help you make sure that you don’t put too much product on your lips, which is a plus. The formula is nice, and I find the taste to be mild and pleasant; I don’t taste sunscreen at all. The oil is also a lovely natural color on bare lips, but works well over other lip products too. Best of all, it is one of the few lip products that is actually SPF 30 or above, since we all know anything less is worthless. All in all, I think it’s a solid lip oil and will be wearing it at the beach and pool all summer! I only took off one star because it’s not quite as good as my holy grail Dior lip oil, but I’d probably rate it 4 1/2 stars if I could. Great for summer!
