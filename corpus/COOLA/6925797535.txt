I got this lip oil spf thinking it was going to be moisturizing while protecting my lips from UV rays. It was very drying and super slippy where it barely stayed on my lips even without moving them much. It tasted like sunscreen but the scent was pleasant. If I had my original receipt Iâ€™d return it. Ended up reaching for the COOLA lip BALM spf more. The applicator is also very peculiar in a way that makes application messy and uncomfortable. Drying lip oil that slips off my lips
