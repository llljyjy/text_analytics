I was looking for something to reapply sunscreen over makeup and I wanted to give this a try… it was okay I definitely wouldn’t use this alone for sun protection but I felt a little better about having SOMETHING to reapply with. Biggest downside was if I got any in my hair while spraying my face it would get SO dry and would leave my hair feeling crunchy. nan
