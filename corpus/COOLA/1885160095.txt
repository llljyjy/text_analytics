After years of zinc craze and many products that left me prone to sun spotting, I found coola. It is the best sunscreen in my opinion. Preventing burning while not leaving the skin prone to sun spotting. Be careful ladies, so many products lead to excessive sun spotting!!!! Pay attention to your skin, especially when using SPF! Some places still ban certain SPF products, they’re not all good. Thus far, this one I have not had issues with. Current favorite SPF. Finally found a sunscreen that won’t trigger spots
