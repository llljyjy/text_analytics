The ONLY reason this doesn’t get a 5 star is because it simply isn’t enough spf protection on its own. Inherently, as a mist - you’re not going to be able to rely on this to effectively cover all of your skin - but instead you can use this as a “topper“ and supplement whatever SPF you’re already using. Otherwise, I LOVE the fine mist, the scent and the great finish it provides! Doesn’t get super sticky like other similar products and smells great. For those saying the scent is too strong, I find it dissipates rather quickly. Spray all day!
