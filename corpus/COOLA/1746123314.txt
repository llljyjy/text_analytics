Wonderful product! I struggle with oily skin and have been looking for a new spf. This is truly Matte and wear wonderfully under makeup. Has controlled my oil very well. Smell isn’t bad, I realize other reviews complain, but it doesn’t linger. Consistency is a bit thick, but overall not a big deal. Wonderful SPF
