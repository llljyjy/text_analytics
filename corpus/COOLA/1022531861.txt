I went into the store looking for Lancome UV Expert, which I absolutely LOVE. This store did not have the product and the beauty adviser suggested that I try this product, and said it was so much better than Lancome! NO. IT IS NOT. I used this for the first time today and my makeup looked absolutely horrible over it.....dry and cakey looking, something I’ve never experienced with Lancome! After I did my double cleanse, I felt like the product was still on my skin...it was very weird. I do not care for this at all, and if you are told this is better than Lancome, you will be highly disappointed. I’m sorry I wasted $10.00 in Sephora card rewards on this. I’m one of the people who lives about 75-100 miles from a Sephora, so I am just out the money. Don't Get Talked Into It!
