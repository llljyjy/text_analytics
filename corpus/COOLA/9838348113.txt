Ten stars.Not really understanding the reviews where people are spraying this in their eyes or trying to use it as a perfume and then give it a low rating. When used as intended, this is a godsend. Miracle. Game-changer. Or whatever other synonym you prefer to use. I have oily skin like nobody’s business, sweat like I’ve run a marathon in the Sahara, and will all but burst into flames in the sun. So the fact that this is mattifying, waterproof, and SPFs ALL WHILE SETTING MY MAKEUP… There’s nothing else like it. I can even spray it on the part in my hair so I won’t burn and flake—without ending up looking like I haven’t washed my hair after a month-long camping trip. The fact that it’s heavy on the alcohol smell when you spray it is just a temporary side effect and really shouldn’t be that big a deal. Especially considering that the product is vegan, clean, and (if I remember correctly) 72% organic! Many of the alternatives are made of toxic sludge that simply smells neutral—so people are preferring that over this. Smh.All the haters can go back to their greasy spread-on lotions that make skin look oily and inevitably melt makeup and the awful-ingredient-containing setting sprays (even the best of which have not worked any better than this when tried with my skin type, btw). I just pray there are enough people with the good sense to actually use this correctly and appreciate its awesomeness that Coola continues its production for as long as I’m alive. Absolute face-saver.
