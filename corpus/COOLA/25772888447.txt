I’ve had the hardest time finding an SPF spray that can be used over makeup, doesn’t smell horrible or sting my eyes, and doesn’t make my face look like an oil slick after misting on my face for SPF touch-ups throughout the day. So far, this is one of the better ones in regards to those aspects. But, I wish it was higher than just an SPF 18- especially for the price. nan
