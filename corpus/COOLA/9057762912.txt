Maybe this works for some- I have been using self tanner for face for 25 years.  This is one of the worst I have used.  I donâ€™t know if it was bad or old.  But I could not believe how in even this left my skin.  There are so much better products out there and for a lot less. St. Tropez vit c self tanning face serum for instance.  Good luck- happy shopping:) blotchy and too light
