I wasn’t in love with this product when I first got it. I didn’t HATE the smell but it wasn’t my favorite, and it did feel a bit drying. My least favorite thing was that if you got any in your hair, it made your hair feel oily and chalky all at the same time. All this I could ignore because I really just wanted an SPF spray that I could apply over makeup without it ruining the makeup (spf powders make me too matte and move the makeup around too much). The thing that really tanks this product for me was the packaging. AWFUL. It leaked after I had it in my purse for a day on the go (which is its whole purpose) and ruined everything. I threw it out without using it more than twice. Sounds like some got a functioning bottle, but it is not worth the risk. Do not buy. Leaked and Ruined Bag
