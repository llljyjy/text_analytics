Bought as I needed a travel size makeup remover. It’s definitely oily but I double cleanse so that wasn’t the biggest downside for me. Instead, it’s the fact that it broke me out completely all over my face. Tiny whiteheads and pimples that took weeks to clear up. Would not recommend, especially if you have sensitive skin.
