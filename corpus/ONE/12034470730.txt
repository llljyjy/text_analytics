Amazing!!! This is my holy grail for removing my makeup when I have my full face done. It sprays gently, and some people don’t like the fragrance but I seriously don’t mind it. You dont have to rub it on hard at all! It does leave an oily feeling when you rinse it off, but you obviously need to wash your face with a cleanser afterwards. People who are complaining about the leftover feel aren’t washing their faces lol. Must Have!
