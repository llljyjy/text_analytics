I bought this because it was on sale and I had always wanted to try it out, seemed like the perfect time right? wrong! My main issue with this is the fragrance. I donâ€™t feel like it was necessarily, as it can become irritating to skin and linger on your face and whatever towels or cloths you use to remove it with. Also after washing off the product, it still felt like it was on, like a film on my face. It also does not remove makeup very well. I had to cleanse at least 2 more times. The spray is also very greasy, which is a given because it is a dry oil, but it can and will break you out. Overall this was a hard pass and I returned it the next day. Stick to clinique take the day off for way way better results. Might as well use Pam cooking spray instead
