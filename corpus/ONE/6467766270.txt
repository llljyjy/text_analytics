this thing is insane. i tried it in store on my hand after swatching alot of stuff and all the makeup came right off. I use micellar water but HATE the feeling of it, so i purchased this to replace it! Its so quick and easy to use, doesnt leave your face feeling oily, and the mist feels like NOTHING. this is honestly the craziest product ever. i cant recommend this enough nan
