See, I really like this product and the idea of it. I really like it’s performance as well. However, the smell is such a bigggggg no for me, I will likely and sadly return it. I am sensitive to smell(migraines) and unfortunately this one is so strong that I’m nervous to use it because I don’t want to trigger a migraine. I hope in the future they can make this without fragrance Good Product, Bad Fragrance
