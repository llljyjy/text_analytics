This spray will remove every speck of hard to remove waterproof mascara. It will work on heavier foundations too. I only like to use this on my eyes as I don’t like the way it feels on the rest of my skin despite that I double cleanse after. Also, it’s a good way to save money to only use this on my eyes. This has replaced other tried and true eye makeup removers I used to champion over the years. nan
