I love this stuff!  I always double cleanse and this makes the first part so easy. I really like that it’s not cold or wet when you spray it on your face, it’s just a nice mist. I then use a makeup eraser to wipe my face and ready for step two. I’ve also used it during the day of I need to redo my makeup, I just use this to take everything off and then put on a new face. nan
