I was watching one of Trixie’s vlogs on YouTube. De-Drag with me| my updated routine. He used the Go off spray and wipes. The makeup came off within seconds. If this can make Trixie into Brian within seconds, this is a product i needed to buy. I did buy it. It’s great. Usually, I would need extra attention to take off the mascara, I didn’t. Do follow the instructions. Massage into the skin. I did leave it on more a minute or so. The wipes do work too. But I will not get the wipes again. It’s just like my other wipes. Nothing special. Note: I did have glitter on too. Came off fine. I will get this again. I’m here because of Trixie Mattel
