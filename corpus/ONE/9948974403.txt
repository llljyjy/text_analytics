I like this to remove makeup for the convenience because it is easier than using cleansing balms or wipes, especially on a fuller face day.Surprisingly It does a pretty good job, I was skeptical at first because I haven’t seen any product that works like this but I’m glad I purchased. I will be buying again.The only thing I do not like of course is the fragrance so if you are more sensitive to this I wouldn’t purchase Will be buying again :)
