I purchased this during the sale and have used it a few times.  It’s a nice cold cream that feels cooling after you rinse it off and has gentle beads to help exfoliate.  It’s very gentle and leaves skin very smooth and soft after rinsing.  There’s not much to say other than it’s a cold cream in the classic sense.  I purchased it because I wanted to slough away some flaky skin from retin-a and it doesn’t contain mineral oil, as a lot of cold creams do. Gentle and Smoothing
