When trying out the product the first thing I noticed was the scent to me in reminded, me of a cough drop halls mix with a light berry scent which to me was pleasant. As mentioned on there site the product has little beads in it to exfoliate your face and I instantly saw them when I put the product on my hands. The beads didn’t irritate my skin and as I mentioned before of the cool halls drop or cough drop scent it did make my face feel cool which I like especially this would be perfect if your face/skin is irritated or warm this might help to cool it down. For me it was easy to wash off leaving no beads behind, it cleaned my face and didn’t burn it, so I will this perfect for me is good. Cooling
