When Bite Beauty shut down, I never thought I’d ever find another holy grail mask, though I certainly tried. I remember hearing lanolin was the magic ingredient, not agave, so I looked for products with lanolin and products with agave. After trying all types of products, I can confidently say it was the agave. This lip mask is everything! I’m so happy with the results! I am chronically dehydrated and my lips get chapped often, but no more! A few swipes of this stuff on my lips overnight and I’m good to wear my mask proof liquid lipsticks! nan
