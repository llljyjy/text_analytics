I am new to Alpyn Beauty. Never tried the brand before this product. First of all, it smells great and I absolutely love the color. Also, I chose it over others because it has an exfoliating factor. Nobody just wants their lips temporarily moisten and the appear of dry lips to go away only to find out that dead skin is left behind. I wanted a lip scrub + moisturizing balm and this is just that. Not necessarily the easiest to use because I donâ€™t like sticking my finger in a pot (sanitary reasons). Wish it came in a clear tube instead. Wish it was in a tube
