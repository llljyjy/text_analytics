Another great product from Alpyn Beauty! I love this serum. I use it in the AM after washing my face and under my sunscreen. I like to put some more on my brow bones, eye lids, and the high points of my cheeks to get even more of a  glow on no make-up days. Hydrating and doesnâ€™t irritate my 66yr old skin. Plays well with the Bounce Cream and the Wild Nettle serum too. Now if only Alpyn would come out with a sunscreen I would be in heaven!! Glowing
