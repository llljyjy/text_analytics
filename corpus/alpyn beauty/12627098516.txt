At first I didn’t care for it because the product itself didn’t feel like the Fresh I was used to. Alpyn has a “dryer” more matte feel to the creme.  But after using it for sometime I love it! I think it’s more of a spring summer moisturizer rather than WNY Winter time moisture, but either way this melts into your skin with no oily after feeling.  It leaves a subtle - subtle matte finish that is perfect for no make up days.  And the jar has such a big lid that it doesn’t go spinning out of your hands when you’re trying to get product out. I know that sounds unimportant but other jars drive me crazy because the top doesn’t go on smoothly.  The only reason I deducted a star is because I don’t feel like this is an all year moisturizer, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Give it a chance.
