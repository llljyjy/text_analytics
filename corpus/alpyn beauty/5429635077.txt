I received a sample from them to try! This didn’t work for my combination and sensitive skin. It has fragrance which made my skin itchy. It has a cooling effect, creamy texture and very lightweight. It removes makeup but struggled with waterproof makeup. After rinsing, my skin didn’t feel hydrated. nan
