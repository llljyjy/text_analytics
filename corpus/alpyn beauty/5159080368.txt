Iâ€™ve been looking for a good cream cleanser and Alpyn is my new go to!  I absolutely love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel.  It has small jojoba beads that gently exfoliate your skin and has a nice cooling sensation.  My face always feels so refreshed when I use this.  You can use this as a daily cleanser or leave it on for up to 5 minutes as a mask! My New Favorite Cleanser!
