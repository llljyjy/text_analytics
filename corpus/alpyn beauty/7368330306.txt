This cleanser has truly become a main staple in my skincare routine! It makes me feel like I just went to the spa! It has a smooth texture and feels so good when I apply it to my skin, and I can definitely feel it removing all my makeup without feeling like itâ€™s stripping my skin. It has such a nice cooling sensation and smells incredibly refreshing. I love using it as a mask- leaving it on for 15 min. After my face feels fresh and hydrated. Highly recommended
