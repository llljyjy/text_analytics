After using this product for a month now... I already have seen a huge change in my skin-- it is literally GLOWING. The texture is smooth and feels cool the moment it hits my skin. I’ve been leaving it on like a mask (it’s nice to have options) for a deeper cleanse. The cooling sensation my skin feels really makes me feel like it’s really exfoliating and getting in there. I also have been lazy and skipping my makeup remover cloths, and am shocked at how well this product takes off my makeup too -- it’s almost eliminating a step. After using my skin feels smooth to the touch and extremely hydrated. I feel like it is a great first step and allows my oils / other products to now really absorb into my face. I added a photo of my skin post makeup and you can literally see how clear and glowey it is-- I’ve never had texture like this! My new favorite sustainable skincare brand!
