This is such a unique cleanser! I love the cold cream formula. It makes the product feel so refreshing and hydrating and softening! I’ve been using it as a 2 in 1 kind of product and applying it as a mask first and then working it into my skin with water as a cleanser after a few minutes. I love the little jojoba beads! They’re provide just the right amount of gentle exfoliation! Such a cool, creamy cleanser!
