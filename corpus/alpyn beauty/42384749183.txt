First of all, I LOVE that this product is responsibly sourced! As a nature lover, environmentally friendly is something I’m very passionate about. The product is super creamy and feels SO smooth going on my skin. It genuinely gives me feelings of being pampered when I use it. (Maybe this is a weird way to describe it, but I can’t think of a better way...the creaminess of it just feels so “expensive“.) You can tell that a lot of thought goes into its’ production. Secondly, my pores actually do look smaller after having used this product for a few weeks! *insert shocked emoji here* I’ve used a lot of natural products that fall short compared to other less natural options on the market, but this one does not disappoint. I feel my skin practically sucking up the moisture this provides, while also giving me a smooth clean. Once I wash it off, my skin always feels so well hydrated and supple...which this tired mama of three little ones NEEDS at this point in her life. haha! I can’t believe how deeply it removes makeup and the days’ dirt as well. (I literally felt like I went to the spa the evening I used it after helping my husband lay sod in our new backyard)! ha.  And I couldn’t be more excited about my pores actually reducing in size through use of it! On another note, there was a slight tingling sensation when I once left it on for several minutes, using it more as a mask, which felt quite refreshing too! 10/10 would recommend! Legitimately minimizes my pores!
