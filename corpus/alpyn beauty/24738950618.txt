Good cleanser. Light creamy hydrating. Love that its a clean hydrating cleanser in a glass jar. Dont even notice the beads in it, they are soft, non abrasive. Switched to this cleanser from my tatcha rice wash. I have 3 products from this line now & overall this is a good clean brand. Nice clean hydrating cleanser
