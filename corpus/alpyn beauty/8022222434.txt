I was so excited by the reviews to try this! I have oily, slightly textured skin. At first I loved the moisturizer, it felt so nice and made my skin feel instantly hydrated. HOWEVER, by the end of the day I was a complete grease ball. I didn’t find it mattifying at all on my skin. It would be a good moisturizer in a night time routine but for me, I just can’t wear it as my daily & thats disappointing. If you’re dry I think it would be great! Not great FOR ME
