Meh. I am always on the hunt for a solid moisturizer that actually does something beneficial to my skin. This dries very matte and I was not a fan. Under my Ilia skin tint it was okay. Under anything else foundation wise my skin felt tight and my makeup would flake. I have combination skin with drier cheek and an oily-ish t-zone. My skin can be sensitive and I didn’t have any issues with this but I wouldn’t buy again. Back to Caudalie I go! Meh. Matte finish and not enough moisture!
