This is more gentle than I expected and the scent is much more mild than I anticipated - all positives for my sensitive skin. One thing to be warned, this isn’t a cold cream (assuming you aren’t sticking it in a freezer). Yes it is cooling but it’s a standard cream cleanser with exfoliating beads - you can easily pot this into a squeeze tube (better/safer for shower) and dispense the product just as easily unlike say ponds cold cream or Nivea that are actual thick cold creams. Nice product for my acne prone areas nonetheless. Not really a cold cream but a nice cleanser no les
