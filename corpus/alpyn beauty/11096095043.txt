Now this product is THE TRUTH! Right away I instantly loved how they have jojoba beads to help exfoliate my skin as I have been looking for a gentle exfoliator. I also love that you feel the product working, my first use I had a cooling/tingling sensation going on and that was EVERYTHING for me. The scent is great and I love the feeling of the actual product itself. I can say my skin has been doing great with this cleanser, I use it both for my day and nighttime routine. My skin feels amazing and yes, I know, you shouldnâ€™t touch your face too much but this makes me want to all day lol. You Got To Try This!
