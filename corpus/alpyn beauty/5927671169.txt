I appreciate that this peel mask combines chemical and physical exfoliation into one product for a more comprehensive and effective resurfacing experience.  This duo leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  Any rough texture is evened out and any flakiness is sloughed away from the first use.  This mask’s consistency is similar to a whipped mousse and its scent is subtle and reminiscent of berries.  During the five minutes that I leave it on, I feel a tingling sensation that lets me know the chemical exfoliation from the acid blend is kicking in.  Before I rinse off the mask, I massage it around my face.  This is the moment where I notice the physical exfoliation granules from the berry seeds and bamboo powder.  They feel firm but not abrasive.  My fair, sensitive skin tends to look flushed afterwards, but any redness is temporary and will not scare me away because I’m so impressed with all of the benefits I’ve been experiencing.  Once per week is the ideal exfoliation frequency for me, but if you have more resilient skin, you can definitely use this more often! Powerful ingredients, powerful results
