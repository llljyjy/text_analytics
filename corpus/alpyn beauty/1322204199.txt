This cream cleanser is a powerhouse! It’s smooth, creamy, and feels amazing as it works its magic, removing makeup and dissolving dirt. There’s no heavy scents or perfumes (thankfully), just a refreshing & cooling sensation when applied. When you rinse it off, all thats left is hydrated, soft, and most importantly makeup free skin.  I’m always on the lookout for clean, sustainable products that actually work, and this one checks ALL the boxes. It’s packed with natural ingredients, antioxidants and plant based collagen to help my skin look and feel its best. This is not your mother’s cold cream! It’s the cream cleanser your skin deserves. Highly recommend. A cooling, hydrating cleanse every time!
