Absolutely love this new hydrating cream cleanser from Alpyn Beauty. When I initially apply it, it has a really nice cooling sensation. Since I have combination skin I tend to stay away from cream cleansers but this one has worked amazing for my oily t zone. Completely breaks down my make up and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and clean. The best part is it can also be used as a hydrating mask. Highly recommend picking this new cleanser!
