I started investing in products that are cruelty free and sustainable, and knowing exactly where the products come from. I really appreciate Alpyn Beauty’s transparency and how they use sustainably harvested ingredients. I have become obsessed with this cleanser — the texture is so luxurious and creamy. I literally have never felt a cleanser this creamy before, my skin feels so refreshed,  hydrated and clean. It does the job and then some with removing makeup and has benefits of antioxidants and plant based collagen My new fave!
