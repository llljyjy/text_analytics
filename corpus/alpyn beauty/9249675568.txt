My new favorite cleanser! I have been using this every morning for the past couple of weeks and I can’t say enough good things about it. It gently exfoliates and cleanses leaving my skin feeling soft, supple and looking absolutely radiant! It is refreshing, has a light fragrance that smells lovely and doesn’t dry out my combination skin. Additionally, it doesn’t make my skin feel taut and doesn’t leave behind any sticky residue. I really love the slight cooling effect too so I store it in a skincare fridge for a little extra boost to get my day started! nan
