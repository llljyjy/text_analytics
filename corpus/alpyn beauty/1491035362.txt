I cannot recommend this product enough. It is incredible. First it smells SO GOOD and the texture is pretty thick which is super soothing to apply. My skin looks incredible after I use it. You can use it more as a cleanser or a mask. I prefer the mask where you leave it on for 5-10 minutes. You can notice a difference for sue and after using it for a week it has easily made a difference. My skin feels super hydrating, especially with the weather changing. With the holidays coming up this is for sure going to be on my gift list! nan
