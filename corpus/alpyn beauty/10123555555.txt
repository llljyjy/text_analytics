This is a really lovely lip mask. It has a really faint yet sweet scent to it that’s not bothersome at all. It’s very easy to apply with your finger and almost melts into the lips. I really enjoy using this at night because I wake in the morning to supple, hydrated lips. This doesn’t give you a ton of color it just sort of enhances your natural lip color adding a nice healthy glow. I really appreciate the healthy ingredients and feel that they are helping combat the brutal dry elements where I live. Achieve healthy, hydrated lips.
