Thanks to Alpyn Beauty, I was gifted their Wild Huckleberry 8 Acid Polishing Peel Mask in exchange for my honest review. This mask is incredible and will forever be a staple in my skincare routine. For starters, the smell is amazing, natural and berry fresh. There’s no way a mask can be anymore eco friendly and Innovative than this one. It’s vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, and sold in 100% recyclable packaging. And for the cherry on top to a perfect mask, it leaves my skin hydrated, plump, refreshed, and SO smooth. For a product that initially sounds so harsh by using a double exfoliation method and 8 different naturally derived acids, It’s amazing that its actually very gentle and effective. I have fairly sensitive, skin with bumpy, uneven texture and unruly flaky patches that I despise. With Alpyn Beauty’s Huckleberry Polishing Peel Mask I was able to achieve beautifully smooth and even textured skin, with diminished pores and an overall brighter, healthier, and glowing complexion! No redness, irritation, inflammation, or negative reactions of any kind after using, whatsoever. Score for me! Awesome mask!
