I was initially interested in this serum because I believed in the ingredients for brightening my skin and diminishing some hyperpigmentation from sun exposure. And while the Bearberry and Vitamin C formula does that, the fact that using this serum immediately provides a healthy glow is what keeps me using it every morning. It has such a lovely finish that I barely need any makeup to look presentable. Plus, it plays nice with my sunscreen and makeup, so Alpyn has really hit a homerun with this product. Iâ€™m sold.
