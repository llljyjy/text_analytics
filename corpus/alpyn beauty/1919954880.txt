The texture of this cream cleanser is like a hydrating moisturizer with tiny beads. Itâ€™s so creamy and the perfect consistency, not too thick and but still has a good lather. I really enjoyed the cooling sensation it left on my skin and how easily it helped in removing my makeup. My sensitive skin was not triggered instead this product left my skin feeling squeaky clean while still feeling hydrated and supple. Highly recommend for people with dry skin.
