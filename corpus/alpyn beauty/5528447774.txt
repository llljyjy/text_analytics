I was originally hesitant to get this as there was only one review with a verified purchase at the time. However, I definitely wanted a moisturizer that was completely free of palm oil (which is apparently very difficult to find these days) so I ended up buying this to try out. I find that it moisturizes my skin well in the mild California winter, and I really like the fresh grapefruit scent. I also like the yogurt-like consistency and don’t mind the slight stickiness. The only major downside is that I’m almost out of my first jar after 10 weeks of consistent use, but haven’t noticed my complexion being any brighter. I have a few sun spots I’ve been trying to get rid of so I’m a bit disappointed in that regard.I would probably purchase again because it’s moisturizing, feels/smells good, and is free of palm oil, but I’ll likely alternate between this and a less expensive moisturizer or face oil. Decent moisturizer in a cute jar
