After falling in love with the Alpyn eye cream, I thought this serum was going to be a winner as well, but I was terribly wrong.Maybe if this is used for a night serum it’s ok. But, I purchased it for daytime, and it does not look good under makeup & SPF. Also, it broke me out, which at first seemed unusual for a niacinamide serum… I didn’t realize vitamin C was in here, as my sensitive skin always reacts to it.So, if you plan on using as a night serum, and your skin likes vitamin C, then this may work for you! High hopes
