I love trying new lip balms, as I am a huge lip balm junkie! This Willow & Sweet Agave Plumping Lip Mask is really nice and nourishing. I do not notice a huge plumping effect, but my lips do feel hydrated which makes them look a little fuller and healthy! I am really enjoying this one and I enjoy the subtle scent, as well nan
