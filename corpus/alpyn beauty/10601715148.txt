I received this product from Alpyn as someone who has used their products for quite some time. I’ve been an Alpyn Beauty user for 3 years.  I’m a huge fan of this entire product line. Historically, I’ve tried it all. I’m mixed race with tan skin, freckles (hyperpigmentation), and in my 30s, focused on anti-aging. This specific product, where do I start? The instant glow, hydration, and ingredients to target hyperpigmentation all work in my favor. The texture is luscious yet eventually spreads, and the smell is light and fresh. This can also go under or over makeup (I use it as a highlighter).How I Use These Products (give and take my sun exposure and hormones) - Mornings: Wash with Creamy Bubbling Cleanser. Apply Bearberry & Vitamin C Glow Serum and Line-Filling Eye Balm, then Melt Moisturizer.Evening: Wash with Creamy Bubbling Cleanser. Apply Wild Nettle Firming Serum and Line-Filling Eye Balm, then Triple Vitamin C Bounce Cream.Once/Week: 8-Acid Polishing PeelHappy purchasing and using. You won’t be disappointed. 3 year user of this product line. I love it.
