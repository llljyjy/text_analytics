I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks now.... LET ME JUST SAY, as someone who has extremely sensitive, combination/acne prone skin, this is IT! I have a hard time finding a good cleanser that is acne-friendly but doesn’t simultaneously dry me out... I really love wearing this as a face mask for a couple minutes before washing it off. It has this really amazing cooling, refreshing feeling when you first put it on your face, plus it helps take off all of your makeup without needing to use any other harsh makeup remover before or after! Once I rinse off the cleanser, my skin looks not only clean, but super hydrated and doesn’t feel that uncomfortable tightness I usually feel after using any other cleansers. HIGHLY recommend! Great for acne-prone, combination skin!
