I love anything that is a lip mask! I find myself needing hydration more and more. I really enjoy this product, but wish it was a tad easier to get the product out. It feels stiff in the pan, but once you get it out it leaves the lips so soft and hydrating. I really been reaching for this more over most of my lip balms lately. new lip mask!
