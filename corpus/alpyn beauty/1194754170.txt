The Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser works very well for my combination skin. This is a cold cream type cleanser that has cooling effect upon application that feels very nice and soothing. It does have very gentle exfoliating beads that help to smooth and slough off dry skin. My skin feels soft and most importantly hydrated. Amazing cleanser!
