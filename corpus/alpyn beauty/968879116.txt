I’ll give this 4 stars for its soothing and hydrating abilities but I don’t feel like it did much for my lines. I used the whole jar and never really saw any “line filling” happen. If you’re looking for a clean product that hydrates, this is great for that. I love Alpyn Beauty ingredients. creamy and hydrating just not line filling
