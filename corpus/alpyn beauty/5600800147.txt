This has some great actives in it that make it truly a performance product - and I can see the difference in my eye lines after a few months usage. I’m going to forgot the botox around my eyes from now on. For those that are worried when they see the word “alcohol” in any product - make sure and look up the type.  They are not all bad for you and not all ethanol related (i.e. they are not drying).  Cetearyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol - The good news is that cetearyl alcohol isn’t “bad” for you, your skin, or your hair.  They help create smoother creams, thicker lotions etc as in this product.  Love Alpyn and their lineup, but in particular this product:) Effective Eye Cream
