I received a sample packet of it with my Sephora order. I was a little nervous about the matte finish. I have very dry skin due to a hormonal imbalance and meds. I used vanicream, face oils, serums, etc. I felt like my skin couldn’t retain moisture. I won’t say this is a holy grail of face moisturizers. I did like it. I felt that it absorbed well into my skin. It didn’t leave a super tacky or oily residue. It didn’t just sit on my skin or pill up. My skin was left very soft. I did add a face oil after ( youth to the people ) because again I have dry skin. I love that this is light yet creamy, matte yet moisturizing. I love the ingredients. If you are prone to oily skin you might like this. If you want a high end moisturizer to wear under make up, I think this will work well since it isn’t super oily. If you have super dry or dry skin you may like this BUT I would recommend adding an oil at night. The only con is the price. Also I’m not sure if they make a version for dry prone skin, I like a semi dewy finish. I am new to this brand but I am thinking about purchasing the mini size to try it out. Just like that... soft and matte
