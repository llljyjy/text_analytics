This cleanser feels so good! I can’t wait to wash my face! The Vermont winters dry out my skin and I’m so glad to have this as the temps drop. I use all of the Alpyn line because it literally changed my skin. I can’t say enough great things about their stuff. High end ingredients without a crazy price. My new winter cleanser!
