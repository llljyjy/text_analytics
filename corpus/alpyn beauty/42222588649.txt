I just turned 30 and have been looking to do something a little extra with my skin care routine. I was gifted this product in exchange for a review and it could not have been better timing. I love that it has vegan collagen. The jojoba beads give you the scrubbing sensation of a facial while still remaining sensitive, and my skin feels amazing after. Soft, clean, and hydrated. Iâ€™ll definitely be adding this to my regular routine. Vegan collagen with jojoba beads- yes please !
