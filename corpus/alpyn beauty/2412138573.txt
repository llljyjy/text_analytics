Received this cleanser and began to use it during my morning routine. During the first application I began to feel the cooling sensation on my skin. It has a smooth textures but has jojoba beads that you can feel gently exfoliating your skin. I left it on about 2 minutes and rinsed my face. It really did a great job at depuffing and refreshing. Look at the before and after photo I posted. Instant depuffing. This product definitely hydrates and almost feels like a mask if you leave it on for 3-5 minutes before rinsing. It’s so good. Bonus points for being plant based and clean! It left my skin feeling so clean. Another plus is how good the packaging is. I’m a sucker for packaging and it feels so high end with a ton of product inside. A refreshing experience!
