I don’t normally like using masks because they often make my skin feel super tight and dry afterwards and often increase the redness. This Juneberry cold cream however left my skin actually feeling super hydrated after! It’s also really delicate on the skin and therefore doesn’t leave it looking red after. I also love the cooling sensation that it has during and after which feels super refreshing. Also it smells really good! My new favorite facial mask!
