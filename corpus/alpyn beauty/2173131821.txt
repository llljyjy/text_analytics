I love the packaging for all Alpyn Beauty products first things first, in a glass , it doesn’t feel cheap or like packaging was a after thought. When you open the moisturizer there is a clean scent, almost zesty but nothing too strong that would cause irritation. It didn’t break out my sensitive skin. I noticed as a combination skin woman with texture , this seems to have a smoothing affect almost like a primer, it didn’t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy . My face feels exactly how my skin feels after applying lotion, moisturized however  the oils are contained . I love this for the heat in Texas , it doesn’t feel heavy on the skin and cause my make up to slip off. Will be a stable of mine for the warmer days when I don’t  need a lot of dewiness. nan
