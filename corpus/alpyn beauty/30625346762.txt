I LOVE the way this stuff feels. It’s silky and soft and just feels like a cloud against my skin when I use it. This has been a miracle product now that the weather is getting colder and the air is getting drier. It’s a great cleanser and it’s probably the most hydrating cream cleanser I’ve ever used. Seriously love it for my dry, flaky skin. Must Have for Dry Skin
