I LOVE LIP MASKS that can be used overnight and OHMYGOSH, this one from Alpyn Beauty is sooo good! If you want a clean, cruelty-free lip mask, this is for you! I LOVE how soft, smooth & fuller-looking my lips are the next day. When I don’t feel like putting any lipstick on but still want to make sure my lips looks “juicy” this has been my absolute fave AND go-to! Honestly speaking, I recommend this to everyone moving forward. Plus, it’s not sticky at all and it’s VERY hydrating. It’s a 100/10 for me! Using this every night, any time of the day, all the time! Definitely get this, it’s going to be your new holy lip grail! SOFT, SMOOTH, FULLER-LOOKING LIPS? YES PLEASE!
