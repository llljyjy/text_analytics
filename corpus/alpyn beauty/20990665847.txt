Admittedly reading about the 8-acids exfoliating properties in this product seems intense at first, but my sensitive skin quite enjoys it. :) I like to apply a thin layer, it feels mostly silky aside from the granules. I then wait the 5 minutes, and gently massage & rinse off. There is bamboo powder and blueberry seed paste which attributes to the physical part of the exfoliation, and it is gentle! There was no sensitive reaction or flushing of my skin so yay for that! My skin was left smooth & fresh feeling. Love how quick and effective this acts as an addition to my existing routine.
