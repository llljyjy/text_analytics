I’m happy with this cream cleanser. The scent is light and soothing. It’s gentle on the skin and the creamy feel is lovely. It rinses nicely and cleans my face well. My skin has problems with dryness but this product doesn’t leave my skin dry or tight afterwards. A small amount is all you need. Works great on my dry skin.
