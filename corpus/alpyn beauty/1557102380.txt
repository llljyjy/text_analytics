This moisturizer is a game changer. Living in Arizona during the summer can be brutal on my skin. It’s typically dry and doesn’t hold hydration too well. This showed significant difference after only one use. My skin looked bouncy and had a beautiful matte finish. The scent isn’t over powering (in my opinion) and glides on your skin like velvet. I love how a little product seemingly goes a long way. The texture is like a creamy gel, and clings to your skin. I put this on prior to my primer and foundation, and everything stayed in place so nicely! Arizona girlie seeking deep hydration - yay!
