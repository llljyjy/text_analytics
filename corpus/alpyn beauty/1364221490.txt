This is a great mask for a quick glow. I received this from Alpyn but have also purchased their serum so I have tried other products from them. The mask is meant to be left on for 5 min and that is enough to see the quick glow it gives. This photo is right after I washed mine off. I have highly reactive skin and I have used this twice and have had no issues. My skin looks flushed after rinsing but it goes away within a few minutes.It has a nice smell and texture. It is not a mask that is stiff or dries on your face. The small beads it has help exfoliate your skin without irritating it. You donâ€™t need a lot so it will last you if you use it as mentioned. I can see this lasting at least two months using twice weekly. Simple 5 min mask for a quick glow
