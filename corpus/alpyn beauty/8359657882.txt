I have been using this cleanser for the last two weeks. The texture of this product is creamy and smooth, very easy to spread and rub onto your face. I love how cooling it felt after you apply all over your face. It cleans SUPER WELL even with a full-on makeup!!  When you finish rinsing it off, my face feels unbelievably refreshing and hydrating and even texture. I am IN LOVE with this product. Will definitely buy again! A MUST-HAVE Facial Cleanser!!
