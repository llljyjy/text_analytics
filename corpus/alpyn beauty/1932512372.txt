This eye cream is designed to minimize the appearance of wrinkles and puffiness by combining a variety of ingredients targeted at brightening, moisturizing, and minimizing fine lines. It has a lightweight cream texture that spreads mostly well, but it leaves slightly visible streaks even after applying which makes it feel like it doesn’t absorb quickly. It doesn’t contain added fragrance and didn’t have a noticeable smell. This has Sephora’s clean beauty seal and the ingredients list has a lot of promising ingredients. I love that this contains centella to help calm as well as a variety of plant extracts like calendula and bearbeary. I was initially concerned seeing mica! After using this eye cream my undereye area looked brighter and felt well hydrated and moisturized. I have not yet noticed improvements in fine lines but I have noticed that bakuchiol takes some time to have a noticeable effect. Overall a great option for responsibly sourced beauty. nan
