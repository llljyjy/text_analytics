I tried a sample of the Juneberry cleanser, and am purchasing a full-sized jar for myself.  This is a creamy cleanser, and has a very light and natural scent in a good “I don’t know what this is but I love it“ kind of way. It’s delightful to use. The gentle exfoliating beads, creamy texture, and delicious smell along with the slight cooling sensation makes washing my face something to look forward to. It rinses clean yet leaves my skin perfectly hydrated. Alpyn never disappoints me. Truly lovely cleanser
