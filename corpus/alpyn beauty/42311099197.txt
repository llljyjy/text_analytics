Hydrating Cold Cream Cleanser, I love the freshness and how clean it feels and the hydrating glow is so amazing. Also I love how it remove all my makeup, It is creamy with light exfoliation and leaves your skin feeling cool and very important it doesn’t dry your skin, I’m sure you will fall in love too once you try! Made my face feel like a baby skin!
