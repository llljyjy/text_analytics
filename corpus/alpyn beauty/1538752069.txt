The way this cleanser makes my skin feel so hydrated right after cleansing in my nightly routine AND the morning after is next level! When you first begin to apply, there’s instantly a cooling sensation that I found very refreshing. Then as you massage it around your skin, the jojoba beads feel very gentle but are really effective at removing make up and impurities from the day. While the application process is very refreshing, my favorite thing about this cleanser is how great my skin feels after I wash it off. It’s incredibly soft, super clean, and well hydrated. My face always feels amazing the next morning too! My new favorite cleanser!
