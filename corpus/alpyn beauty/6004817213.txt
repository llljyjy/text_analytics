I have oily but decently clear skin unless it’s before my period but wow, this broke me out pretty badly. Don’t know about the scent a lot of people are complaining about but holy cow, my skin has never broken out this badly from using a cleanser. It doesn’t have much of a lather, but I think some people would enjoy that. I’m not as much of a fan though, but that’s my own personal preference. It is a pretty big bottle, though, and it lasts for a while. nan
