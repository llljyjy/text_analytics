I received samples of Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser. The cream itself is lightweight but also has little circular jojoba beads for mild exfoliation. As for fragrance, It has Alpyn Beauty’s signature scent, which is light and refreshing. After reading the directions, I was impressed to see that this cleanser can also double as a mask if left on for 5 minutes. This cleanser was easy to spread with slight foaming action. It did a great job removing both sunscreen and makeup. It did struggle a little bit with my waterproof mascara. Unfortunately, the eucalyptus leaf was a little bit bothersome around my eyes. I do not personally have sensitive eyes. There was no redness or swelling, just that cooling sensation lingered around my eyelids even after rinsing. I don’t think I could recommend this to somebody who does have sensitive eyes. But overall, this cleanser left my skin feeling moisturized but clean. This product would be great for someone who has normal to dry skin. As someone who has combination/oily skin, I generally prefer a gel based cleanser.But if you’re looking for a cream cleanser with all natural ingredients, and one that leaves your skin feeling super hydrated, I would recommend this product. A nice hydrating moisturizer
