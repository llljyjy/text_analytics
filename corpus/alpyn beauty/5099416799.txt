This isn’t my first Alpyn product and definitely won’t be my last! I love how this lip mask feels. I’m always wearing gloss or lipstick and am very particular about how my products feel. This cushions my lips without feeling heavy or sticky. It also feels mint-y and plumps up my lips naturally. I’ve been using it at night every night to help with how dry my skin has been feeling this season, but, I’ve started prepping my lips with this in the morning as well. In LOVE. A lip essential for me
