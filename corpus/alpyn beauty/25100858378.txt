I have been using this serum for the last week with my morning routine and I am amazed by the results in this short while. The serum provides an instant blurring effect and dewy look (owning to its pearlescent quality). It is neither too thin nor thick and blends into the skin almost immediately without any tackiness. I am donâ€™t mind the scent at all as it does not linger. Hoping to see the results of the vitamin c with prolonged use. I am in love with this product and will be grabbing it again for sure! Pearl drops for morning dewiness!
