This is the worst moisturizer I have ever used. It caused breakouts and patches of irritated skin on my face. I stopped using it two weeks ago but Iâ€™m still trying to repair the damage it did to my skin. Beware the positive reviews as they seem to be fake. Especially those including pictures of the reviewer posing with the product. Worst moisturizer ever
