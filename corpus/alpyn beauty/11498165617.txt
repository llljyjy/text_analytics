What really stands out about this lip mask is the thickness and long lasting effect of it. So often I find lip masks rubbing off in the middle of the night, but this one does a great job hanging in there. Itâ€™s definitely a dense recipe but the effect it takes is great if you tend to have dry lips at night. No More Reapplication at night!
