This lip mask really saved my dry chapped lips in one night! I was so impressed! If you’re tired of your dried lips leaving indentations on your lipsticks when you apply it, please try this! My lips in the morning were fuller looking, glowy, plump and very hydrated! A little goes a long way and it doesn’t leave an oily or tacky feeling! The texture is similar to a demi matte lipstick and stays on all night . Very Moisturizing
