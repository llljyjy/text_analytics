BIG fan. I love to use it at night as it actually works great taking off makeup too. It is hydrating but not too much. I have oily skin usually and this doesn’t make me more oily. The texture is super creamy, kind of like lotion but it washes off easily and doesn’t leave a film at all. It also has beads in it that are great for light exfoliation. I love the way it feels when rubbing it into my skin. It also has a pleasant scent and has no pore clogging ingredients!! I am super happy with this product. A perfect addition to my nighttime routine!
