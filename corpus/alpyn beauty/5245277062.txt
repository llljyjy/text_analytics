I adore this cream, makes my skin look youthful and dewy, clean ingredients, and pretty packaging. The only drawback Iâ€™m having is how this wears under my makeup. I think it looks great, then a few hours later, my chin looks weird and dry. I think I may be using too much, a little bit goes a long way. It also does have a bit of a tackiness while it sets into the skin, which really may be me once again going ham while applying it, lol. The pros definitely outweigh the one con. Even my fine lines were plumped out, including my my perpetually dry undereyes. All in all, I give it 4 stars. Well worth the money. Dewy and Plumping
