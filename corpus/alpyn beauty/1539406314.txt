I tried alpyn beauty Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cold Cream Cleanser for roughly one month. I have oily acne prone skin that dries easily due to acne fighting skincare. The Cold Cream Cleanser easily rubs into and is easily applied to my skin. The cleanser is creamy and refreshing. It left my skin feeling softer and hydrated after washing. I love that this skincare is natural and plant based too! This was an easy addition to my  routine. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Must have hydrating cleanser!
