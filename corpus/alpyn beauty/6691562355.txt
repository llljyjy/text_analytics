After using this product for a week, I am obsessed!! I love the tiny jojoba beads that gently exfoliate my face when cleansing. This product has an amazing consistency that is very refreshing and has a slight cooling sensation. After using this product, my face feels super clean, refreshed and also hydrated which is exactly what I look for in a cleanser. New go to cleanser
