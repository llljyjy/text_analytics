I have really sensitive skin and this has been the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I’ve had a variety of not great reactions to pretty much everything I’ve tried and settled for herbivore pink cloud. It worked ok, but I could only use small amounts or I would break out and it was really annoying to only be able to buy a huge, expensive container of it. I’m so glad I tried this! It comes in a reasonable size to try and I have been able to slather it on my whole face with ZERO negative reactions. And it works! My face actually feels healthy and moisturized for the first time in a long time. I live in a desert, so that is saying a lot. I will also add- it has an interesting smell. I don’t really know how I would describe it- earthy/citrusy? Either way, the second it sinks in you can’t smell it anymore and it works well. I’d also rather have a more earthy smell than a bunch of added fragrance any day! Great for sensitive skin
