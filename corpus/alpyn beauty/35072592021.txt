Okay so let me tell you, every fall AND winter season no matter where I am my lips so easily get chapped, then crack and then BLEED. You have no idea how much I dread the fall and winter just because of the discomfort my entire body goes through because of how dehydrated my skin is, but my lips is the most sensitive part of my body when it comes to dryness. I don’t know why I’ve seen doctors and they always prescribe me these lips creams that I need to heavily lather on my lips and cover in Vaseline. It is so hard to constantly do that and it is also so unsanitary to me because I have to always apply it with my hands and it gets messy and I just am not a fan. Also it costs so much $$$. Anyway so I only put aquafor on my lips for the past 5 years of my life because that’s all that works especially in the fall! I literally avoid lip products because of how sensitive my lips are. When I saw this product I was curious but hesitant so I never bought but when I was sent this product I gasped in real life because of how good this product is. It barely has a smell which I also love and it smells natural but exactly like the ingredients. It’s sweet but not too sweet because it’s agave and it’s balmy but not glossy and it’s thick but not heavy on my lips! I love the formula so freaking much. Also vegan and cruelty free which is just  great because it’s better for me and the planet like such a win. Also it makes my lips look so pillowy like not bam here’s my lips but more of a “my lips are so full and cute and they have sheen so compliment me” like what more could you ask? It’s a great lip product and it deserves all the hype. If there’s a fire in my house I’m taking this
