I received a sample of this product for an honest review. The 8 ml sample lasted me 3 days, washing in the AM and PM. This cleanser is SO hydrating! I had a dry patch on my face that significantly improved after 3 days! The beads provide sensitive exfoliation. The cleanser gives a cold feeling when you use it. After my sample was done, I found myself craving it so I ordered more from the Alpyn Beauty website. The only downfall is the price, but it is a sustainable, clean product and part of the proceeds go towards national parks. Surprised me how much I loved this!
