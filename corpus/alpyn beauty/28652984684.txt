I have sensitive, combination skin that is leaning more towards dry with each passing year ;) This cleanser feels SO soothing while simultaneously giving a beautifully deep clean and minor exfoliation. I also love the cooling sensation - so refreshing! I left it on as a mask as recommended every time I used it and it works very well. nan
