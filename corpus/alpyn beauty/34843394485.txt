I was gifted this for my honest review! This is my 1st time using a glow serum. I used it in conjuction with my makeup. Note I have combination skin as well. It did make my face glow more in lighting. It soaked into my skin quick  It has a slight fragrance to it. Texture is amazing and glides on! Thanks for the wonderful product! I like it alot!
