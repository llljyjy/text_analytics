I really like this alpyn beauty hydrating cold cream cleanser. I have drier skin and as the weather changes here, I am looking for a cleanser that gets all makeup off without drying my skin out. This has a very slight cooling effect that feels refreshing - it’s just a really clean feeling. My favorite part is the jojoba beads for exfoliation - I’m including a close up picture of it on my face before I rubbed it in so you can see the texture. Would definitely recommend for dry/combo skin! nan
