This cleanser has truly become a main staple in my skincare routine! It has a smooth texture and feels so good when I apply it to my skin, and I can definitely feel it removing all my makeup without feeling like it’s stripping my skin. It has such a nice cooling sensation, smells incredibly refreshing, and makes me feel super clean and revitalized. After rinsing my face, I instantly feel hydrated and plump and can definitely see a major difference in my skin! I’m also super impressed with the packaging itself - the glass jar makes the whole experience feel super luxe. I’ll definitely be using this cleanser for the long run. Would absolutely recommend it! A main staple in my skincare routine!
