I loved everything I tried from Alpyn Beauty and this was no exception.I have chronically dry lips that chaps and peels a lot and this has become my favorite lip balm and mask of mine. The packaging and initial texture reminded me of their Vitamin C Bounce Cream! The texture is thick but not uncomfortably heavy and itâ€™s glides on like a dream. It immediately softens lips and keeps my lips hydrated for a long time. I love the natural ingredients such as sweet blue agave leaf, willow bark and hyaluronic acid. Juicy & Deeply Hydrating Mask!!
