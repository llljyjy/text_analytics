This product lives up to its advertising - it cleanses without stripping the moisture from your skin. I wasn’t sure i would like the gentle cooling effect, but it’s actually very nice to help me wake up in the morning! I have very sensitive skin and can’t exfoliate everyday, so will be using this as a once a week treatment rather than a daily cleanser.  Would love to see a version without the jojoba exfoliators! nan
