I really enjoy this moisturizer, it’s pricey but it goes a long way. My skin feels softer and my eye lines are less prevalent. It has a nice satin finish. I like to wait a little bit before putting foundation on after using the eye cream, but I tend to use the eye cream in the evening before bed. Regular use makes the product more effective and impactful. I am 20 and I have seen a positive difference in the depth of my eye lines. I use 1/4 of a pea size for both eyes, and dab it underneath. Nice soft fragrance that isn’t overpowering. Great eye cream for filling in fine lines
