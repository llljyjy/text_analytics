Iâ€™m a fan of alpyn, so I was excited when they launched this. Packaging wise, this is small and I think it should have come with a lip wand to scoop product out. The texture of this is nice and reminds me a little of the bite lip agave mask (when it was good). Wear and results wise it goes on nice but I think there are better masks out there that plump. nan
