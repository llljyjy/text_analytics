As an eye cream, this stuff is great and does most of what it promises, at least with laugh lines and brightening. My only complaint is with the packaging. The lid is made of some very brittle plastic, and the jar, itself, tends to slide--off my countertop, etc. So, the thing’s fallen twice and, each time, parts of the lid have shattered to the point that this jar can’t ever be sealed. I’m still repurchasing because I really like the cream, but wish the packaging were sturdier. Great cream, breakable lid
