This is the first cold cream that I’ve tried. I normally use the bubbling Alpyn cleanser and read this could be used as the second step of a double cleanse. Since I normally wouldn’t have the time I tested it alone. I immediately noticed it is very creamy, thus not requiring you to wet your hands before applying. I feel like it was lotion like scent wise but not strong. Immediately I could feel a cold tingle that was quite satisfying. I’ve been leaving it on 3-5 minutes while I continue my skincare routine. After washing it off I could feel how smooth my skin was afterwards. It also gave my skin a glow! nan
