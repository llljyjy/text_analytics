Iâ€™ve been using the melt moisturizer but my skin gets super dry from traveling so I started using this cleanser as well as a face mask and my skin is liking it! The texture is light, smooth and the cooling component adds a nice touch on my skin. My skin is very very sensitive and this product has been a satisfying add on to the mix/line I already use. The fragrance is light enough to enjoy with use but not overbear after usage. After the mask, my face feels clean and somewhat cool still and hydrated. Works great alongside moisturizer
