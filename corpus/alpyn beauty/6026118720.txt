I normally don’t review products but this one smells like rubber... If you’re sensitive to smells I would pass. I received this as a sample. I can’t really speak to the quality but take the positive reviews with a grain of salt. The smell is clearly off putting and people posing next to the product looks disingenuous to me. If your really think it would be something you like try to get a sample. Even if the ingredients are great what’s the point of owning it if the smell is so bad. Smells like rubber...
