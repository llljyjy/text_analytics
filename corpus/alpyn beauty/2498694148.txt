Love this moisturizer! It’s super creamy and goes on thick, but once you fully rub it into your skin it creates a beautiful hydrated, plump surface. It’s a velvet matte finish and layers perfectly under a full face of makeup. Didn’t make my foundation separate or break up which is usually what happens with thicker moisturizers. Will definitely be incorporating this into everyday skincare routine. nan
