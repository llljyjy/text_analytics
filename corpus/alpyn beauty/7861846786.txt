Purchased not gifted. Lid was closed extremely tight and very difficult to get off. It was not hydrating for my eye area which is quite dry to begin with. I also have sensitive eyes and this ended up being irritating. I will not buy again but I do use the moisture melt on my face and I adore that product.  Bummed the eye cream did not work out Per other reviews the lid is too tight!
