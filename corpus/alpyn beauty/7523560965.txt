I love this new cleanser from Alpyn Beauty! It’s made with all plant based ingredients making it gentle and great for all skin types. It doesn’t get a big bubbly lather but is more creamier and feels so nice and refreshing the second it hits my skin. It has collagen which is great for my aging skin and the tiny little beads do a good job of exfoliating leaving my skin moisturized, soft, smooth and happy. Another fabulous feature is that it doubles as a mask! Anytime I feel my skin needs some extra hydration, I just slather this on and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before adding water and turning it into a cleanser. I look forward to my skincare routine now and will definitely be keeping this on hand at all times. Gentle and Moisturizing
