This stuff is SO GOOD. I bought it on a whim and am so glad I did. My Retin-A chapped skin improved literally overnight when I started slathering this stuff on (alternating days with simple moisturizer + Retin A 3x a week at night, then bounce cream 4x per week at night + morning). Over time, I’ve noticed my skin brightening quite noticeably and I’ve been getting compliments on my skin since I started using it. Others have been noting the “sticky“ texture--it’s not sticky--just not oily nor silicone-y like many other products on the market. I hope Alpyn keeps producing this stuff because I will for sure keep purchasing it. nan
