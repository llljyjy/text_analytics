This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used! I love how it has a matte finish and layers really well under SPF and makeup! I also love that it’s plant based and has amazing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalene! Not to mention the plant derivative of retinol, bakuchiol! My skin feel so hydrated and soft! In love!!! The best plant based moisturizer! PERIOD!
