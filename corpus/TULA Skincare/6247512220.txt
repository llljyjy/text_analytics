I was so excited to trial this eye balm.  It comes in a tube (very similar to lip balm).  It’s extremely easy to apply!  I do a quick swipe under each of my eyes where I have small bags and discoloration.  It feels moisturizing for quite a while after.  I applied it one morning and noticed in the afternoon that it was still silky to touch.  It doesn’t really have a scent. It’s got a good variety of ingredients to get to work on what your skin needs - collagen, peptides, caffeine, cocoa seed extract, etc. I will highly consider buying this again once mines is used up. Convenient Eye Balm!
