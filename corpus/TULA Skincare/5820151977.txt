i was very excited to receive this Tula Bright Start Vitamin C moisturizer from Influenster because uneven skintone and texture are two of my top concerns and it claims to tackle those issues. I wasn’t disappointed! I find the formula feels a little heavy going on but it absorbs so quickly, and doesnt feel greasy or sticky. My skin feels super soft after applying it also. The scent is a very subtle citrus which is really nice. I’ve been using this for about a month and I have seen a change in my skin for sure. A little brighter, but the major change Ive noticed is I had a lot of bumpy skin on my forehead and cheekbone area that seems to have smoothed out since I began using this product. Loving the results! Excited to continue to use and I would recommend. It is a little higher in price but I do think there is a fair amount in the jar and it would last you for a good while. Loving my results
