I’ve been using this product for the past two weeks on and off. It’s highly moisturizing with Vaseline like consistency.  I have fine lines around my eye areas and dark under eye circles and have noticed a slight change with the dark circles.  It’s highly absorbant and reduces the look of fine lines & wrinkles.  For the price point, it’s quite affordable compared to other eye creams/balms in the market.  Tula is slowly making a name for itself and I was surprised when I received this product complimentary for my honest review.  I’ve never tried any probiotic skincare before so this balm with its list of potent ingredients is definitely a win. Collagen and hyaluronic acid were the deciding factor for me to try it out.  I’ll keep using it the product.  I haven’t had any breakouts or adverse reaction so that’s also a win. Vegan product with no parabens, sulfates or other harmful chemicals.  It’s clean and effective Nice hydrating eye balm
