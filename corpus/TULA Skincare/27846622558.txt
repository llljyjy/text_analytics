I’ve been using this product for a week now, it does work decent. I have bags under my eyes cause I’m a mom of 3 always on the go, but after using I could tell a slight difference and did think that it brightened up that area of my face. I liked the cooking sensation as well, it was not too much, just right. I would add to my routine.
