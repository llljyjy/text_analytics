Hydrating and cooling product for the undereyes! I feel that most eye creams I use leave my undereyes feeling heavy but this balm is very lightweight and cooling. There’s no scent which is great as it doesn’t irritate the eyes, and the balm stick glides on smoothly. While I have not noticed any difference in the undereye darkness, I definitely notice a difference in the puffiness after using this product! nan
