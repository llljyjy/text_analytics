Decent firming/anti aging serum. It has a nice light texture and scent, nothing offensive! I have combo skin and didn’t notice it to cause dryness/extra oiliness. I used this once a day and didn’t notice any irritation but I don’t have overly sensitive skin. I think this is great if you are looking for something light and gentle, but I think there are stronger products out there! I received this complimentary to try. nan
