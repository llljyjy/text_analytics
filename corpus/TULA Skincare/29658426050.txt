First time using this brand and I liked it. The consistency is thick and a little sticky, but it moisturizes the skin very well. The only thing is that it takes a long time to absorb, which can be an issue if you want to apply makeup after your skincare routine. I think it is a very good option for dry skin. If your skin is very sensitive or you have never used retinol/retinol substitutes, it is better to start applying it every other day so that your skin gets used to it. Good option for dry skin
