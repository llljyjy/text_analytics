Very surprised. I received this from influenster for testing purposes. I didn’t expect it to do much. It’s like a milky light liquid and spreads easily. The next morning my skin actually looked better.  Slightly plumped.  The best way to describe it is refreshed.  I am not entirely sure if it replaces a more harsh retinol but it definitely does something.  More so than other skin creams I have tried.  I recently went through a jar of the skin fix barrier cream and this did more in one use! Definitely does something.
