I received this product to try. The formula is smooth and glides easily under the eyes. If you swipe it about 3-4x under the eyes you feel the cooling effect and it will last long. After I glide it under my eyes it does leave a little white pearly color that you can blend by pressing gently into the skin using your ring finger. It has no fragrance. Cooling and Smooth
