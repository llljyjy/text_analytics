I received this Tula Skincare so polished exfoliating sugar scrub as a free product in exchange of my honest opinion. I have been using this product from the last few days, it gently exfoliates the skin with sugar, probiotics, papaya and pineapple extracts revealing a smooth looking and polished skin. It can be used by a person having sensitive skin as mine because it is so soft in texture.My overall rating for this product is 5/5 and I will be definitely buying it.I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a gentle and effective exfoliating scrub to include in your skincare. It is meant to be used by people of all skin types. Say goodbye to dullness
