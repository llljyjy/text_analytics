Gentle and effective! Iâ€™ve used other glycolic based toners in the past that have really damaged my skin. (Even my lips because I accidentally moved it around after applying moisturizer). This formula provides a nice resurfacing effect without overdrying. I use it daily, at night. My skin looks more even, pores less noticeable, overall smoother. I experienced no sensitivity and saw results, a win in my book!I received this product free in exchange for review through Influenster. Not too strong, just right
