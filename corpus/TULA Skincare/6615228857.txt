Normally I have really oily skin but during the winter I tend to get dry patches that flake. Usually I need to moisturize and do all these things to match the dry patches go away. This toner is so gentle and soft on the skin that during these morning that’s all I needed for the patches to go away. It also has not made me oiler than normal. My skin feels soft and has not cause any irritation or breakouts. I notice it brighter and that my makeup sets better since starting to use it. It’s definitely a staple in my skincare now despite the price tag! Loved it!
