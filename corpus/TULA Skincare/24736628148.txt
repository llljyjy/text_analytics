this product is super light weight you don’t even feel you have anything on your skin. i have really acne prone skin this product doesn’t make my skin breakout. it helps my skin to brighten the acne scars. i would recommend using this product at night and use good SPF sun screen because it contain vitamin c. so if you don’t use good SPF then it can damage your skin more. this is product is wonderful and this brand is really amazing would love to try other product from this brand. amazing product
