I really wanted to love this product, but after almost 3 months of use, I can’t say I would buy it again. It made no difference to my skin, and in fact, it was so greasy that it almost seemed to accentuate my forehead wrinkles (maybe my skin didn’t absorb it properly?). I’ve since had much better luck with other brands, like The Inkey List and Versed. All that said, I love the vibe and social responsibility of this brand, and I hope I might have better luck with other Tula products. No luck with this one
