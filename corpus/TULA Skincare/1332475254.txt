This serum is a great all around serum for daily use. It absorbs quickly and comfortably into the skin with no stickyness or residue which I really like. Usually serums feel very awkward on the skin. Also when used with a nice creamy moisturizer like the Tula day and night cream, it leaves your skin feeling supple and glowing. I definitely noticed my skin looking very smooth and glowing after using this product for a month. Maybe even a little brighter and evened out. I would definitely recommend giving this no frills serum a try and adding it into your beauty routine. You wonâ€™t be disappointed. I will definitely consider purchasing this product as my next vitamin c serum. Boost of Vitamin C!
