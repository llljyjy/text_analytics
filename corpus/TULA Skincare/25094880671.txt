I fell in love with this as soon as I put it on my skin, it is so light and fluffy. It was so easy to run in and it didn’t leave any greasy residue behind! This is in the middle budget wise but for the price it is most deff a 100/10 it didn’t break me out and I seen a major difference using it on my under eyes they were more moisturized, I didn’t have any flakey skin. I wanted to thank Influenster Tula for allowing me to test this product nan
