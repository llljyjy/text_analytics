When I first received this product, I thought it was some sort of gift because no instruction cards or anything came with it.. I haven’t tried much from this brand. I was excited to try this, as summer is coming in my state. I’ve only tried this once so far; as the last step in my skincare routine. I was outside for about 30 mins or so- and did not get burnt in 90+ degree weather. It made my skin very pretty/glowy. Ididnt notice a scent or any kind of cast. It was a gel like texture. It didn’t irritate me. I will def be trying this under makeup + using in the future on sunny/outside days! nan
