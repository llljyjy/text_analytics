I have oily skin and can be sensitive to certain products. These pads were refreshing with first use. I love the smell its not strong at all. Itâ€™s also mentions the pH-balancing toner pad that lifts impurities and purifies skin to tighten the look of pores. Love the clean feel and skin feels tingly and I felt my face was already moisturized. I would recommend this product. Even the price is excellent. I will be definitely trying more Tula products! Must try !
