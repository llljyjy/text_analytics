As someone with combination/oily skin that struggles with hormonal acne in my late 20s - I was real nervous when I saw the speckles of shine in this formula. However to my surprise, it has not made me break out once since I’ve used it. It also does not leave me feeling greasy or oily when I apply. This is the first “glow” sunscreen that I’ll be incorporating into my daily use. I am interested to see how well it’ll wear under makeup as I do get pretty oily when I have a full face on. I’ve tried other Tula products in the past and they’ve all been a hit! Not sure how it holds up too well in terms of its spf properties as spring just started but so far it goes on nicely and feels comfortable which is the main issues I have with sunscreens. I’d prefer with no shine still cause of my skin type but this makes me curious about their other products which may be better suited for me so far so good! even with acne prone skin
