I haven’t noticed any brightening effect yet but will keep using it. The formula is great, it’s not that sticky and it’s easy to apply evenly. It also absorbs very well. The packaging is great as well! Taking one star off because there are better and cheaper Vitamin C serums out there but this one is worth a try. Good!
