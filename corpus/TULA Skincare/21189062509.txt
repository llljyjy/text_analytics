I never used this brand before, but it wasn’t bad. I was quite surprised by it actually. It didn’t dry my skin out or leave any greasy residue. I like the fact that the smell is subtle. Great travel size, but the price took me by surprise a bit. Other than that, they seem to be good products. Great For Travel!
