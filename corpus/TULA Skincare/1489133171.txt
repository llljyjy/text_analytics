It’s an overall good product. It’s lightweight but it is slightly oily/greasy and skin can get oily in the T zone. The cologne is a tan color and leave a light tint/cast that goes away after some rubbing. Overall it’s okay if you have dry skin. But I prefer the unseen by supergoop at this price point. I received this from Influenster. nan
