I was gifted this complimentary product from Influenster for my honest review, and it has been a great addition to my beauty routine. The product feels nourishing and moisturizing to my under eye area without feeling greasy or “wet”, and it glides on smoothly and doesn’t tug at the skin in that area (which I’ve experienced with other roll-on eye care products in the past). I use it both in the morning under my makeup and in the evening after cleansing for added moisture overnight. When applying before makeup, I would advise to either be careful not to use too much product or give yourself some time for it to sink in before applying foundation or it could move your foundation around a bit. Otherwise, no concerns or recommendations for improvement - i haven’t used it long enough to speak to long-term effects but will definitely continue using it, and recommend trying it out. After using it multiple times a day for over a month, I haven’t noticed a change in the amount of product remaining so I would assume it will last for quite awhile, making the price well worth it A welcome addition to my beauty routine
