My skin had been suffering after using another sample I received from Sephora not being moisturizing enough and having no sleep due to vaccine booster pains. While I was able to subside the overall hot and irritated feeling in my skin using the FAB Arnica Mask pack and the Beauty of Joseon rice sunscreen, I did feel the moisture from my skin was zapped out way quicker than normal (as expected, but still sad). I remembered at night that I got a sample of the Tula moisturizer and it said “prebiotic“ somewhere on the packaging, so I thought ’d give it a shot since my skin enjoys plenty of brands’ prebiotic skincare lines.As soon as this got on my face it felt so perfect - so soft and cloudlike and I could feel the instant cooling and soothing to my skin. It is such a great texture for both day and night for me as a dry and sensitive skin person. I had been missing the plumpness in my skin due to the other brand’s product not delivering enough moisture for me, and the lack of sleep and pain was not helping either. But this felt like a soft blanket to soothe all my current skin problems.Texture and feeling after applying I can compare it most closely to the Paula’s Choice Antioxidant Enriched Natural Moisturizer, which (despite the other products I tried from that brand not working out for me at all) is my favorite soothing moisturizer I can always turn to. if it wasn’t for the fact this is significantly more expensive and I get much less than I do with the PC moisturizer, I would immediately only go for this. But even with the steep price point, I am seriously impressed with this product and I am glad there are many great ingredients I know and trust as both a skin care enthusiast and being a South Asian too (as I learned this brand is founded by an Indian origin gastroenterologist). I hope to keep trying more of this brand’s products to see if they have more stand out products that do justify the higher end prices compared to other most trusted brands. Perfect product, just wish it was more affordable
