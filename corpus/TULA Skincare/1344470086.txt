I was sent this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I personally like the pump dispenser as it minimizes contamination by avoiding using your finger to dig into the cream. I do recommend only using half a pump. I also like the bubble gum scent! For the actual cream, it was light and non greasy and absorbed easily into my skin. I did not have any break outs while using this (3 weeks so far) and no film or residue either. My skin was plump and moisturized. The price point is high but I would repurchase. Highly recommend!
