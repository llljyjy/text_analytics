I have always had puffiness around my eye area, and I finally found a product that does not feel sticky, greasy and it’s easy to apply. I love the texture and the fact that you can easily swipe it in your under-eye area. I have noticed a difference using it! It has improved smoothness in my skin and the puffiness around my eye. It’s formulated without parabens, sulfates, fragrance, silicone and other ingredients that you want to avoid. Before this product, I had never tried probiotic skincare. I will add this eye balm to my everyday skincare routine, along with more probiotic products I can find! I would recommend it to anyone that wants to improve the look of eye puffiness and reduce the look of fine lines. Goodbye eye puffiness!
