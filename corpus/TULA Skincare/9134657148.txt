I really like this product! I feel like it is the only cleansing product I need to was my face. It removed all my makeup including my liquid liner which I previously needed another product to remove. This wash only requires a small amount and comes to a lather leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh after use. The only thing I found was the smell to be a bit more soapy than Iâ€™d normally like. Good Product!
