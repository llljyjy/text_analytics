If you’re into cucumber scented products than this would be the one for you. As a whole the product has a nice texture, applies smoothly and doesn’t leave a noticeable residue. (I apply it at night before facial cream). It definitely improves redness and irritation associated with acne however I cannot stand the fake cucumber smell it has. If you don’t like cucumber scent I wouldn’t recommend this product & thus why I have to give it 3 stars. I received this product for free to test; if I had purchased it I would have returned it. Must love cucumber scent
