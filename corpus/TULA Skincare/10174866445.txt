After using this products for a week I noticed that there is definitely a “cooling” effect. Initially, when opening the product, I was surprised by the consistency of the stick. When I apply it, it is somewhat shimmery. The fragrance is sort of neutral, but appropriate for under the eye. I didn’t really notice a brightening affect other than the color of the product itself. Maybe this works for people with different skin tones. Overall good product. nan
