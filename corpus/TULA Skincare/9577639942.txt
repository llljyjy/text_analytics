Pros: By morning, my skin felt hydrated and smooth. I’m not sure what was going on with my skin before use but I was getting some breakouts and this seemed to have helped calm it down some. This is not an acne product but perhaps it helped to balance my skin with the probiotics. The cream goes on very smooth and has a nice feel. It makes my skin feel fresh, dewy and hydrated. I really like the packaging. It is a jar with a pump that doesn’t require me to dip my fingers into the cream. It dispenses by pushing down on the top and the cream comes through a center hole.Cons: Since I received this as a trial, I did not get to smell it in the store. The fragrance, while light, was a tad stronger than I prefer for a leave on night cream. I also wish there was a different scent, maybe more warm notes for night time. This reminded me of cucumber? Overall: the product is a great addition to my nighttime routine. After just a week it balanced my skin and left it feeling refreshed and hydrated by the time I woke up. It is not too heavy and goes on smooth with a nice finish. I’d recommend it for skin that needs a boost of hydration and moisture. Since I have combination skin, it was the right amount for me. *I received this product for free in return for my honest feedback. Skin left dewy and hydrated in the morning!
