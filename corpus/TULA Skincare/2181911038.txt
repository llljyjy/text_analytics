I got this product for free to review. When I opened the box and seen toner I wasnâ€™t too excited. I have never been able to stay consistent using a toner before. I tried them and immediately changed my mind! I love these toner pads, and will be keeping my container for refills. The pads are quite thin, but I find holding one side with my thumb against fingers prevents rolling. They have plenty of product on each pad and a nice light scent. Must try!
