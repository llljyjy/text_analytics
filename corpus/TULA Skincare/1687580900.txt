First, just generally had the worst shipping experience on my last order.  Box crushed, everything inside looked like it had been opened.  Anything without an internal seal I had to take BACK to the store and try to exchange, lest it have been contaminated. This was one such item and rather than exchange, I s/ just have returned.  It feels pretty much like putting on a sunblock stick.  Just a thick block, no real hydration, sort of sits on top of the skin vs. absorbing into it.  It’s just one of the worst buys I’ve ever made at Sephora (and I buy a LOT!  Those perhaps less so going forward after this...). Anything But a Balm
