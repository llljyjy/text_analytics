I’ve used a few Vitamin C serums, but this has been by far my favorite so far.It doesn’t have that awful “hot dog water” smell like so many of them have— it does have a mild scent, but nothing overwhelming. I’ve noticed my skin looks radiant and glowy, in a way it didn’t before. It actually feels softer and more hydrated as well.I think it’s pricey, for the size given, but I think I’m gonna have to replace my other Vitamin C serum with this one. I’m a big fan. The only reason I left a star off is because it’s too soon to tell if it’ll brighten my skin, but so far I’m very impressed. It’s also worth noting— I have dry and sensitive skin. If you’re not sure if it’ll break you out— do a patch test on your inner arm before putting it on your face!! I did get this item as incentive to review it, but my review is honest! I AM SO IMPRESSED
