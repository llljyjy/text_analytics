I got this product for to test out from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product is nice but I was shocked to find out it’s worth nearly 100$. Maybe due to the ingredients but I personally don’t notice any major skin difference. The packaging is nice, and the metal tip application feels cooling under the eyes, especially in the morning to wake up. The only con is when you push down for more product, way too much comes out.
