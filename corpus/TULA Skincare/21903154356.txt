I am absolutely loving the Claydate Detoxing & Toning Face Mask Stick that I received complimentary from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest opinion. The first thing I noticed was the nice fruity scent. It smells amazing! The easy no mess application, will make this product one of my top 5 favorites. My skin looks better and better each time I use the Claydate. I actually look forward to my Claydate a few times a week.Those little bitty bumps that camp out under the skin are slowly being evicted one by one. I am in love and highly recommend that others make a Claydate! Make a Claydate
