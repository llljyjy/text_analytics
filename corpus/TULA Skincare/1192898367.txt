I was so excited to try this product. I’ve been struggling for most of my adult like with tired looking eyes as well as bags under the eyes. I thought this product was great. I loved the cooling feeling it gave my skin and it helped brighten my eyes. It’s great for a day when you didn’t get enough sleep but you can also use it daily. It’s really made a noticeable appearance on my skin and gives my face a brighter appearance. I use it daily and have fallen in love with this product. I highly recommend it and I’m so happy to have received this product for free for my honest review. With so many products out there, it’s hard to choose and I really have found a gem with this one. Love love love this product!
