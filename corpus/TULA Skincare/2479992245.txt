Great sunscreen. It’s lightweight and doesn’t cause breakouts or make you look washed out. I love that I can wear it under my lotion and my face feels super smooth afterwards. For the price it’s definitely a good value. The only reason I knocked off a star because ideally this would be spf 50 and provide a bit more protection. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. nan
