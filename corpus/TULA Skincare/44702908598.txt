I received this product for free from Influenster to try and give my honest review. This under eye balm goes on smooth and dries quick. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks. I love the cooling effect, it’s not too strong. I use it under my foundation to give me a brighter appearance and to tone down the shimmer. It doesn’t do anything for my fine under eye lines, though. I’m going to continue to use in hopes that it will soften those fine lines nan
