Absolutely love the pump top on this cream, it makes it so easy to dispense. I’m not a fan of the smell, it is quite overwhelming and smells like chocolate and oranges which I do not like. My skin is fairly sensitive and it hasn’t been irritated by this cream so I count that as a win! It leaves my skin feeling nourished and moisturized! nan
