I’m torn on this product. I really love the application if it, the non-oily drops feel so refreshing and like total pampering when I apply it. But I can’t really say it does all that much for me. I do feel refreshed, brighter, and hydrated but only for an hour or so, nothing long term. I love having it as part of my routine, but I’m not sure it’s a necessary step. Soothing, pampering, but useful?
