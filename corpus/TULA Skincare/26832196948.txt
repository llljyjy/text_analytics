This sunscreen is one of the most unique ones I have tried. It leaves a nice glow and a dewy finish, which is enjoyable to me. It smells nice, no chemical smell like many other sunscreens. So far, it has done a great job at protecting my skin and not making me break out as I am pretty sensitive. It doesn’t feel sticky or leave any white cast. I have not used this under any makeup, so I’m not sure how that would go. However, if you’re a texture aware person, it does come out chunky. I wasn’t expecting that but the chunks do dissolve with application. Another downside I noticed - only product on my face was this sunscreen - a couple hours after applying, I barely rubbed a spot on my face and the product seemed to rub off like a bad primer would. Definitely did not enjoy that whatsoever. Overall, not the worst product but I wouldn’t purchase once this runs out. nan
