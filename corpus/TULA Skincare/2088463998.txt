I received these products for free from Influenster and Tula Skincare in exchange for my honest review. These items are the first Tula products I have tried, and I am truly impressed. I found each product to be moisturizing and gentle on my sensitive skin. I love that the ingredients are clean. You don’t get a lot of each product, but I will say that a small amount goes a long way. You don’t need much at all! I almost always leave the house with a full face of makeup, but these products made me feel so confident in my bare skin. My skin felt like it was glowing. I will definitely be incorporating Tula products in my skincare routine from now on. Very impressed! nan
