The texture of this serum is a bit thicker than the other serums I have. It feels like jam packed with so much nourishing good stuff in it. It’s with a light pleasant floral fragrance that I love. My skin feels smooth and hydrated after putting it on. It absorbed so nicely and doesn’t feel sticky at all. I put it on an area of dry skin to test it out and noticed the dead skin flakes came off after a few minutes it’s been on. Looks like it’s doing it’s job. Very Nourishing
