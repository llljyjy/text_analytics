This cleanser is one of the more substantial facial cleansers I have ever tried. The product is very gentle on the skin at the same time, it is creamy but not too bubbly. There is also a subtle fragrance that does not interfere with my skin routine which is always appreciated. It removes face impurities and keeps the face soft throughout the day. Highly recommended even with the steep price tag. Great Cleanser but steep price tag
