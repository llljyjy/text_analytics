I have heard great things about the Tula brand, so I was excited to try this Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment. My skin tends to be on the oilier side and the advantage to that is I feel I am less prone to wrinkles. I have, however, noticed that with more teleworking and exposure to blue light, my skin has looked tired and lackluster. After using the Tula Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment, my skin immediately looked more plump. The texture of my skin is so smooth and I could feel a difference as I applied my makeup. I took double takes as I looked in the mirror because my skin looked soft and my overall skin tone was more even. I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin since I began using this product. I detect no scent in this product and it is weightless once applied. I am really happy with the difference this Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment has made in my skin and I highly recommend. Significant improvement overnight!
