I received this product as a free sample from Influenster for my honest review. Firstly, I love the packaging it came in, the pump is very convenient and dispenses the perfect amount of product, which smells very very nice. After a few uses my skin had a nice glow but my dark spots were not lighter. I did notice that my rosacea was less visible which I loved but his product is not the most moisturizing. nan
