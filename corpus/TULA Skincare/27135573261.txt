Formula of this sunscreen is a 10/10 for me.  I am combo/oily, so I am looking for sunscreens that balance my skin out while still allowing for a glow, and this definitely gives that.  I think I like this formula more than any of my K-beauty favorites!  BUT, I am taking away a star because 1) the packaging is a bit messy & could be better and 2) the price per amount of product you receive is dismal.  Was happy to try this with rouge discount during the sale, but donâ€™t know that I would repurchase at full price. nan
