I received this for free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. This is my first Tula product ever and I enjoyed it a lot. This cream has a nice, whipped texture that is easy to spread and fast absorbing. I woke up the next day with plump and well hydrated skin that is also glowing. It can feel a bit sticky at first but doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my face. I took one star off because of the strong floral scent. It eventually goes away after 10 minutes though. Moisturizing, nice whipped texture, strong scent
