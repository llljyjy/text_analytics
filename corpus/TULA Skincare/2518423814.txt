This product actually surprised me once applied. It is non greasy and not heavy on the face at all. I noticed overnight that my skin was softer, and over time, it has helped to resurface my skin. My only issue with the product is the smell, the product smells somewhat doughy like, but it is overall a nice mask to wear overnight. nan
