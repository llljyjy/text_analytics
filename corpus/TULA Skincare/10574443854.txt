Useless product.  I wanted to like this because it would be cool to instantly brighten the under eye area , however the product just disappears so you have to reapply every hour. So what’s the point lol also I find it made the concealer cake up and my fine lines showed more than usual . I returned it and I don’t recommend it at all . Just get a nice highlighter instead nan
