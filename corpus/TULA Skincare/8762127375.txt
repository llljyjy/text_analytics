I have been using this serum for almost two months since receiving this complimentary from Tula in exchange for my honest review. Just to test the effectiveness of this Serum, I paused my Estee Lauder night serum and used this Vitamin C serum daily morning and night. I use three pea sized drops one on forehead and each cheek. After several weeks I did notice visibly my skin is brighter and not as dull as before. So for this price of 63$ and the size of the product I would say it’ll last you around 3 months depending on how often and how much you apply. There is no scent, easy pipette application, non-sticky texture and with the effectiveness I’d give it a 5 star. Highly recommend!!! Significant improvement/glow to your Skin!
