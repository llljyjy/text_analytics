I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about a month now. The serum applies nice and light and absorbs quickly into my skin. I love the pump top lid on this super easy to handle. I haven’t noticed a super huge difference in regards to brightening (only slightly) but then again I feel that this would need more time to fully work with regular use. Gave 4 stars at this time as it would probably have better results the longer I use it but only had a month to try it.  I look forward to seeing how it does with longer use.
