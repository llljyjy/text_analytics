Really like this eye cream. It’s definitely thick. I also notice that it will start rolling off if I rub too much so I try to pat it on gently to avoid this. I like the ingredients and the packaging is cute and convenient. The downside to the dispenser is that it dispenses a lot of product, way too much for the eye area so I have to kind of press it halfway rather than all the way down which can be annoying. I do feel like this product has helped keep my eye area hydrated and will continue using this! I’m excited to see the longer term benefits. Hydrating
