I received this product from Influenster and TULA in exchange for my honest review. I really liked the cooling feeling upon application of the product, and the packaging is very chic and pretty. It says it can be applied over makeup but proceed with caution because it does leave an almost shimmery color on your skin. It does brighten up your eyes though! Just remember to blend it in. nan
