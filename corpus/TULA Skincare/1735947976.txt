The cleanser itself was OK, but I just can’t get past the smell. I’m never bothered by scents, but this one reminded me of old-school cheap hotel/motel bar soap (some people will know). It’s so strong that I can’t stop imagining said bar soap while I’m using this product, so I can’t get behind it. Sorry, Tula. nan
