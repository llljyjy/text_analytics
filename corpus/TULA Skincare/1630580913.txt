Does this make my dark circles disappear? No. There’s some brightness because it’s shimmery (no glitter). I like it only because it feels cooling and I enjoy putting it on in the morning. It has caffeine too. I think I just enjoy the feeling of the cooling more than anything. I don’t have puffy under eyes but I think that would help people with such a problem as well. Don’t be unrealistic
