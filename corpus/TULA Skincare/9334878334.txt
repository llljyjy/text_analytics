It worked well as a light mid-morning moisture boost. I didn’t find a noticeable shimmer on my skin after application but didn’t mind really. My skin tone is fairly even but I did notice a slight reduction of a darker area on my cheek. I love how it applies with no greasy feeling. I can apply makeup right after the serum without my face being damp. Liked it!
