I was excited to try out this moisturizer sent to meby Influenster. Since I have only been using it for aweek I cannot comment on its claims to improvefine lines and wrinkles but here’s my honest reviewof what I have found. I am a very oily skinnedperson so I’m very wary of trying new moisturizersand tend to steer towards gel types. However thiscream is not heavy and feels light and refreshingon my skin. I often worry about the heaviness of acream or that it’ll make me extra oily. Not this time.It absorbs into my skin quickly making it feelhydrated and my makeup sits nicely over it. I alsolove the way it dispenses the product in a cute littleflower so I don’t have to put my fingers into the jar.It also has a nice light sweet scent something likebananas but it’s not overpowering. And while Idon’t have any sensitivities, this moisturizer got alot of appealing selling points to those who do.However, I do think the price point is a bit much.I’m going to continue using until it’s all gone to seeif I notice any major difference in my skin beforeeven considering purchasing this product myself.It’s nice but I wasn’t wowed, especially for beingpriced at $76. A nice one.
