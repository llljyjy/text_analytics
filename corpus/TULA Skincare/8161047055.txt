I 100% give this 5 stars. It is unreal amazing, as soon as you put it on you get a wonderful cooling sensation. It feels magical after you’ve been crying or if your eyes are tired. It also moisturizes and brightens. I’ve also noticed in the mornings my eyes usually have bags and this definitely helps subside those too! Overall I totally recommend trying it! Influenster
