Love the packaging and product. it met my expectations. I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review. I love that I don’t have to touch the product and apply it directly. I have used it both morning and night and it leaves my eye area moisturized. it’s has helped reduce the puffiness and adds moisture especially during winter months.  This is my first time using a Tula product and I am glad I tried it. I have an extremely dry skin and this has been moisturizing. Great product. Easy to use.
