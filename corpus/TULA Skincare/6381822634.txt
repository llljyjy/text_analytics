i have VERY textured skin..small bumps type, prone to having a lot of dead skin cells on the surface of my skin. i’ve been using it about a month now, and i gotta say..i do love it. it made me skin so soft, didn’t strip my face, and knowing my type of skin it was the right type of texture for it (sugary grit). i only use it once a week and i see a difference in my face texture, smoother. the scrub does has fragrance, but i don’t mind..nearly reminds me of a spa. part of my shelf <3
