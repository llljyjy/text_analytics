I got this product for free for testing purposes. After trying this product, I realized it’s not for me. Once I apply it I can feel the coolness and freshness instantly, but that’s about it. My eyes still have a dark and tired look and my eyelids are puffy. I don’t see myself using this product in the future and I wouldn’t recommend my friends to try it as it’s pricey and it doesn’t work well. There is a shimmer to this product but it goes away after lightly rubbing it for like a second. I know others were complaining about a scent but I person didn’t find there was a noticeable scent. Not for me
