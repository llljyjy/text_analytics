I recieved this product for free for my honest review. The container is cute and it’s very easy to apply with no mess. Doesn’t have a scent, or at least too subtle to detect. It glides on smoothly and withing a few minutes I can feel a light tingle. Not uncomfortable, but different. I took pictures before and shortly after I started feeling the tingles and noticed no  difference. I do  enjoy the tingle so I will keep using this and see if anything changes. nan
