I really enjoyed this mask and have used it three times already. The formula is a transparent, gel like consistency, with no noticeable scent. I have combo skin with some acne and have been very dry with the winter weather. I had no irritation or redness when using this product (I’ve had redness in the past with another fruit enzyme mask) and I didn’t feel like this made my skin feel super tight. I definitely made sure to follow up with my normal routine which has lots of hydration though. My skin felt noticeably softer after but especially the next morning after using my skincare routine my skin was softer, smother and overall it just felt like it added a boost to my routine. Great boost to my skincare routine
