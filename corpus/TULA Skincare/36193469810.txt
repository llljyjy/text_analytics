I received this product for free from Influenster.I just love the color of the packaging, it is very eye catching with its unique shape.This was my first time using Tula. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and what a difference in texture. My skin had been more on the dry side since winter, and my face is now so soft, like softer than my 4 year old daughters.I didn’t think it had a strong smell to it but it wasn’t a very good smell.I also didn’t find it made any difference on my fine lines or pores.
