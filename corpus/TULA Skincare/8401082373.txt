I used this serum for a month before writing this review because I wanted to be sure it did what it was supposed to do. I absolutely love this serum as a moisturizer, it’s bomb when it comes to sealing in that moisture and keeping you moisturized all day. Aside that, it didn’t do anything else for my skin. I do have sensitive and oily skin and this didn’t break me out, neither did it make my face more shinny. So if you’re looking for a bomb moisturizer then this is your girl…. nan
