I received the product for free from Influenster and Tulu for my honest review. I love how soft and clean this toner makes my skin feel. It doesnâ€™t not have a burning feeling or harsh smells. I was used to using products which were basically alcohol and this is night and day different. This is thicker like a jelly and cleanses and firms my skin in a natural way. Absolutely love this product. No Harsh Chemical Smells
