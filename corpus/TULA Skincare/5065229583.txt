I quite enjoyed this face mask, the mask itself is a clear gel with an orange tint that dries quickly on the skin. My skin was definitely softer but the most noticeable difference was It looked glowy and brighter immediately after. I did find that it was not as intense (and skin smoothing) as other resurfacing masks, but because of that I think I would be better for those with more sensitive skin. Usually more intense masks I canâ€™t use on my forehead because it breaks out, but this one I had no problems with. Definitely recommend giving it a try! great mask for glowing skin
