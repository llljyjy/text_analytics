I have combination skin that’s been quite dry before trying this product. My skin can also be pretty sensitive especially to overly scented products so I usually steer clear of them. This product has the nicest smell and it didn’t irritate my skin at all! It goes on light and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling. In about a week of using it morning and night , I noticed a big difference in my skin! It was no longer flaky and dry when applying makeup. I would definitely recommend it. My only minor dislike is the style of pump but that’s probably just a me thing! Smooth , hydrated and amazing smelling skin !
