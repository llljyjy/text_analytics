Love this exfoliating scrub. I have a normal type of skin and just after using the scrub my skin feels so smooth. The sent is awesome, it smells like candy and the texture very nice when you add a bit of warm water. It was the first time I use a product for my skin with probiotics and I loved it. Love that there is no paraben and that it’s cruelty free. Can’t wait to use it again. I recommand for sure! Love it !
