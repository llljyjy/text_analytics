It is easy to apply on your eye as it just glides on. However, it feels more like you’re putting Chapstick under your eye. If you like feeling like you have eye cream, this would be perfect for you. I’d suggest you let it sit for a bit before you add on any additional make up. It may be better for people with drier, more mature skin.I received this as a complimentary gift from Influenster to test for my honest review. It's like Chapstick for your eyes!
