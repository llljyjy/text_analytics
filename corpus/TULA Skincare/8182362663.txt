This product definitely has a scent that I’ve never smelt before in another product. You can tell it’s pretty natural! It does feel a bit more harsh on my skin but my skin feels super nice once I use it.I’m not sure if I would spend $42 on this scrub as I feel like that’s a bit steep for what you get and the outcome but it’s definitely a good self care product. I would recommend if it’s on sale, hence the 4 stars! It’s good!
