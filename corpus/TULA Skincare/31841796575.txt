I received this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. I am so happy Tula is now in Canada, I am totally changing off of my skin care routine to this brand. I have combination skin, and I struggle with my skin. I love the texture and the scent, it’s a fresh scent and the texture is perfect not at all too thick or greasy. After I put it on in the morning I’m ready to go it’s the perfect amount of moisture and I no longer feel dry. I have never tried probiotic skin care before but I’ll never stop now my face looks amazing. I’ve noticed my skin tone is much more even, and bright like I have a glow! Our northern Ontario winter has been harsh and this has been a life saver, I’m hooked and would recommend it to anyone! You won’t regret it. I'm changing my entire skin care routine to Tula
