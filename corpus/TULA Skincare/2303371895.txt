I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have to admit, I wasn’t entirely impressed. The night cream has a strong odor, however it is the best of this bunch. It evened out my skin but that’s what I have retinol for, which is a lot less expensive than this product. The rest did not do much for my skin. nan
