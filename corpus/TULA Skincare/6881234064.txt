I received this product complimentary Influenster, and it’s probably one of my favourite products to date.It’s a balm for your under eyes, and applies just like lip balm. I apply it directly after a shower, when my skin is warmer, and it glides on like butter.I don’t personally find that it tugs. It doesn’t have a cooling effect, and there is no perfume.  I have sensitive skin, and this product has been great.I’ve been using this for about a month, and I feel it has helped reduce puffiness, along with dryness. I will keep using this till it runs out, when I’ll most likely purchase it again...whenever that may be.  A little goes a long way!This product doesn’t feel oily, heavy, or sticky. It just feels nourishing, and hydrating for the skin. Very convenient
