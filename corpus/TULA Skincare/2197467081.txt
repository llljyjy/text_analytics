The cleanser is alright but nothing special. I don’t like the scent of it. The sugar scrub smells good but it dissolves so quickly, it doesn’t really exfoliate well. The moisturizer doesn’t smell good and I prefer my regular moisturizer. The Vitamin C serum is alright but again, I prefer my serum. nan
