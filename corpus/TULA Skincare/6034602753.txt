I was expecting it to be a lotion or some sort of serum but this was more like a Chapstick(looked and felt like) which made it difficult to apply and not get in my eyes so I ended up using my finger to apply . But I did notice a difference on my second use and It feels good on my skin so I’d probably recommend to someone who would need more of a dramatic change. Also keep it in the fridge to help with puffiness and it’s refreshing. Would recommend!
