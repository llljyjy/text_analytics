I received this product from influenster complementary for my review. First I’ll start by this is super nice and cold on the eyes so you get this feeling like you are de puffing the eyes and it feels really nice. But I don’t care for how sticky it gets under my eyes and takes a while to fully absorb. It leaves a really nice dewy look so I prefer to use this in my night time routine. nice and cooling
