Love the packaging. I have sensitive skin and didnâ€™t have any issues after using it for two weeks. I did find however that my skin was more sensitive to the sun when I applied it. So be sure to wear SPF. the pump is good. It actually dispenses a lot of product. I would use half a pump and also apply my own moisturizer on top. I would recommend this product. Light scent, if anything. Light weight and not greasy.
