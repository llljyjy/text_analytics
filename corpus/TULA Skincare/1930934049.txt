This has been one of my favourite Vitamin C serums I’ve used. I tend to actually not integrate Vitamin C into my routine because I find Vitamin C can smell a bit. This one smells pretty pleasant with the light citrus scent. I’ve only been using this one for 3 weeks, so it’s hard to tell if it will start to smell after some use. But in general I think my skin has been looking a bit brighter and I can definitely see myself integrating this into a longer term routine! Really have been enjoying this!
