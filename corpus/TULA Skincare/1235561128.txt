This is definitely cooling! It does leave a shimmer where applied so would recommend using before makeup I received this as part of an influencer campaign, though will most likely not buy a replacement. I didnâ€™t notice any difference in the skin around my eyes, just the cooling effect. Might give it a try again in the summer when the cooling will be welcomed. Cooling!
