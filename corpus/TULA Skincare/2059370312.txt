I like it! It feels nice on the skin, it applies smoothly. As for the claims I haven’t noticed anything really yet, but I haven’t been using it long enough I feel to get the maximum benefits. It leaves a tacky feel to the skin, so beware of that. I feel like it would make for a nice base for your complexion products because of the tackiness though. It has a light, cucumber scent to it so it’s very spa-like. I like it
