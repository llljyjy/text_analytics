The best sunscreen I’ve ever used in my life. I will never need to try another one. I used to use the supergoop glow screen before I got this one. This is way better. The texture is creamy & feels so soothing on my face. It doesn’t have a scent. It sits well under makeup. I just love it. Try it if you are in the market for a new sunscreen! I have dry skin & this one sits so much better on my skin than the glow screen did! amazing
