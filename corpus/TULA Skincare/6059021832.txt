I received this product compliments of Tula and Influenster in exchange of my honest review. This apt is great. I normally don’t care for stand alone facial spf’s bc they make my makeup look heavy or my skin greasy and sticky. But this one is awesome. It’s a gel formula that absorbs so nicely instead of sitting on the surface. It has a perfect amount of mica to give you a glowy, dewy skin flush. I will definitely repurchase this product. Beautiful glow!
