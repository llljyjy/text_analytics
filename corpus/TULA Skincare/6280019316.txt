5 STARS FOR THE ACTUAL PRODUCT. This face wash is great. It leaves my face feeling and looking wonderful. It has a good smell (strong but very subtle) cleared up my blemishes and uneven skin tone in only a couple days!However, this was my first time buying any Tula product and I was very disappointed in the packaging. The tube came with a broken seal and leaked all over & wasted so much product. Sephora did give me a refund but Iâ€™m hoping this is a one off packaging malfunction. AMAZING FACE WASH HORRIBLE PACKAGING
