I received this complimentary from influenster & Tula. I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. It smells good and it feels nice on my skin and I have noticed reduced pores. However, I have super sensitive skin and this product does not agree with it. I’ve noticed more redness, pimple breakouts and more oily areas on my t-zone than with other products. It’s ok..
