The cleanser itself is very nice—removes makeup but is gentle, but not too gentle to where you feel like you are just rubbing nothingness around.However the scent!!! Tula! Why?! It smells like some old Olay face lotion you’d find at the bottom of your grandmother’s makeup drawer. It’s a very odd scent for a brand that claims to be clean since it doesn’t smell like something found in nature and it’s very strong! Would be so nice if it smelled like orange peel, rose, lavender or lemongrass or something. Would be perfect if the scent wasn't so “old lady”
