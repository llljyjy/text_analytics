I received this kit free for review through Influenster. Overall I feel like this is a solid discovery kit. The sample sizes are pretty generous, enough to get a feel for the product, if it works with your skin, and if you want to spring for the full size. Two standouts in this kit for me where the depuffing eye cream and the probiotic moisturizer. Great Introductory Kit!
