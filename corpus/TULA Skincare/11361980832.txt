After using this product for about 2 weeks I noticed a difference in my skin. This is a great winter moisturizer due to how thick it is. Pairs nicely with my Belief face wash. I started using this as my night time moisturizer. becomes sometimes itâ€™s too thick. I would definitely purchaser this Thick Hydrating Moisturizer
