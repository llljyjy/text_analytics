I received this product for free from Tula and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love the way this product makes me skin feel afterwards. It feels smooth and exfoliated and leaves it moisturized. I love the fact that it smells lovely and is a clean beauty product! Only thing is that it does leave my T-zone a bit oily after, recommended more for dry skin! Polished!
