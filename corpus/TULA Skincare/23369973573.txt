This eye balm has a refreshing and cooling effect. It is very easy to apply and reapply throughout the day. After applying, it can leave a light blue highlight, which requires additional blending the product with your fingers. I would recommend it to friends who want to have an easy to apply hydrating eye balm. I like this eye-stick and use it as an addition to the more active eye serum. nan
