I enjoyed testing this product as I am someone who has ezcema and at time It will flare up under my eyes making it really dry and cracked where it will burn. This product was great at really hydrating this area without making it feel very oily which is something I hate about thicker creams. It is lightweight didn’t have much of a scent and best part it didn’t flare up my ezcema in this area which is always something I have to be careful of. Great eye cream
