✨I received this for free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review✨This sunscreen is great…if you like the dewy look. I have very oily skin, and as much as I wanted to love this-It had me looking a tad sweaty imo. The texture is a little gritty straight out of the tube, but goes on smoothly. I will say, there is absolutely zero white cast/flashback. I started using this along with my regular sunscreen as a highlight on no make up days, but it looks great under make up as well. No White Cast
