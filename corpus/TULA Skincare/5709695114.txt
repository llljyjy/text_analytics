I got this as a sample. The cream felt nice on my skin but unfortunately I had to wash it off an hour after application due to the scent. It’s a really strong, Dove soap-like scent, like I lathered my face in soap and didn’t wash it off. Unfortunately it gave me a terrible headache. Scent very strong
