I really love the pump- the way it dispenses. Super handy. The cream has a nice texture/consistency. It’s thick enough to make my skin feel hydrated but not too thick. The only thing I wasn’t in love with is the smell. To me it smells like tanning lotion. A little like fake coconut. Some people love the smell of tanning lotion however I don’t really like it. Definitely will still use it though! It’s worth it. nan
