I have used other vitamin c serums so I wasn’t sure how the Tula Serum was going to stack up. To my surprise I love this one. I find the packaging great and easy to use and apply the serum directly to my skin with the dropper before rubbing it in. The Tula serum doesn’t have the gritty texture some vitamin c serums do and for that reason I really enjoy using it as part of my nighttime skincare routine. I apply it with. The Tula moisturizer before bed and make sure to use an spf moisturizer during the day to protect my skin. The Tula serum is on the pricier side from what I have used in the past but a little does go a long way so I would consider repurchasing this product when it runs out. nan
