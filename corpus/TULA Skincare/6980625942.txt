I’m definitely a fan of TULA products now. This is a lovely serum that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky. I haven’t been using it long enough to really notice a huge difference with brightening but it feels great and doesn’t make my face oily. Great for wearing under your makeup. Vitamin C for me!
