For my taste, this moisturizer is a little heavy. I would suggest this for a night cream or makeup primer if you like a thicker, more intense moisturizing cream. I don’t think this is the best option for 24-7 use as the name suggests, but rather when your skin is dehydrated and in need of extra moisture. The experience isn’t my favorite due to how heavy it is, but there is not anything wrong or bad about this product. It gets the job done, just not my favorite personally. Heavier, thicker moisturizer
