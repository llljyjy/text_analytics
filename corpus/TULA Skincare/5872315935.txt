I’ve had a tough time finding a night cream that I really like. I have fallen in love with TULA! It applies easily, feels light once it’s on and my face look and feels so replenished in the morning. It appears less puffy and feels hydrated. I also love that this product is cruelty free and the easy dispense canister. I will definitely get again! Love it!!
