I have dry skin so I always need a lot of hydration. I love that this is clean, probiotic skincare. I love how the cleanser and moisturizer makes my skin feel soft. The cleanser is my favorite cleanser at the moment, it does a good job and doesn’t leave my skin feeling strip. It’s great for traveling or to try out Tulsa’s skincare. I just wish the moisturizer kept my skin moisturized a little longer because I have dry skin. nan
