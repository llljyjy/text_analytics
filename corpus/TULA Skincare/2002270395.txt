I really enjoyed incorporating this product into my skin care routine. I have never used probiotics before, but I found that using the serum morning and evening helped reduce my redness and keep my skin calm, especially after using a retinol. The serum smells very refreshing like cucumbers but has no irritating fragrance added, which is perfect for my rosacea. I would definitely purchase this product in the future! The only reason I would give it 4-4.5 stars is because the serum is a bit thick and the dispenser doesnâ€™t work that well, I find there are too many air bubbles and it is hard to get the product out. nan
