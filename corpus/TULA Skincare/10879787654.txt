Honestly if you’re willing to spend the money, do it. Its an amazing product and I swear by TULA products. Its gentle and hydrating without being oily, it’s helped my acne so much and I’ll forever rave about this product. Im sure you can find cheaper options but if you have the money it’s totally worth it One of my favs
