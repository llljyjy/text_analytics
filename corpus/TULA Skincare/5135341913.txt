Thick yogurt scented moisturizer, in a nifty cool gadget pretty container at a fair price point that can be purchased at Sephora. As someone who’s taken years to heal their acne prone skin I am cautious on what I apply especially a thickening moisturizer overnight. The packaging feels so tailored with premeasurized pumps. Warning it straight up has a lingering yogurt smell but once you are a habitual user, it’s not potent. Great for fall/winter months as our skin is less greasy. I apply mine overnight and can feel my plump skin in the morning after deep cleansing. It’s a must try. Repairing moisturizer that feels pure and works!
