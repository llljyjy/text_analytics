This sunscreen sinks into your skin and leaves an undeniable glow with no white cast. However, I had to take a star off and warn you that it is not travel friendly. The first time I put it in my travel skincare bag I was sad to see a decent amount of product had spilled in the cap. The next time I put it my suitcase I was very careful to pack it on top of everything and it still leaked. I was still able to apply the product using Q-tips to scrape out the excess but I will have to wash out the cap eventually. The picture is after 3 days of applying from the cap, applying a full face one time per day. I will still buy it and use it; however, I would not travel with it again. Great product, not travel friendly
