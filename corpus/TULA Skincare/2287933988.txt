In love! I bought this sunscreen from Ulta after watching KatieJane Hughes use it. I am black girl magic and believed that my melanin did not need sunscreen..besides I’m allergic to sunscreen. Boy was I wrong, I have aged backwards like Benjamin Buttons and I attribute it to this. It does have an odd texture, and can appear oily but dries down nicely. It has not flaked or peeled. No breakouts and no clogged pores. Beautiful on its own or under makeup, all while protecting precious skin. Chef’s Kiss
