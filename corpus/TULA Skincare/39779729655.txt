I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest review. I love Tula skincare products in general. This serum has a gel like feel to it and it initially does create a brightening effect on the skin. I do like this product and think it would work well for people who donâ€™t have acne prone, extremely sensitive skin. Not For sensitive skin
