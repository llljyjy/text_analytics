If I could give this product 4.5 stars, I would. I love it because the dropper holds just the right amount of product for my whole face, and I love the texture of the serum. I havent been using it long enough to see if itâ€™s made a difference but I quite like it.I recieved this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. Solid product
