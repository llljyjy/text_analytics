I received this face wash for free from Influenster and Tula for review. It’s a gel-based unscented cleanser. I typically use cream based cleansers and was pleasantly surprised by how hydrating this cleanser was compared to other gel based cleansers I’ve used. It left my skin looking dewy and after a few days of use, it evened out my fair skin tone. Great Gel Based Cleanser
