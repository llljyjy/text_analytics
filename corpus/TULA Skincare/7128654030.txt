*Received from Influenster for review*This is a decent cooling eye balm. It’s not something I would probably purchase myself as I prefer a more hydrating/moisturizing texture like a serum or cream under the eyes. I do like the cooling effect and I keep it in the fridge so I can use it in the morning. It feels like a nice wake me up in the morning on tired eyes. Overall, it’s ok. It’s ok, I like the cooling effect.
