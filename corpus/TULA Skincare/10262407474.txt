I really like how clean my skin feels after using this product! It genuinely feels softer and cleaner the more I use it. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because I’m not a huge fan of the scent but it’s pretty light so it’s not the biggest deal in the world, just something to note if you don’t like fragrances in your skincare items, this does have one. nan
