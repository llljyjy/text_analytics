This is one of the best sunscreens that I have found!  I have tried so so many.  I love that it is mineral based.  The ingredient list makes me smile.  If you research the ingredients you will see just how amazing this little jewel is.  It does NOT give me any break outs, which is quite rare with sunscreens; especially if you put this on then run 6 miles...think hot sweaty mess...still no break outs-no redness or irritation!  Simply the BEST sums this up ;0 Simply The BEST
