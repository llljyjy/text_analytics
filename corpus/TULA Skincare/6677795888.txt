First off this smells soooo good! It kinda smells like strawberry jam to me. Very sweet scent and I love how clean my skin feels afterwards. It doesn’t leave any oily residue and your skin doesn’t get dry and flaky like other treatments. I had some breakouts initially, which is expected especially if it’s working the way it should. Once those initial breakouts cleared up, my face was left feeling clean and clear. I have no blemishes and my pores no longer look clogged. I use it multiple times a week and what I love is the fact that you only need a tiny amount and a tube lasts such a long time. Definitely worth the price! I am in love with this!!!!
