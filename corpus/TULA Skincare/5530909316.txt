I have used the Tula illuminate eye stick (pink one)  in the past and didn’t like that it didn’t absorb into the skin. This one is a knock out. Tula nailed this product. It glides Over the eye and absorbs quickly. You don’t notice any residue under makeup application. I use it both in the am and pm. Definitely worth the buy. Makes your eyes less dry and crepey. nan
