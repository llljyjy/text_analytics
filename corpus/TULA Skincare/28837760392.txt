Iâ€™ve been using this now for over a week and I love the way it makes my skin feel!! There was a little trial and error at the beginning as the cream is thicker so I needed to use less than anticipated to cover my whole face. When I use at night my face feels well moisturized when I wake up in the morning without it feeling oily or like a second coat. Looking forward to continuing to use and see results! A great addition to my routine
