This is a very nice and light vitamin C serum. After using it for a few weeks, I can see the difference in my skin. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother. I like that it does not feel oily and absorbs right into my skin! I would definitely recommend this product for those who are looking for a nice vitamin C serum. My only complaint is the packaging. It is hard to pump out the product and it is hard to tell if youâ€™ve run out. nan
