This eye cream is the perfect consistency. It is moisturizing without being too thick or too watery. It is absorbed quickly and I can tell that it is moisturizing as the fine lines around my eyes are not as noticeable when Iâ€™ve been using this cream. The only con is the pump style tends to dispense more product than I need at one time. nan
