I have been using this for a week now and I like how my skin feels - lighter, softer and I can’t wait for the brightening effect (which I’m a fan of). The smell of it is bery refreshing and that’s one thing I prefer not too strong fragrance. I haven’t used anything with probiotic so I’m really excited about this product. Also the packaging is pretty cool. I will recommend this product and might continue using it. Love your Vitamin C
