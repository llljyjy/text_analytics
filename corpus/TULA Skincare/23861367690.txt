I love the entire line but this one has to be my new favorite. My skin type is combination and I have tried so many products to fade the stubborn dark spots but after using tula illuminating serum I’ve seen a massive difference. I am truly OBSESSED with the glow I get from this light weight serum. The good thing is it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky layer on your skin. The key to the product is probiotic technology which means multiple benefits anti aging, radiance, brightness, wrinkles etc. I will continue using this product in my skin care routine and will surely recommend this product to others. Already planning to buy one for my mom. Amazing Product
