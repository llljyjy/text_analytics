It’s a good product! It smells nice and absorbs quicklyInto the skin. However my skin doesn’t feel hydrated for longer than 3 hours and I need to reapply. It also leaves dry product on face like flaky areas if you don’t distribute evenly… it is lightweight and smells nice with is good my skin feels great after instant wear just wished it lasted longer. Have only used it for a week so cannot see any skin improvements yet! It’s nice
