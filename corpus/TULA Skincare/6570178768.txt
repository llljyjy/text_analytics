I got this as a free product to review thru Influenster. I love the moisturizer it feels very hydrating in the skin and has a good texture to it.It wears super well under make up which I feel like is pretty important.The packaging is great I love that I don’t have to drip my fingers into a jar to get my moisturizer out. The reason I dropped a star is because of the smell.It has a candy smell to it when first applied. It does go away when it’s on the face. nan
