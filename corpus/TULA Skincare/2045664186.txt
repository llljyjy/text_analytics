Products felt nice on my skin and were easy to apply. I didn’t particularly love the smell of the Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment or the Protect + Plump Firming & Hydrating Face Moisturizer, but they were light enough scents and absorbed quickly, so that wasn’t a deal breaker for me. The Instant De-Puff Eye Renewal Serum felt cool and lovely under my eyes. I’ve been using these products for about a month now and don’t notice much difference in my skin, so I don’t think I’d purchase them once they’re gone. But the Discovery Kit is a great way to try several Tula products before committing. nan
