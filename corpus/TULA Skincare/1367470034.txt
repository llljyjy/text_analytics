I’ve been using this product for a few months, and I really like it for a number of reasons. First, I’m very sensitive to products and this doesn’t irritate at all, even with repeated application. If you have puffiness, it will reduce it a bit (I recommend rolling or massaging gently first) and it improves dark circles - especially on video cameras :) I find it works well under concealer for extra brightness. The cooling sensation is nice, but I think that’s more for the sensation than effect. I use almost daily, and will definitely repurchase. apologies for the corny pun :) 'Eyedeal' for Video Meetings
