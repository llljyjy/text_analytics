I have a really difficult time finding products that work for my combination skin. This product is great because it acts as a toner and almost like an exfoliator for my skin. However, most pads I have tried in the future are a bit too rough and harsh on my skin. This one IS NOT! It is gentle and smells very fresh. Great for my sensitive skin. My face looks healthy and has a glow after I use this product. I will continue to incorporate this into my daily routine. The only thing that would push me from repurchasing is probably the price, I do spend this much on toners but I am a bigger fan of the liquid toners rather than pre-soaked pads. I love that this product is in the “green at sephora“ category as I am trying to switch into a more healthier and conscious lifestyle. I also love that this product is refillable so I am not wasting plastic every time I buy more. Good Product!
