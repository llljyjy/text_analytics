Iâ€™ve never used a serum before on my skin, I thought it would be greasy but I was happy to see it was not! It was very light weight, I hardly felt that it was on my skin. It was easy to apply with the applicator. As I have sensitive skin, I am only using every 3rd day. My skin does feel healthier and smooth. I am surprised with this serum and in love! I highly recommend!I recieved this product free to try for my honest review! My favorite
