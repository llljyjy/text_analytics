Pretty good moisturizer. The texture is thick. If you are looking for more of a heavy moisturizer this one is good. I didn’t notice much, I’ll definitely need to use it more. The only thing I really noticed was how moisturizing it was! The automatic pump dispenses quite a bit of product, I usually just used the excess on my neck, chest, and hands. nan
