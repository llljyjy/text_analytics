I’ve been using this every night for the past week and my skin already feels smoother and more hydrated. My current routine doesn’t contain AHAs or Vit C, so I was pretty happy that my skin hasn’t shown any irritation or sensitivity.  I make sure I wear sunscreen during the day, since these ingredients increase photosensitivity. The bottle is a vacuum pump, you push the whole top portion down and the lotion pops out the middle. It does a great job keeping things air tight, there’s zero waste, and the push button is very good at dispensing as much/little as you want. The only weird part is you have to sort of smear the product off the container. nan
