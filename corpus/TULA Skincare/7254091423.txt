Never leave reviews but this smells so strongly of laundry detergent that the taste gets in my mouth (even though the product is not actually in my mouth) every time I have attempted to use. It is so overwhelming that I canâ€™t move past it to actually review the effectiveness of the product. For the record, scented products never bother me. No No No. Is this laundry detergent?
