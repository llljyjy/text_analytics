I received this product complimentary from TULA and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have oily-leaning combination skin, so I was a little surprised that I was sent this cream, which seems more geared toward a drier skin type. With that said, overall it worked really well for me! It absorbed well and left my skin feeling really smooth. My t-zone did get pretty oily a few hours after using this, but the rest of my face didn’t slick up and remained very soft. (To be fair, my t-zone is oily literally all the time and the only thing that has ever tamed it had a hefty dose of alcohol, so I don’t think any less of this cream for not being able to handle it.) Going forward I plan to keep this cream in my nighttime moisturizer rotation and will continue to use it on non-t-zone areas during the day. This has a pretty strong peachy scent, which I did find pleasant, but beware if you’re sensitive to fragrance. Surprisingly suitable for oily/combo skin
