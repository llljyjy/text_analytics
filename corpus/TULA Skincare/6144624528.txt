Honestly have been loving this cleanser! For the comments about the scent, I can describe it best as almost a laundry, slightly floral but very fresh scent (think almost like Moroccan Oil), and I love it so much. The cleanser itself cleans the skin and removes all traces of makeup, better than I thought it would for sure. It also doesnâ€™t leave your skin feeling overly dry either. Bought the mini and will definitely purchase the full size. One of my new favorites!
