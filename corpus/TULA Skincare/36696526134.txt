when I first started these toner wipes I was super skeptical, they made my face feel super sticky throughout the day. after maybe 15 or so days it stopped being sticky and I did notice a difference in the tightness of my skin. but I’m not sure if I would buy it again, for my skin personally I couldn’t put moisturizer on after this otherwise my face would become greasy. nan
