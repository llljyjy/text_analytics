I prefer this eye cream over the jar types. The metal applicator helps smooth the cream over the eye lid and under eye area easier and with less pulling and tugging at the delicate skin. It is very soothing and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. I found a half pump under each eye was more than enough anything more and there is just too much product and made my eyes water. The formula is light dries down quick and leaves the skin very soft! I love using this product especially after a night of drinking; for obvious reasons of having puffy eyes but also because of the caffeine used in this product (coming from tea!) and the cooling sensation it not only wakes you up but if you carry the product in to your temples it helps with headaches. I received this product free from Influenster to try and review. Easy and convenient
