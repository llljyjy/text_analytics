I have combination, dull skin with a few dark spots.  After using the product for a few weeks I donâ€™t really notice a change in my skin texture.  The scent is a nice and refreshing mandarin and the texture is an absorbing gel/cream.  The dispenser is nice but it dispenses more product than needed.  I will continue using this moisturizer and hopefully will notice a change in my dark spots. Refreshing Feel
