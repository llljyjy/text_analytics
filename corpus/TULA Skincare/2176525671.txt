I received this product from Influenster and this is my honest review.This product feels refreshing on the skin and leaves it feeling soft with no greasiness after application. I apply it twice a day - morning and night - per the instructions, and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. A+ to the ingredients list! I gave it four stars since I am personally not a fan of the cucumber scent, and it is a bit pricey for what you get. I’ve only used it for a couple of weeks so I haven’t noticed any difference regarding my redness. Once I use it for a couple of months, I’ll be able to see if I would incorporate it into my daily routine! Refreshing!
