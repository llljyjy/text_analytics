Putting skincare or makeup in stick form is a sure fire way to get me to try it. I lose motivation to stick to a routine quickly, but for some reason sticks don’t fall off my radar. It could be the ease of use or the novelty factor, I’m not sure. Either way, if I could rate this 10/5, I would. I’m a mother to two toddlers, so I’m absolutely no stranger to dark and heavy under eyes. The cooling sensation helps me survive until my coffee is brewed, and I’m convinced it makes me look brighter (as though I slept more than 5 hours!)This will read as an exaggeration, I know that, but it absolutely is not. The fragrance along would be enough for me to replace when I use it up! Late twenties holy grail.
