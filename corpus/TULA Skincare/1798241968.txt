Honestly, this product is mild to the point it does absolutely nothing. I was hoping this product would be a little more scrubby and aggressive because I have quite a bit of texture sometimes... but it’s very mild. To me, this product is very similar to the skin prep scrub from Dermalogica (which is very gentle). I am not a big fan of this and wouldn’t repurchase. Not Scrubby Enough
