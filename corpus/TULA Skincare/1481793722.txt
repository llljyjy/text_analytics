I have received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for over a couple weeks now and I have got to say, it’s probably one of the top Viatmin C serums for me so far. It’s lightweight, hydrating, doesn’t irritate or feel sticky. Leaves my skin looking and feeling refreshed.I like the size of the bottle as well as the applicator (drops). I look forward to see additional positive changes to my skin with this Tula product. If you’re looking for a Vit C serum. This is it!
