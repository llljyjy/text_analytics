This is much gentler on the skin than regular retinoids which I think makes it great for beginners or anybody that has a lot of sensitivity to retinol.  I always feel odd about using these products in the daytime (even under heavy SPF coverage) but maybe it’s not as much of a problem since it’s a retinol alternative and that might react differently to the sun’s rays.  In any case, I chose to only use this in the pm, once a day.  It felt like there was some slip when applied to the skin but it dried down fine.  I did look pretty shiny after using it though and that’s usually how I look after any serum because I have oily skin.  I like the packaging a lot, the dropper is hygienic and I just like the way it looks.  I think it looks more sleek than the regular droppers where you have to squeeze the top instead of pressing like this one.  I tried this from influenster in exchange for an honest review. nan
