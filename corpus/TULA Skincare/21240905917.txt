This is a great eye cream, I have tired, sunken eyes and I found that this eye cream had made such a difference. It’s a nice subtle scent and thick consistency, but doesn’t feel too heavy when you sleep. My only cons are that it’s expensive, and if you’re not consistent with it, like any skincare routine, you’ll stop seeing the benefits. Great product, but expensive
