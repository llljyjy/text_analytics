So I’ve had the product for about two weeks and I use it about 4 times a week. I have combination skin and this works well for me but I’ve noticed my T-zone gets a little oilier than usual so I wouldn’t recommend for oily skin!I quite like the scent, it’s not too strong or sweet. The sugar isn’t too harsh on the skin and my skin is noticeably softer! The first time I used it, I couldn’t stop touching my face, great for dry skin! Worth Trying!
