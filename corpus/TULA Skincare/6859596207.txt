I received this product free to review. It’s really pleasant to use. I use it in the morning for a brightening boost. It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly and well under SPF and makeup. I like the pump and I especially like that you can still screw the top off to get all of the product when the pump stops reaching. It’s not life-changing but I would buy it again. nan
