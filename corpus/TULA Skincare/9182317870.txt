I would rate this 3.5/5 if I could. If you are sensitive to fragranced products, I would not purchase this. It’s a very nice consistency - lightweight and my combination skin absorbs it really well, but the fragrance is very strong and it lasts quite a while (it’s not a bad scent, it’s just too strong). Not for me. If you don’t mind using a moisturizer that has a lasting scent, then I would recommend giving this a try because it does moisturize well while feeling lightweight and it did brighten and plump my skin. nan
