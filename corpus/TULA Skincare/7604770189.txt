I love the consistency of this product and that it has no scent so it doesn’t interfere with the rest of my skincare routine. The instructions state to pump 1-2 pumps onto a cotton round but you definitely need more than 2 pumps to get the right amount of product; I wouldn’t use a cotton round unless you want some exfoliation bc they soak up product. I’m not sure that I would buy again bc it left my skin feeling sticky until I used other products on top of it and I prefer a more fresh feeling face. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Liked it
