I was sent this product to review.  I have used it for two weeks now.  I find it too thick and greasy to use as a day cream. I also prefer to have an SPF in anything I wear during the day.  It states it is fragrance free but it has a very strong fruity scent which lingers for a long time after application.  I ended up using this as a night cream as my skin is already oily and I didnâ€™t like the shine it gave me.  I did not notice any significant changes to my skin texture after two weeks. Better as a night cream
