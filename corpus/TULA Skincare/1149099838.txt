I love everything about this eye cream. It is extremely hydrating without feeling overly heavy or greasy.  It leaves my eyes looking well rested and feeling refreshed. I love the bottle and the applicator pump because it distributes the perfect amount of product without contaminating the rest of the eye cream. I will absolutely be repurchasing this when I run out. Itâ€™s a new favorite. I received this product complimentary in exchange for a review but all opinions are my own. I really do love it. Love this eye cream!
