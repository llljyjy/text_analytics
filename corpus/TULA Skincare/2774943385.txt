I received this product from Influenster my review. This product really works to brighten and illuminate skin. I used this in the morning before moisturizer, and almost immediately noticed results. I thought maybe I was imagining things, but my sister commented on how great my skin looked and didn’t know I was trying this product. The only downside is the smell. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be unscented, but it does not have a pleasant smell - at least it disappears quickly. This really works!
