I love that it is super convenient, I can just apply it whenever my skin feels dry, I use it for any part of my face not just for my under eyes. It is very refreshing and cooling too, and spreads very easily so it doesn’t drag my skin. I feel like it doesn’t provide enough moisture/hydration, so I think this is best used in summer when my skin needs a bit of cooling and not much hydration. Very cooling, but not much brightening
