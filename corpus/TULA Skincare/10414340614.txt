Alcohol free, so no stinging/burning on the skin. Love the gel consistency so I can just use hands to tap into face and save my cotton pads for more liquidy stuff. Pump design was confusing though. I kept pumping and nothing came out, so I unscrewed bottle and realized it had no straw. Which meant I had to turn the bottle upside down before pumping. Good formula, but confusing pump
