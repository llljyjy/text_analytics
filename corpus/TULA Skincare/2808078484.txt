Iâ€™ve been looking to try out a new under eye cream and this has been amazing. It feels cool when applied and rubs in well leaving you feeling hydrated and smooth. A little goes a long way so you feel like you do get your moneys worth.  I love clean beauty and have been trying out new products because I am pregnant and trying to be as safe as I can be. It can be used while breastfeeding too which is amazing.   I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and I have noticed an improvement in the darker circles under my eyes and that my skin feels smoother and hydrated. I would recommend to anyone who wants to improve the appearance of under eye circles and try out a clean beauty product! Definitely worth the hype! Super hydrating
