I received a sample of this and was so excited to try it. Unfortunately the scent was overwhelming. As someone with sensitive skin, this made my hands and face irritated after using it. The scent is long lasting too which for me isnâ€™t something I enjoyed. My skin did feel pretty clean after using it and it did an alright job of washing the makeup off my face. Overwhelming scent
