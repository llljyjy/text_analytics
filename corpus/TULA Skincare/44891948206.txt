I received Tula Moisture Intense cream complimentary from Influenster. The packaging is very pretty. The jar it’s in is iridescent and really nice.The cream is very smooth and dense. It is not greasy or sticky. Unlike other creams I’ve tried, it does not change the look of my foundation, which is great! It feels very hydrating and my skin doesn’t feel dry throughout the day. The only negative I have is it seems like I have to use more for coverage than my usual moisturizer would take. Great moisturizer!
