I have dry skin and my face is very red, all the time. This moisturizer has a very nice, citrus scent to it and feels very lightweight and silky. It was nice to apply to the face. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and haven’t noticed any changes to my skin. I don’t like the way it dries, feels like there is constantly a mask on my face. Nice moisturizer just not for me nan
