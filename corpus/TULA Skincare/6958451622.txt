I received this product complimentary from influenster and I was really excited because initially I was using a separate vitamin c serum and other serums but this one has everything that I use separately in one go! I like the smell and how it applies onto my skin, it definitely helps in every way. I’ve been using it for about a month. The only thing is that you need to follow up with another moisturizer or else your skin won’t stay hydrated all day with this alone and definitely need to add SPF to see the results of the bit C’s brightening effects! I’d recommend this as a go to in your skin care essentials if you want to keep the amount of products used to a minimum. It's dope
