I have dry and really large pores. My blackheads around my nose area are really stubborn and I have been trying to find a product to really help. I used this for around 3-4 weeks and havenâ€™t really seen a difference in the appearance of my blackheads. If you want a physical exfoliant in your routine that helps make your skin smooth and minimize the appearance of texture then I would recommend it. I think of this more as a chemical exfoliant rather than something that targets blackheads. Doesn't help much with blackheads
