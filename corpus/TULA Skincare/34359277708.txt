Works! easily incorporated in every morning routine. Im impressed that it makes my skin feeling healthy that whole day. It leaves my skin a nice glow too.Its unscented and very gentle even on my first use. Packaging is so pretty too. If you have dry &  dehydrated skin especially if youâ€™re using retinol at night, its time to use this product. Product that works
