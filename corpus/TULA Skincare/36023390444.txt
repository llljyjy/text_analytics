Right from the get-go, this product was enticing to me. It indicates that it’s probiotic and super foods which is really trendy lately so I was intrigued. Another positive about this product is that it is cruelty free which is something I look for in products, especially ones for my face. I have tried other exfoliating scrubs before but found that they were too harsh on my skin and would give me rashes. That’s why I’ve been turned off of exfoliates for a while. However, this  product seemed to be very mild and had a very pleasant smell. The smell had some Island Beach vibes (pineapple snd papaya scent) but not in an overpowering way which I liked. The scrub itself is quite lightweight and does not have an oily or sticky feel to it. Once I rubbed it on my face it felt soothing and not harsh on my very sensitive and oily skin. I am very hesitant to try new brands, however this brand, is right up my alley. I’ve only used it a few times so I can’t really say, just yet, the long term results it will have on my skin but I am very hopeful that it will reveal smoother, brighter and more even looking skin, as the product advertises. I really like the feel to this product on my skin because it feels quite gentle and doesn’t have any harsh ingredients or chemicals. I would definitely recommend trying out this product. Gentle & lightweight exfoliator
