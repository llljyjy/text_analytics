I’m not a huge complicated skin care routine person. I usually find one/two products and stick to them. I’ve never had a eye cream before. I received this product free to review and was pleasantly surprised how it fit into my life. It’s very convenient to use, one reason I don’t like using some products is because of messy applications- I love the firm product in stick form vs a pot of cream/tube of cream. I decided to throw it in my purse and find myself using it as a nice little pick me up. The cooling effect is very subtle which is nice for me. I was travelling on airplanes and to a warm climate and it was on me the whole time. I used it a lot and my skin thanked me. Unexpectedly awesome
