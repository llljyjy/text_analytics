I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I am not the biggest fan. I have previously used their blue packaging eye balm which I loved, but this specific product does not do as much to my under eyes as their previous products. I would not recommend using this product in the day time, as it did leave very dark circles for some reason. They did clear up and there was a tiny bit of a difference, but I’ve seen better results from just upping my water intake. Unlike the blue packaging, this one absorbs into your skin a little bit better, which is always nice, however there isn’t a nice cooling feel to it like the blue one. In fact, it hurt under my eyes to use this, but I do have very sensitive skin. I definitely do not recommend this product even though it wasn’t terrible, just because of the price. I’ve seen products work better for less money. Not the biggest fan
