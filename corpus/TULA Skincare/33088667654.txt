This is a nice clay mask stick. The packaging really make it easy for apply the clay mask to your face with no mess at all. The mask doesnt smell all of clay it has a slight really fragrance nothing over powering. Detoxing & tones the skin leaving ypur skin really soft. The price is a little expensive for a mask, but I would still purchase, and I would recommend to family and friend because it is a really good mask. Compact Mask Stick
