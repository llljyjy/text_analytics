I received the TULA Skincare Claydate Detoxifying & Toning Face Mask Stick complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Overall, I am super impressed with this clay mask, and I have definitely noticed that my pores have become less noticeable. My facial pores  are so difficult to cover with makeup sometimes, however just the other day I noticed that they looked so much better! I love the roll on concept of the product, it makes application so much easier and less messy. I did however remove one star due to the overpowering, strong scent. I definitely recommend this for anyone searching for a clay mask. Great!
