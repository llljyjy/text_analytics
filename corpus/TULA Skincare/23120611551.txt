I have been using Vitamin C products for a while now and I really love this product. It has a fairly faint Vitamin C scent, not overwhelming like other Vitamin C products. No added synthetic perfumes or whatsoever, just a natural citrusy scent. I had no problems with this product, no burning or tingling sensation, itchiness, redness, or dry patches. The consistency is in between a cream and a gel, not greasy, and just glides effortlessly onto my skin. It gets absorbed fairly quickly. My skin looks refreshed, glowy, dewy, and radiant. I love it. The moisturizer comes in a pump, which is perfect as it prevents any bacteria getting into the product. But, the top is not sealed, you can still open it when the pump doesnâ€™t work any more and can get every bit of the product out. I really love it! Glowy and radiant skin
