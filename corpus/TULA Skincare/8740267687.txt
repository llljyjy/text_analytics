I enjoyed trying these out from Influenster, but donâ€™t think that I would ever pay the full amount that this kit is running. The samples are so small. The products worked well for my skin, but the retinol did give me some redness and irritation (my skin is very sensitive so I expected that). The daytime lotion, however, I found to have a very unpleasant smell. My skin liked it, but I could never use the lotion in my regular routine due to the scent. Glad I tried it
