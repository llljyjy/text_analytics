I love the ingredients of the peptides and the superfood that this eye cream claims it has. The packaging is not my favourite, but I like the metal eye applicator. Unfortunately it didn’t mix the best with my other products I used it with and pilled up on my skin, but I used it again at a later time with different products and it was fine. I haven’t noticed much of a de-puffed look to my eyes. As of now, I don’t think I would recommend this as I’m sure other eye creams would be just as good. Not bad, but nothing groundbreaking
