I really like this nighttime eye cream. I have dark circles and am getting older so I’ve noticed fine smile lines. This eye cream is super hydrating and absorbs into my skin easily. I have also noticed that  my dark circles have lightened up a bit and my under eye skin is firmer. This cream can be a little “greasy” if too much is applied and a little goes a long way. This container should last for a while. I would definitely recommend giving this a try. I have sensitive skin and this did not irate or break my skin out 10/10 Adding to my nighttime routine
