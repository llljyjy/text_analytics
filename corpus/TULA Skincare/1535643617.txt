I was really excited to try this vitamin C serum as I’ve struggled with residual dark spot scarring from acne spots. I’ve had this product for roughly a month now and I’ve been really enjoying it. It’s lightweight and not sticky which is great. I layer on a moisturizer over top to lock in moisture and I’m set to go. I’ve noticed a slight difference in my dark spots on my cheeks but I think I’ll need to continue to use it to see it’s full effects. I was also pleasantly surprised that the scent was good. I’ve tried other vitamin C serums that are hard to wear on your face because of the smell so that’s a plus for me. Definitely worth giving this serum a try! Lightweight Vitamin C Serum
