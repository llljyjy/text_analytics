I received a complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. This is my first time using a Tula product and all I can say is wow! First of all, the dispenser for this product is genius. It looks like a regular jar, but when you take off the top there is a pump inside that releases the perfect amount for your face and neck! I love that it keeps the product hygienic and keeps me from scooping too much cream at once. I did notice the smell right away- it’s a heavy floral scent but overall I don’t mind it, especially given the results. This cream is thick, feels luxurious, and absorbs fully without leaving a greasy feeling. After one use, my skin was soft and looked bright. After using for a week, my skin feels hydrated and looks smoother than before. I feel more confident in my skin and look like I just got a facial! A little goes a long way and this container will last me a while, making it an awesome value for me. new favorite night cream
