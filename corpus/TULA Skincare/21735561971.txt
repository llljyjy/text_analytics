I’ve received this product for free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I like this cream, it’s kinda thick but it’s not a problem, just an advice not to put it under the make up. Although it is a night product, I use it in the evening and wash out before going to bed or use it during the day, I don’t like using anything in the under eyes area before bed.Also an applicator is very nice too. Nice and smooth
