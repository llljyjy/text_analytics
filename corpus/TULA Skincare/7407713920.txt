After a long search, I finally found my perfect sunscreen. I prefer mineral sunscreens, but as a Black woman, it’s difficult to find one without the dreaded white cast. This has a bit of a tint, a peach that evens out your skin, without providing any coverage. It doesn’t burn my eyes and there’s no smell. It also stays put on my oily skin. Give it a try! nan
