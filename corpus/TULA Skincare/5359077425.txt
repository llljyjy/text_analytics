This makes my face feel so soft after. It’s gritty enough that you feel it’s doing something but not aggressively so. Also I accidentally got some in my mouth the first time I used it and it didn’t taste bad….I mean, I’m not recommending you buy this to eat it but if you accidentally do it’s not terrible! Haha Tasty
