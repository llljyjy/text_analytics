I received a full size sample of this 60count toner pads. Immediately I was faced with a bit of difficulty to open the product. It took some effort to unscrew the top, after that I peeled back the aluminum foil and then it was all good to start enjoying these toner pads. I have replaced my toner with these pads for the last 7 days. I really enjoyed the smell, earthy and refreshing. The pads are pre soaked in naturally made toner ingredients free of chemicals common found in other leading brands. I love how my skin feels after application. My skin feels bouncy and rejuvenated instantly. I then let it air dry and then apply serum and lock in with a moisturizer. It fits perfectly into part of my face wash routine. I love how convenient it is and not wasteful anymore because each pad is already soaked in toner. I would not have to worry about excess toner escaping through my palms from  the traditional toner method. I also love the natural factor in this product, recommend others to give this a try! Difficult to open at first but a great joy to use!
