I love the concept of this toner and that is has prepared pads! And the biodegradable helps so much because I’ve done my best to switch over to reusable for other toners. The product felt very refreshing on my face and has worked well. I do hope they change the pass themselves. They’re very small and thin, which means they begin to roll up and you can’t properly use them all over your face. nan
