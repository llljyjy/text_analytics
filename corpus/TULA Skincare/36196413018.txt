I bought this thinking it would be a nice light eye treatment for summer, especially with the cooling factor. It is very light - it doesnt affect the skin long term in my experience, but it is nice and cooling and slightly moisturizing upon application. It definitely feels like an extra step and not a necessary one. I probably wont ge buy again bfor the price nan
