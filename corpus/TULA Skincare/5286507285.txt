I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I have been using this serum once a day in the morning (packaging recommends twice a day) for about two weeks and so far I can see some small improvements in the texture of my skin. I have combination skin in a dry climate and tend to get hormonal cyclical acne still. This product is more preventative for me as I don’t have deep wrinkles, but has improved the appearance of fine lines especially underneath the eyes. I find the scent quite unpleasant (like old beer) probably because of the fermentation, but the packaging is great and the serum itself goes on smoothly and sinks in fast. I don’t tend to spend this much on skincare yet and the price point is quite steep, but I think probiotics/fermented skincare does have some benefits. Star off for the price and for the scent but otherwise I am enjoying the product so far. nan
