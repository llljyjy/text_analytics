I am super impressed with this product. I have only been using this for almost a week now AM & PM, so I know that’s not enough time to see a huge difference. However, what I have noticed is that my under eyes feel more plump and look & feel more hydrated. In turn it makes my fine lines less noticeable especially when I am wearing makeup. The product is lightweight and absorbs nicely into the skin. A little goes a long way. This is the first product that I have ever tried from this brand and I’m now very intrigued to try more. Very impressed with this so far. impressed
