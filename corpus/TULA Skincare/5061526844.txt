I’m not a huge fan of this product.  Not sure if I had a defective bottle or not but it took over 20 pumps to get the product out of the bottle.  I didn’t like the smell of the product and just thought it was okay.  I have combination skin and from what I could get out of the bottle it didn’t make a difference on my skin. Not Thrilled
