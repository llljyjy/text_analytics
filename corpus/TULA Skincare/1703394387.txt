This product is amazing! I have used it for a week now and I have been seeing changes on my face for dark spots/acne scars. I have noticed within 7 days how much it has lightened those areas. I typically have combination but during the seasonal change. I do have dry skin.My skin stays hydrated I am currently using it with my Ordinary serums and moisturizer and I find it really effective. Definitely will purchase and will be apart of my skincare routine. The pump and the packaging is so cute. I only use 1 pump in the am and pm. Best part about this product itâ€™s cruelty free. Tula and Ordinary for combination, acne prone skin
