I really don’t have much to say about this serum, I didn’t feel like it did much to my skin at all, even after a whole month of use but I am used to using AHA’S and other stronger exfoliant and serums so that might be why, again I really think this is a good skincare beginner product and line up. Very light, easy to apply.... but probably won’t cause your skin to react arshly at all. Always test the product on the back of your wrist for an hour before using on your face if you have sensitive skin. Meh
