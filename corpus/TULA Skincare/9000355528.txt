This product is lovely! It is light and doesn’t feel heavy after applying. It dried nicely and didn’t feel greasy. I have natural puffiness around my eyes that is impossible to get rid of. This product helped to make the puffiness around my eyes decrease slightly and helped the area appear more youthful. The applicator is nice and helps to apply comfortably and smoothly. I’ve used this brand before in a face wash and loved it. They are consistent with their quality and I’d absolutely recommend this product, and this brand in general! nan
