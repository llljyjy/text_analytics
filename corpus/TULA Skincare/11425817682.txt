I have really dry, breakout prone skin. Iâ€™m also dealing with some hormonal break outs right now as well. With all that going on - I have used this cleanser for about a week now and I really like it. It does not strip my skin or add any breakouts. The scent does remind me of a hand soap my mom had when I was a kid but I can look past that. Lol I have been enjoying this cleanser and would consider repurchasing. nan
