Received the product complimentary for my honest review. Awesome packaging and good size for travelling. The product itself smells really nice and a good consistency. It is very moisturizing, but may be too much for some people depending on skin type. Can make the T-zone a bit greasy if you have very oily skin. May be best for dry to normal skin types. The price is a bit expensive for a cleanser in my opinion but will continue to use it more to see if it is something I will purchase in the future. So polished
