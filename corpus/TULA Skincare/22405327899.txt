Not bad overall, I don’t find it particularly hydrating, cooling, or smoothing so it’s not a staple for me, but it’s nice to add a pop of shine. It does have small pearlescent flecks and when I apply too much they tend to spread and get random spots of glitter on the face. I’ve found it can over-apply when you use the stick directly on the skin so I pop some on my finger and then apply where I want it. It is also VERY cool-toned, it can read almost blue or ashen if you use too much. good for spot-brightening
