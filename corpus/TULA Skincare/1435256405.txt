I received this free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I loved how lush it felt in the container. It has great coverage but still feels light when itâ€™s applied. I have a slight allergy to apples and my skin does turn a bit red when I apply it so I only use it at night, but my skin still wakes up very hydrated and there are no other negative effects. I wish there was one without apple! nan
