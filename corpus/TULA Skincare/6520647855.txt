I wanted to love this but I just dont find this does anything for the appearance of dark circles. The balm glides on very smooth and it is cooling, which helps with puffiness. But I have to rub in the formula or I have blue sparkles under my eyes. Just not a fan. Leaves a trial of blue glitter under eyes
