first impression of the product was how thick and creamy the cream is, lovely light smell, and how it disappears into my skin.  changes in my skin I noticed immediately was how moisturizing and smooth. After continuous use my skin felt more comfortable and even in the dry winter air my skin was soft and less irritated then usual. My skin I can be sensitive and irritated easily, I did not have any issues with using this cream. Easy upgrade to my routine
