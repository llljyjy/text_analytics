I have never heard of this brand so I was curious to try it and see how it works. It smells great and feels great on my skin when I apply it. I did notice that my skin was more dewey and not so try whenever I applied the moisturizer. I have combination skin but this didn’t make it oily or greasy which I love. One down fall of the product is the packaging that it comes in. You have to press the pump slowly otherwise it will go all over the place and it’s too small. I would highly recommend the pump be made a different shape or just have a cap so you can take what you need.I loved the slight citrus smell as it was refreshing but not too much. I have noticed my skin brightening up a little bit after using it for a while. I will continue to use it for sure as I do love how it feels on my skin. Great moisturizer
