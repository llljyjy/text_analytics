This scrub is great for anyone who has sensitive skin. Normally I find that other scrubs are too harsh for my skin, but because of the natural ingredients in this, I don’t feel it’s harsh at all. I do find the sugars do dissolve quickly so you gotta use more product or less water on the face but otherwise great product! Love it!
