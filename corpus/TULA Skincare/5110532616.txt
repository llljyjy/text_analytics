I have been using this product every evening, and I already notice a difference after a week of daily use. My skin is usually quite red and oily and in my opinion I think that has reduced to some extent. This product has a typical serum texture and I really am pleased with the packaging and glass dropper for application. I have sensitive skin and the products faint cucumber scent does not bother me. This product nicely sinks into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated without any residue. I am quite impressed with the ingredient list, because there are no essential oils which I tend to avoid. I will continue to use this in my skincare routine and definitely recommend! Great Product!
