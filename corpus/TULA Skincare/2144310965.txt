I have been testing this product for around two weeks now and I have to say I’m really liking it. The balm stick makes it so easy and I love that I’m not sticking my fingers in an eye creme tub. This balm is very hydrating so start with one swipe and build up as needed it can feel a bit greasy if you use to much but the hydration really lasts all day. I like the glow it gives my eye area Seriously glowy!
