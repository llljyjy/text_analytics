Not worth it. Overpriced, didn’t have much of an impact on my skin. It’s a greasy moisturizer that hangs around; and even as someone with dry skin this made me look sweaty from the get-go. I’m assuming that is all the oils in this (all seven of them). Maybe good as a night moisturizer, but I can see running the risk of congestion acne because it is so oily. Avoid it. Way better products for $70. TLDR: very oily, not worth the $. nan
