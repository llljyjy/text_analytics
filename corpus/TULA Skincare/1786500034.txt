I received this product for free from Influenster and Tula in return for my honest review. This balm is so refreshing to put on directly under my eyes. It does not irritate my eyes at all and I do find I wake up with less puffy eyes and dark circles when I use it at night. The only con is that if I use it in the morning without any makeup (concealer or foundation) on overtop, I find it makes my waterproof mascara come off throughout the day. Great for dealing with dark under eye circles!
