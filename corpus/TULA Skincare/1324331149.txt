I am a tough critic when it comes to eye creams/products and I have some holy grails that are pretty hard to beat. I was excited to try Tula’s Glow + Get Eye Balm which is said to cool and brighten the under eye area as well as “fill” the look of fine lines/wrinkles around the eye. I was a little weary about it being in stick form but I was pleasantly surprised that it did not tug at the skin and glided on easily. When applying, less is more as it does have a light blue tint and it also tingles/cools which could be uncomfortable if too much is applied. I did see an immediate brightening impact and while this does act as a great pick me up for the under eye area, I did not find the cooling or brightening to be long lasting. I did find myself reapplying it throughout the day as I enjoyed the immediate glow. With regards to my fine lines/wrinkles, I can’t say that I saw any improvement but this may improve over time. Overall, I consider this a great add on to my existing eye skincare regime but it certainly does not replace any eye serums/eye creams for me. A Nice Pick Me Up!
