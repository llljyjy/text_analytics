I have used this very very consistently for 3 maybe 4 months and have seen no difference. Even with weather change my skin got so dry and it barely helped moisturize my under eyes at all. I had to lather on another eye cream on top of this. The only thing is it makes you look a little more “awake“ due to the highlighting tone of it but sometimes I feel like make up could do the same thing. I also really enjoy the application stick and makes it really easy. But does it work? No. Pass
