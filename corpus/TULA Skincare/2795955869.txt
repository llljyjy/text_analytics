I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is beautiful and functional. The pump is intuitive and simple. The scent is noticeable and citrusy without being too overpowering (and I’m pregnant with a sensitive nose right now so I was anticipating not liking it and found myself pleasantly surprised). I love that this brand has so many pregnancy safe formulas (this one included). The lotion absorbs well into my normal/dry skin without leaving me greasy. I haven’t noticed much brightening power but it looks fine. I have super sensitive skin that hasn’t broken out in 2 weeks of consistent use! Makeup wears well over it too. nan
