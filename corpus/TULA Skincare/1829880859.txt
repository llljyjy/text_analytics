This moisturizer smells delightfully like those creamsicle popsicles I loved as a kid! For my dehydrated skin, this lightweight mosturizer seems to provide enough hydration for the daytime during the warmer spring weather. My picky skin seemed to like this - no breakouts or irritation or even dry patches. It absorbs quickly into the skin and wears well under sunscreen and makeup. The only thing I think that could be improved is how the moisturizer is dispensed - it took a little bit to figure out how hard to press the pump and where to put my hand so the moisturizer doesnâ€™t shoot too far and land on the table. Otherwise overall, after using this for a couple weeks my skin looks brighter thanks to the vitamin C, ferulic acid, and tranexamic acid. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great lightweight moisturizer! nan
