I am a big skincare fan, especially when it comes to serums. These drops donâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin and actually make my skin feel quite refreshed. It has helped reduce the redness in my skin and it has a lovely fragrance to it and a good consistency. I absolutely love that the product is cruelty free! The only negative thing I have against the product is the design of the bottle, I find it hard to dispense and wish the eye dropper was easier to use. Overall would recommend! nan
