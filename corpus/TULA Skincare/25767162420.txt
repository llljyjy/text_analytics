I was so happy to try 24-7 Power Swipe Hydrating Day & Night Treatment Eye Balm by Tula.  I really like how it was a twist up, stick form. It made it easy to apply to my under eyes went on really smooth.  Took a couple seconds to dry which is why I prefer to use it at night.  It really brights up the under eye and when I wake up my eyes look rested and Rejuvenated!!  I would purchase again! I love how itâ€™s a stick formate!!!! I love the Stick form
