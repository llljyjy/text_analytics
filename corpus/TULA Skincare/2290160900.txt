This product has a unique packaging design where you pump and the product comes out of the middle. I like this feature because it helps control from using too much. I like the ingredients this is formulated with and without. Overall, this is very hydrating and works well, though given the name youâ€™d expect it to be a bit thicker. Downside of this product is the overwhelming scent. I find it unnecessary to be so heavily scented and the smell is almost rotten or fermented. nan
