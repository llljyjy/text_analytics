I have very sensitive acne prone skin. I started using this cleanser and my skin was the best and clearer that it had ever been. I honestly did not think it was the cleanser because I never believed a cleanser could do that much to your skin. A bottle lasts you forever and when I finally ran out I decided to switch things up a bit. Boy what a mistake, I started to break out again. This is a great cleanser and as far as all the reviews talking about the scent… I don’t get it. It barely smells like anything, let alone perfume and whatever very very mild scent it has it dissipates immediately, does not linger at all! You don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone
