i’ve been trying these out for a few weeks now! they are so worth the price & are unlike any other toner i’ve tried. they feel so nice and soothing on the skin. it leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh! i’ve noticed a big difference in my skin since using it! it leaves me with a super smooth base to apply my moisturizers and skin care! also loooove that it’s all environmentally friendly & gentle on my sensitive skin! love this product!!!
