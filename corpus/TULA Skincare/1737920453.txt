This moisturizer is super silky and creamy, easy to apply. However it is not hydrating in my opinion. It did soak into the skin and is non greasy but I didn’t feel that it deeply nourished. I have sensitive skin and this did break me out quite a bit. It’s ok but I wouldn’t use again. This product was given to me via Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Silky smooth but just ok
