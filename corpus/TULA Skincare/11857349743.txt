This is a great moisturizer! I really liked that isn’t not super thick and doesn’t leave my face feeling oily or greasy. It has a light scent of grapes to me which I enjoyed. I use this in both my morning and night routine and I haven’t experienced any breakouts and it works well under makeup. Very nice moisturizer
