I am so happy to have tried the Tula Skincare protect + plump moisturizer. I have been using the same moisturizer for over a decade and only recently realized there are multiple ingredients that I do not want to use on my skin. Now that I have found Tulsaâ€™s moisturizer I am going to replace my old one. I love how plump and bright my skin is without the use of parabens, sulphates or silicones. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective moisturizer with clean ingredients. Super Plump Skin!
