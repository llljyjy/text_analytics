Fornula is quite rich.  It aborbs and spreads quite well without a greasy, heavy feeling.  It manages to keep me moisturized all day without reapplication or needing a super thick layer of application.  It’s got a light almost fruity, scent but not like a perfume - truly almost non-detectable once absorbed.  This was received as a complimentary product from Influenster *incentivized.  I’m not sure it warrants the higher price tag, however. Decent Moisturizer
