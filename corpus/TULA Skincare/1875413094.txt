I’m alway wary about products claiming to de-puff and brighten my under eyes as none of them have ever seemed to make any difference. This, however, has made a noticeable difference without my even using it daily, let alone morning and night. I’m giving this all the credit for why I no longer look like I’m as sleep deprived as I am being a mom of 3 with infant twins! nan
