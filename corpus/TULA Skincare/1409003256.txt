Bought in-store (had never heard of the brand) and Iâ€™m hooked! My texture (seems to always be an issue as I age) and tone (am prone to redness) improved big time. Highly recommend to anyone with combination, acne prone and aging skin. Almost at the end of the bottle and will def buy again. A Must For Ruddy, Sensitive Skin
