I have Tula Protect & Glow and I love that.  But I also wanted a mineral SPF and was hoping for a similar finish.  This is really good!  I put it on over Drunk Elephant C serum and a little bit of Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream.  This leaves a glowy finish with no white cast at all on me.  I have medium neutral skin. My new favorite mineral SPF!
