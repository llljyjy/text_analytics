I got this as a sample from Influenster. I have been trying this product for a weeks and applying it is very easy. I do it once in the morning and once at night. It makes my face feel much healthier around the eyes. What I am not a big fan of is the scent that comes from it. It’s not strong but it feels strong. I’m hoping with more time, I’ll continue to see improving results. Still waiting
