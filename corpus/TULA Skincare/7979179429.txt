The eye balm is definitely cooling and leaves a slight sparkle on your skin! It works great on dark circles but not as well as other products Iâ€™ve used for puffiness. Nice morning eye treatment as the slight sparkle does brighten your under eye area. I recieved this product in a VoxBox campaign. Good morning eye treatment
