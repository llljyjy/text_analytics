I received this product free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. First, I love sleek the container. It is easy to pump and store. The cream isn’t greasy and it absorbs into your skin very quickly. I love that it is made with cleaner ingredients. I found my skin felt refreshed in the morning while trying this night product. However, I wasn’t a fan of the smell. It was a bit strong for my liking but I was please it didn’t smell once applied to the skin. Overall a good product but if you are sensitive to smell, for the price point, I would choose something else. Solid product but heavy scent
