This set is a bit of a hit/miss for me, hence the score. The Instant De-Puff Eye Renewal Serum is a 5/5. No other eye cream has made my under-eyes so soft and smooth. I would definitely purchase this myself. The Protect + Plump Firming & Hydrating Face Moisturizer was a 4/5. It was a nice, light moisturizer that worked great under makeup. It was just moisturizing enough without making my combo/oil skin too oily through the day. The Wrinkle Treatment Drops Retinol Alternative Serum is pretty good. Didn’t really see much difference in my skin, but may need a longer time and larger size to see changes. At least it didn’t make my sensitive skin break out. Probably 3/5. The Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment was the dud for me. I’d rate it 1/5. It was way too heavy for my skin and it made me break out. This kit is a great way to try out some Tula products, but it may be best for dry/normal skin that isn’t too sensitive. Hit or Miss
