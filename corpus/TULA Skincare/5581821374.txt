My skin, very much like my gut, loves probiotics! I have had a really good experience with other probiotic serum products before and new I’d like this as soon as I saw the texture. It’s a bit too early to say too much but after a week of use, my skin is already brighter and less congested. It also serves as a great base to let the rest of my skincare routine absorb better.I have a reel with a demo of this on my Instagram @theperfumemenagerie!I received this as a free product on Influenster in exchange for an honest review. nan
