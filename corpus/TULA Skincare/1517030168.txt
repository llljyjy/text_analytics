I’ve really enjoyed this Tula set. I have combination skin, and this set doesn’t tend to leave me too oily or dry after using it. I really like the sugar scrub. It smells amazing, and I like how it exfoliates my skin. I also like that this is probiotic skincare. My skin tends to do well on it. I will continue using Tula products and recommend them to others. nan
