I don’t know if it’s the glitter or the formula, but every time I put this on, it leaves like a strange salty texture on my face, I don’t know how else to describe it, like a very thin white dust. I’ve tried it alone, with moisturizer under, with a different moisturizer under, same results - salty face. Needless to say, it makes wearing this product under makeup almost impossible. If I apply the correct amount (2 fingers worth) it stings my face, especially near the eyes. What a waste of money from such a nice company. Can't wear under makeup! Leaves nasty texture
