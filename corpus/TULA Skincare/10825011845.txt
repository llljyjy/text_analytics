I received this from Tula and Influenster complementary to try out, but Iâ€™m honestly obsessed with the entire Tula skincare line. Every product is so well thought out with quality ingredients that just make my skin radiate and stay hydrated. This moisturizer is no different, and with vitamin c added, my skin is more glowy and brightened throughout the day. Highly recommend! Sold!
