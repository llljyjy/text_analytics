I got this product to try from I Influenster around a month ago and I wanted to have at least a month of “experience” to be able to right an honest review. At first it made my face feel super sticky but since you’re supposed to use other products on top as part of your skincare routine (like moisturizer), that didn’t bother me. I did notice a difference in the tightness of my skin and it feels more smooth - like baby face. I like the smell too. I’m pretty sure I’m gonna keep buying them as I think these pads are pretty easy to use and I don’t waste product like with liquid ones. Great idea - toner pads!
