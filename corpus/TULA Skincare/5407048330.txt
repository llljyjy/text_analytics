I must say I am quite pleased with this product. I’d been looking for a good sunscreen for awhile & I wasn’t sure how I’d feel with the ‘glow’ aspect of this sunscreen but it blends out beautifully on the skin & wears well under makeup! I have sensitive combination skin and I didn’t have any issues with the sunscreen breaking me out thankfully & it does have a lovely moisturizing effect. You may be a little confused when using this product for the first time because it is a bit of an odd texture at first but don’t worry, everything blends out seamlessly on the skin. I’d say if you’re looking for a good sunscreen for using under any sort of makeup go for this. If you’re using this product alone go for the less is more; the shimmer for me wasn’t overwhelming as it does blend out nicely, give it try! :) Beautiful Sunscreen
