I received this product free from Tula and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I LOVE this! I’ve tried a number Vit C serums over the years and this is by far my favorite. It’s plumping, hydrating, and dries down to a lovely, natural finish. I’ve noticed a real difference in the brightness of my skin over the last three weeks. I almost wish I didn’t like it so much because it’s really pricey, but definitely worth it! I’ll absolutely be repurchasing! It’s a YES!
