I received this product as a free sample from Influenster though it doesn’t effect the experience I’ve had with this product. I’ve introduced it to my morning routine and its become a staple these last few weeks. I use it as my last step before moisturizer and sunscreen because it is quite thicker of serum. It gives my skin an instant glow I do love it for days I’m not wearing any makeup. nan
