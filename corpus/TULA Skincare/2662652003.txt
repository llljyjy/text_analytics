Packaging on this product is so appealing it really calls to your attention. I have tan skin and there’s was no white cast or flashback. This doesn’t have a strong scent it still has a sun screen smell to it but very very light and the smell doesn’t seem to linger. Applies as a radiant finish and I loved that this sunscreen did not make me oily throughout the day as many others do tend to. I will definitely love this in the summer on no makeup days as it leaves a beautiful glowing finish but it also still wears perfectly under make up and doesn’t take long set. Tula did amazing with this sunscreen and I would absolutely recommend this. Glowing protected skin
