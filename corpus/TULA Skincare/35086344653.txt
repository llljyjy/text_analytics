I have heard alot about Vitamin C serums and I didn’t really believe in it however I did try one and I couldn’t bother with it. Since receiving this complimentary product from Influenster and TULA, I will always apply this serum as part of my routine. You hardly have to use much of it in each application, the applicator is perfect and simple and the package is so cute. It spreads so evenly on my skin, I never have too much or not enough and I can truly see a different in the appearance of my skin. This is another great product you need to have. Tula does it again
