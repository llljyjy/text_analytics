This product was designed specifically for sensitive skin and irritations. My skin is not generally sensitive, but in the recent year I have been experiencing a lot of irritation and dryness. I was excited to try this product and now after a few weeks of using it I can say that is not too bad at all. It soothes the skin, the texture is interesting, applies well. However, the smell was a bit too strong. It smells like fresh cucumbers and I think for people with skin more sensitive than mine this might be a problem. I have it to some of my friends to test out as well and this product didn’t suit them at all, causing red skin. But for me personally it was working well, so it really heavily depends on the skin type. I probably won’t using as generously as I did before, but I will definitely use it when I experience irritation again. nan
