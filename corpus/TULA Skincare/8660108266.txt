This eye serum comes in a portable, slim tube and dispenses with the push of a button. The serum comes out of a smooth metal tip which can be used to massage the eye area while applying the serum. The eye massager tip has a soothing and cooling sensation which can be enhanced by storing the serum in the fridge. The product is unscented and has a very light cream texture that is readily absorbed by the skin without feeling greasy or heavy. It reduces the appearance of wrinkles and leaves the skin more smooth, dewy and moisturized. There’s no immediate decrease in puffiness on the eyelid skin. The serum has skin nourishing ingredients such as probiotic and prebiotic extracts to smoothen and balance the skin, peptides to firm the skin, sea algae to reduce wrinkles, pink silk tree extract to brighten the eye area, reduce dark eye circles and reduce puffiness. There’s also other nourishing ingredients including orange, oat, camellia leaf, blueberry, yogurt and rice extracts. The formula is also free of harmful substances such as parabens, sulfates, phthalates, formaldehyde and fragrances.I really wanted to like this eye serum, but unfortunately it causes a burning and stinging sensation on my eyelids. My skin seems to be allergic to some of the ingredients, which was surprising because the ingredient list looks very clean. I would highly recommend testing this eye serum in store first before buying to ensure that it is compatible with your skin type. Burns and Stings Eyelids
