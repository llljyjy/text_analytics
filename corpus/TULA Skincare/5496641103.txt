I think my favourite thing about this product by far is the scent! It’s the perfect moisturizer year-round and especially for spring and summer. It smells like an orange creamsicle! YUM!! The scent isn’t overly strong, but I wouldn’t recommend for anyone who doesn’t like scented moisturizers. The consistency is great and one pump is the perfect amount for face and neck. I used it every morning and night and it really helps with the dry patches on my nose and forehead. It has made my skin brighter and more refreshed looking. I would definitely purchase again and recommend this moisturizer. Perfect for summer!
