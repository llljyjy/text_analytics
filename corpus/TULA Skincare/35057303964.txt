The cream itself is light and effective. Definitely nice to have SPF and moisture in the winter months! I only gave it 4 stars because the scent isn’t something I’d prefer to have on my face. It’s mild, so not enough to stop me from using it, but would rather have unscented or something a bit cleaner/fresher scented. Great effective product despite scent
