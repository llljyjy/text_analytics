I was really excited to try this product given that it’s a clean moisturizer free of harsh chemicals and ingredients. My skin is pretty sensitive so the cleaner the better and from a texture and formula standpoint, this did not disappoint.  It also did a great job moisturizing overnight. However, the thing that might keep me from continued use is the smell!  I love the sort of floral smell it has but when applied, it’s almost a “greek yogurt-y” kind of smell that comes through that I don’t really enjoy. One thing I love about the packaging, tough, is there is a push top that dispenses the product so you’re not over using. Great formula, not so great smell!
