I have been trying the Glow + Get It Cooling & Brightening Eye Balm for a few weeks in combination with the probiotic cleanser. The eye balm is very easy to apply in its stick form, and I can confirm that it produces a cooling sensation within seconds which is very refreshing. For my skin tone, the glow it provides is a bit too silver blue even with blending it into my skin. However, I did find that it makes a slight difference in firming, tightening, and reducing the appearance of wrinkles on the skin under my eyes especially thanks to the caffeine, apple, watermelon and probiotic extracts. I feel good about using products from Tula because they are cruelty-free, and make them without fragrance as well as other undesirable ingredients.I look forward to buying the rose version one day and seeing whether it works better with my skin tone while still providing the benefits of this version. I would recommend the eye balm for all skin types. nan
