Only thing this has going for it is the easy applicator and hydrating. I haven’t noticed any difference in puffiness or fine lines after using it morning and night for over a month. Can’t wait to finish it up so I can move onto something else… Save your money and purchase a product that actually works if you have any real under eye concerns. doesn’t live up to the hype
