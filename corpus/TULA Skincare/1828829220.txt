I’ve been using this product for about two weeks and I really like it! The serum is lightweight and absorbs into the skin nicely. The bottle itself is quite sturdy and feels nice to hold. It’s easy to use the product with the dropper and I have had no issues with applying it. I use this maybe 2-3 times a week as I’m not sure if my skin can handle it every day but so far I’m really liking it. I do feel like I’ll need to use it for longer to see obvious results. I received this product free from Influenster and Tula Skincare in exchange for my honest review. nan
