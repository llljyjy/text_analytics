This is a nice, thick cream which is perfect for the winter. My combination skin is drier this time of year so I appreciate a thicker moisturizer. It is a little too thick for me, personally. I think the water-based ones are a little more hydrating but this is a solid one to add into your rotation especially if you like thicker creams. The consistency is similar to Pondâ€™s classic cold creams, without the strong scent. nan
