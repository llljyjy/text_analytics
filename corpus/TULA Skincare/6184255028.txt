As someone with fairly sensitive skin, I was a bit hesitant to use this product upon recieiving it - but my skin loves it! The dispenser is great, and it truly does plump up my skin and gives it a healthy glow. Price is steep, but it does do as it claims. I find it wears well under makeup too. A pleasant surprise!
