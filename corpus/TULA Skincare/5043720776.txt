I do not understand the good reviews. Maybe I’m using it wrong? I’ve tried to like it, I really have. I WANT to like it. And yes, it does have a nice cooling effect. But whyyyyy the shimmer? It looks so weird! The instructions say you can “use throughout the day over make up” uhhh no not unless you want to look like you have glittery eye patches on. Tula make this without the shimmer and it would be a winner for me! The shimmer ruins it
