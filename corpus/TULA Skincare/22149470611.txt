I really like the texture! It melts and soaks into my skin super fast. Doesn’t leave it oily at all. Makes me wonder how dry my skin is. LolBonus, it’s cruelty free and is free of all the bad things! Will definitely continue using this and would recommend others to try. I’m pretty sure you can take a little bit as a sample from Sephora before you invest on the full size. Very hydrating
