I have received The tula 24-7 power swipeâ„¢hydrating day & night treatment eye balm to try. I have dark circles and puffy eyes so i keep it in the fridge and use it before bed and when i wake up in the morning. I have noticed a difference in the way my concealer apply and last under my eyes. And it has been helping with the puffiness. I highly recommend it. Great product
