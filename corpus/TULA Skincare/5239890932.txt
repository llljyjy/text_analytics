I’ve heard great things about this product but I really don’t understand the hype. I’ve been using it for a little bit and I haven’t noticed any changes in my under eye area. When applied, the product becomes sticky on my skin and becomes difficult to rub in. If I don’t rub it in, my under eye looks discoloured. I would much prefer a hydrating eye cream. ** received from Influenster for review. Not My Favourite Product
