Got this as a exchange for my honest opinion and I was skeptical at first cause most eye creams make my eyes water or burn and this is the first one that hasn’t done either.its very moisturizing and the smell is amazing and doesn’t smell like chemicals like others do. Yes price is kinda high but to me it’s worth it cause it has helped my under eyes alot Must have
