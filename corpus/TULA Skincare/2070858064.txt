I received this moisturizer from Influenster in return for an honest review. I have been using this product for about a month as a day time moisturizer under my sunscreen.  My skin is combo/oily and it seems to really like this cream. I haven’t been using it long enough to notice anti aging but my skin seems bright and glowy when I use this during the day. I really like the packaging it is hygienic and easy to use. The only thing about this cream is it had a strange smell not necessarily bad, just strange and it does not linger so it isn’t not a big deal. nan
