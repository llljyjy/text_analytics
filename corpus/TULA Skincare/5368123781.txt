I really love this product. I have sensitive skin and I had zero reactions to this product which was the first win of this product. Then, we get to the product performance and boy does it perform. It is so lightweight and glowy for a sunscreen. It doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. I wore this the other day by itself and it looked beautiful. I am so glad I was able to sample this product through Influenster. Yessssss
