I tried to give it some time to work before writing a review. After a week, I could feel my skin feeling more hydrated and nourished. The serum has a weird smell out of the bottle and a bit of an oily texture so took some getting used to but after a while I didn’t notice it anymore. It layered well with my usual moisturizer under my makeup. Not sure if I’ll rebuy it but it’s a good skincare option if you can afford it. Good addition to skincare routine
