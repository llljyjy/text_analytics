I like this sunscreen but it’s not my favorite! I wear sunscreen everyday and most days I don’t wear makeup so I like sunscreen with a tint. This one doesn’t have much coverage. I’d say my least favorite part of this sunscreen is the smell. It’s kind of a chemically smell and it’s not very pleasant. The smell lasts even after applying it. Over I’d say this sunscreen is just alright! It’s okay!
