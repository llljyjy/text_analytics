This eye balm is the only eye care product that has gotten rid of the dry skin on my eyelids due to allergies.   Easy to apply, I use it day and night. I love how it’s in a stick form. I tend to squeeze out too much product when it’s in a tube and I hate sticking my fingers into a jar because of my long nails. Super moisturizing balm
