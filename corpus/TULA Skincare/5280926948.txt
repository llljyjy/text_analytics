I was so hoping this kit would be stellar but unfortunately, it didn’t hit the mark. I actually took it in a two week vacation and used it AM and PM. First off, it isn’t strong smelling but the face wash did have a off putting scent to it. Next, I really saw no difference in my skin except that I broke out quite badly about halfway through. I did like the moisturizer because it seemed very hydrating, but other than that, I wasn’t impressed for the price. Not worth it
