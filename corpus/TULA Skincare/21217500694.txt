I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have tried lots of scrubs in the past, most of which really irritate my sensitive skin (rosacea). This sucks because while I have sensitive skin with redness, I also have blackheads! I’m happy to report that I am loving this TULA scrub after 2 weeks of use! It smells amazing (like berries) and isn’t too overbearing. It also feels like it really cleanses my skin without irritating it! I also have noticed a small difference with my pores after the first couple weeks! Overall I’m loving it and will continue to use it every 2-3 days. Effective & Smells Delish!
