I received this product for FREE from @influenster and @tula in exchange for my honest review. I was so excited when this arrived since I have some trouble with many retinol products. I have slightly sensitive skin and although I know the benefits of using retinol, especially as I am getting into my 30’s, I typically struggle with the breakouts and redness that can be associated with using such products. This is an amazing alternative using natural ingredients like bakuchiol and olive-derived squalane to provide you with plump, hydrated and renewed skin. I used this am and pm in my routine for well over a month (while using this I stopped using other acids and any retinol products) and saw some really great results! The label suggests using 4-5 drops and I found the dropper a bit difficult to get used to at first, it takes a light touch but after a few days I had it figured out! I liked that it wasn’t strongly scented and had a very lightweight feel that absorbs well. This serum has Goji berry to help with firmness and probiotic extracts to help calm irritated skin and maintain balance for you skin barrier which worked wonders on my combination skin! I really love that this product is gentle, it is the perfect retinol alternative that also provides a bunch of other benefits. Another amazing part? This is cruelty free and listed as a ’Clean at Sephora’ product. Gentle yet effective retinol alternative
