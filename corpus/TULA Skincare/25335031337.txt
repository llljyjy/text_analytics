I received this product free to rate and review. This is the richest eye cream I have ever used. It is super thick at first and trust me a little goes a long way. It easily absorbs and leaves skin dewy and tight. My eye area felt hydrated and looked smoother after 4 weeks Iâ€™ve been using. Def a staple! Rich and Creamy
