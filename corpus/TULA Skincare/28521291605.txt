This is the first time I used any Tula product. I used this eye cream day and night for almost more than a week now. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes. This balm definitely hydrates the skin but I don’t find it much helpful for my dark circles. Apart from this it’s easy to apply and doesn’t leave any residue. nan
