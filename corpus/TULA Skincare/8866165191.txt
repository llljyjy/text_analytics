This face cleanser is super nice, and a great size for the price. I love how is doesnâ€™t make my face feel stripped but a the same time clean. I find the you need to add a little water ( like a couple drops) or it hard to rub into your skin. After using this for a couple of weeks I have noticed my skin looking a lot better as I have been having random breakout. super nice , and great size for the price
