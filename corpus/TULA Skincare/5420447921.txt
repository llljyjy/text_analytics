Thank you Influenster and Tula for allowing me to test this cream out in exchange for my honest opinion.  I have combo skin more on the dry side and sensitive.  As soon as you open the package you will notice a slight scent. The product is thick in texture but not greasy. I found it best to warm it up inbetween my hands and then applying it to my face. After having it on for a couple of hours, I did notice my face felt dry even though the product is suppose to be hydrating which was disappointing. Didnâ€™t work for my dry combo skin
