When it comes to sun care I love me a good sunscreen as I don’t compromise and I wear it every single day. This TULA Mineral Magic sunscreen was a great addition to my morning routine. Mineral sunscreens can be a hit or miss for my sensitive combination skin. I had some that worked really well and others that irritated my skin or made it break out and had to stop using them.The size of this product and its packaging make it perfect for travel and reapplying on-the-go. There is a pleasant smell to this cream and the formula it’s lightweight and non-greasy. I love the fact that it does go well with my already established morning routine and also performs well under makeup. The formula has a slight tint, but once applied on it just melts into my skin. I have very fair skin and for me it works really well. I have been using this sunscreen for over a month now and depending on what creams I use for my morning routine, especially Vitamin C, I noticed a slight piling in my neck area. Other than that the TULA Mineral Magic seems to be working great for my sensitive combo skin. It works well on my skin
