It’s hard to tell how well this works on my skin because the smell is so overpowering. It smells like regular Dove soap. I don’t even mind that smell but right in my face it’s such a major turn off. And it doesn’t go away right away. It takes a long time. I used my points to get the trial size and I’m about to throw it out. That’s how much I hate the smell. If you are not sensitive to smell this might be fine for you. My face feels clean. But I would never buy this. nan
