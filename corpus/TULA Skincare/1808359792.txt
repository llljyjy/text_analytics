Doesn’t live up to its label. It is noticeably scented. Which got us started off on the wrong foot. Then moisturizing capabilities quickly left and my skin didn’t feel hydrated or happy even just an hour later. Furthermore, it often stung upon application. This was far from a win. Back to old faithfuls I go. Missed the Mark.
