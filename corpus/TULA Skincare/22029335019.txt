My favorite moisturizer so far! My skin is normal but it has little patches that get quite dry in the winter and this seemed to help reduce the number for me. I also have some acne issues and it did seem to make me break out on my chin but it was fine for the rest of my face so I think its just a “know your skin“ scenario and I would still recommend it to other people with acne. It’s lightweight and has little smell to it. Pretty much everything a perfect lowkey moisturizer needs to be. nan
