Let me start off my saying that I love this company - TULA checks off all the boxes for what I’m looking for in a clean beauty brand; their products are free from all the things I want them to be free off, they’re cruelty free, AND advertise as clinically effective.  The product I’m reviewing is a moisturizing eye “balm” and I love how convenient it is to apply - it comes in a twist up tub (kind of like a bigger lip balm) and then you just swipe it right under your eyes. I must admit, it does “tug” a little at the skin as you swipe, so I’m not sure how good that is for that delicate skin under your eyes, but maybe I’m doing it wrong and you’re supposed dab it on instead? Either way, once applied, it feels super nice and hydrating and only a little bit of product goes a long way. I have been using this for several weeks, and you can barely tell it’s been used at all, so I expect the stick to last quite some time. I tried to give this product a solid 3 weeks to fully see if it’s effective on me, and I must admit that the results I see are minimal. I took a picture before I started and then after 3 weeks, and I don’t see much of a difference at all. That being said, I did possibly forget days here and there and didn’t always apply it 2x day, so maybe if I get more consistent, I will also get more consistent results. I will continue using this until it’s used up, and if I continue not seeing any results, I may look into other options from TULA - but it is a nice and hydrating balm, so even just the feeling it leaves and longevity may be worth it for me. Great clean beauty choice!
