I just received this product yesterday so I wanted to give my first impressions. I also want to note I was sent this product for free but this is 100% my own opinion. I have absolutely terrible dark circles, I have always had horrible dark circle just from genetics and allergies. I will say this does help a little bit. It’s not life changing under any circumstances so please don’t expect it to make them disappear BUT I did notice a difference and I have used it twice and because it’s shimmery (no glitter) it definitely reflects light to brighten the under eye area. The cooling is almost not there but in a good way. I was nervous that it would be some severe cooling effect and I was so thankful it wasn’t! If you’re looking for some hydration and a bit of a pick me up for your under eyes I’d recommend it for sure. It definitely made putting concealer on easier and I only had to use one application instead of my usual touch up after the first one. It claims you can put this on top of your make up but I’d be nervous to just because I use powder on top of my liquid products. Simple and effective
