This product is great if you are looking for a moisturizing under eye cream. I usually just used Lancôme’s genifique under eye serum, which I thought worked really well until I tried this one. This one feels amazing under my eyes and the dispenser makes it an easy application during my night time skin care routine and helps avoid touching the product directly with my fingers every time I use it , which is a plus. When I wake up, my under eye area feels soft and looks brighter. nan
