This product is great if you have dry skin and need extra moisture. The consistency of the product is thick and feels instantly tacky when you apply it to your face. I apply it before bed, let it soak in a good 5 mins and then go to sleep. When I wake in the morning it feels instantly smoother and more hydrated. Hydration nation
