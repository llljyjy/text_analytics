i shoulda known that most of the reviews could’ve been bought considering they basically all say “incentivized” but i thought to give it a go anyways. Lemme save u the time and money- it doesn’t absolutely nothing for dark circles and fading them. the “cooling effect” works the first few times but now it’s not even there. it’s also quite streaky when u apply it so u gotta rub it a bit w/ ur finger. it doesn’t actually change the colour of ur dark circles,, I’d say it just makes ur under eyes look shiny. i gave it over 2 months before writing this review.. hoping that it somehow decides to show some difference but it did nothing. it’s not drying tho, it’s easy to apply, and there’s quite a bit of product but like i don’t know if that matters considering it doesn’t work. it’s doesn’t actually do anything
