Idk if it’s doing much but it feels nice and moisturized. Plus I like the stick application. Lots of mixed reviews on here. Love it hate it. It seems like people who got it gifted to them for free like it more than those who paid for it. I got the dual set with the pink glow one as well as it’s a good deal and hopefully I’ll see some improvement under my eyes and less bags and darkness nan
