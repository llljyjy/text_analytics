Really wanted to love this product because it contains the two ingredients I need, hyaluronic acid and vitamin c, however, I find it greasy and it definitely makes me break out in small whiteheads all over my face every time I use it, the container is nice and scent is great, I wish it wasnâ€™t as oily or there was a gel version. Overall great if you have dry skin and not prone to breakouts. eh could be better , greasy
