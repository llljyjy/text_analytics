I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have really liked this serum! There was a little bit of a learning curve in figuring out where to fit this into my skin care routine but now that I have, I love it. My face feels fresh and glowy and on days I’ve used this before doing my makeup, it truly feels like my makeup has always set more nicely than days I didn’t!As someone with sensitive skin and acne prone, I haven’t found this serum to bother me or break me out AT ALL, which was a lovely surprise. Also, while I haven’t been using this too long, I’ve definitely seen improvement in the texture of my skin and areas where I deal with extra redness and discolouration. Additionally the packaging is great and seals really well for travel and on-the-go use. Overall: would strongly consider repurchasing this product!I only have two complaints - one is that despite being “fragrance free” there is a noticeable  scent to this product that could be a problem for some people. (I personally like it, as it feels fresh and is not synthetic - but a fair warning for those who are scent-sensitive!) Two being that I wished the dropper gave you a little bit more product than it does.Thank-you to TULA and Influenster for allowing me to try this product! Great Product for Discolouration & Texture
