I’ve been using this product for about a year after getting one in a FabFitFun box, but then I just received another one to test from Influenster. I would say it’s a decent product, definitely gives you a cooling sensation wherever it’s applied, but I’m not a huge fan of the“ brightening“ claims, as it’s more of a shimmer sort of reflective product. And that’s the way that it is able to claim brightening. I just feel like my Becca under eye lightener does a better job. Still a great product, and I use it on days where I want light coverage. Not sure it has any long-term effects, such as helping with fine lines or anything, but will continue to purchase and use for those light makeup days. Simple for light makeup days
