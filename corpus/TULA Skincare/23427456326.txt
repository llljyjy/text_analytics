I tried this spf without my usual skin prep (which is usually pretty hydrating) so it did dry down a little matte, which I did not mind. I think that with a little more hydration prep, this would give you the same glow that the Tatcha Silk spf does. Second, this did not pill AT ALL. I was pleasantly surprised, but again I only applied moisturizer & not my usual skin care. I like the tint that this spf has, it nicely concealed some of my redness. I have yet to try this one underneath makeup but overall, I think it’s a great alternative to the Tatcha Silk one— not to mention it’s $38 and not $60!! I recommend buying this one if the Tatcha one is too pricey! tatcha silk spf dupe????
