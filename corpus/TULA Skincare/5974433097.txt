Ive been using this for about a week and im still undecided about it. Its really easy to apply. However, the stick and cream is kinda rough and hard to apply around the delicate eye area. WhatI usually do is rub it on my hand and get it warm so it glides smoother. Overall, i do like the product as its hydrating but still undecided. Price wise,Its expensive. Not sure
