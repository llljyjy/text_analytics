I love the fact that this is a stick product. It makes it really easy to apply and no getting under the fingernails. It applies very smooth and there’s no tugging of the skin on application. The product is hydrating without leaving a stickiness to the skin. I give it 3 stars because I do not like the “brightening” effect. Maybe it’s just my tan skintone, but it almost leaves a pink highlighter sheen under the eye that is not very flattering. I choose to wear this to bed so it’s not too big of a deal however, I would love this if it came in other options like more of a yellow tone, etc, for different skin types. Great idea, execution could be better
