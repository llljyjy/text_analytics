Received this product from Influenster to try and so far so good! I have normal/combo skin but I find that if you have oily skin this might not be for you - I let my boyfriend try it and he found it too greasy for him. It has a very pleasant smell and goes on very smoothly, absorbing well into my skin. The pump is also nice to have but I find that product can get clogged over time - doesnâ€™t bother me personally as I just make sure I keep it clean. Overall would recommend! nan
