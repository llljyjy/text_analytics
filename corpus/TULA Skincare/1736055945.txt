Thank you to Sephora, Influenster and Tula for the complimentary voxbox of products!! I had never even heard of the Tula previously so I was very excited to learn about a new company thanks to the voxbox and explore the brand a little. It’s very cool that the products are formulated by a doctor who is a gastroenterologist - definitely a new angle into skincare!  The incorporation of Probiotics and superfoods is novel and very effective, at least for me. I also love that these are all clean beauty products. I have been on the hunt for a good vitamin C Serum or product and tried a few - this is far and away the best one I have tried!! That includes the more expensive Tatcha violet serum (I hated that) Its dropper style for application and definitely, finally for the first time I feel likeI have a vitamin C product where I can see a difference! and quite quickly as well, in just a few uses my skin was definitely smoother in texture, nourished, even I could really see an improvement in that aspect and brighter as promised. I followed it with their moisturizer and together it’s a lovely and effective skincare routine for me that leaves my face supple and clear. The packaging is quite pretty as well. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this product it’s my favourite of all three Tula ones in tried (I liked them all don’t get me wrong :) just if someone were to ask me which product they should buy first or could only afford one, I would hands down steer them to this one. Absolutely LOVE this vitamin C serum!!
