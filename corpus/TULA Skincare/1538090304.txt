I had the opportunity to try Tula’s cooling and brightening eye balm. The product comes in a tube similar to a chapstick and it really is like applying a chapstick like product underneath your eyes. After applying the product to my under eyes I found you need to use your fingers to blend in the product a bit as I did notice a bluish tint. Otherwise I did instantly notice the brightening effect. I like to just apply this product on it’s own without any makeup and it makes a huge difference to my under eyes. nan
