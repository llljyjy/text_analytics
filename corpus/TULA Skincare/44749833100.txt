I received this item in exchange for a review.  I feel like I have a love /hate with this product.  It does do what it intends, but the color it leaves is not pleasant. I found I was blending it in with my makeup and did not enjoy the iridescent color. Wearing it on a bare face is what I enjoy and it definitely has a nice cooling for early mornings and late evenings. I found myself reaching for it less in my makeup routine and more during early mornings. Not my favorite product
