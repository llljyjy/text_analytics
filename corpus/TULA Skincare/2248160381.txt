My skin is acne prone, and on the oily side. I found this has helped to keep my pores small, and keep my oiliness at bay. The smell is really refreshing and cooling after cleansing and taking off makeup from a long day!That being said, I find it to be heavy for day use. I find the texture to be sticky on the skin. However in the morning, I’ve noticed my skin looked brighter, pores and blemishes smaller, and skin less red. I love how the ingredients are all good for your skin! It’s like taking a vitamin on the outside. My skin texture has improved slightly with using just this and I cant wait to try more things from Tula! Smells great and is refreshing on the skin!
