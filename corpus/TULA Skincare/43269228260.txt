I received this product free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I got it about a week and a half ago and I love how soft it makes my skin feel, it’s like no other toner I have ever tried before. The consistency of this product reminds me more of a serum than a toner. I definitely recommend this product to you ladies, it has got my skin glowing in a way it hasn’t in years! I hope I get to try more Tula products in the future! A special kind of glow!
