*I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for a review.I was excited to try this product as I need something to help even out my skin. It’s advertised as not leaving a sticky feeling, but that wasn’t my experience. Not the stickies serum I’ve ever used, but still pretty tacky for a few minutes after application. The smell is also kind of weird. I have used the product for a couple of weeks and while my skin felt nice and soft after applying it, I have not seen any noticeable changes in my skin tone. Product was alright for a freebie, but I won’t be purchasing in the future. Not seeing the hype
