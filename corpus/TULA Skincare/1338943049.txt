I got this because I read so many good reviews of it, but I’ll be returning it. The texture is nice and smooth. It glides on the eye area nicely. However, the cooling aspect of it is really not my thing. The cooling sensation stays around the eyes, as if there is some kind of mint in it. I don’t have particularly sensitive eyes, but this didn’t make my eyes happy. Would not recommend. nan
