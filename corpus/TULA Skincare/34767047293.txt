I got this product complementary in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been using this product for around 2 weeks now, I did not see any drastic changes but it suits me well making my face look clear and glowy after use. This has gel like consistency and requires lots of pumps to get required amount from bottle. Does not smell bad and did not cause any adverse reaction to my oily/combination skin. Okish product
