I absolutely love this product! I am pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers as i have combination skin, and was worried this would leave a sticky residue or make my skin oily. Well i am glad to say that was not the case! 1 pump is enough to completely cover your face and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. Plus it has a great citrus smell! Definitely recommend. Feels great on your skin!
