I have combination skin and absolutely love this product. This hydrating cream absorbs into the skin and gives a natural glow. It’s gentle and hydrating without the excessive oil. I also have sensitive skin and didn’t have an issue. Definitely working this product into my skincare routine. Also, is cruelty free products are important to you, as they are to me, this is a wonderful skincare product for that. The packaging is amazing and provides an upfront list of ingredients - very transparent and I love that! If you’re willing to spend the money, then I would recommend it. :) adding to my skincare routine
