I would have thought a balm would be heavy and feel sticky, but I like this a lot better than the day eye cream. It goes great under makeup, isn’t sticky at all, and very hydrating. I tried this at night and then the following morning to see how it did over a good chunk of time, and I’m pleased. It doesn’t really depuff very much, but there is a small difference. I’ve included an unfiltered no makeup comparison. Great consistency, very hydrating
