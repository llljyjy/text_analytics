I looooove LOVE the ease of application of this mask. Because it’s on a roll up stock it mess free & super fast to apply. Saves you time & clean up. I also love the ingredients in this, it feels super smooth on your skin & no hon can’t smell the ACV. The mask has a pleasant scent in my opinion. All mask should come on a stick like this lol Took 1 star off because it’s overpriced. You don’t get much product for $34! PS I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review Mess free, time saving
