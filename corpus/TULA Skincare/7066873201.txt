Just wow.  I’m outside frequently during the winter time so I typically deal with dry, chapped skin.  This moisturizer works wonders while giving my skin a healthy glow.  It’s made out of wonderful ingredients that I don’t have to feel bad about putting on my skin.  The consistency is good and goes on smooth.  I don’t feel like I need a lot of it to get good coverage.  No residue that is typical of cheaper creams.Price is good for what you get when compared to other creams from brands like L’Oréal which I’ve been typically using in the past.  Great that Sephora now is carrying this.  Love the product. Deeply hydrating and moisturizing
