First time trying Tula brand and I must say it wouldn’t be the last. I was so excited to try this detoxing face mask. It was very easy to apply on the face and it glides evenly on my face. Soft and creamy texture and I just used my finger to spread and apply it on creases where the stick can’t reach. I waited 10 mins and wash it off. I was scared at first that it might be hard to remove but surprisingly it wash off rather quickly with warm water.  After the first use I can already tell my skin feels soft and clean. It says use 3-4 a week so I plan to use it every other day. Soft and Creamy face mask
