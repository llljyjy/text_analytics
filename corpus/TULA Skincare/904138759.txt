I’ve used several different vitamin c serums and didn’t expect this one to be different. I’ve been applying this for about two weeks and have seen a huge difference in the clarity of my skin. The serum isn’t sticky at all and sinks in immediately, no pilling or issues when I layer a moisturizer over it. My skin glows the mornings I’ve used this product.  Some vitamin c serums aggravate my skin, the one hasn’t cause any breakouts or redness. I don’t love the packaging (it feels a little young) but I will absolutely repurchase when I’ve used my current bottle. nan
