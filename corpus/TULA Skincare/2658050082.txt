Lightly citrusy product that is lovely to use on your face in the morning! The texture feels thicker than a standard lotion and is non greasy after application. The product has really good ingredients and is clean. I have been using it on my skin for about a week day and night and it has made my skin feel more moisturized and bright. Refreshing moisturizer
