I don’t understand how this product has such amazing reviews. I usually don’t fall under peer pressure with products but I did when all the TikTok girlies raved about it - lesson learned. This product was nice the first time I used it - it had a cooling effect. Until I realized it has mini glitter particles in it? Why?! That’s where the alleged “glow + brightening” effect comes from. Truly nothing spectacular. Didn’t provide hydration under the eyes. Save your coin & splurge on the OH banana eye cream instead. What’s all the hype about?
