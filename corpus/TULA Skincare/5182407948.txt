Iâ€™ve been testing out this product for weeks now. My skin has felt hydrated and smoother. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me at all. There is a very subtle scent to scent to it, and I did not bother me. There was a bit inconsistency with packaging of the product. The box indicate to dispense 2-3 drops, but the bottle itself says 4-5 drops. I recommend going with the box, as I only needed 2 drops for my whole face. nan
