I got sent this a little while back and omg does my skin LOVE it!! I’ve gone through the 1.5oz pot so quickly that I’m gunna have to splurge and get the bigger pot. Which definitely isn’t a bad thing at all! I’ve never finished a moisturizer before, and with moisturizers I never really repurchase. I typically just move on to the next thing lol!!I have very dry and sensitive skin due to my pretty bad rosacea, and this hasn’t irritated it at all! They say to only use gel moisturizers with rosacea, but this cream base has really been helping keep my rosacea happy.Highly recommend!!! Finally a moisturizer worth repurchasing!!
