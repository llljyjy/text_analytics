This is a fantastic day/night cream for men and women! I wasn’t big on hydration for my face until this came into my life. Didn’t think it mattered…. LET ME TELL YOU HOW WRONG I WAS. Since this was introduced to me by Influenster, my face is so soft and radiant. One thing I will say though, READ THE INGREDIENTS. My wife tried this, knowing she’s allergic to oranges, hoping the oil content would be small enough, but it was not. She broke out from it, so make sure you know the ingredients! Fantastic Hydration!
