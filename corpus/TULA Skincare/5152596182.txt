I’ve been trying this product for about a week and instantly fell in love with it! I’ve used this toner both morning and night to see which time I prefer, and the benefits that result. Using it before bed on a clean face gave my skin a really healthy glow in the morning, loved that! This toner has a very cooling and refreshing feeling, so I actually preferred using it in the morning for that purpose.  I typically have some congested areas (under my eyes) that result in skin texture. This issue didn’t really change using the toner, but it wasn’t worsened either. My skin has some redness around the nose and unfortunately those areas were irritated a bit by the product. After a few minutes the redness went away though. I love how this leaves my skin feeling healthy and looking fresh and bright, it’s something I can use day or night depending on what I need. My skin doesn’t get super oily or dry when I use these regularly (once a day), it’s balanced which makes makeup or makeup free life so much easier. I haven’t used probiotic skincare before so I’m hoping this provides long lasting benefits as well as the shorter term results I’ve experienced. Skin balancing is now a breeze
