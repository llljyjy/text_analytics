I really liked these products! The face wash could lather a little more as a personal preference but otherwise I noticed a big difference on my skin after using the products! It balanced out the oily parts of my face without over drying the dry sections! The night cream is not to greasy and doesnâ€™t make my skin feel gross in the morning. The scrub is really nice to use as well as it gets ride of dry skin and makes look more even! nan
