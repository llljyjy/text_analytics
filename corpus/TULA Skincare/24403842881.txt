I absolutely love this product. I does make my skin smoother look more refreshed and pores on my face look smaller. I have combination type skin. This face mask is not an everyday face mask which I love, has a mild scent, is a light peace colour and goes on clear. Im glad you dont need very much, I use 3-4 pumps. There was a slight stinging sensation the first time and only lasted about 20 seconds each time after that there was no stinging sensation. I felt like it was working and cleaning all the guck off my face. I will continue to use this product and recommends to others The sting is real
