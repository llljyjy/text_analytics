I have super oily skin. This product did help to smooth out my skin. It didn’t sting when I applied it (it may if I had broken skin though) and had a nice cooling effect. I didn’t find any long lasting effects in my opinion but it was a nice mask I’d use every once in awhile to pamper and treat myself. I probably wouldn’t purchase the product again only because I already have other resurfacing products already in my skincare routine. An Okay Mask
