I have quite a few Tula products with the Cult Cleanser being my ride or die. That being said, I was excited for try this discovery kit. My overall reaction to these items was meh. I didn’t love the smell of any of them and didn’t notice a difference in my skin. The products in this kit are also so tiny for the price point. I would say it’s a good option to try out a bunch of the products but they definitely didn’t wow me like other Tula products have. Discovery kit was meh
