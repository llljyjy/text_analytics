I used this product for three weeks. I think alcohol free sounds nice. Also it’s animal cruelty free which I wholeheartedly appreciate. I love toners I can just spray on my face and go. I don’t like having to use cotton swabs or face cloths. This product is thick and it honestly made my face breakout. The ingredients and company seem nice so I had high hopes. I’m sad it didn’t work out for me. Not for me.
