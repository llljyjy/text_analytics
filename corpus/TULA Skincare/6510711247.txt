I was sent this complementary product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This was my first time using an eye cream and I was very happy with this one. I really like that it’s in a stick, so no product gets wasted. It kept my under eyes very moisturized. If you are using it under makeup, I would suggest waiting a while to let it sink in, otherwise your concealer may not stay. I can’t speak to whether it helps with puffiness or fine lines nan
