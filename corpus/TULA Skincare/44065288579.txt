I hate lotion when it’s sticky and stays forever. I love this product. It’s very fresh and hydrating. It smells clean, and lays on the skin naturally. Loved that it goes on smooth, definitely good with just a drop of the cream. With a drop of it, you can cover the area needed. Definitely going to add it to my self care routine! You have to try! Love love love it!
