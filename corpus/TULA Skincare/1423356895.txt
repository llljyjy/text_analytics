i was sent this by influenster in exchange for a fair review and i have to say it is a great serum if you’re new to vitamin c or actives. however, as I am a heavy user of acids, retinols, and other active ingredients I can’t say that I saw much of a improvement in my skin. What stood out to me though, was the gentleness and versatility of the product. It sat great under make up & with sunscreen, I had no weird interactions with any other products and most importantly, I didn’t have any negative reactions on my skin. It’s super lightweight a great starting serum for those who are interested in getting started without having to invest a large amount of money upfront but I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone  who is a lot more in-depth with their skin care or a further along on their skin care journey. Good starter serum not for experienced users
