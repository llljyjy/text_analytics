I have good skin except for my eye area. My eyes are so much darker and looks sunken, no eye products have worked for me in the past. I have been trying out Tula for more than a week, and I can see my eye area getting brighter, hydrated and lively than before. Almost like a miracle! The cream itself is perfect consistency, not too thick but thick enough to stay in place. I usually use it only at night time but occasionally used it during the day too. I will 100 percent recommend, it has become an integral part of my skincare routine. Works like a Miracle
