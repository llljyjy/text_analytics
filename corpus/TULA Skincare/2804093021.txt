Loved the scrub, found it worked great on the deep pores on my nose and around my mouth. I have a oily t zone that tends to get dark clogged pores, this helped get gunk out and keep clean.It has a great grape juice fruity smell that evoked a childhood recollection. Loving the pink salt and volcanic ash for the scrubbing action.Only problem was the bottle needs a good squeeze and if your hands are wet or have any product on it, itâ€™s hard to get out. Was my first time using a Tula skincare but I will be back for more. smells like childhood
