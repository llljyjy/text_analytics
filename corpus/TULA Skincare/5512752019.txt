I received set as a sample from influencer to try and give my honest opinion. I had already tried the face wash and having very dry skin see too much help with moisture. I set it aside and when my son started to break out with acne around 21 years old I gave it to him hoping that it would help with blemishes pretty moderate. And he has now stopped incoming acne and he started seeing less and less! So when this set came in I had him try it all! He loves skin care, and Since it works so well the first time I figured why not try again! He has been using a different set of products and hasn’t seen any acne in almost 4 years used the entire Tulisa and said that he was still for the face wash and that the moisturizer worked well on his acne prone skin. I think this is a pricey little sir and I can’t really see myself purchasing these minis however because my kids do enjoy using them I try to grab them when they are on sale! His face looks flawless today and he would definitely recommend to help clear your face up and keep it clear! great for acne
