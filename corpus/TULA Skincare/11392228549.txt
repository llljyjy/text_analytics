This Tula Protect + Glow Daily Sunscreen Gel SPF 30 (sent FREE for my HONEST review from influenster and the brand) is definitely not for my oily skin type. I love the glassy skin finish it gives to the skin, as well as the fact that it does dry down completely. Unfortunately, by the 6 hour mark I looked like I coated my face in Crisco. And felt about the same. I think this spf would be beautiful on normal to dry skin, especially under makeup. There are little beads in the product that burst as you work them into the skin. Which some may or may not love. There is also no detectable scent which is great for those who are sensitive. I also wish the spf was higher when touted as a stand alone sunscreen. While testing I did wear this under makeup and without makeup both. It didn’t seem to matter to my oily skin. This was an absolute oil slick waiting to happen. Beautiful…Just NOT for my OILY SKIN
