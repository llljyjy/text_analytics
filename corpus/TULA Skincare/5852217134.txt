Nice and refreshing for evening skincare, but there is a bit of a sticky finish left on the skin. I thought this might help prime for makeup, but it did make my makeup pill quite a bit. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the pads are flimsy and roll under your fingers sometimes, but I didn’t find this to be too big of a deal if I spied more gently. I’ve only used a couple days so haven’t seen significant difference in my skin yet, but overall it’s a nice product. nan
