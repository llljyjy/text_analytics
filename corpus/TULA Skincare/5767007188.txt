The packaging itself is sleek and the pump is very generous with how much you get in one pump. The moisturizer itself is orange tinted and smells just like a creamsicle! This is great for day or night use, as I felt a marked difference in how moisturized my skin was after only 1 use. I also love that Tula only uses clean ingredients, however I think that other skincare companies should follow suit so the consumer does not have to choose between $ value and ingredient quality (the retail value of this moisturizer is quite high compared to other similar products on the market). Otherwise, this is a fantastic moisturizer that I use close to every day now, especially with summer right around the corner! nan
