As someone with sensitive skin, this product is amazing! It doesn’t break me out, it gives me a nice soft glow and has that good UV protection. The only thing I do not like is that it has a very strong sunscreen smell. It’s honestly all I smell for hours. If it had a better smell or no smell at all, it would definitely become and product I routinely use. Stinky glow
