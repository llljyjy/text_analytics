I might have just found my new favourite eye cream! Light weight that doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling afterwards! Packaging is stylish and the smell is clean and not over powering. Hydrated my skin wonderfully and left my under eyes perfectly prepped for concealer. I definitely saw a noticeable difference in my under eyes. Looking forward to purchasing more and trying other products from the brand. nan
