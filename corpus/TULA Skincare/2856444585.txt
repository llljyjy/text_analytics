I so wanted to love this serum with all of the boosting of the probiotics and superfoods, but unfortunately it left my face after a fews hours very oily and sticky.  For the price I would look for something that would make my face feel less oily and lightweight.  After a week of using the serum AM/PM my face broke out a bit.
