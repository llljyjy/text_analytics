I really like this whole set! One negative- the first product I tried was the beauty sleep moisturizer. I woke up with little acne bumps around my face that didn’t go away for about a week. I didn’t use any of the Tula products until they went away. But after a week, they went away and I gave the other products a shot. I loved them! I slowly integrated the beauty sleep back into my routine and didn’t have any issues whatsoever. Maybe my skin just needed to get used to a new product. I would definitely buy all of these products again. My skin feels so refreshed after I use daily! nan
