love the idea of an eye balm - i typically stick to an eye cream, but when i received this complimentary, i had to try it out. i was pleasantly surprised! the consistency isnt too sticky or heavy, and it isnt too fragranced! ireally look forward to using this product more often and seeing nice, plump skin around my eyes. i am interested to use other tula products as well, ive only heard positive feedback about this brand! love the balm
