I have to say I really love this. A little goes a very longway. I had use two pumps the first time and it was wayto much. But after using it every night with one pump myface feels amazing. I already have a oily face. But withthis hydrating night cream at night it some how worksmagic. The smell isn’t to bad. It’s tolerable. I asked myhusband if it smelled ok and he said it smelled just fineMaybe it’s just me. But overall amazing. Really like the night cream
