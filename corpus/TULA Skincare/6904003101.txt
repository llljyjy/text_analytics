I like this for cooling and depuffing under the eyes in the mornings when I wake up (or later on in the day if I feel extra tired) and it helps to slightly brighten as well but not as much. I find it works well under makeup.My number one concern for the eye area is dehydration which i haven’t found it does much for. I have however tried the rose version of this and I find it is much more moisturizing so if you’re like me and deal with dryness under the eyes but also want something cooling, Id go with the rose version. nan
