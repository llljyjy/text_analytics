This is the most unique Vitamin C serum that I have used. I love that it is thicker in texture. How hydrating it is, and how long lasting the moisture stays without being heavy or sticky! A lot of Vitamin C products leave an odd residue / odd feeling on your skin (or scent!!!) BUT this one does none of that! I can use this DAY & night, whereas most Iâ€™ll only use at night because of all those issues that I cannot get past day time. This stuff is good!!! The Best Vitamin C you will try!
