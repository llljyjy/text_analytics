Unique delivery, fresh feeling, slightly glowy eye highlighter/stick. I love that it’s so easy to apply over or under makeup. Doesn’t leave you with messy fingers, and has an instant cooking effect. I keep it at my desk for a quick pick me up mid way through the day. I wish it actually helped with fine lines vs just helping to hide them, though! nan
