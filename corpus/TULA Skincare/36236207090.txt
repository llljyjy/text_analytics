I received this product from influencer and am glad I was able to try before purchasing. I’ve got fairly oily skin with texture, unfortunately this product didn’t work out for me. It left a tacky residue that my moisturizer wasn’t able to over take, leaving my skin soft in areas and tacky in others. I had tried the liquid toner in the past and was hoping this would be different but that one felt the same as this, maybe it’s the same toner in pad form? Either way I’m sad to say this was a no go for me so I wouldn’t repurchase nan
