I have dry skin, especially in the winter. I’ve tried a few different moisturizers this year in hopes to find one that really helps me.this one was sent to me by indluenster for a review and it was the moisturizer I’ve been looking for! How crazy is that! I find lots of moisturizers feel good when you first put them on but after awhile they just feel like a matte thick paste, not hydrating, so I never know if it’s actually helping my skin. Well the Tula moisturizer goes on great, little product goes a long way. And it makes my skin dewy, even after hours, I can see the hydration and it’s so nice! I’m not a fan of fragrance so I’d like a non scented option but this product makes me so happy! I couldn’t recommend it enough to people with dry skin. Game changer
