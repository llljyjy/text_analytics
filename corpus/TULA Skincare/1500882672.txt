I like how smooth this feels and it is in fact VERY hydrating. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because of the fragrance. Personally I do love the smell of it (like creamsicles!) but the scent is a bit strong and I find it lingers which isn’t exactly ideal for many workplaces that require fragrance free. nan
