I received these products for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Throughout the years I have been looking for good skincare products to use for skin. My skin is sensitive and I have combination skin. Most products can be overly strong for my sensitive skin. Over the month I have been using all the Tulaâ€™s products. I have definitely see the difference in my skin. These products have my skin feeling clean and moisturized. Also got rid of my small dark spots and blemish on my face. I have plans on actually buying these products to continue the progress in my skin. Wonders for the skin
