I used to think that my undereye skin didn’t need hydratation but I was wrong. This particular  area gets even more dried if you often put makeup on. After trying multiple eye creams I was given the chance to test 24-7 Power Swipe Hydrating Day & Night Treatment Eye Balm and was surprised by its efficiency. I felt hydrated and my concealer looks no more like a dry chalk. Moreover it doesn’t cause any eye sensitivity like redness or tearing. And above all the dispenser is very practical as you don’t need to dip your fingers in. Just roll it over and that’s it! I am definitely including this balm in my skin routine. Everybody needs it
