My first impressions: not too perfume-y, it actually has a nice clean scent.  It’s a little bit on the thick side but found it really absorbent! It held well under makeup; not slippery so it set a good base for my under eyes.  Overall, I’m really enjoying this!  I’d recommend this to anyone who has thirsty eyes like mine! Thicker consistency but absorbent
