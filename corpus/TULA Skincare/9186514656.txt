This product leaves the skin feeling firm and healthy. It does not leave a sticky residue. It is slightly scented, with a fresh scent. I personally do not like the packaging and it the reason I am scoring so low. The eye drop like dispenser seems to not work too well for this semi-thick material. I find it had a hard time sucking up the material, I also donâ€™t like the colour of the product. It is a semi white thicker material which kinda looks like a male bodily fluid. If the consistency was changed or perphas in a pump instead, I think I would be much more eager to use it! Change of packaging/consistency
