This is actually way better than the other 2 glow under eye sticks Tula has! I put this in the fridge and it feels so good and relaxing in the morning. Puffiness is gone and the caffeine and hylarauonic acid really brightens and moisturizes the under eyes. I also like the packaging this is a great on the go under eye treatment and great for touch ups. Great for on the go!
