I am not a big fan of retinol products, so this retinol alternative serum really intrigued me. It’s a lotion-oil kind of liquid, very moisture, I don’t need to apply moisturizer after this, but not sticky at all. It gives your skin a warming sensation at the first few minutes. I am glad there is no fragrance or funky smell. I only used for a week, I like it so far, butI have to minus one star due to its higher price tag. It works for me
