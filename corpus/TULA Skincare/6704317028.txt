I’ve been trying this product for the past two weeks using it daily twice a day once in the morning and at night. This has visibly plumped up my skin and improve the look of fine lines. This is not Botox in a bottle but it’s excellent at smoothing the appearance and for preventative measures. My skin is super dry and this was super hydrating. Is the price point worth it? It could be better but for the claims on the bottle it sure measures up. super hydrating and smoothing
