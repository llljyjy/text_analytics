I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion! After using it now for approximately a week, I believe this toner is great especially for oily skin. My main skin care concerns are oily skin and pores/blackheads. This product makes my skin feel clean and not greasy and has already made a difference in my skin. I would recommend :) 11/10
