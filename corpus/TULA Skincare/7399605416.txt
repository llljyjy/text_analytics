I’ve been using this (almost) nightly for seven months now and I love this product. It’s the only eye-product I’ve used that I’ve seen results with. I have naturally puffy eyes and aging has only increased that. I swipe this product on at night and my puffiness has decreased with time. Very hydrating and easy to apply. I was worried that it would tug on the delicate skin, but I have had any issues. Absolutely love and will buy again. nan
