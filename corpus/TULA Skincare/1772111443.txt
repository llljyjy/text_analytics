I received this a while ago and did like it for the most part but I found the smell to be super off putting. I kind of dreaded putting it on at night while I was testing it out for that reason. I know that am I sensitive to smells and I can sometimes hate scents that other people really enjoy so maybe this is one of those times. I will say that the first couple times I used it, I was impressed by how my skin looked in the morning. My skin looked bright and clear those first few days and did seem hydrated. After that initial period though I realized that this wasn’t a product I could use daily on my sensitive skin. If it wasn’t for the scent I’d probably keep using it a couple times a week to exfoliate and maintain my skin. A bit much for sensitive skin
