this was my first time using the famous vitamin base from bobbi brown. it is extremely moisturizing, a bit goes a long way, and it melts into the skin, really blends in quickly. I think going forward I’ll use this not only as a primer, but as an AM moisturizer as well. it’s nice that it can take the place of 2 products! I’m excited to see the results from continued use. slight citrus scent, nothing too overpowering. nan
