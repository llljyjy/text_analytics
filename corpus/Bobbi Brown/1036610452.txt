LOVE this eye cream! A tiny amount is all you need for excellent moisturizing and smoothing around the eyes. Not overly greasy, so undereye concealer stays put, no creasing ALL day, and my eye area still feels moisturized at end of day. I use it at night too. My experience with a lot of other eye creams has been concealer settling into fine lines and eye area feeling dry by late afternoon - not with this! A little sticky out of the jar, but you melt a tiny bit between your fingers and pat on, it is quickly absorbed. I like the fact that there is a refill available that fits into the jar but it is not available at Sephora. My must-have eye cream!
