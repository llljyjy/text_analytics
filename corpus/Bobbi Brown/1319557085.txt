Why didn’t I try this cream earlier?? I use this everyday with or without makeup and it’s contains just the right amount of hydration for my 30s skin. I think if I used this in my 20s it would’ve been too oily but now I’m in need of hydration especially as I get older. I like that it doesn’t contain spf because I like to use my own mineral sunscreen. It smells great and I can tell it has good moisturizing properties because my skin feels so smooth even after I wash off all my makeup at night. I will be using this for life. My HG!
