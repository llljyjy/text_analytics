The product smells amazing and is very creamy. I think if you have normal to dry skin and is looking for something spa like to treat yourself. this will work nicely, it does help with makeup application and add hydration (however nothing that a little bit of Cerave or Aveeno can’t do). It does not work at all for my very dry textured skin. If anything I feel like my skin is slightly drier after applying this and applying makeup. I do really enjoy the smell and how it feels when first applied but for me ultimately it didn’t meet my need especially at this high price point. Would not recommend for people with very dry skin like me. Not for very dry skin
