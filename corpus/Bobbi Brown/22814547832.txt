This is a great moisturizing primer. I don’t usually reach for primers anymore, but this has been changing my mind lately. I really like that it’s basically a 2 in 1 product. It works really nicely under my makeup, and doesn’t feel heavy at all! My skin feels soft after and it gifts a soft glow to my skin. The price is a little steep to be honest, but it looks like it could last me a decent time. nan
