Bobbi Brown’s Vitamin Enriched Face Base has transformed my makeup game. This is the best primer I’ve tried which hydrates instantly. It moisturizes too which is a nice add on to any primer. It did have a bit of shine to it but I’ve added more powder which controlled that aspect of it…I also have naturally oily skin so it should be better on normal to combination skin. New fave
