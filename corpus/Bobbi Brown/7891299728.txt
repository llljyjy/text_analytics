I have oily acne prone skin. This is the best moisturizer I have used. I have used many moisturizers from sephora as well as Cerave and Cetaphil. Nothing worked on my oily skin in the past. I am on my second container. I get that its expensive, but at least you dont have to buy a primer separately. Works for me.
