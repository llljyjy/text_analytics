First time trying a skincare product from Bobbi Brown! This product is a 2-in-1 moisturizer and makeup primer. It has a thick creamy consistency which I believe works best in the winter or for those who have drier skin. I do like that itâ€™s two products combined in one as it takes less time during my morning routine, and it helps avoid the issue of my moisturizer/serums sometimes not working well with my primer and causes pilling! No issues here! nan
