Iâ€™ve had a few samples of this cream and fell in love with it!!! I am so happy to have the full size now because it became a staple in my morning routine!It has a clean and fresh lemony scent, it moisturizes without being greasy, it actually feels light on my skin and absorbs quickly. I use it mostly in the morning because it creates a flawless makeup base and it keeps my foundation smooth all day.My face AND neck look and feel great! nan
