Okay so I live in a ski town where it is VERY cold and dry, so my makeup is constantly looking “off“ because it settles into the little dry patches on my face. This Vitamin Enriched Face Base does wonders for my skin! Whether I’m applying this as a moisturizer before skiing, or as a primer before makeup, this formula hydrates and smoothes my skin like no other. It’s so easy to apply and I love the luxe packaging. Every time I reach for it, it feels like such a luxurious experience. I’ve never used such a hydrating primer before! Love it. Incredibly Hydrating and Soothing
