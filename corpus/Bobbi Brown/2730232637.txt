This is a great priming moisturizer as it gives my skin a nice level of hydration and allows my foundation to lay nicely on top. I have combo skin and just using a little bit makes a huge difference. The jar will last you a while. It also has a little scent but it doesnâ€™t bother me at all. Great for combo skin
