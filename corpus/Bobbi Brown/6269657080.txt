I looove Bobbi Brown products and was super excited to try this. I am always looking for products that combine my love for skincare and makeup, and help the two work together. This priming moisturizer is exactly that. It feels very hydrating without being too heavy, and definitely sits well under makeup. It helps my skin look smooth and I like the scent as well. I would definitely recommend this for those looking for a good priming moisturizer! Amazing priming moisturizer!
