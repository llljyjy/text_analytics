Ok so my skin is SO sensitive and has been my whole life. I’ve bought so many primers to try and none of them have kept my makeup looking as amazing as this one.I was worried about the fragrance when I first used it but I found that it did not make a difference!I do my full skincare routine and make sure to moisturize before applying, then I put this primer right on top! I wait about 10 min or so to let the primer in, then apply my tinted CC cream on top! A PERFECT and hydrating combo!I got the smallest size which I think $24.00 is a great price. You don’t need a lot of the cream so the little one will last you a while!100% recommend this if you have dry skin and want a primer that hydrating and leaves you crease-free!!! Great for dry skin!!
