I love it!!! Really nice scent but not overpowering (I have sensitive skin and it was perfect!), leaves my face feeling moisturized and buttery without being too heavy or greasy (I have combination skin so i worry about getting too oily or shiny). Overall really great product, will continue using daily! Love!!
