This was my first experience with Bobbi and I have to say I’m pleasantly surprised (I went on their website and ordered a bunch of products) and beyond grateful to experience this Vitamin packed Primer! It’s so good! Plus it’s a moisturizer and primer in one she fills pores, blurs subtle lines and definitely makes my skin feel good and ready for makeup! Can be used with or without but a day moisturizer is a better deal, plus it’ll last longer. Either way she does what it says and feels great. As for my makeup longevity, it was great! I’ll be repurchasing her! Fabulous 2 in one formula! Great 2-in-1!!
