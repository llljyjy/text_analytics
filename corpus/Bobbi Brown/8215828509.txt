I have heard such good things about this base I was super excited to try it and it’s really is everything it’s hyped up to be! I really love the scent it’s very sweet and not chemicals like some skincare, and it goes on so smoothly!! It really shows a difference in my skin with or without makeup :) Worth the hype
