I’ve been loving this primer for my oily-combo skin! It feels very moisturizing but not at all greasy or heavy. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft & prepped for my foundation! My makeup stays on longer & I don’t get as oily when I wear this primer. It does have a light scent but it’s not too strong. I love that it can be used as a moisturizer as well! Such a great primer!!
