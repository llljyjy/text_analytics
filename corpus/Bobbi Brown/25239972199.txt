I was gifted this product in exchange for review, but I’ve purchased it myself in the past and not reviewed it.I am so excited to have this product in my life again, it’s such a wonderful primer! I have dry and sensitive skin. I prefer glowy makeup to matte looks, but many glowy products contain ingredients that break out my skin or types of oils that clog my pores. This product gives me a smooth base for a glowy look without any irritation!This product has a slight citrus scent, but it isn’t overpowering and isn’t noticeable when applied. The product is very thick and creamy, and it only takes about a fingertip of product to cover my whole face. When I used up a jar in the past, the 1.7 ounce jar lasted nearly 6 months of almost daily use. The product absorbs into my skin well, and it leaves a smooth and hydrating layer on the face. It doesn’t feel tacky, just very soft. I have never had this primer pill under makeup, and I have tried it with a matte formula (the Bobbi Brown longwear foundation) as well as several hydrating options like tinted moisturizers and skin tints. It never fails to make my skin look plumped and smooth under my makeup.Overall, I love this stuff! I don’t have a huge makeup budget, but I will continue to fit this product into it whenever possible. Moisturizing and glowy
