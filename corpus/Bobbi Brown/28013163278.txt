I used this face base for my New Yearâ€™s Eve makeup as my primer and was so pleasantly surprised by how long it lasted! I was wearing makeup for around 10 hours that day and it stayed perfectly in place. It has a light and pleasant consistency, like a lightweight moisturizer, and feels great upon application. I have acne prone skin, and thankfully had no problems using it. Will definitely be using this as my primary primer now! nan
