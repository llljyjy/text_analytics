I have very dry skin (especially in the cold weather) and it makes it hard to wear long-wearing foundations without them getting crusty-looking. I was hoping this would help and it did!It feels very creamy and hydrating going on and can be worn as a moisturizer or as a base for foundation, which is what I wanted it for. I’m not sure if it helped my foundation wear longer as a primer but it absolutely helped keep my skin hydrated enough that the foundation layer didn’t get crusty and dried out. It’s a staple in my makeup collection now for sure! No more crusty, dry foundation!
