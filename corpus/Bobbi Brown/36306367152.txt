This is super good moisturizer!  I love it especially with the vitamin C in it.  You can smell a light hint of citrus in it, nothing overwhelming, and the benefit of VC Is so good.  I went through a jar In no time! I kept putting it on just bc I liked the way it made my skin feel and the way it smelled! I will buy it again. nan
