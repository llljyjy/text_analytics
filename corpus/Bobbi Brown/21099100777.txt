I had been meaning to buy this for the longest time given all the amazing reviews everywhere, but oh am I glad I got a sample to try before buying it! I really wanted to love it and I rarely write reviews unless the product is amazing or very disappointing, in this case unfortunately is the latter. I was looking for a hydrating nice base before my foundation. At the beginning it felt like a nice texture, with a pleasant and not too strong scent. Felt kind of thick and sticky, which I thought was probably great as a primer for my foundation. However, only an hour after application my makeup started looking super dry , patchy, and settling on fine lines and pores. I have normal skin (more on the oily side actually), the rest of my makeup routine and prep was the same as always, so after giving it a second chance and the same thing happened, I realized it had to be this given it’s the only change I’ve done to my routine and most of my makeup is creams with either natural or dewy finish and I do good moisturizing before anything. I’m so disappointed. Why is this drying..?
