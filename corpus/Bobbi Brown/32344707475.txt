I have really enjoyed this moisturizer/primer! On days that I donâ€™t wear makeup, it provides the perfect amount of hydration and glow. Underneath makeup, it has kept my foundation and concealer base looking flawless! While it smells luxurious, I could do without the fragrance, as that tends to irritate my skin. However, I have not had any reactions yet, and have been careful about avoiding my eye area (as instructed on the product). Hoping this product continues to be wonderful! A must-have for a glowy base.
