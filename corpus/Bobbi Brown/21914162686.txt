This primer is perfect for cold weather and under budge-proof foundation!I have combination skin and usually use less rich and creamy primers and moisturizers. This vitamin enriched face base is the best option when my skin is drier in certain areas from the cold weather, or under long lasting foundations which tend to leave my skin tight and dry. The hyaluronic acid and squalane moisturize my skin from the inside out and the shea butter makes my skin luminous. I love the fact it has added Vitamins B, C and E to nurture my skin! I highly recommend it and will purchase it in the future. Perfect under long lasting foundations!
