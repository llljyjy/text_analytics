I’m giving this five stars for now... I have very oily acne prone skin and buying this was a real leap of faith because the person who I originally heard about it from has ultra dry skin. But living in Alberta (especially now that it’s winter) I wanted something a bit more nourishing since it’s so dry here and I am shocked at how well it’s been working for me. I usually know pretty quick if my skin is going to freak out at something and so far (it’s been a week!) so good. I’ve been using this with the dr. jart cicapair on top and some laura mercier setting powder and it’s the best my skin has looked in AGES. I use it as a daytime moisturizer, not a nighttime one though. Note: it does smell very citrussy so if you don’t like that smell or if you’re scent sensitive, you might want to avoid. For comparison, my summer routine is the origins matte moisturizer (in the pink container) with the biossance gel one over top. Alberta winter oily skin hero?
