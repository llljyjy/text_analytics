At first I didn’t really know how to use this, because I apply sunscreen every morning, so I can’t put this face base on top as a primer because it’s too hydrating. Is it a primer or a moisturizer? I still don’t know.So finally I use it as an hydrating undereye primer and I like it, but it’s expensive and I don’t think I will buy it again just for this use. But it’s a good product, I don’t fully understand the buzz around it, but I recommend it if you’re searching for this kind of cream. And the smell of lemongrass is not unpleasant. Good but not for oily skin (and no FPS)
