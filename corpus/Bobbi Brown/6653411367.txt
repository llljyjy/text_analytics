I’m going to be honest; I am a little upset about how much I love this product. It’s pricey, so I held off from trying this cult favorite for awhile. Once I saw that they came out with a mini size, I decided it was the perfect way to give it a try. I ended up buying the largest size a week later because I am obsessed with this product. But granted, I don’t think this product is for everyone. It really is more of a moisturizer vs a primer, which I was personally looking for since I am currently treating my acne so aggressively & my skin is always dry/flaky. It’s consistency is light & spreads easily, but also feels so hydrating & soft! 10/10 recommend for dry skin especially! My New Favorite!
