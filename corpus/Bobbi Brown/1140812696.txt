I have tried dozens of oil cleaners and this is the BEST. Years ago I got a travel size as a gift with purchase and truly so impressed. I don’t understand why this product doesn’t get more hype?!?!? Well... if it cost less I would buy it way more often. This is an oil cleanser that feels like it rinses off with just water and doesn’t need a second face wash to get rid of residue. It removes heavy eye makeup really well without needing to heavily rub or wipe the eyes. I think this product deserves more praise like some other reviews say! I do 1-2 pumps and massage it all over my face for maybe 20 seconds and it rinses off clean and skin feels great This deserves more hype!!!
