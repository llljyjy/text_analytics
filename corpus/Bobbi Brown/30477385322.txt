This “vitamin enriched face base” from Bobbi Brown is so much more than I could have imagined from a moisturizer/primer combo! I have dry skin, so I must say I was a bit skeptical that this would even work for me, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The texture of this cream is buttery and rich, and it’s just what my face craves. It is actually hydrating enough for me to use as a moisturizer and primer in one, and I love the way it makes my skin feel. This is a big win for me! Buttery and Luxurious Texture
