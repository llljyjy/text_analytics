I love this product! It goes on very smooth with a light really nice scent. It doesn’t pill up when I put on my makeup like some bases I have used before. I do feel like it plumps my skin and keeps my makeup from settling into my fine lines. I recommend this makeup base of you’re looking from something to prime your skin for a flawless look! Great Product
