I have oily skin however it’s prone to dehydration and dryness especially on my jawline. I absolutely LOVED using this under my make up - it provided nourishment and allows the makeup to glide on. I skipped my serum and typical moisturizer and paired this with an SPF. I didn’t have any trouble with piling and it wore beautifully throughout the day. Pricey Yet Beautiful!
