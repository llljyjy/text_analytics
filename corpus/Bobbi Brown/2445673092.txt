This is one of those products that I wish I didn’t love because the idea of consistently repurchasing to have my in collection sounds costly and unfun. But I love this product. I can’t deny it. I’ve used samples before in the past to get my fix but I can’t run from it any longer. It’s a gorgeous product that really combines skincare with makeup to create the perfect base for your complexion products. I notice when I don’t use it, even if I’m still doing my skincare routine before applying makeup. It’s just the perfect hydrating last step to make things look impossibly smooth. A little does go a long way so you can definitely savor this over time to avoid breaking the bank on frequent occasions. I don’t want to know what my makeup looks like without it anymore! Yes, It's That Good
