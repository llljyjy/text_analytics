One of my favourite face primers for all types of foundations. I have oily skin so usually try to use something mattifying primers but I received this as a gift and I’m obsessed. A little goes a long way! It is quite scented, which is the only downside. The smell doesn’t linger on your skin but it’s strong when you’re applying it. If you are sensitive to scents you might want to pass. My makeup stays put with this and the texture is amazing. nan
