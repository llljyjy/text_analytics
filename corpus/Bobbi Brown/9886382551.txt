I have heard so many people rave about this so I couldn’t wait to try it out myself! It totally lived up to the hype for me. It’s the perfect moisturizer and primer in one! It leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and ready for makeup. My foundation applied beautifully over it and it helped my makeup lasts all day! I definitely recommend. The best!
