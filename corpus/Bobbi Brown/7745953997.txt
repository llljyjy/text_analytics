I tried this amazing primer several times as a sample and I always loved it so, when Sephora had the full size half price, I jumped to buy it (I needed to go to the store because it was sold out in the web immediately and I bought the last one in store)PROS:- It has a thick consistency that melts into the skin and gets absorbed immediately. - Very hydrating but it doesn’t leave a greasy feeling.- Great ingredients like squalane, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.- This priming moisturizer works perfectly with my skincare, it doesn’t peel, and sits perfectly on top of it.- My makeup looks great over this primer.- It smells so good! If you don’t like scented products, this is not for you. - Vegan and gluten-free CONS:- It is very pricey, but it is worth it.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Amazing priming moisturizer
