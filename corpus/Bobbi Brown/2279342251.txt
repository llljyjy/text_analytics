I’ve heard about this product for years and just wasn’t every that interested in buying/trying it but I happened to get a sample of it recently and NOW I understand why everyone’s been raving about it for years.  This is definitely a thick moisturizing base and right now--in the winter months--this feels amazing and definitely makes my makeup wear nicely.  I love the hydration that it gives and it really feels incredibly nourishing.  For those that dislike fragrance, this DOES have a subtle fragrance and I don’t think that those with oily skin are going to appreciate the ultra-creamy formula but I’m currently really enjoying it and I’ll probably end up repurchasing it.
