I do find this scent of the face base to be quite odd. It reminds me of this degreasing hand soap my dad uses when he works on cars so it feels kind of strange to out that scent on my face. The cream is very soft though, and it makes the skin feel super soft and hydrated too, it works well underneath makeup and preps it well. nan
