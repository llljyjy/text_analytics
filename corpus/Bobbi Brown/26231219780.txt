always dreamed of trying a base from bobie brown.  and then I was finally able to get her.  very beautiful, laconic packaging.  easy to use.  smells like citrus.  orange or lemon.  but the smell goes away very quickly after application.  I also liked the base itself.  it nourishes the skin well.  smoothes it and makes it ideal for applying foundation Popular face base
