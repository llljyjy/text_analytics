I have oily skin, right now for the winter it’s not as bad but this cream is really thick and rich. It hydrates my skin so well. I put it on even if I don’t wear make up because it gives me a nice healthy glow. When I do wear make up I let it skin on my skin for 5 minutes before apply makeup. I set my face and my skin just looks so healthy. If you have oily skin and looking for a winter primer. I think this one is great. Good winter base for oily skin
