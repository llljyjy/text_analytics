I’m never going to use another primer! I have tried so many before, but they have all been just so so. This one hydrates my skin while also offering a perfect canvas for my foundation. I also really enjoy the scent! The only down is that it’s in a jar and not a pump. I feel like that would make it more hygienic. nan
