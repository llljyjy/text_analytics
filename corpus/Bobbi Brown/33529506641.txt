I have always liked the Bobbi Brown brand because of its approach of beauty and the quality of its products. I already have several of their cosmetics and I wanted to try the makeup base because well-prepared skin makes the makeup prettier and long-lasting. Well, I am pleased! The smell and texture of it is really enjoyable. It melt very easily on the skin and doesnâ€™t make it greasy or unconfortable. You can apply makeup directly after and it looks good! Good melting texture
