I received this primer free from Bobbi Brown for my review. I’m not going to lie, I am not a huge primer person, and I didn’t have huge expectations for this.… But wow! This is probably the best primer I’ve ever used! And it’s probably the first primer that I have used where I really saw a very noticeable difference when using it versus not using it. This primer is kind of like a moisturizer; it is thick and moisturizing, and you only need a little bit. I apply it with my fingers, and let it sit on my skin for about a minute before I apply my foundation. I usually use a sponge for my foundation application, and I find that when I have this primer on it’s like the foundation just magically sticks to my skin. I feel like this primer has some “gripping” qualities that I really enjoy. My foundation looks fantastic on top of this and my skin is hydrated and plump. For reference, I am 44 and have normal skin with somewhat large pores. I highly recommend this primer and I’m honestly blown away by it! Seriously blown away!
