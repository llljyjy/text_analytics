This product gets absorbed quickly, so it’s easy to use it under makeup. The foundation doesn’t get messed up when applied over it. I like the texture of the cream and the smell is neutral. I am also a fan of nice packaging (the stuff you look at every day should look great IMO!) and this little jar looks great! Looks and feels nice
