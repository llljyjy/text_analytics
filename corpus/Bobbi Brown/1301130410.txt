Love this product. It is a really hydrating face product to use in the winter and is perfect for prepping the skin for makeup. I typically donâ€™t apply TOO many layers of makeup underneath this because it can pill depending on the products used. Plus this is hydrating enough for most days. Definitely recommend! Recommend this one!
