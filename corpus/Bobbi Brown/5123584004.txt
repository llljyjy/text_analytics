You absolutely get quality with this brand. The texture of this face base is absolutely decadent. It absolutely serves well as a moisturizer and a base for your makeup. It leaves a beautiful glowy, but not greasy veil leaving your skin looking absolutely healthy and vibrant. There is a gentle citrus scent that did not irritate my skin. Absolutely enjoy using this! nan
