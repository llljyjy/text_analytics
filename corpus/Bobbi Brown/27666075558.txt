This has to be the best Face Base Priming Moisturizer there is out there. I really like the ingredients they used in this product , I can smell the grapefruit and the shea butter. I like that it contains vitamin c and it’s also gluten free. I use this product before I apply any make up on my face. It’s super hydrating and the texture is so amazing. My face feels so soft and looks so glowy I love that this acts also as a moisturizer . I would 100% recon this to anyone looking for an amazing face product. Great Product
