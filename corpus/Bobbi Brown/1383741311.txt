This is such a great priming moisturizer. I love that this product is 2 in 1 and does a great job at hydrating my skin while prepping my skin for makeup application. I tend to reach for this product more during the winter months when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration. This has a citrus scent, but it doesnâ€™t seem to irritate my skin. I just wanted to mention that in case you are sensitive to fragrance. Overall, I really enjoy this product and will continue to repurchase. Hello, hydration
