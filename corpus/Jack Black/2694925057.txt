The OG lip balm for me. This stuff is truly the best I’ve ever used. I’ve been using this for years and when my lips are at the brink (peeling, bleeding) this is the best I’ve tried for getting them back into a healthy condition. I don’t always need this much moisture so sometimes I alternate with other balms, but I have yet to try better at either cheaper or more expensive price points. I think this is worth trying if you’ve already tried cheaper balms and they’re not working for you. If you already have effective balms that work for you that cost less, then I don’t necessarily think you need to splash out for this one. I’ve tried a few of the hyped $20+ lip balms/masks and none of them are comparable in effectiveness to this one in my experience. nan
