This product is amazing. Iâ€™ve tried the black tea scent and the mint. Both work equally as good. Not only does this lip balm smell amazing, but it also left my lips feeling/looking soft, hydrated, and healthy. I 10/10 recommend investing in this lip balm. If you want long-lasting hydration, buy this.
