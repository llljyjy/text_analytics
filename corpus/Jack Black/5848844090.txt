I have dry skin and lips year round, through very hot summers and cold winters. I had tried some of the more expensive lip balms and masks and they either didn’t work me, didn’t stay on my lips very long, or were a hassle to use and goopy (I really hate both the Laneige and Tatcha lip masks). Not to mention the ridiculous prices, and gross overly artificial flavors. I first tried this in lemon (which is sweet like lemon cake or limoncello), and I liked the performance enough to just try the basic scents. Shea is very light, just smells like shea butter, and mint is refreshing, like you just brushed your teeth. These are great both in performance and packaging. Easy to use on the go or in the dark when I’m getting into bed, stay on my lips all night, even stay on pretty well throughout the day with eating and drinking, a very thin layer works great for lipstick prep. They never feel goopy, waxy, or turn white. I saw another review mention tasting the sunscreen, I know that flavor from trying the Supergoop lip balm, and I do not have that problem with this at all. In fact, I don’t really “taste“ the scent either, it’s really just a scent. It might be fun to try the others but I think these two are the best. I also love that this brand is cruelty-free. I can stop searching for new lip balms
