This is an absolutely amazing product it left my lips feeling hydrated and soft and supple. I didn’t experience a white film while using it and I will also say the formulation was great I personally prefer the thick consistency. It’s a great everyday lip balm also the fragrance isn’t overbearing. AMAZING!!!
