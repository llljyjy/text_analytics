Absolutely love this lip balm! It makes my lips so so soft. I have the mint and lemon ones, which I love both. The lemon oneâ€™s scent reminds me of skittles or candy. Only giving 4 stars because it runs out quick if you use it everyday and the price is a little expensive for a small tube! Overall though great product! nan
