I’m obsessed. It goes on really well over lip tints and layers with lip glosses (I don’t use “real” lip stick, and so I can’t say anything there). It’s an easy way to add SPF to your lips. I don’t feel like it causes lip balm addiction, and the two scents I got (black tea & blackberry and the grapefruit one) are really nice but not overpowering. It feels moisturizing, not sticky, and healing. I have several so I am never without it. nan
