Picked both the mint and grapefruit up prior to a recent desert trip. In the past I have been lazy about SPF for my body and lips, and vowed to do better in 2022. My lips have yet to burn after hours in the sun hiking and running. Easy to throw in my bag and didnâ€™t make a mess or get runny in 90 degree weather! nan
