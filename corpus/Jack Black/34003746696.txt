I had the Shea butter one- I don’t hate it but I had rebound dryness if I went even a day without it. I also didn’t like how it had a chemical-like aftertaste if I licked my lips but that may be from the SPF in it. I do like the smell and like that it doesn’t have an actual flavor. Flavorless lip balms are hard to come by lately. nan
