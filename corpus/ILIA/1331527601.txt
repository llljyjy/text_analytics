So I didn’t read the directions well before using. I ended up applying it exactly the way they tell you not to and experienced that piling effect. Once I fixed my application, it was great!  My only “issue” with it was it didn’t really look too different before using and after. And I even got a darker color that my natural skin tone because I’m darker in the summer and lighter in the winter.  I am happy about the spf in it but would love just a bit of color to my skin. nan
