I received this as a free product through pinch me. After using it for a couple of weeks I have noticed a major hydration boost. I work in the sun daily and this product makes my face feel so moisturized. I love that it has SPF also. Iâ€™m just not fond of the Dewey finish. Other than that I might keep this in my routine.
