Can we just take a minute and talk about how amazing this has been for my super sensitive skin, its not very often a product does this well besides vanicream, but this hit it out of the park, I love the spf 40, the c beyond triple serum, it brightened a lot of my dark spots, gave me a light coverage.  I think this could be the product I have been looking for, it is scentless, it has dry oils so its also a moisturizer. Its an all in 1. I will be re buying this product. Can you can see how much it honestly helped my skin. It looks more even than it has in a long time. Yess girlll
