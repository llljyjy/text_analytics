Ever since working from home, I’ve paired my beauty routine down to nothing. My skincare has taken the front seat and ILIA has been my go-to. This new product takes care of my quick errand needs, I wear it alone, it’s translucent but I feel like the darkest tone gives me a subtle alive look. It takes care of my SPF which I love since it takes that extra step away and I just look fresh! I also layered it with the skin tint foundation and loved that I could add the vitamin C without waiting for my serum to dry. I think it’s a game changer and I’m here for it!!! Please go onto their site for more info, I don’t think Sephora does a good job with the description, I also used their site the shade match since I do all my shopping online! ** don’t judge LOL OBSESSED
