This product is great if you need minimum coverage as it does not cover as a tinted moisturizer does. Overall a great product as it provides great moisture all day. I also noticed that the vitamin C is helping clear my face a little bit. I also appreciate the SPF 40 as sometimes I would rather apply something light with sunblock when wearing a mask. The instructions to use the product are also on point as applying too much can leave a residue so a little goes a long way. Great serum, minimum coverage
