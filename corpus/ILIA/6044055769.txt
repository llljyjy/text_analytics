I initially really loved this product. So many benefits in one - I was able to replace most of my morning skincare routine with just this. However, over time I grew to dislike how oily it made my skin (I have combo) and then I saw what it costs... not something I would ever buy at full price. If it was half off maybe but sheesh. I don’t love the bottle design either, it’s hard to get enough out and you need to apply a lot each time so definitely not cost effective. Overall if it fits your budget I think it is a nice product though, probably best for those with dry skin. All in 1
