I was selected to try this and give my honest opinion and review after using this for a month..so here goes..day 1 I opened up the package to get thrown off by the color of the shade.. even tho I chose the lightest 1 shade it looked off..I was afraid to try it but needed to . so I applied as you’ll see in the pictures..I still thought..omg the color is all wrong. but I was happy when it really did absorb and fade into my light skin color!! I was even happier when my face felt as soft as it did after even my very first application.   I was afraid this would make me break out with the heavy formula it seemed to have at the first use... but happy to report I did not.  my face felt so much smother and it did slightly even out my tone.. but not enough to skip my face daily make up routine lolI like this product but not sure I’ll use it all year.. but possibly during summer months when the sun is more damaging.  I like the vitamin c and sunscreen that did seem to help as a pre makeup step...it is easy to apply... just make sure to shake well before your application and apply like a serum patting it into your freshly washed face.a little goes a long way I realized after my first use..I mightve used too much my first day but it didn’t cause any issues for me.  I’ll share pictures before and how the makeup itself looked at first sight... and how it did absorb and match my complexion as I said..all in all this was a decent product to use. I might buy if on sale but not sure I’d want to pay full price being honest. smoothing skin serum with benefits
