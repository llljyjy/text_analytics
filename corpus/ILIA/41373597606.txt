I received this sample from pinchme for my honest review. First off I like the color; it is also light and airy which is what I was looking for.. but you HAVE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. it is important. Or it will start to peel and look horrible. I wish it was just a little more easy to apply.  I will use the product again without makeup and see if it makes a difference.. Eh make sure you follow instructions
