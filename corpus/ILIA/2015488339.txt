I was looking forward to trying this serum because it had everything I was looking for and I was not bothered by any fragrance. The color matched me but I felt the not much color was even deposited on my skin. I was confused on when to apply the serum, before or after my moisturizer? The directions on the box doesnâ€™t say so. Overall, a nice light serum to protect me from the sun. All-in-one serum
