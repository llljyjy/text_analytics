I received this this product complimentary for my honest review. I tried this product for a week but the smell was too much so I had to discontinue use. It has a very strong fragrance that literally made my eyes water and I couldnâ€™t stand smelling it on my skin all day. After a week with no results I discontinued use. Smells horrible.
