This is a 4-in-1 product - a serum with hydration and Vitamin C for brighter skin and SPF 40 for sun protection and finally minor tint for days or moments when you just want to let your skin breathe without makeup.  I like the packaging and teh dispensing.  It took me  two days to understand that shaking the bottle well to mix Vitamin C and then patting it gently to apply is essential.  Also, you have to leave it on for a minute so that it absorns before you apply additional makeup.  If you follow the steps you get a glow, smooth beautiful skin.  I love it and will buy it again. 4-in-1 Product Love it.
