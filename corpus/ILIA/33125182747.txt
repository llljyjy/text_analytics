ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum: If you ask me,It has so many skincare benefits in just one step(vitamin, niacinamide $sunscreen).The SPF 40 is really good and does protects the skin.Serum blends in well and gives your skin that all-over glow.You do not need extra moisturizer as the moisturizing level is good enough.However, if you have a combination/oily skin, you might want to check the quantity to apply because it’s oily.Another good thing about this serum is that it’s fragrance-free, I’m not scent-sensitive but if you are, this is definitely an okay product for you.Overall, I love that it’s valuable for its emollient properties and that’s why I really do not think it’s pricey for what it does at a time.So far result has been impressive and I hope to to buy soon before this runs out. Awesome multitasking product
