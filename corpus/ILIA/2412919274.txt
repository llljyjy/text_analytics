I like the concept of this product but it didn’t perform how I would have liked. Shade 3 is actually very dark and slightly red but shade 2 was too light. I first tried this over my normal skincare routine and it looked greasy and never dried down. I also got weird looks from my coworkers as it made my face look “off“ and like I was definitely wearing makeup. I also tried it on bare skin which looked like a satin finish but still remained transferrable throughout the entire day. I found my cheeks and chin feeling dry by midday and it made my cheeks itch. In the photo shade 3 is in the middle, left is GA luminous silk 8.74, and right is Merit amber. nan
