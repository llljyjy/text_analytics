Veryyyy greasy finish. I have combination skin and it would take about a minute or 2 to fully absorb into the dry parts of skin, and would take about 10 minutes to absorb into the oily parts of my skin and still leave me looking greasy. It also pills if you use anything under it even a lightweight serum or a toner. nan
