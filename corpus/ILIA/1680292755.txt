It was a little messy and I wouldnâ€™t use it as my sole source of sunscreen. However, I found that applying a few drops after my normal sunscreen gave a nice look. Helped to make my dark spots a little less noticeable. Overall a good addition but not a main source of protection unless you want to be slightly orange. nan
