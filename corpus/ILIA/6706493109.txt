Before using make sure you shake really well, it makes all the difference.This is quite an amazing serum, it has a thin consistency, however once applied & allowed to dry it leaves this flawless almost blurred effect on your skin. I did not think I was going to like it as much as I did, mostly because of its consistency. Really glad I  didn’t give up on it. And a HUGE + It’s an Spf 40!!! Serum + SPF? Yesss Pleease!!!!
