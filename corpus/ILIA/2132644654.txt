I received this product as a free sample through PinchMe.com. I really like the Ilia brand and this product did not fail to impress me with its sheer coverage and moisturizing properties. I have fair skin and usually wear products that contain SPF for that extra protection against the sun. It was also nice to have a product that had Vitamin C in it as I use a face serum and eye cream that also could twins Vitamin C. I like having Vitamin C in my face products as I feel it brightens my tired skin every morning and helps minimize dark spots and freckles. Sheer and Bright
