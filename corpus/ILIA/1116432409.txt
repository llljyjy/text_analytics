I have been using the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum Spf 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C and Niacinamide for a couple months now. Its takes some getting used to and some research to figure it out. First of all it’s NOT A TINTED MOISTURIZER. I had to keep telling myself that. Think of this as your serum or sunscreen step. It is NOT intended to provide coverage. It is tinted to get rid of the white cast traditionally seen with mineral sunscreens. This is a brilliant idea especially for those with dark complexions or skin tones. I love this part about it. I also love to 10% vitamin C that is encapsulated making it much more user friendly and effective. I didn’t have any sensitivity to this product at all. So the tricky part for me is that I’m not sure which step to use this in my routine and also it leaves my skin more oily than normal. I have worn this item alone, with a tinted moisturizer over it, with full make up over it , and even attempted to put it over make up (for the beach). Don’t do that last one! It doesn’t work out well! I tend to wear it the most under makeup but I just don’t like how oily my skin gets throughout the day. I think this product would be better for someone with combo-dry skin. I have been using it on my chest and over my tattoos. It works great over my tattoos for sun protection and without the white cast. I want buy this product for myself, but I have recommended it to some of my friends with drier skin. You have to think outside the box for this one
