I absolutely love this sunscreen. I had no issues with pilling. if u pat the sunscreen on your face instead of rubbing there will be no pilling... I must say this sunscreen has truly done wonders for my skin. it improved the texture of my skin, has brightened dark spots, and evened my complexion over time. it’s super dewy so if u don’t like a dewy look. I recommend setting it with a setting powder. only downsides are that I finished this product within five weeks which can be pricey but I don’t mind investing in my skin. also I wish there was 1 more shade between tone two and three and I wish it had a better product dispenser. 100% recommend LOVE
