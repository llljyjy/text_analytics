I almost didn’t pick this one up because of the reviews, but I am so glad I did!My skin is normal to dry, tan skin and this product is so dewy and it leaves me with no white cast. I often struggle with dryness when I use physical sunscreens, but this one is great!I do think there’s a bit of a learning curve? I think that may put some people off for sure.As always check the base of your products... is it water or oil or silicone based? If they don’t match, your product will pill.I use the Tatcha dewy cream and I follow it up with this product and I have had no pilling issues. Agree that the bottle is super small! Love it!
