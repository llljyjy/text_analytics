I received a free sample of ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide in Translucent Tone 1 in exchange for my honest review. First off, I love that this product had Vitamin C and Niacinamide in it. That means less steps in my skincare routine. I also love that this has SPF 40 because sun protection is extremely important to me. You definitely have to take extra care when applying though, because it will pill if not applied correctly. Great product for sun protection and skincare
