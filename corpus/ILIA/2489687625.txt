Love this product for summer and lighter makeup days! It goes on really smoothly and just adds a slight airbrush look to your skin. It won’t cover major problem areas but does smooth the overall appearance. I do typically add some powder over the top just because my skin tends to be a little oily but that’s no fault of the serum, just preference for a more matte finish. Love the SPF benefits too! I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. nan
