Super great product!  Very lightweight very natural and is really wonderful for someone that doesn’t want a lot of coverage.  I have oily skin so I wouldn’t recommend this for an oilier person all the time but as a quick product it’s really wonderful.  If you have dry skin 100% think this is for you!  It’s extremely thin and blendable.  See my pic below for comparison. The top is Colourpop Hyaluronic CC cream in 9W the right is TF Born this Way foundation in Praline and the left is the ILIA in medium. Awesome lightweight serum foundation
