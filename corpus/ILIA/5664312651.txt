For what it is 4/5 stars. I do feel like my skin has benefited from this serum. It does not have “coverage“ so I wouldn’t use it if needing a fuller cover. But with SPF and additional treatments, I would say it was a good purchase especially for the summer to keep things light. Could there be something out there that does just the same for less -- most likely. I liked it
