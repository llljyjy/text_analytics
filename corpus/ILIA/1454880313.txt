I was excited to give this a try. I was quite shocked at the price considering it’s only a 30ml bottle, and this is being marketed as a serum/sunscreen. It takes about 10 pumps for me to feel like I am going to get sufficient coverage. I did experience the dreaded pilling after rubbing it between my hands and trying to rub it into my face. I had greater success when applying this shortly after applying my facial oil at the end of my full skincare routine (sans serums because this one is pretty loaded). When I do wear it, I find that my skin does look good.Due to the price, I generally save this for going out. Wore it on 3 different days and already seems like the bottle is < half full.For an everyday driver with reapplications throughout the day, I’ll stick with my Supergoop glowscreen. love/hate relationship with this
