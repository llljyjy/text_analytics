This is a true game changer. I haven’t been able to find a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white film on my face so honestly, I’ve been out in the world unprotected from sun rays.I love the way this sunscreen goes on. it rubs in completely clear even though the product has a tint. I absolutely love it and it is a staple for me now. I layer it on top of my facial moisturizer so I don’t have to worry about my face looking or feeling dry. works great
