I love this!!. I haven’t experienced pilling. I don’t use gel or oil free products w this either. Since this is waterless you don’t need a lot..this isn’t a regular 2/3 finger SPF. This looks beautiful under skin tints as well. I got several compliments and asking “what do I use on my skin” since I’ve been using this! For reference I use CT Magic Cream as my moisturizer and REN Barrier Support Facial Oil so this product doesn’t have anything to clash with. LOVE A WATERLESS PRODUCT!
