I really wish I loved this product. I loved the idea of this product and it actually looked really nice when I first applied it. The color blended okay and gave me just enough product for a nice light coverage for a simple day out. The actual product was not my favorite. It had a weird fragrance to it which was not pleasant. The product actually pilled so much on my skin. I didnâ€™t like it. I really hope Ilia will work on the formula for this product because I would try it again if they did. Great concept but weird texture
