I received this product from Influenster and I was so excited to try it because I have been wanting to try the Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint but, this was a let down. First off, the shade range is not that great. It does say in the product description that it is a “translucent tone“, which is true cause it sheers out when blended, but I still don’t think three shades is enough. I also have sensitive acne-prone skin and some Vitamin C serums work for me but, this one left my skin SUPER irritated for at least an hour after application. I will say it did leave nice glow on my skin which I did enjoy but, I had to stop using this product after three days because of how much it irritated my skin. I wish I was able to use this product longer to see if it did improve my skins texture and uneven tones so I cannot comment if it does help with that. The price of this product is a little stingy especially when there are a little bit cheaper products out there that could probably do the same exact thing. NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
