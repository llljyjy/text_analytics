I received a free sample from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. I was disappointed at first but after reading the application directions which I obviously failed to do so at first, I actually like it a bit. I dabbed it on using my fingertips, NO rubbing. It took several pumps of the product to apply over all my face. There is no real coverage. I did feel a bit of a stinging sensation which subsided after a couple of mins. It took about 2-3 mins to be absorbed. It did not have any kind of scent. I love the benefits especially that it has high SPF protection. I applied face powder over it without any issues. Itâ€™s okay
