I really liked the idea of this product because I suffer from Roscea and thought this would be a great way to get light coverage and SPF protection.  Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t quite work out that way.  It was wonderful at first but then as it soaked into my skin the red started showing.  It did do a wonderful job of protecting my face from further sun damage though and I do like that aspect of it.  I tried it again with a primer under it and that seemed to help for a little while. An OK product
