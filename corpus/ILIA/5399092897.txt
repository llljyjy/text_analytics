This will be my summer staple and my lazy days. It is sheer (as it describes) and has great spf coverage. However, anytime I see someone putting this on via Ilia social media, they are never applying enough. You need at least two to three fingers full of spf in order for you to have protection from the sun. If you are applying an adequate amount, you will look overly dewy (nothing a setting powder won’t help). Overall, it’s great but ilia needs to show the correct amount of the product that needs to be applied in order to have protection from the sun. Good stuff
