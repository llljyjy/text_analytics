I received this product for free from PinchMe in exchange for a review. Overall, I have enjoyed using this product. I love the high level of SPF with the added benefit of vitamin C and niacinamide. Though the tone looks several shades darker than my skin, it didnâ€™t show once applying to my face. The only drawback is sometimes this this product can be fussy. Too much can leave a greasy versus glowing look and not being careful upon applying can lead to the product peeling off and disturbing products applied over it. A little fussy
