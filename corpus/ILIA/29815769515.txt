This product takes a little bit of practice to get the hang of, but once you do it’s pretty amazing. At the time I ordered there was only one skin tone option available which was for extra light to medium skintone. I am fairly tan and was afraid this would be too light on me. Once it settles into the skin, it blends in flawlessly and matched my skin tone fairly well. You absolutely must follow the directions when applying this product. You have to shake it really well for at least 10 seconds, and when you put it on your face, you cannot rub it in.  You have to pat it into your skin so it doesn’t start to pill. Give it at least half a minute to fully dry, and then you can apply your foundation on top of it. Or, you can do what I do and use this as a fresh faced foundation. I’ve started using this as my make up, along with brows mascara, and a little lipgloss, and I’m out the door. It does not oxidize and it helps control oil and shine.
