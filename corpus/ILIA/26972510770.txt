I was thrilled to be able to try this product since I love Ilia products. I found this serum to be easy to apply and it left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Also liked the fact that it has an SPF of 40 and this product is a “clean“ product, which is something I am only trying to use these days. I think I would have preferred this serum to come with a dropper to dispense rather than the container that it came in. I feel it would have been easier to know exactly how much I needed for each use. Although it has a high SPF, it is not something I would recommend if one was to be out in the sun for a few hours. Worked fine for every day outings , but for any prolonged period of time, I would recommend using another sunscreen to protect your face from burning.All in all, I have enjoyed using this product, but would prefer a different way to dispense the serum. Have to say I didn’t notice any tint to my skin or any changes, but still like the product and it leaves my skin feeling soft. Leaves Skin Soft and Feeling Hydrated
