I got the medium shade as sample which kind of blended with my skin but I think tone 1 would have been suitable since I couldnâ€™t really feel any difference however using the shade 2. It can be used as base before make up and blends well with skin. But Incase you have oily skin it might give a bit greasy to your skin. It leaves skin glowing. Would recommend it if you have normal skin. Good for normal skin
