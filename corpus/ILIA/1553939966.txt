I love that it’s a serum x sunscreen. I usually layer it underneath my moisturizer and it really gives me a glass skin look. I’m not sure if it has significantly improved my skin over the course of a few weeks, but it definitely makes me feel really hydrated. The one thing I don’t like about it is the smell. Great serum x sunscreen combo!
