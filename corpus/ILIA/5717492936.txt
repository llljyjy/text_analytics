I tried this product as a free sample promotion and had high hopes for it as it sounded promising. It is tinted, however the tinting doesn’t provide any facial/unevenness coverage. It is oil based so I knew it could take a bit of time to absorb into the skin, but following several times testing this product I found it didn’t absorb even many hours after use. I asked my teen daughter to try it as well to see if she had better results. She had the same experience as I did thus we cannot recommend it to others if your skin tends to be resistent to oil absorption. Not what I anticipated
