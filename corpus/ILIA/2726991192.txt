I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The product is very lightly  tinted product, barely noticeable and it goes on like an oil it feels nice at first but when it’s very hot outside it does tend to sit on the skin and make me very oily.I would wear this more often when it’s cooler outside with foundation over it I do like the fact that it is a clean product that is also nourishing my skin. Very hydrating!
