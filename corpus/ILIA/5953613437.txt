I would give 0 stars if I could. What a waste of money. As soon as I put it on it pilled. I love the ilia skin tint and wanted this as a sunscreen by itself but it’s so bad!! I’ve never had skincare to pill like this. Also for the price point you should get AT LEAST 1.7 oz like most sunscreens. This is horrible and wish I never got it. PILLS LIKE CRAZY
