Upon first use I did like this product. After a few times I decided to try it under my makeup. I was not as satisfied due to my foundation crumbling up on top. If you are using ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40 alone I highly recommend it. Even following the directions carefully I still had trouble with it laying under makeup. Best Alone
