This is the first time in my history of shopping at Sephora that I have ever returned a product. I don’t know if I was doing it wrong or something. But this is just not a good product. It has no color and made my skin look greasy, not glowy. It just sits on top. It is absolutely NOT worth the money especially because the bottle is tiny and only halfway full! I didn’t use it long enough to see the promised results but the feel and consistency and cost is just horrible! awful
