I really like the results that Iâ€™m getting with this serum, but the application process and dispenser bottle are a little inconvenient. I use 4-5 pumps in the morning and you have to pat gently on your face or it will pill. Then wait a few minutes for it to completely absorb. It looks oily at first, but then leaves a nice glow. The scent kind of reminds me of self tanner but not in a bad way, and the tint is nice and sheer. Leaves a nice glow
