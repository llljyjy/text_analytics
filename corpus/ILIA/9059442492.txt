Before the product, I was always applying Vit C serum...wait wait...then niacinamide...wait wait...then finally apply my sunscreen. So when I saw these ingredients in one package, I was pretty stoked. I like that there is no fragrance and no white cast in this product. But I can’t get over the pilling. For minimal pilling, I have to press the serum into my skin, but if I even rub a little bit, I can feel the pilling. After a few minutes, the pilling disappears and I can apply other product. I just wish Ilia could come up with a serum where the texture is smoother, but I’m guessing the mineral sunscreen causes that pilling. And yes, this is after 30 seconds of vigorous shaking, like I’m a bartender. The jury’s still out whether I’d get this product again. Great ingredients...but still pilling
