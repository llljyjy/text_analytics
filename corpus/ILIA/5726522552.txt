I really wanted to love this, but just couldn’t. First of the shade range is incredibly small. I was between tone 2 and 3, the rep recommended tone 2 as 3 was too deep. I tried it when I got home and tone 2 just left a bit of a white cast, which would have been fixed with bronzer and other face products overall. THAT IS OF COURSE IF IT DIDNT START PILLING!! I tried multiple different ways to use it, but it all resulted with it pilling :( I’m disappointed that I have to return it. So much Pilling!!!!
