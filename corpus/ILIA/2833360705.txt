I received ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide for free in exchange for my honest review. Fist thing I will say it is extremely important to read the how to apply instructions because if you rub it it it will pull & look awful & if you have dry skin as I do & don’t use an oil before this product I found it to point out your dry spots. The biggest positive when used correctly is it gives a dewy glow which I love & love it gives the glow alone without extra makeup needed. It says it is scent free which I am guessing just means they didn’t add fragrance but be aware there is a fairly strong powder like scent but it does fade. I did notice after a few hours it did oxidase slightly to a light orangy kind of color. The pump I didn’t like you have to pump so many times to get enough product but I suppose that is better than a ton of product going to waste if too much came out. I haven’t noticed my skin being visibly brighter but that may need more time. I didn’t get sunburned while wearing the product so that was nice.  I am still unsure if I enjoy the product because of the reasons mentioned and it only being 1 ounce for over $60. It might just not be for my skin type. Another positive is even though the product might appear to dark as you pat it in to the skin it blends in nicely. Final thoughts if you try this I recommend getting a sample if you can & read the directions. I'm unsure about this product
