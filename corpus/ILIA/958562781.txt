I was given a complimentary sample of Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 from PinchMe & Ilia in exchange for my honest opinion of what I thought about the serum. I used this exactly as directed to get the best results. It glided on just like silk. I dabbed a little at a time using just my fingertips. It makes my face so smooth and I love i can get my vitamin c and SPF in one step. I donâ€™t need any other make up after applying this. It does seem to cause my mascara to smudge more if I get it too close to my eyes. One step wonder
