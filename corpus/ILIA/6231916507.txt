I really wanted to love this product. I appreciate a quick morning routine and thought a serum SPF with a slight tint would be a staple in my routine. This product isn’t it for me. I have normal skin leaning dry and it just kind of sat on my face. It didn’t absorb into my skin. It dries so quickly out of the container I felt I had to use SO much product which isn’t a great value for the price of this serum. I didn’t notice any other skin improvements in wearing this daily for a couple of weeks. I wish I had seen more improvement given the claims. Fine for a tinted SPF, but not anything else
