This is an interesting product to me. I’m not used to using tinted Sunscreens. It doesn’t provide actual coverage, it is very sheer, which I actually like. I’m really not big on oil based products, but surprisingly this doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. It also didn’t cause Amy breakouts or irritations, so that’s a plus. Overall, I’ve enjoyed testing this product, but I’m nit sure I’d purchase it in the future. Decent product
