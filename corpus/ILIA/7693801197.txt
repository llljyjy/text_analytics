This is a very nice tinted sunscreen. The application was easy when using my fingers and has a beautiful skin-like, glowy finish. As some reviewers noted, I feel like whenever I use this tint which is a decent amount every time (3-4 good pumps) I could finish this up in the next month or less with everyday use. For a $64 product itâ€™s an expensive tint. Other than the price and amount which I wish had more product, tint is amazing and would possibly repurchase again. Great formula but very expensive for amount
