Ok I did not care for the pump at all . But if you hold it upside down it works . The formula was very liquidy. Went on ok tho. But seem to make my skin more dry after using . I just donâ€™t think it agreed with my normal / dry skin . It did look good tho as far as shade on my skin . Could not tell a big difference tho after use other then my face skin was dryer . Just ok
