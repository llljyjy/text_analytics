When I’m running late for work or just having a lazy day in sweatpants, this is my go-to product. This sheer product provides the most natural “my skin but better“ look. The only negative that I could give to this product is the price, which is a bit steep. However, I have yet to find a product that gives coverage, skincare benefits, and sunscreen rolled up into one like this product. It truly delivers. I will gladly replace this product when I run out. Pricey, but delivers
