Got this recently and really wanted to love it but it’s so underwhelming considering the price point. For starters, the smell is just weird— it’s such a strong fragrance and it smells so bad!! Also this pills so so badly! It feels gritty when I try to apply it and even if I gently pat it in, I still get weird flaky pilling. Then I use moisturizer over to combat that which feels like a waste of product. It’s also greasy but dry at the same time. I’m just so disappointed. Overly Fragranced and Gritty
