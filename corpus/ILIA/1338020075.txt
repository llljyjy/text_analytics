Wanted to love it - I like the idea of this serum as an additional layer of protection although that’s most likely from the antioxidants because there’s no way anyone would use enough of this serum to get the benefit of it’s SPF 40. It looked pretty on my skin initially. But unfortunately this product pils. What a bummer. nan
