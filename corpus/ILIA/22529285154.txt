I really wanted to like this product- seemed like everything I wanted (light coverage + mineral SPF + Niacinamide) but it was not for me. It pilled at first, and I saw others comments to try applying it to a wet face and that helped although it didn’t solve my biggest complaint which was that it totally dried out my skin! Loved the idea but I can’t keep using the product, I think the Vitamin C and Niacinamide might have been to harsh for everyday wear. Great idea, not for me
