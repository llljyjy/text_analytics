Overall, I thought this was an okay multi-tasking product. My skin is oily in the T zone and combo to dry in other areas. I don’t have breakouts, have some hyperpigmentation and enlarged pores. First the positives: I did notice slight brightening and smoothing of the skin from the Vitamin C and Niacinamide. This is similar to other Vitamin C or Niacinamide products I’ve used in the past. The SPF40 is good and protects the skin. I initially thought the color shade would be dark but after applying it, it seems to go on pretty sheer and did not tint my skin at all. The shade might have provided a slight blurring effect but it was hard to tell. In summary, I thought it was an okay product that multi-tasks and makes it easy to get the benefits of Vitamin C/Niacinamide and sunscreen all at once. Product goes on matte and that could be a positive for some and negative for others.Onto the not so great things: The smell. I CANNOT stand the smell that this product has. There’s no artificial scent although I wish there was something to cover up the odor. It’s strong and I don’t feel that it ever goes away. This is the biggest issue I have with it and honestly makes me not want to use it some days. I also don’t really like the feel of the product on my skin after being applied. I feel that it just sits on top of the skin and doesn’t really absorb, making it a product that could not be worn under make up. I don’t wear makeup normally so i usually just wear this and moisturizer and it’s okay, but it definitely feels like I have product sitting on top of my skin. Because of these two reasons, I don’t think I would repurchase this item. I would just stick to using separate vitamin C, Niacinamide, and sunblock products. I may have given this 4 stars if the product didn’t smell so bad, I just couldn’t deal with using this daily and having my face smell like soil or dirt. The price point is pretty high and unfortunately the packaging and product did not feel as high end. Just okay
