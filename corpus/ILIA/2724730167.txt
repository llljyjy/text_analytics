Sign me up for all the serums and vitamins. I liked this product and used it everyday for a month. Somedays I mixed it with moisturizer and that seemed the work best me. It goes on super light and not oily at all. The days I used this with my Ilia foundation I felt more glowy and almost shinier, than days I used with other foundations and powders. I didn’t really see much difference, so I gave this 4 stars. I do like the added vitamins to my skincare routine, but this didn’t blur sun spots or really smooth fine lines noticeably. I do like the brand, and the feel when it goes on. Sign me up for serums!
