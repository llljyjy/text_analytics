I’ve been using this a few weeks or so and I am liking it. No break outs or irritation. It’s light feeling and doesn’t interfere with my makeup. My skin feels and looks more hydrated and has a nice glow while also looking a little more smooth. To be clear, it has no coverage tho it has a bit of a tiny to it....I think that just keeps it from creating a white tint. My only complaint is that the bottle is annoying. I would prefer just a dropper or a dropper bottle. Otherwise, I have really liked this product and it has improved my skin. Make my skin glow and didn't break me out.
