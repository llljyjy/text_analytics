I should start by saying I love everything Ilia and use a few of their products. I was super excited to try this but it really didn’t work for me. First off, the coverage is minimal at best. It’s oily and not moisturizing enough to wear alone so I had to layer with my moisturizer which then negates the tint. If I put it over the moisturizer the serum doesn’t absorb properly. Also, I had to use a lot in order to benefit from the SPF; at this rate it’ll be gone in a week. I appreciate what they were trying to do here but this is just not it. nan
