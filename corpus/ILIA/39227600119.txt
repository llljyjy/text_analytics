ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 in Tone 2 has everything I want.It gives me an instant glow after applying and at the same time  it claims to have SPF 40 that will protect me from sunburn. Because of the tinted feature of this serum it hides some of my skin’s imperfections. (The Tone 2 shade is just right for me) It’s lightweight and no greasy feeling. Most importantly I didn’t experience any irritation while using. *results may vary Has it All!
