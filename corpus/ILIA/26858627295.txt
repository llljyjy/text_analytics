I used the ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide and I really like the idea of it but I just wish it was a little bit better for the price. You really have to follow the directions or it is very oily and even when you shake it really well it still seems a little too oily for my skin. Maybe itâ€™s because I have kind of oily skin to begin with. Ok product
