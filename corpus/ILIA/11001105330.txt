I received this product complimentary from Ilia and PINCHme in exchange for my honest review and I’m so happy with this sunscreen. I’m in my early 40s so my skin is showing signs of aging and sagging, and my once oily skin is now on the drier/combination side, so I’m constantly looking for multi-purpose products that offer a lot of hydration. This sunscreen more of a watery, serum-like texture, no scent I can detect and just a hint of color. It is oil based so the finish is dewy/radiant, and it’s absolutely perfect for me. Someone with oily skin might not like this, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. Also, keep in mind this does not provide any coverage, just a slight tint that fades beautifully, I don’t usually wear foundation (I hate the cakeyness of some formulas) so I prefer to use tinted moisturizers or sunscreens so this product simply meets my needs. Love the ingredients, it feels luxurious and you can tell it’s made with the highest quality ingredients. I’d definitely repurchase this and very much recommend it. My new holy grail
