It’s tough to give a review of the serum itself because the dispenser leaks horribly. When I opened the box it was a goopy oily mess. I decided to give it a chance thinking maybe it got too shuffled around, so i spent some time wiping it all down. Not ten seconds after it looked new, it started leaking again at the seam. I cleaned it up yet again and put it in my cabinet, and an hour later it had leaked so badly that it made a mess there too. Wanting to leave a good review, i tried the product anyway. I don’t like that I can’t rub it into my skin because it piles (as explained in the instructions), but the good is that my boyfriend actually said my skin looked “nicer.“ Overall I’m definitely going back to my old tinted sunscreen moisturizer. This one isn’t worth the trouble. Horrible Packaging
