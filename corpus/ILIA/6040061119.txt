I revived this as a free trial through PinchMe. The product is different to say the least. It’s not my favorite feeling in the world, but it has its pluses.  Slick but not at the same time. Kind of heavy feeling but eventually dries down. I do love the fact that it combines many products into one. I enjoy the little bit of tint it has and actually wish it had more. There’s not much coverage. I wore it stand alone. I wore it to the water and did not get a face sunburn as usual so the spf is there. I did not break out like I do with most oily products either. Interesting.
