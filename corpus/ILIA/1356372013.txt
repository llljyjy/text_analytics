I received from influencer to try for free. I really wanted to like this. A tinted serum with sunscreen is right up my alley! Unfortunately it was a bit greasy, and didnâ€™t do much  I used it daily for about a month and did not see a change, though the tint and sunscreen combination did make me keep using it! The color of the tint was perfect to even out some of my natural redness Did not see a change, but love the tint
