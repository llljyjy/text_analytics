The product itself is runny right out of the dispenser. I made a complete mess attempting to use it. After cleaning my mess, I decided to squirt a small amount on a sponge. The product looks greasy on my face (which is already sort of oily) and it felt “heavy”. I couldn’t really tell there was a tiny so I put a little more on which made my face look “chalky”. Overall, I did not have a great experience with the ILIA Mineral Sunscreen. All reviews are my own. Back to the drawing board
