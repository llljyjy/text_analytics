This is a very comfortable product to use since I don’t wear foundation. There’s no much coverage to be honest but it leaves a glowy appearance to the skin. I like to use it more for its benefits with Vit C and Niacinamide. I received this product as a sample in Tone 2 and it is darker than mi skin but still using from time to time. Lightweight
