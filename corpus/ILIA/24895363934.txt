Overall I really enjoyed both the tone/shade and product consistency. A huge bonus to have a product containing Vitamin C, a Niacinamide and also be a sunscreen. Since this formula is so lightweight, it works well with my concealer - I do tend to use it under my eyes the most. I would recommend this product, give it a try since I was a happy customer and would definitely try other ILIA products in the future. ILIA Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen A+++
