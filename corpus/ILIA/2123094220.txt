So it’s imperative that you shake the bottle before applying, that’s the trick ! I’ve used several other serum foundations but I have to say that I think Ilia feels the lightest but covers the best. I got it in Tone 2 , and I’m a medium light olive skin tone. It blended beautifully and without creasing. I’m.54 and I’ve used alot of foundations , I like that this has SPF and is good for my skin . SPF 40 :)
