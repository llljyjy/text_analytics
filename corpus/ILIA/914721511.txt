I love the brand Ilia and the quality of their products.  However, I did not love this.  I feel like the serum should be separate from SPF because I found it did not fully absorb into my skin, to leave my skin moisturized.  Also, you have to apply precisely the way indicated or you get a gritty texture that cannot be smoothed into skin.  I will continue buying Ilia products because theyâ€™re fantastic but this one missed the mark. Great concept but...
