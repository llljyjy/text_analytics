Feels really smooth on the skin, and sits well under my makeup! I love that it has retinol and sunscreen so it has more benefits for my skin than a normal primer would. The only downside is I feel like I have to use 3 pumps to have enough product to thinly apply all over my face, so I feel that the bottle won’t last very long, which isn’t ideal given the price. But I do believe Ilia products are worth the investment - can’t wait to pair this with my Ilia skin tint! Works well, feels great
