I tried this product  as a promotion for my honest review. I applied facial moisturizer prior to using this product. As I rubbed this product it pilled. I has to take it off. I though it was because of the moisturizer but I tried without and it happened again. If it didn’t pilled, it would be a great product as it looks like it gives a nice glow. I would definitely not spend money on this. I’m glad it was given to me to try. Not what I expected from Ilia.
