I should have read reviews first. 1. This pilled I had to wash my face and reapply with Nothing underneath which is not how I’d wear this. 2. It provides ZERO coverage. I guess I assumed I was getting a sheer to light tinted sunscreen but this provided absolutely no coverage, I guess it just wasn’t white going on? 3. This actually burned my skin a bit upon applying. So disappointed especially for the price so sad
