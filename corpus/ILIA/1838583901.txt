Such an easy addition to my morning routine! A note for pulling - after I apply my moisturizer I wait until my face is dry and then pat this in. It soaks right in with no pulling and leaves a stunning glow. Definitely could be tricky to figure out but 5 stars for the extra moisture and overall radiance my skin has after using it for a month. perfect summer glow
