I was so excited to receive this product. It has all of the qualities that I love in a skincare product. SPF 40, vitamin c and niacinamide - all products that in theory should help you get bright, even skin. Unfortunately this product was a miss for me. The pros are it blends in beautifully - almost too well. You really can’t tell there’s a tint at all. It does work well to balance out any white cast your usual spf would have and if you’re okay with applying sunscreen first and then this product afterwards, like i did, you may love it for that. I had a hard time dispensing the product in my hands however and I feel like for what it is, the price point is way too expensive. nan
