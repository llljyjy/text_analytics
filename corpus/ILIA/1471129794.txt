I received a sample of Ilia Triple Serum in tone 2, and as much as I wanted to like it, I was a little disappointed. So many instructions in order to use it correctly! And even after following directions, I still ended up with a gritty application that was took effort to spread. Iâ€™m sure the product and ingredients themselves are beneficial, but for me, not worth the hassle. nan
