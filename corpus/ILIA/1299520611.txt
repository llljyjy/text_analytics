Loving it after using about a week. Makes skin look great. Not enough time to see a difference in dark spots. However, I notice an improved difference in glow and texture using this under my regular foundation. I definitely need more coverage than this offers even though I thankfully have decent skin. Donâ€™t expect it to cover anything problematic. nan
