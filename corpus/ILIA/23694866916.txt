I really liked this high spf serum. Most facial sunscreens are less than 40 so I’m loving the higher than normal protection. I always apply sunscreen before going outside to keep my face protected. I loved the tint of color it gave me. There was no smell which I liked. It felt weightless and didn’t even know I was wearing it. Cant say enough good things about this product. Very impressed with my results. Impressed
