I love this product. I think most of the bad reviews were referring to the fact it “pills“ which i’ve never noticed and I’ve layered this serum with oils, lotions and tinted moisturizers. And also that it is very light but in my opinion that’s whats so amazing about this product. It letes your natural skin show through which looks dewy and not like you have a cake face and it sets it and makes my skin so soft. I use the ilia tinted moisturizer then pat this on my face (NEVER RUB) and it’s flawless. Will continue to buy until it’s discontinued! Will continue to buy until it's discontinued!
