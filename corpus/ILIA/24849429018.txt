I received the ILIA CBeyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide from Sephora and Pinchme as a complementary sample to try and give my honest opinion. I have never tried a serum like this before, much less one that is tinted. It comes with a lot of instructions but it is so you apply the serum correctly and get maximum results. I don’t like to wear foundation a lot so this was perfect for me. The tint was just enough to help hide the spots I don’t like and the serum really helped give my face a beautiful healthy glow. I would recommend this ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide for anyone to try. A Serum must have!
