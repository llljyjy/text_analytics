I received a full sized product of the ILIAC Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide from PINCHme. I used the serum for two weeks to make sure I was attaining the full benefits of it. I really like how my face looks as it looks silky, and makes me look as if I have light makeup on. Where I live it has been very hot and humid, so I really put it to the test. The only thing I did not like is that my face looked greasy sometimes (I have combined skin). Iâ€™m not sure I will buy it again as it is quite expensive and not enough product. Good Product!
