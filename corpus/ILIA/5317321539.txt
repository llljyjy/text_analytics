I have normal/dry skin and was really intrigued to try a product that was tinted but also had skincare benefits. When first applying it, it’s definitely more liquid than I’m used to and has a dewy/glowy finish. The tiny is very light coverage but I honestly liked that aspect of it for more natural days. Overall really enjoyed. nan
