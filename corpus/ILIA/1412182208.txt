This product is basically a sheer, silky feeling sunscreen. It feels like I have to pump it a lot to get enough product to cover my face, so not sure how long it will last. It doesn’t have any coverage to speak of, an almost completely natural look with a hint of color. I use it under foundations that don’t have any form of sunscreen already incorporated. It made my eye area burn and itch the first time I applied it, so I’m careful not to put it in that area that anymore. No other irritation to speak of on the rest of my face. nan
