I was given ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40 for free from PinchMe for my honest review. After reading the instructions and making sure that I filled them to the point I was very disappointed when it started peeling after it started drying off. I waited for about 2 min to put makeup on and it just peeled on me. I liked that it was smooth with the application and not sticky. I tried it a few other times and it did the same. I don’t know what I am doing wrong but I haven’t been able to keep it without peeling. I loved the idea that it had spf 40 which is something I look for to protect me from the sunlight, but very disappointment with my outcome. It peeled off!!
