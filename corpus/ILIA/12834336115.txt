I received this product as a free sample for my honest review. I was soo excited about this one because I am lover of ILIA products and I use a C Serum and Tinted SPF every day. This product combines those things - the holy grail!! However, I was not impressed with the coverage (not much), the feel (oily), the application (do NOT rub it in your hands or it will pill) or the dispenser (wasnâ€™t sure how much to use?? came out weird??). In theory, this would be a great product and time saver, but I will stick with my separate C Serum and Tinted SPF for now. With the price point I would not buy or recommend. Too Good to be True
