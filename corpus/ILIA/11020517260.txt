This is SPF Serum with a light tint, this will not replace foundation, but it will even out the complexion a little. You need to shake well before use, it is not always convenient when you are in a hurry, but I am used to such similar sunscreens. After application, the face looks a little greesy and this shine can be removed with matting powder or left as is, but if you have oily skin, it is better to use powder after application. It does not absorb quickly and leaves a feeling of presence on the skin throughout the day. Yes, this product protects well from the sun, my dark spots do not darken, and my face does not sunburn. Nice packaging and interesting tube. And I also liked the composition of this product and the fact that it does not clog my pores, unlike many sunscreens. nan
