To start off let me just say maybe it’s just me… BUT… I honestly haven’t had the best of luck with products from this brand. However, I went into trying this product with an open mindset and full optimism. The packaging is nice and sleek. Easy to pump the product out it comes pretty standard to other items packaged this way. I did one pump and applied evenly across my face with my fingers and I used my fingers/hand to also rub the product in afterwards I used a brush to make sure everything had applied evenly. I have COMBO/OILY skin and this product just made me feel even oilier and I even let it sit for a few minutes to see if it would maybe become less oily or ? My face felt super heavy and oily  after letting it sit. So I decided to go on with a powder on top and I still had the same results my face felt very heavy and oily. I had to instantly take this off. I can say I’m not a fan at all Big Nope.
