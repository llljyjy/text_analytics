APPLY TO DAMP SKIN!   I wanted to like this product but it was peeling like crazy every time I applied it.  I see a lot of reviews have the same feedback.  I have never taken a product back to Sephora but I was about to take this one back.   This morning I thought I would give it one more try and it dawned on me.  This product has hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid should always be applied to damp skin or it peels.   So I applied this serum to damp skin, just like in would do with a hyaluronic acid serum, and it worked!   It went on really smoothly, soaked in really quickly, and had no peeling whatsoever.  I hope this helps! APPLY TO DAMP SKIN
