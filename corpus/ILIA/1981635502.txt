I didn’t have any issues with pulling when using this product because I followed the instructions. However I feel like if s product is this finicky it may turn off some ppl from using it. I wasn’t s fan of the scent. It smelled sort cinnamony to me, which is not a scent a would typically associate with makeup or skincare. At that point I would prefer it to be unscented. I also wasn’t a fan of how oily it felt. I tried using less and leaving it to absorb longer but my skin always felt super oily. The shade had a bit of s reddish undertone which didn’t match my skin tone and made me look flushed and like I was wearing a mask. I don’t think the product worked for me or my needs but it was very moisturizing and there are 3 shades so it might work for others. Not for me
