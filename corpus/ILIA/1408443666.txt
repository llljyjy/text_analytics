This ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Sunscreen is quite unique. I had never tried a sunscreen like this so it took me a little while to get accustomed with the application process. Made with Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Allantoin this is one supercharged SPF. I love that it has a tint to it too. You have to shake, shake, shake to ensure the formula is well blended before dispensing. Then gently tap it into your skin for a flawless application. I totes love that I am treating my skin while protecting it. I really like this sunscreen but wish it came in a larger size. Since I apply sunscreen daily, this goes pretty quickly. Because I have combination to oily skin I prefer to wear this when Iâ€™m not wearing a heavy foundation on top. This sunscreen is da bomb and I definitely recommend it. Unique SPF
