i liked the product, but it really wasn’t worth the high price of 64 dollars. i didn’t experience pilling like a lot of users of this product did, but it did leave my face feeling oily after a short period of time. also, I don’t like that the pump only dispenses a small amount of product when using. i did like that the formula includes vitamin c and niacinamide, but I didn’t like how (like most high-end sunscreens are on the market) isn’t waterproof. lastly, I did enjoy that the tint actually had somewhat of an skin tone-evening property to it and the coverage is pretty decent for just a tinted sunscreen.  in all, the product is alright, but nothing mind-blowing enough to spend 64 dollars. overpriced, but overall decent
