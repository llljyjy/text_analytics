I was so excited for this product….a clean beauty, moisturizer & SPF 40 all in one, I think it was brilliant & couldn’t wait to have it. It was very disappointing! First of all the packaging is way smaller then I expected, it says 1 oz but I have the Skin Serum tint which seems way bigger then this. The coverage is sheer, but I was expecting that & was planning on wearing it under foundation anyway, but you need 6-7 pumps of this to even fully cover the face to have enough SPF on there, which means this will be empty really fast! Lastly, I didn’t like the consistency at all. It felt grainy going in the face & it was very oily. All these negative factors do not justify the high price, so I returned it. Go with the Skin Serum Tint. It’s so much better for way less. It’s one of my top favorites & I already repurchased that one twice. Save your money & pass on this. Huge Disappointment
