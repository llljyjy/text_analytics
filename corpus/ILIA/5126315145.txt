I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out. And my thoughts are i think for a mineral sunscreen it’s well. I went to a 3 day beach festival and all i wore was this and some cream blush, i didn’t reapply at all all day and i didn’t get sunburned. My face was even out, the texture is smooth but not like a hand cream smooth it was more on the matte side. Of course at the end of the night you have to wash it off since it does have a tint to it. If you like very minimum makeup look and want to stay protected from the sun then this will work for you. I don’t believe it’s transfer proof since i did have my face on my Bf’s shirt since it was raining and I was covering my face on his body, and didn’t see any residue nan
