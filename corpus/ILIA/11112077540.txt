I have been using the ILIAC Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide for a few weeks now and I’m loving the extra hydration. I went to Florida for a week and the sun was intense. I loved that I could add this into my daily routine and not be worried about my skin getting fried. I noticed a huge difference in hydration, sun protection and how easy it is to take off. I didn’t have to worry about my skin feeling oily or dry. I would definitely keep this in my skin routine. Use it daily
