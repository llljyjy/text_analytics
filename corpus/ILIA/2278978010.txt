It’s important to read the instructions with this product. It has very sheer and minimal coverage so you will want to wear foundation over it depending on the look you’re going for. It has a nice feel on the skin and is fairly natural feeling. The applicator is easy to use. I like the addition of niacinamide for skin health. Overall nice product just was hoping for a bit more coverage (I am fair skinned). Nice sunscreen
