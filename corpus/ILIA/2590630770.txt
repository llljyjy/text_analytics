I received this product from Influenster to test.  I really enjoyed this product!  I’ve been looking for a weightless non-greasy everyday sunscreen, at this fit the bill!  I have normal, leaning to dry fair skin with loads of freckles (and more likely sun spots).  Although it’s “tinted” it gives no coverage, but that isn’t what I was looking for anyway.  It’s SUPER lightweight, glides on the skin and sinks in quickly so you’re not left feeling greasy & sticky.  Plays well alone & under makeup.  I like the added benefits of the vitamin c, although couldn’t say after only using it for one month if it did anything to my skin.  I will continue to use and would definitely consider repurchasing! SUPER lightweight  Everyday SPF!
