I don’t quite know how I feel as of yet. I love the idea of this product however they definitely need something between 2 & 3. I ended up getting tone 3 however I am somewhere between 2 and 3 so 3 noticeably gives my skin a slightly darker hue. It’s not drastic but it’s noticeable to me because I know my skin and it makes me look off. I want to try tone 2 but at the price point I won’t be purchasing an additional bottle just to test it. The texture is very runny which I like but the application is weird. It goes on smooth and distributes evenly but then it’s oily but not… lol It doesn’t feel oily on the skin (my skin doesn’t feel clogged) but looks it very shiny and feels oily to the touch for a minute. I’m not sure if I’m putting on enough to get the full benefit of the spf however I wouldn’t put on any more product than I am because of the oily look. Eventually it does settle into more of a glow and less of an oil slick. Also Until it settles in the tint is absolutely transferable so be careful of that and I wouldn’t bring it down to my neck because of that. Another reason why I’m kind of bummed about the color being slightly off. Outside of all of that I haven’t full blown tested the spf factor but it seems to be ok with a  regular day in Florida. mixed feelings
