I received a free bottle from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try this as I’ve never tried anything like this before. I followed the directions and shook the bottle really well, turned it upside down and applied it to my palm so I can dab it on my face. It’s very watery because it’s basically oil and powder. This went on very smoothly as I dabbed it on my skin but it took forever to absorb! It made my face very greasy, but once it was finally absorbed, my skin was really smooth. I did not like washing this off though because as soon as I put water on my face, I could feel the residue from it. It made me break out a little bit and I really didn’t notice much of a difference. I looked sweaty with this on, not a very attractive look. I would not buy this, especially at this price. I can look sweaty all by myself. nan
