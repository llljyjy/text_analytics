Ilia’s C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide is a great face sunscreen. Despite having zinc oxide as the active ingredient, I didn’t notice any residual white cast; the “tone“ (which doesn’t impart color like a CC cream or foundation would) might help with negating that.The hydrating formula is SPF 40 and absorbs quickly, without leaving a noticeable layer (of grease, color, etc.) on my skin. If you follow the instructions, it blends in easily without pilling.My only complaint is this sunscreen serum has a noticeable scent. nan
