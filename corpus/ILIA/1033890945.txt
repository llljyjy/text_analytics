I love my serums and was very excited to try this one. Especially since it has a tint to it.  I love that it has SPF 40 in it. It goes on very smooth and disappears into the skin like advertised. I wear it under make up because even though it is tinted it doesnâ€™t cover like a foundation. SPF with sheer tint
