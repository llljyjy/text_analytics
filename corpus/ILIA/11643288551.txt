Oh Em Gee!! the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum was the best discovery of the SUMMER for me! What a game changer for brutal Texas summers. I’ve learned to just accept that in order to protect my face when we’re out and about, I had to sacrifice a bit of the looks aspect because every product I’ve tried leaves a wide range of whitecast on my face, but safety first so I just dealt with it and try to ignore it. But this?! This was amazing! it feels light and nice on my face and ZERO white residue! I absolutely love it and it will become a must for my makeup/skincare bag. Whitecast? what's that?
