I like the spf in this and the Dewey coverage it leaves you with.  I do highly recommend following the instructions on how to apply it.  It will leave you with a slightly greasy feeling.  I didnâ€™t get the pilling issue but it did feel greasy no matter how applied.  I liked it for certain occasions though just not everyday. Pinchme Ilia review
