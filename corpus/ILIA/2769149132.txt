I tried this on my skin, it did make my skin feel kind of dry. Since it’s serum, sunscreen, tinted & has vitamin C which is good for daytime use only. I not sure I like the tinted part since wasn’t much coverage. I still had to put my foundation on. I prefer no tint. It didn’t really make my skin glow but like that it was multiple use. Multiple use
