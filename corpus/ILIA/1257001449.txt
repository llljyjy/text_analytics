I am so happy with this productâ€¦ perfect for a day by the pool when you want SPF with coverage. It has a natural finish and is hydrating. I do agree with other reviews that it does require a decent amount of product to get complete coverage/protection. The consistency is pretty thin so I need 3 or 4 pumps for my whole face. Given the price point I can see how this is off putting for some. Overall I find this product high quality and useful and I would definitely repurchase. nan
