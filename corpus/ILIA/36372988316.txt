I recieved this free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoyed this tinted serum with SPF 40 to give my skin a more even looking skin tone as well as saving my skin from harmful UV Rayâ€™s. You must shake this product really good to mix it all up then only pat on your skin do not rub or pilling will happen.  Great for dry, combination skin like mine. It didnt break out my skin or clog my pores which I loved. The feeling on my skin is smooth and soft and not heavy at all like some do. Great Serum with SPF40
