I received this product as a free sample. I got excited because it could be a must-have in my routine. First time I used I noticed I should shake it well to get better result. Iâ€™m not 100 % satisfied because the smell is weird, my three years old kid hate the smell. If you look for a tinted sunscreen you should buy a tone more dark because it got translucid in my skin. Overall the idea is great, just need to improve the smell in my opnion. Good product
