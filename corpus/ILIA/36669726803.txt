First time trying this product I liked that it protected my skin from the sun but also noticed that it does make you look a bit bronze depending on the shade you buy I got tone 2 it does leave your skin kinda matte which I don’t mind because my skin is oily. But I don’t think I would rebuy it again just because I wasn’t in love with the product and how it was making my skin getting darker Tone 2
