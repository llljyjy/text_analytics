I recieved this product from PinchMe in exchange for an honest review. To be honest, I hate the product, It does not absorb well and leaves my skin feeling greasy and heavy. It may work for some but it’s just not something I’d but more of... and at the price point of $65? Way too much. The scent is also really gross and smells like old foundation. Not a fan of this product
