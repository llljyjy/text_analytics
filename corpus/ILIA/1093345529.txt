I was so excited for this product that I bought it as soon as it was available and it’s a disappointment. It is very, very dry and I can’t figure out how you can get this on your face under a moisturizer (which I assume is what you should do). I have to apply a bit of face oil first just to be able to sort of pat it on. It’s very drying, even though it doesn’t look it (which is good). But the worst thing is that it balls up on my face. I haven’t noticed any benefit from using it for three weeks or so. I love Ilia’s makeup but their skincare never works for me. Ineffective, balls up on face, difficult to apply
