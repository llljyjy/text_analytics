I received a sample from Pinchme, didn’t have any issues with pilling. I have oily/combination skin. I followed the directions and tried it several ways with different types if foundations, very happy with the results each time. Don’t expect coverage just a natural glow and hydration, even under full coverage makeup. Very happy with it. Love the glow
