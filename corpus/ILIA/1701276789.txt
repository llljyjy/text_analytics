Ok. So you SERIOUSLY have to read and abide by the directions in order to apply this serum correctly. At first I rubbed it in like a moisturizer and it piled. :( Then I read verbatim the directions and it was better but i was expecting atleast a deeper tint sort of like a tinted moisturizer. This is more of an underlay primer before applying actual makeup. I was more so hoping that it would be something that I could get away with to wear to work as a light tinted barrier inside of a full face of makeup to mask a blank face. It is not unfortunately but that’s my fault for misunderstanding the premise of the product. But it is very confusing that it comes in 3 different shades when the shade doesn’t show up. At. All. Not even a hint. So that’s the reason I left out two stars. It is lightweight, smells pleasant and effective but it is literally shaded for no good reason and that steered my wrong. READ THE DIRECTIONS!
