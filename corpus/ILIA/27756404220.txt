I received this product as a free sample from PinchMe.  I love easy it is to apply once you figure out how the bottle dispenses. I had no issue with pilling. Great to wear under your make up or alone.  I love it has great SPF protection and doesnâ€™t smell horrible like some products with SPF.  My only small complaint is I wish it was a little more moisturizing.  You can wear with another oil based moisturizer if your skin is drier. Overall  I was very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it! Love this product!
