This is a lovely product. I loved the way it looked on my skin and how easily it applied. I deducted one star because I didn’t like the smell - it’s fragrance free but I detected a slight metallic smell that didn’t go away and bothered me. So I returned the product because it wasn’t usable if time. But seriously give this one a try! It’s was truly beautiful in my skin and I really wish it had worked out!! lovely finish!
