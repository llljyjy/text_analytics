First off, I would say - read the instructions and make sure to follow it! I had issues with piling even when I let a lot of time lapse between products. Then I read to not rub it in and that changed everything. I make sure to put plenty all over the face and pat it in. I don’t use makeup over my sunscreen, so I appreciate that it feels light. I don’t feel like it’s cakey at the end of the day. It also has a nice shine that makes my face look bright. Overall, I’m a fan. nan
