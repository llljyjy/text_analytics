The Ilia C Beyon Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% and Niacinamide sounds like a great product. I was very excited to try a tinted mineral sunscreen to use when Iâ€™m out hiking. The coverage is minimal or light. I did not see any full coverage at all and the tinted sunscreen would break throughout the day. I could see bits of the color seeping into my pores. I did like the application first because of how light it felt on my skin. I did use this only on my finger tips and gently pat it on my face. I did not like that I could not use a brush because it would pill. I do think if you try to use makeup over it, it will pill or break during the day. I think this is more of a stand alone product for sunscreen with a tinted color. I did like the added sun protection and some ingredients that help keep skin from sunburn or discoloration. nan
