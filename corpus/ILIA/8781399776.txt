I received a free trail of of this sunscreen. This is my honest review. I absolutely fell in love with this the moment it touched my skin. It leaves the skin so dewy & glowing. This definitely isnâ€™t for someone with oily skin. I really like the pump application instead of the traditional squeeze. If you have dull dry skin. This sunscreen is for you. You definitely need to follow the instructions when applying. I actually use a dense foundation brush. Then let it fully dry. Love!
