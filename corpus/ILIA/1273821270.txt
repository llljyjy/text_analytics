Disappears into the skin. Its really light. During the summer my skin on my face starts to ct up because of sunscreen (I play beach volleyball) but I havenâ€™t had any flare up using this. I have suggested this to all my friends that spend a lot of time outside. Sunscreen with coverage and no breakouts!
