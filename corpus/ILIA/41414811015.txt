I tried the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF Mineral Sunscreen from Ilia and PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. Since I work in the hospital setting, I do not have a whole lot of time to focus on my skin care routine in the mornings. In addition, I do not really wear that much make up (only an eyeshadow and mascara). So, I cannot give a good review on how this product does with make-up on top of it. However, I truly love this serum for my minimal make up face routine. It hydrates my skin while giving me a healthy glow that does not make my face feel oily. While it does have zinc oxide as a sunscreen, the tint in the serum does a really nice job blending it into my skin- no white spots, no awkward looking residue. Application does take some minimal effort. I do have to shake the product really well. The ingredients naturally separate. In order to have it blend well, I would recommend shaking it at least 15-20 times. It does have a certain smell to it, I would say maybe a slight cinnamon scent?? Some of the tint rubs off on my face mask by the end of the day. A little goes a long wayâ€¦ The first time I tried it, I looked like a glazed donut because I put too much on. I would definitely recommend this product to those looking who get up and go in the am, and are looking for a quick, easy skin routine with amazing ingredients. A good, natural serum
