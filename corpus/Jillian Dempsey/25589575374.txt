This is a life savior for those struggling with puffiness in the mornings! I’ve tried a bunch of different face massaging devices and this one is my favorite so far! It was super easy to use (but don’t forget a serum or a face oil), I use it 3-4 times a week, usually in the mornings and I can see how much better my face is looking, my cheekbones are more sculptured and there is a lot less puffiness. Definitely recommend! nan
