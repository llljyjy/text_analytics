What a cool product added to my skin care routine. It’s very durable and luxurious. I can tell that it’s well made and made to last. I also like that I can just pop in a new AA battery once it dies down, I also really like that it’s 24K gold. It’s really relaxing to use and does ease my facial tension. I have to hide it from my husband otherwise he would steal it lol.. it feels amazing!!!! I hope to see my face look more toned after using it constantly. nan
