I have been using the Gold Sculpting Bar by Jillian Dempsey on my face for a couple of weeks. It’s pretty fancy containing 24k gold and you can feel the heft of it in your palm. I use it in conjunction with a serum and enjoy the feeling of the vibrations. The messaging motions of this bar are intended to relax tension, as well as tone/lift. While it’s a little premature to tell more long term effects, my skin looks a bit improved following each session of use. I will continue to help release tension and improve my appearance. nan
