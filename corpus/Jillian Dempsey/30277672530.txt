I love this little vibrating bar! It’s so great to help depuffing in the morning which helps define the contours of my face by helping drain the water retention! I like using this after my moisturizer since I don’t use oils but still need it to glide across my face. The only down side is that when I use it anywhere near my nose it makes my nose tickle and I sneeze haha! 10/10 would recommend though! Such a fun tool to incorporate into your routine! nan
