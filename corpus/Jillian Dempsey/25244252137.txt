The Jillian Dempsey Gold Sculpting Bar is an expertly designed beauty tool that is plated with 24K gold. It is a T-shaped tool that fits into the curves and outlines of the face perfectly. It works to lift, tone, and contour the face instantly. The massaging mechanism helps to alleviate tension and stress in the skin. The gold metal has a cooling effect to soothe the skin. It feels very relaxing and refreshing on the skin as well. I like to use it in the morning to reduce puffiness and at night to release tension as well as for lymphatic drainage. It is easy to use, sleek, quiet, and modern. Included is a carrying pouch and a double AA battery. nan
