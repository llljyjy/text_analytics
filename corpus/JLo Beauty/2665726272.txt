At first glance this seemed like it would be an exciting skincare option. The packaging is elegant, and the treatment goes on smooth with no irritation and a light scent.Unfortunately when it said resurfacing I was expecting a J Lo glow, not changing from my normal skin to a teen breakout nightmare. I was fine for 2 days, and then broke out into a ton of tiny whiteheads. I tried the treatment for a full week, and my skin continued to worsen as I used the treatment (and nothing else had changed in my skincare routine). Once I stopped it took a full week for my skin to return to normal.Try a sample first - this may work for some folks, but for me it was comedogenic and a skin nightmare. Comedogenic
