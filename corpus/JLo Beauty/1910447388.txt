First off, I have been wanting to try these products for awhile. I love this set because it’s perfect for just that, seeing if you like it. I also love the packaging. The tubs and bottle look very nice on my vanity. Now for the nitty gritty part. The serum is lovely. It absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave a residue on my fingers and no noticeable scent. The eye cream is light and creamy and also absorbs quickly. It feels rich and luxurious. I enjoy using both those products and would consider continuing to use them. My skin feels replenished and has a nice glow and texture after. Now The Blockbuster cream is a totally different story.  The contents of this particular tub were not creamy at all. You almost have to spackle it on and it doesn’t blend in as easily as the other products. It’s a bit thick and applying it is not as pleasant as the other products. Overall, 2 out of 3 products are great. love it, but…
