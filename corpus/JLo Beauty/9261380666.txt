That JLO glow serum The packaging is very eye catching. The serum itself is a nice consistency, so spreads easily.  I like the clean fresh scent. It is very slight which is nice. I cannot say that I noticed much of a difference in my skin  after using for about 2 weeks.  So I wouldnâ€™t really recommend. Nice product , but does it work
