I received this cream free of charge from #influenster and #jlobeauty as part of a #voxbox campaign, in return for my honest review.Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this cream!  It’s light, creamy, not greasy, yet hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves no residue. It does not have any fragrance. My absolute favorite part about it, is the way it makes your eye area feel right after application. It’s as if your eyes were more awake, firmer, more rested. It’s a spa experience in a jar!As per Jlo website, the key ingredients in this formula are peptides, blurring complex, and sugar-derived tightening matrix. I also noticed that it contains caffeine, which I love in an eye cream! The formula is designed to blur dark circles, improve the look of fine lines and wrinkles, tighten and lift immediately.I definitely agree that you can feel the lifting right after application, and it feels great. I think it’s definitely worth a longer-term try to see what the long-term benefits are like. It is on a pricier side at about $48 for 1/2 ounce of product, however, you need such a tiny amount of the product that I would expect it to last a very long time. Feels so good!
