This eye cream is nice. I would say the skin under my eye is normal type. I prefer to use this as part of my night time skincare routine just because itâ€™s on the creamier side. If you have dry or mature under eye, you might enjoy this during the daytime as a primer before applying concealer. If you have sensitive skin, note that this not fragrance-free. nan
