I received this product complimentary from Influenster, but my review is my honest opinion. I definitely like this eye cream, so moisturizing, perfect for aging, dry and sensitive skin. Perfect for winter months, it doesn’t make my eyes puffy in the morning, it doesn’t have any scent. Probably won’t be a perfect fit for oily skin. Perfect eye cream for dry skin
