I have tried so many serums and there are plenty I like but this one is my absolute favorite. I received a sample of it and noticed a huge change within a few days. I never thought I’d pay $80 for a serum but it really is that good so I bought the full size. I also find a little goes a long way. I’m in my early 40’s and my skin has become much drier with age and this really replenishes it and leave my face so so soft and evened out the textur. Highly recommend Worth every penny
