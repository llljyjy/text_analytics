I received this set from Influenster. I was excited to try this set but I’m disappointed. It doesn’t quite match my skincare needs. The eye cream and moisturizer are too thick and rich for my skin. My skin clogs easily if products are too thick and unfortunately that’s what happened here. The serum seems nice the light on the skin. I haven’t seen any improvement in my skin though. Overall, a dud for me. nan
