The previous moisturizer I’ve been using was working well, but pricey, and was looking for a replacement. I have super dry skin so I need something super moisturizing. When I used this for the first, the cream felt nice and thick, but when I wake up, I was deeply disappointed. I’d wake up in the morning with my skin feeling tight and dry. This isn’t the right substitute for me. Not a great cream for super dry skin.
