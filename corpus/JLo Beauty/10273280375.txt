This eye cream is amazing. Smells wonderful. Does what it says. Very light and you don’t need a lot- goes on amazing under makeup - I use Guerlin foundation- usually eye creams are too thick and take forever to met in.  Not this stuff and it Does NOT pill and in fact is probably the best consistency for an eye cream I’ve ever seen. Note aside: for those that are seeing “pilling” with this or any other cream or makeup- 99.9% of the time it’s because of the condition of your skin, rather than the product. Make sure you prep skin well (wash/exfoliate, toner, serum) before applying any moisturizer or eye creams. love love love
