I am on my 4th jar!!! I love this moisturizer..  At first the texture was a bit odd I thought but who cares, I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. I am 50 years old, normal/dry  skin and this makes my skin look youthful.  It does not feel greasy/ heavy or tacky.  I have tried nearly everything and this is hands down my favorite. nan
