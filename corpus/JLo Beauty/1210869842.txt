This cream is super rich and feels really nice. The packaging is super pretty! It looks great on my counter. You get a decent amount of product too, I think it will last a long time. I haven’t noticed a major change in any fine lines but it may not have been long enough. I will say that my eye skin feels healthy and more moisturized and less delicate/crepey. I’m going to keep using it! Thick and moisturizing!
