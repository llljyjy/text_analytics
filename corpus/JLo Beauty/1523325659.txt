Pros: Pleasant smell, gentle cleansing, non-drying.Con: The cap does not seal well. When stored upright (cap-side down), I had a good amount of product leak out. I have to store this with the cap upright to prevent it from leaking out even when fully capped. If the product was packaged in a better container to prevent the product from leaking out, then I may reconsider purchasing. Overall, I think it’s a decent cleanser but I think there are several comparable clean cleansers at the same price point that are gentle, and have the hydrating benefits of squalane. Not to mention equal cleansers that don’t have issues with the product container itself. I would rate this higher if it weren’t for the faulty container design. No one wants to spend $38 on a product only to see it leak out on your counter. Decent cleanser, but product container defective
