I’ve always felt when products say resurfacing it’s a bit gimmicky- for me.  My skin is pretty textured so I wasn’t sure what to expect.  After using for a month, I saw great results.  No product has made my skin look smooth like this one.  My skin is clearer and more even.  I love her line and have been using it since the launch- but this has now become my favorite.  I purchased from her site but am waiting patiently until the launch on Sephora to stock back up.  I did not get any freebies here- just an honest review from a skincare junkie! holy grail night serum
