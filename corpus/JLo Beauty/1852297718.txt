I think this could be a solid moisturizer for people with dry skin, but I have combination skin and it felt way too heavy. It is moisturizing, but doesn’t seem to absorb very well and leaves me feeling greasy. I also really don’t like the scent; it smells almost like sunscreen, and it lingers on my skin. Overall it’s not terrible, but absolutely nothing special, especially for the price. nan
