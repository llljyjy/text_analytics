[ I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review ] First, let’s start with the packaging... ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! It looks so luxurious. They did a wonderful job with designing and making this products packaging. It’s very soft feeling putting it under my eyes. A little bit goes a very long way, so you’ll definitely get a lot of use out of this. It makes under my eyes brighter, softer and honestly, younger looking. I am loving this product so much! There is no nasty scent at all to it, which I’m so happy about. I highly recommend and will be purchasing this product in the near future. Thank you Influenster and JLO Beauty!
