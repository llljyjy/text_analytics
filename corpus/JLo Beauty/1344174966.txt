I received this complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  First off, I thought the packaging was beautiful, but once I held it, and used the product a few times, I realized how cheap and wasteful it is, and it is often difficult to get the cap back on, it feels very poorly made, I would’ve preferred simple glass packaging that could’ve been recycled.  As for the product itself, I didn’t expect to like it as much as I do.  It’s very thick and rich, but soaks in completely almost immediately.  I love that I can use it during the day and it won’t make my concealer slide around.  It’s thick enough to give me a nice occlusive barrier at night, without getting all over my pillowcase.  It also doesn’t seem to cause any milia, which many other eye creams seem to cause me.  I will say it’s rather expensive, and it hasn’t transformed my eyes or anything, but it’s one of the nicest user experiences I’ve ever had with an eye cream and will continue to use it until I find something better One of the best I’ve tried
