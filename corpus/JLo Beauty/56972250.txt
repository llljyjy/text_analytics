On the positive side I did really like the packaging for this eye cream. Itâ€™s pretty heavy and luxurious. On the negative side this eye cream was too heavy for my eye area. I ended up with milia in my eye area from using this eye cream. I would have preferred a pump packaging too for sanitary reasons as I dislike jars and dipping my fingers or wasting a spoon dipping into they eye cream. Heavy and gave me milia
