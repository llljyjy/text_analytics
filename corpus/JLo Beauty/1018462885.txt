I really thought this would be just another gimmicky, celebrity line until I tried it. I really ended up loving this cleanser and many other products in this line (not the spf moisturizer since that made my face pill up). I experienced what several others did with this cleanser when they stored it cap end down (leakage). I would love it if they would start making this in a pump! Aside from that it is a very gentle and hydrating cleanser that left my face feeling clean and soft with a nice subtle fragrance. It did not strip my skin, so many cleaners do. It also didnâ€™t break me out. I highly recommend this cleanser! Can we get this in a pump?
