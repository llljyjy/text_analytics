Swapped this into my routine when I ran out of my regular vitamin C serum and I’m pleasantly surprised!! Tbh I was iffy as there’s always doubt if you’re just paying for the name from a “celebrity” brand. I had a hormonal pimple that showed up, was getting some dry patches from my tretinoin, as well as some rosacea flaring up. I swapped this in for my vit C and use it morning with the Sulwhasoo first care serum and a moisturizer, and all three problems were gone in a week! Nice texture and absorbs into the skin very well, not sticky and no pilling with other products. I’m a doubter no more! Pleasantly surprised!
