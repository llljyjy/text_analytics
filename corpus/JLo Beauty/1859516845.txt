I usually steer clear of celebrity cosmetic lines, but I must say that this one impressed me. Glamorous packaging is the first plus! And peptides? Yes, please!!! Creamy and smooth formula and does not cause any irritation to my sensitive eyes. Moisturizing with a tiny amount! Need further use to determine long term results. But, altogether a good product! Beautiful  packaging!
