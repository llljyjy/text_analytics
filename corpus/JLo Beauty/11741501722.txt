This is a very nice moisturizer. My skin is very picky about creams, and I did not really expect anything from the small size I got in the Sephora favorites kit, but I really, really enjoyed it. This cream does has almost no scent, sinks in the skin immediately, but provides a great level of hydration. I would say itâ€™s not the best choice for winter and for super dry skin, but for my combination skin it worked. Applied after hydrating serum it gave wonderful effect. However. I do have to say, that $80 CAD for 50 mil is way too much, you can find something much cheaper and get the same effect. nan
