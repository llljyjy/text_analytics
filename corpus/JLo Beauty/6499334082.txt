I am a skincare junkie. I was looking for a hydration serum to replace my tried and true DE serum. The sales lady suggested this box and after applying the product and walking around the store I was sold on it. All three items are nice, little to no smell, hydrate very well without making me look greasy. The packaging is Luxurious and makes it fun to use. I highly recommend. redhead friendly
