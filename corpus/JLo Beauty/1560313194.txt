I got this serum compliments of Influenster and was excited to try it. After using it for nearly a month, I saw no visible change or glow.  In the end I donâ€™t think I was an ideal candidate for this serum. I applied on clean and dry skin and the product absorbed nicely. There was no fragrance which was nice and the consistency allowed for a nice application. But at the end, there was no difference in my skin. Moreover the packaging was terrible. It was an overuse of plastic. There is only 1 oz of product packaged it what would seem like 5 ouces of plastic. That was also a big turn off. Not ideal for everyone
