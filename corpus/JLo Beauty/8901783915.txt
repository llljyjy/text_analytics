I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. First of all, this doesn’t break me out. I’ve been having an issue with skincare lately ruining my skin. This is a very liquidy formula and it sinks into the skin pretty fast. It doesn’t have a tacky feeling. I didn’t smell any scent but I had Corona so I really don’t know if It really has one. I think the price is a little bit too high for this. It does what it says it supposed to do and leaves the skin looking really pretty. The thing is, I cover it up with makeup anyways, so the glow doesn’t matter so much as I use a separate glow product under my foundation that shows through, this doesn’t show through my makeup on its own. Good product!
