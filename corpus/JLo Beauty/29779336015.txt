I loved this product. The sheet is generously saturated with serum and my skin actually glowed after using it. My skin was supple and well moisturized for several days after using this mask. I would recommend to anyone needing a boost of hydration and wanting “that JLo Glow!“I am 40 years old with a few minor wrinkles. I have sensitive combination skin. I used these masks during the winter when my skin was dry and aggravated from wind and temperature changes. Made my skin supple, dewy, and glowing!
