Out of this set, my favorite product is the eye cream. I have consistently used it since it first hit the market. Although there’s some debate surrounding the efficacy & need of eye creams, I believe that this product has helped reduce puffiness & dark circles around my eyes. A little goes a long way, it’s easily absorbed & it’s fragrance free. Likewise, the glow serum is fragrance free as well. I love how it is loaded with antioxidants, & skin nourishing ingredients. I cannot really determine whether it has tightening properties or not because my skin hasn’t reached that stage yet. However, people have complimented my complexion. The wonder cream is quite lovely too. It has a nice whipped buttery consistency. It locks in moisture which I’m not surprised given the hyaluronic acid, shea butter, squalane, and peptides. Generally speaking, Jlo Beauty, has really awesome ingredients. Despite this, I think the cream would be perfect if it was fragrance free. But to be honest, the fragrance is quite subtle and it has a pleasant floral aroma. All in all, this is definitely a great set with great value. My 3 favorite products at a great value.
