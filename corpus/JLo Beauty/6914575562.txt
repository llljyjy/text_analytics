I received this product from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I am 48 years old, I have combination skin, I have tried many eye contour creams.  My main concern is to prevent wrinkles, remove dark circles and puffiness that sometimes happens. I liked the very glamorous packaging of this cream, the texture is light, it has a pleasant smell.  I did not like to use it under makeup, it needs more moisture because when applying the makeup base it does not help to look hydrated, I think it is more suitable to be used at night.  I used it for a little over two weeks, I did not see any changes in any of my concerns. Low hydration not suitable for use under makeup
