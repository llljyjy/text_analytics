This @jlo beauty duo was sent to me for free via @influenster in exchange for my honest reviews. The moment I opened the #voxbox I was impressed by the luxurious gold and clear packaging! I’m a sucker for packaging and these are too gorgeous!  Personally, I’m not into celebrity skin care lines bc I feel like oftentimes it’s all hyped up but got all excited for this. An ultra moisturizing eye cream with patented peptides  I’m always on the hunt for a good one that wont cause milia. This JLo fresh take eye cream has a silky texture that glides on my under eye and spread smoothly. Helped in keeping my under eye moisturized & i noticed some subtle plumping effect. No eye irritation and I did not develop any new milia. Luxury packaging, moisturizing
