This cream felt so luxurious! It was thick, emoliant, unscented, felt like a top of the line product. It was easy to apply and absorbed nicely, but still left the skin under my eyes feeling extremely moisturized. I noticed plumping, smoothing, and hydration. The packaging was beautiful and also felt luxurious. Luxury and function!
