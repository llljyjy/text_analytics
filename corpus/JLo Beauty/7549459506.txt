I was super excited to receive the That JLo Glow Serum with Olive Complex complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Upon opening the voxbox, the first thing I noticed was the magnificent, luxe crystal looking bottle in which the product is housed. This only furthered my curiosity as to the product and its effectiveness. The pump bottle only requires one pump for ample coverage on the face. If you choose to apply it to the neck and décolletage, an additional pump is necessary. As the lightweight, non-sticky product begins to adsorb into the skin, there is a mild tightening sensation. Upon using this unscented product for several weeks, I found the serum to be very hydrating with some noticeable plumping of fine lines. Personally, I don’t see a need for a moisturizer as the serum is quite moisturizing within itself. nan
