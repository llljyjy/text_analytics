Absolutely adore this face mask I’m very picky when it comes to face masks I wont use just anything cuz I hate sensitive skin and break out easily I typically use the tatcha face mask which I love and decided to try these jlo ones and so happy I did I leave it on for 20-30 mins and my skin looks and feels wonderful you instantly get that jlo glow makes my face plump, moisturized, smooth and beautiful I keep them in the fridge nothing like a cold mask after a hot shower they are drenched with product so I recommend to reuse it 2x and possibly 3 cuz there’s so much product in there I really like these you definitely see a difference after one use I definitely recommend this mask good job jlo It’s wonderful,u definitely see immediate results
