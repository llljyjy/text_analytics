I was so surprised when I received this in the mail! I did not know Jlo made beauty products! Before trying these products my skin was beginning to feel dry and look dull I was also noticing tiny wrinkles around my eyes!  I started using this as my main skincare products and after about three days I noticed my skin didnâ€™t look as dull! After a few weeks my skin felt so soft and cleared up! I wish she also made a face wash to add to this set that would be great! I will be purchasing soon again! The packaging is so fancy! Overall I liked the set it is very affordable! affordable luxury beauty!
