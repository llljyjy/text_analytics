I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. My skin care regimen mimics a lot of what this product line contains. I didn’t notice a major change after a week of use but I didn’t expect too because of my normal routine. This line is has no fragrance and feels light. No sticky or tacky residue. I would recommend this line but I don’t love all of the plastic and excess packaging nan
