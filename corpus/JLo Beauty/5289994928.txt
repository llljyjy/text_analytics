I received this for free in exchange for my honest review. This is a thick, luxurious eye cream. The packaging is beautiful, but a bit excessive. I haven’t noticed a reduction in fine lines, but it’s only been about 2 weeks of use. I will continue to use because of how great it makes my skin feel, and hopefully anti-aging benefits follow! Beautiful
