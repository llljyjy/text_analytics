I was so stoked when my sister gave me this. Well once i tried it, i realized why she gave it away. Tried it a few more nights to be fair, but it felt like my skin never absorbed it. Felt thick & awful. Iâ€™ll probably give it away to a friend and see if someone eventually likes it. Will say the packaging is nice. 2 stars for that. hard pass
