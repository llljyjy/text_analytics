Dud not pair up well with 3 of my high end PM moisturizers at all.  It was not wanting to go deep into my skin when I would use this serum instead of pairing it up with the same brand as each moisturizer which is something I mostly do.  If anything has J Lo’s name on it, I’m expecting some high results that doesn’t need heavy makeup magic to achieve and this did not do it at all. So sad it didn’t work out for me.
