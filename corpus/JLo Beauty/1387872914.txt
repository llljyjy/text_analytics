This eye cream is very moisturizing. It blends really nicely and doesn’t cause me to have to pull on the skin around my eyes. There doesn’t seem to be much added fragrance which is a plus for me. The packaging is absolutely lovely. It looks nice on the vanity for sure. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 starts is because it seems to not do much beyond the moisture. It is a very good basic eye cream. A good basic eye cream
