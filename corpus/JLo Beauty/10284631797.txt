I’ve been using this eye cream for about a month with little results. The only results I saw were that the dry skin I had in my eyebrows and under my eyebrows is gone. I have used many eye creams in the past that had almost instant tightening of the skin and lightening of dark circles, but that affect would wear off by the end of the day. But this DOESN’T do that. Some eye creams have those results in the long term, with continued use. I believe this is more the second type of eye cream. I think it will require much more time to do anything, if it ever does anything at all. Haven't noticed much results
