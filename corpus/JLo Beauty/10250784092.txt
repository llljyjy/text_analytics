To me the packaging made the product. It’s unique and beautiful. The serum is okay. Works into the skin easily and there is it a lot of wait time to apply the eye cream or moisturizer. I like facial products with a scent. These didn’t have a smell which was disappointing to me. I do think my skin was softer from use. I hope with comfier use, it will be smoother and tighter. Of all the products, I like the eye cream the best. nan
