(I received this product for free to review and give my honest opinion)Before I begin, the package is fantastic! (now my review)I liked the texture, however I didn’t see no change in my dark circles. It’s great to use as a moisturizer instead of an eye cream. I will continue using it for few months to see if I notice any changes. It doesn’t affect my concealer nor foundation, but, I wait until it’s completely dry before concealing. Also it doesn’t give a oily look after applying. More of a moisturizer than an eye cream
