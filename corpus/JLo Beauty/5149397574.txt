I received this cream free of charge from #influenster and #jlobeauty as part of a #voxbox campaign, in return for my honest review.My skin is slightly sensitive, when I first applied it it slightly burned. I did give it a second try, wasn’t as bad as the first reaction . It’s light, creamy, not greasy, yet hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves no residue. It does not have any fragrance. My absolute favorite part about its cruelty free and the packaging. Eye cream.
