i used to use the sukari baby facial and thought this would be a good dupe based on the reviews and at the price point, it was worth a shot. this was ok at best. too runny, wouldn’t stay on my face, used too much product, and didn’t get the same results as baby facial. my skin felt nice but nowhere near as good as the DE one. shame because i do love other ordinary products but this was a miss for me. though at the price point, it’s not bad but there’s is better it's ok
