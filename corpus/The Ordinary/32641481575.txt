I have never in my life see so much improvement in my skin! I have really oily, acne-prone, discolored skin. But ever since using this product I’ve noticed drastic improvements!! I was using curology for about 6 months and had to stop but didn’t want to stop using what was in my bottle because my skin was doing very well. I saw that this was one of the ingredients and thought to try it. Ive used this product for maybe a week and by the 3rd use I instantly saw my skin looking more flat and even toned. My dark spots were remarkably lighter. It can feel little drying but coming from someone with very oily skin I don’t mind but if you have drier skin definitely use a good moisturizer. But overall this stuff is a game changer for me!! Will buy for the rest of my life!!
