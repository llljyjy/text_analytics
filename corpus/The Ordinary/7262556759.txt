It’s been a month or so and I’ve definitely seen small improvements. My skin feels plumper, my skin tone more even, my small bit of scarring from a Prednisone breakout has almost disappeared, and my nose seems less oily throughout the day (I have an oily t-zone and this seems to help more than a primer does). It is definitely worth it for the price and simplicity. Good Price, Simplicity, & Improvements
