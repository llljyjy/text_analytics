Truly one of my favourite products! I’ve always had acne-prone skine and this has been excellent with helping to control breakouts. I especially noticed a positive impact on blackheads on my nose... previously I would “need“ to use blackhead strips on a regular basis, but didn’t require them at all once I started using this serum. I also LOVE using a jade facial roller after applying this product...it feels so lovely. I recently went back to using a $60 cream based serum, as I had received it as a gift... and I will definitely be going back to using this product once it’s finished. Better than an expensive serum !
