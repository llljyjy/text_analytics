I have dry skin when I tried this it felt VERY sticky and uncomfortable so I unfortunately had to return it because of the reaction I had too it and immediately after I stopped with this product my skin cleared up from little bumps. I also made sure I was following directions and using the serum the right way like not touching the dropper to the face or applying it on dirty skin. I donâ€™t recommend buying
