So I’m not exactly sure what happened but my skin got irritated as I was doing my skincare. The lower part of my face by my chin got red and welted. It actually feels numb! I put the peptides on at the very end of my routine as I was about to seal it with spf and that’s when it happened. The Buffet is the only new thing I’ve added into my skincare routine. I’m not going to use it anymore. That was scary. It was the third time I used it and I’m not sensitive I followed the protocol waiting 15-20 mins after antioxidants before layering it on. I’m acclimated to use l-ascorbic acid and tretinoin, both in their purest and highest form with little to no irritation. If I ever shed/peel from my vit-a, I like it because it reassures me it’s working. So I wanted to add peptides in to continue to optimize my skincare regimen and I guess I was getting extra and should be happy with where I am.. so weird!!!! Less is more or simple is best lol good luck everyone out there experimenting with skincare!!I heard so many good things about peptides and had previously used growth factor serums which are a $$$ so I wanted to replace them with something more sustainable for my budget and save the stem cell gf serums for post in clinic treatments. I feel like I graduated vit c & a that I’m ready to add more but these serums are too finicky. This buffet and the one with copper peptides. I really don’t want to skip days using vit c & a for these peptide serums that aren’t absolutely proven to work!I’ll be using these on my hands. Allergic reaction
