Just finished the bottle after using it daily for 2 months. When I started using the serum, I had some hyperpigmentation that had been on my face for about 2 months so I thought it would make a difference but being that I have hormonal acne and always break out, I began to get new marks and this still didn’t help. It has a thick tacky consistency that takes longer than usual to sink into the skin. But once it dried down, it didn’t mess with my other skincare steps.. Definitely wouldn’t repurchase or recommend. Nope
