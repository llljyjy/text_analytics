I have acne scars, and I noticed that they werenâ€™t as obvious as before after using this product. I also had more of an even skin tone which was nice. The product is very thin and can be oily if you put too much on, (I did the first time). Put a small dot on the area you are concerned about, and sleep with it on overnight! nan
