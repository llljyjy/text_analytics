This stuff is truly exactly what it says on the tin; it has made the dark spots caused by birth control to abate more than any “dark spot” stuff I’ve ever tried. Really, really makes my skin glow! I will definitely be buying again. BUT. The formula is weird, greasy, and is smells atrocious. Since it’s so odd and runny, you really have to move your head to make sure it never approaches your mouth. It tastes even worse than it smells. I also don’t use it under makeup because it is so greasy. So yes, I’ll buy again, but the formula tries hard to make you consider not doing that. Works! But Formula Greasy and Smells Gross
