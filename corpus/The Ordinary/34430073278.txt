Love love love this product!!! I’ve been using it for about a month now and I already have seen it fading my acne scars. I have a darker complexion so I really struggle with dark acne scars after every breakout. This product is oily which I wasn’t expecting and I have oily skin but I didn’t find it to be a problem. I use this in the morning and then put sunscreen over it. I feel like it is also helping prevent breakouts and honestly my skin is the best it has ever been!! Also the cheapest vitamin C product out there probably. Definitely my new holy grail product nan
