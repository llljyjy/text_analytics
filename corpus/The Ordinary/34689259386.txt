I really like this cleanser!  It’s different from any other cleanser I have ever used and if you don’t follow the directions you may think it doesn’t work.  You have to “activate“ the cleanser before you apply it to your face.  In my opinion it feel like you have to use a fair amount in order to work it into your face, but for the price I don’t mind!  I have sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin.  I use this cleanser twice a day.  It doesn’t make my face oily or cause breakouts.  I highly recommend this product! nan
