this product definitely keeps my skin hydrated and moisture locked in, but i really don’t like how sticky it is and how fast it gets sticky after applying. it also pills when i apply products after it if i don’t wait long enough for it to sink in, usually about 3-5 min. maybe i’m just impatient?? it’s not a big deal at night but very annoying when i’m rushing to get ready for work in the morning. i like how affordable it is but the cons outweigh the pros for me. i’ll stick to my tried and true innisfree green tea serum, which is more lightweight, NOT sticky, and keeps my skin just as hydrated. not bad but not great
