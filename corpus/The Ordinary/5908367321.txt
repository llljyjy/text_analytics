Bought as a non physical exfoliator. Definitely works but personally not satisfactory. There are other products with glycolic acid even in cleansers that works BETTER and also doesn’t irritate the skin. It’s super light and slips down on face, so be careful not to apply too much and keep away from mouth/eye area. Doesn’t blend well with other products, so forget about even properly moisturizing. It’s so tacky on the skin that pillow will be gross in the morning. Tacky texture on skin + Not for sensitive skin.
