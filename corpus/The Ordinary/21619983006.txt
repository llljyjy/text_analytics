It has a weird texture. This is something mentioned on the description of the item. I thought I wouldn’t mind but at the end it felt uncomfortable. It wasn’t completely absorbed by my skin so I stopped using it. It’s not an expensive product at all, not made for me. Weird texture as mention on the item description
