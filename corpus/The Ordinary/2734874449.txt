I love this stuff! I noticed a difference in one application (right after a break out) and my skin continued to clear with each application. It’s only been a week or so, but it’s shaping up to be my fave salicylic acid product ever (and I love SA!). It’s oily to the touch, which made me a bit nervous. I have really oily skin and anything oily is likely to cause a breakout. I only apply at night, and while it definitely sits on top of my skin and looks a bit shiny, by morning it’s been absorbed. Pairing it with other chemical exfoliants has helped with getting it to sink into my skin better/faster, and it also seems like it’s absorbing better as I use it more. Fave Salicylic Acid Product
