I’ve been using this for a year now and it’s one of my favourite moisturizers! It’s very inexpensive for the quality, it makes my skin feel great and I get very dry skin in the winter, and in the summer months it was perfect even when my skin got oily because it wasn’t too thick. I 100% recommend. Amazing!!
