I’ve been using this product pretty consistently for months, and never really noticed how much of a difference it makes. I was without it for 4 weeks, and by the end of it my skin was very textured/bumpy around my forehead and chin. My entire face looked a bit dull and dehydrated. After using this literally ONCE following this 4 week period, my skin texture improved like crazy. I wish I took photos, because I couldn’t believe how much it helped. I used it again 2-3 days later and my skin is back to normal!! Never leaving this at home ever again
