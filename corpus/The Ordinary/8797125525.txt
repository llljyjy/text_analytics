i’ve had genetic dark circles since i was kid so i wasnt honestly expecting much trying this out but wouldnt hurt to try right? i’ve used up an entire bottle used am and pm over the course of about 4 months. i think over time they have lightened a bit, if i dont use it at night my eyes do look a little worse the next morning lol.The biggest change i’ve gotten is reduced eye puffiness. for my east and southeast asians who have uneven eyelids this might be a hg. no more constant taping that one lid thats lower anymore its such a relief for me haha. last thing this serum seems to help is the kp on the outside of my arms. i saw another review saying it worked for them so i decided to try and it seems to have started working it just takes a while lol great for puffiness, eh for dark circles
