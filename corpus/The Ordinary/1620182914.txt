I have very sensitive skin so I was quite hesitant to try this product. After a few uses, I think it’s safe to say I am so glad I decided to give it a try. My skin is so soft and radiant. Also, tried it on the underarms to reduce my hyperpigmentation. They look so after a couple of uses. For such a low price point I am pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of this product. I’ll be reordering soon. nan
