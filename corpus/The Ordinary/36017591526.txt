I have used this product for a couple of weeks and I love it! I get plenty of sleep, but I’ve always had dark circles. I put this serum on twice a day in the morning and night. Then I rub it in under my eye. I’ve noticed my circles have lightened and my under eyes are much brighter. I highly recommend this product and I love it so much! Perfect for dark circles
