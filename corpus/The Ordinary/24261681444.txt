Seen this on TikTok and I said why not, like every other product I try. Its cheap for I had no hype for it. But I seen this for use on back acne. For a while my upper back was breaking out with pimples and blackheads, it was embarrassing, even around my fiancé, it was always in back of my head. Occasionally he would give me a back facial but he didn’t like to...once I started using this 2-3 times a week, the magic appeared. Clear skin! Less blackheads! No pimples! Wow. I never used water with it, just a cotton pad and rubbed on my back. Please restock soon, although I still have half a bottle, I know there’s a few girls searching for a solution to my similar problem. I have yet to try it on my face, I guess I haven’t cause it does have a funky smell, of course moistuizer or creams will make it go away. TikTok Trend!
