I usually use the Clinique oil control face mask with 1% Salicylic Acid and love it. So I figured I’d give the Ordinary one a try since it has 2% Salicylic Acid! But I think this is just one of those things were less could be better depending on your skin. I do have oily skin and a lot of times I can deal with some stronger acne treating actives but this mask I could feel the buying right away…. I also don’t like the consistency of this mask either. However, if your skin can take a 2% percent salicylic acid mask sitting on your face fur a little while I think it would be a decent mask to use once a week or once in awhile when you feel like your skin needs it. 2 percent Salicylic Acid!
