I love this serum!! I use it every night after I cleanse my face. It is a little oily but after a while, the serum absorbs into your skin. There is a light salicylic acid smell to it. After using it, Iâ€™ve seen so many improvements!! My skin is a lot more clear and bright. Salicylic acid helps with acne so this is perfect! I would definitely buy again! amazing product!!
