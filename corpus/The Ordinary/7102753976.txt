Love this product. I’m 40, and concerned about my maturing skin, and tried this product on a whim. Let me say, I didn’t know I had a texture problem until I saw the results after using this product. My skin is noticeably smoother in texture and I think it may be slightly helping some static wrinkles on my forehead. My skin leans to the sensitive side, and I use this product one a week no more than 10 minutes, and haven’t had any problems with the strength. nan
