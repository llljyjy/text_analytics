This NMF + HA was a miss. It does not absorb into the skin. I would place it on top of serums and damp skin and I would still see the white cream all over my face. Once it dried so did my skin feel really dry. I’m going to try using it on my body just to get rid of the product. I will not be repurchasing. Two stars for ingredients and price. No fragrance smell. I wanted this to work badly. I love my other “The Ordinary” products. I am a regular consumer and bought this on my own. Did Not Meet Basic Expectations
