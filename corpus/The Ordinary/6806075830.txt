I’ve only used this TWICE and my keratosis pilaris is already looking a lot better. I’m beyond impressed with this product. Most products that help KP have to be used daily and I just don’t have time for that. With this peeling solution it’s only 10 minutes twice a week for visible results. That’s what I call a WIN! I’m looking forward to seeing what my KP looks like in a few weeks. I haven’t tried this on my face yet (my skin is too irritated at the moment) but with such fast results on my arms I look forward to using this on my face. Great for KP
