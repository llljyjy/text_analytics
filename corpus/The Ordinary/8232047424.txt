As far as cleansers go, it’s alright! It didn’t dry out my skin (which is dry to begin with). I didn’t feel “squeaky clean“ (which can be good, it means it didn’t strip my skin of all moisture!), and the texture is nothing I haven’t seen before. The fact that it’s marketed as a makeup remover is a bit misleading since it does not remove most of the makeup. I had to to a triple cleanse to get everything off and it was a bit tedious. It does not have any special smell, which is good for sensitive skin. All around, a good enough cleanser, at a good price, but I don’t know if I would repurchase. Alright
