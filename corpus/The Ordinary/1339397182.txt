This solution is a nice primer to your moisturizer and makeup. It is not sticky as some have said. You just have to wait a few seconds for it to dry. Itâ€™s nothing worse than a thick serum. The end result is your face retains the moisture better. I highly recommend during the dry winter months. A nice touch to your routine in winter!
