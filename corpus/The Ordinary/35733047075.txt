holy beefy baked breadsticks this product is amazing!!!!! i’m sad the bottle is so small! i didn’t really know what this would do but i bought it because the reviews were so good, and dear god am i happy i did. ever since i started using this, my skin has been glowing immensely and it looks and feels so much brighter. i also have always had a problem with small bumps on my face that weren’t quite acne, and this made them to away completely!! my skin has never been smoother. i cant put into words how happy i am with this. even though the bottle is small, i think it will last a while because i only have to use 1-2 drops a day. i mix it in with a small amount of the vitamin c in ha spheres (also from the ordinary), and with the two of them combined, it’s more than enough for my entire face. 10/10, will definitely be buying again AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
