I’ve heard great things about Rose Hip Oil but unfortunately for me, it caused skin irritation and dryness. Since I can’t use it on my skin, I put some on the ends my hair and I’ve noticed that my hair looks/feels better and is less frizzy. Additional Comments:- It’s really greasy. Be careful to not get it around your hairline (if you use it as skincare) cause it’ll look like you have oily hair/scalp until you shower it off Might Irritate Sensitive Skin; Okay for Hair
