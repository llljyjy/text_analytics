I really wanted to love this product but it’s just ok. There are certain areas specifically around my cheeks that it seems to hydrate and possibly reduce fine lines but my main concern are forehead lines and it has not done much to improve those in the 2 months that I have been using this product. At least it was a affordable. I’ll be switching to something else when it’s done. nan
