I’ve used multiple bottles now.  I really do feel like this product has changed my first signs of aging.  Fine lines are definitely not as apparent.  I think hydrating your skin to help it remain healthy and plump is what really gives our skin the edge to looking more youthful.  Im not afraid of natural aging, but I do want my skin to look fresh and healthy while doing so.  I continue to use this everyday, morning and night after my cleanser and I don’t plan to stop anytime soon :) A staple in my skincare routine
