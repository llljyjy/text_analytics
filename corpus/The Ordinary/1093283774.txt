This serum is fantastic. I never realized how much it was helping my skin until I didn’t have it for a few weeks. It really helps keep my sensitive, dry, acne prone skin calm and hydrated plus it helps with anti aging. It isn’t sticky and has no fragrance. I also put it under my eyes and I find it helps with the fine lines I get. It’s a great serum for a great price and I will continue to use it! Highly recommend to everyone! It’s a holy grail in my routine!
