This is by far my fave product from the Ordinary. I’ve suffered from moderate acne for over 10 years and i have SUPER sensitive skin. I decided to give this product a try and I was not disappointed. it took about 6 weeks for my skin to get use to it (had breakouts to start) but now I barely get any and I mean barely! also the texture of my skin is so much better/softer. I never thought I would have “good skin“ but I do now! HIGHLY recommend, just have to be consistent! nan
