I noticed a difference with my blackheads after the second use! It’s like they all came to the top of my skin and were easy to pop! I use before bed every night and my only problem with it is when I rub it in, it kind of reminds me of a cleanser but I don’t care because it works amazing. I know it’ll last me a long time because a little goes a long way nan
