Bought this because I have issues with clogged pores & acne. I was expecting something different, to me it’s way too oily and it just sits on the surface of skin. I already have a great route going (the ordinary “mandelic acid” & “niacinamide 10%” serums) and thought this would be a good addition. I’ve only used this one 2-3 times but don’t think I will be continuing. Pretty sure it was causing my pores to become even more clogged, it was almost like I could feel them clogging. If you’re looking for help with acne, pores, and scaring I do not recommend this product, but I DO recommend the other two products I’ve mentioned. not for me
