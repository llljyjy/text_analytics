I have very sensitive skin that reacts to almost every type of exfoliation in more breakouts. The first time I used this I didn’t have much success when I just applied it before my moisturizer. Now I layer it between two layers of moisturizer every night and my skin is the clearest and smoothest it’s ever been. So happy! I love my skin now
