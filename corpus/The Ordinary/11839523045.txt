Skin type: In between oily and normal (naturally), normal when consistently using retionid gels (Tretinoin gel, Adapalene gel)My brown skin is prone to dyspigmentation from inflammation, acne, injury and sunlight exposure. It’s not prone to hyperpigmentation from products tho (except in very rare cases) It also sometimes gets duller looking than usual in the winter.This stuff is a dream. Greatest ADJUNCTIVE OTC product I’ve ever used for lightening darkened skin, instantly giving me a brighter complexion, making my warm/golden undertones pop (more vivid color) and maintaining the flawless even tone I was chasing.Using this all over my face along with hydroquinone (2%-4%) cream as a spot treatment this will quickly fade the darkened spots/sections. If you use other chemical (acid, enzyme) exfoliants and/or strong retinoids (tret, taz, adapalene) you’ll probably get velvety skin that’s smoother and softer the touch. It also gets more supple and bouncy even though I’m still in my 20s and thus have a lot of bounce & smoothness to my skin already.I have been using  a stabilized, ph <3, properly packaged ascorbic acid serum for years. It’s my holy grail for brightening but since my skin is resilient I can put it on after using this. These two products are the DREAM TEAM for giving my face the radiance I’ve always wanted I use this on my face for up to 20 minutes (my own dermatologist said this was fine for me considering how my skin reacts to stronger in office chemical peels) and for 7-10 minutes on my neck. When I go over the ten minute recommendation & use it for 15+ minutes on my face I get enhanced results.No irritation, no adverse effects, instant gratification and long term gratification. Only regret is I didn’t try it earlier because I wasn’t convinced it would live up to the hype since you can only use it twice a week Must have for my brown skin
