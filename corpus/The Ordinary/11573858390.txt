I really wanted to like this but it ended up doing the opposite of what itâ€™s supposed to. It clogged my pores, gave me black heads and made me brake out. I do have acne and wanted to give this a try. I noticed my face was way better after I stopped using this and started using a charcoal tea tree soap from my local farmers market. Highly disappointed. just no.
