I bought this moisturiser kinda on a whim and began using it a few months ago. I have combination skin that tends to get dry and dehydrated in the cheek area especially in the winter time. I found that it took a while to fully rub the product in because I had to apply quite a bit to get enough moisture, and even then my face felt quite dry, especially my nose area which is typically oily. Even when slugging with Vaseline or adding facial oils on top it just didn’t work for me. I set it aside to try again in the warmer months, and I’m still experiencing the same problems. I think this is better suited for normal to oily skin. Better suited for normal to oilier skin types.
