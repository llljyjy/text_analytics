I apply every morning after washing my face and before applying my Kiels moisturizer and wow does it make my face look radiant! It’s a pretty thick serum but it spreads well and soaks in quickly. I didn’t have high expectations when I bought it but since routine usage my face looks plump and hydrated. It makes me love the way my skin looks without makeup but it also sits well under makeup, I haven’t experienced peeling like other reviews claim. 10/10 will buy again! Radiant Skin, no makeup needed!
