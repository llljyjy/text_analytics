This is a great product. I love the actual moisturizer and the consistency is great. It is very this which I like too. The only thing I donâ€™t like about this product is that I got the smaller bottle of it and there is barely any product in it. When I tried it for the first time is had to squeeze the bottle a lot because there was a lot of air. I do not think I paid for what I got. Other than the amount of product, I love the ordinary products and you should definitely look into purchasing it. Great Product, Too Little Amount
