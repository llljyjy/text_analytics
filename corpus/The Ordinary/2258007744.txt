Instantly brighter skin in minutes. I leave it on for 5 mins, as starts to get a little itchy. Not a burning sensation just a little itch. But it’s worth it because my skin illuminates soon after.Would be good right before a night out or before a big day at work.I use it at night before bed with a light moisturizer. A REAL PEEL!😍
