I bought my first bottle of this about a year and a half ago and have continued to purchase it ever since! It has worked to significantly lighten some old acne scars I had on my face as well as other areas of my body where I had dark spots (such as my bikini line). I love that it contains HA, which seems to really hydrate and plump my skin before applying my regular moisturizer. Iâ€™ll continue to buy this one! It's a staple!
