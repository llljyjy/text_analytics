ohhhh how I wish this didn’t cause me to break out. I have combination skin and overall I would not categorize it as sensitive. Normally as long as its not an oil based product, I’m fine. Unfortunately while this made my skin SUPER glowwy and baby bottom smooth, it also caused me to break out so bad. And I mean BAD. 16 year old me bad. Very upsetting because as an exfoliater, this worked wonders. So purchase with caution! I envy those who can use this and not break out. I wish it didn't make me break out
