It doesn’t do anything major to my skin. It does give me a glow but that’s about it. I didn’t find that it helped with my dry flakey winter skin . The smell is a bit funky but doesn’t bother me that much. What bothers me the most is that this oil just sits on top of the skin. It’s a fun step in my routine but I think I’ll look for another oil to use. Not so impressed
