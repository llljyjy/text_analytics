I know TO’s Argireline serum is often referred to as “Botox in a bottle,” which, having had Botox I’d have to disagree!  This does not “freeze” the muscles as Botox does but it is still a worthy purchase nonetheless because it has been absolutely effective for me. I know that some say they spot treat with this but I do use it all over my face because I find it to be wonderfully hydrating. In terms of fine lines I noticed a reduction of the fine lines in my forehead after around four months (which was an entire bottle for me). So it helps to be patient!  I’ve tried two bottles of another argireline serum from a “medical-grade” line ($109/bottle) and I can honestly say I like TO’s serum better. When mixed with TO’s Matrixyl serum it’s even better (and more hydrating). I definitely recommend this for mature skin (I’m 48 btw) or anyone looking to slow down the inevitable signs of aging. Excellent, affordable product.
