Warning - this stuff works TOO well! I have a very oily t-zone, so my nose gets shiny throughout the day. I bought this to try, and because itâ€™s a serum, I put it all over my face like any other skincare. BAD IDEA. It dries out your face wherever you put it. Now I only put it in the oily t-zone area and it controls oil for HOURS. Work so well!
