As an already oily-skinned girl, this serum leaves my skin SO greasy. I would never be able to use this in the morning/before putting on makeup, and when I use it in the evening, it just leaves me feeling greasy & gross. No matter how much I massage it into my skin, it never completely absorbs. I will switch to The Ordinaryâ€™s other salicylic acid products to see if I have better luck. SO greasy (oily skinned people beware)
