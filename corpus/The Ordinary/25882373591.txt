Dropping by to say how much I love having this in both of my am/pm routines. I am 30, but have had a deep “11“ (frown lines) between my eyebrows for years (I only started learning about skincare less than a year ago)- it didn’t really bother me until this past year (the lines would still appear when my face was resting). I’m iffy about botox, but am a fan of The Ordinary, and wanted to give this a try after seeing the reviews on Tiktok/Youtube. Argireline was available at my local Sephora, however the Matrixyl was not, so I decided to use one without the other. Its been 2-3 weeks and I am loving the results, even without the Matrixyl. Smooth skin and decreased lines for days!! We love to see it- give it a try. If you're unsure, go for it!
