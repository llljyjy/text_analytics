Wanted to love this because I love some other ordinary products but compared to the Inkey List niacinamide, this product is WAAAY too drying. It made my skin peel because it became so dry. Disappointed but I feel if you have oily skin go for it. But if it’s combo oily then I’d go with the Inkey List niacinamide option because it balances oil control and moisture better. nan
