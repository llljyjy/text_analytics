this is quite literally the best acne clearing product i have EVER used on my face. i have extremely dry skin, and every product used to fight acne, especially cheaper products, tends to dry out the acne therefore creating a dry patch. i have been using this every night for a week, and my skin has almost CLEARED. i had two really bad whiteheads that would not go away for about two weeks, and in two days this serum has completely brought them down to a small red bump. it has also helped minimize dark spots (working alongside my other skin care). i use the smallest amount and it goes a long way. will definitely recommend to everyone with dry skin and acne/breakouts. best spot treatment serum!!!
