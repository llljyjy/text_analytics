I’ve been using The Ordinary SA 2% Anhydrous (Squalane) mixed with Hada Labo HA Lotion/Toner directly after cleansing when skin is still slightly damp as both treatment and moisturizing step all-in-one. I had a huge, deep, painful pimple near my nose that just wouldn’t go away. After 3 days+3 nights of a super basic, lazy routine consisting of cleansing and 3 drop HL HA (hydration) + 3 drops TO SA (treatment + occlusive/facial oil), the pimple is almost gone. I’ve noticed a little improvement on my forehead texture as well. Nice thing is it didn’t dry my skin and it feels pretty moisturized. Other water-based SA serums I’ve used dried my skin even when used with a separate moisturizer. Since I’m applying this on damp skin, it doesn’t feel greasy to me. It kinda feels just like my skin’s natural oils. I’ve got dehydrated combo skin and it seems like the squalane and polyglycerides are actually helping prevent my skin from overproducing oils. Plus pricing is super affordable. Overall, I find this to be great value. effective yet gentle multitasker
