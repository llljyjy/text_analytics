I really like the texture and how soothing this feels when applied and that it dries pretty quickly, unfortunately this irritated the skin around my eyes after a week of daily use (which is a known side effect of caffeine on the skin)  I never got to use it long enough to see if it worked for dark circles. I did know this was possible, but I don’t typically have very sensitive skin. Just be careful if you try this as it might be irritating to your skin. I also only used this at night so don’t know how it would be under makeup etc. This dried and irritated the skin near my eyes
