Really happy with this masque. I’ve used it on my face, on my back, and as a spot treatment for a pimple on my chest that just wouldn’t budge. I have found it a little drying on my face, but it’s worked wonders on my back and cleared the blocked pore I had on my chest. I get super hot at night in the summer and get oily skin and this has helped minimise breakouts and reduced how oily I am. It is a little tricky to get out of the tube, I think a jar would be better or a tube with a larger opening. effective product
