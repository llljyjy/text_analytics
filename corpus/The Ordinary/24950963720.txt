As mentioned in many reviews, this can dry your skin out of not used properly and I have extremely dry skin. I pair this with a moisturizing facial mist before and after applying the hyaluronic acid serum and it truly does lock in the moisture of the spray and help keep my skin from drying out.  Very affordable as well. Amazing for the price!
