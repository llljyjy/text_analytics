I didn’t hate this product but I am also not going to necessarily recommend it. I think that if you are using this to remove medium-heavy foundation or makeup this would work well, if you are currently on the more no makeup -makeup hype I would say this isn’t worth it. Others have mentioned it feels like wet lotion, I agree but keep in mind you are supposed to put this on your face completely dry, rub in then add water so some extra moisture isn’t the worst. I think that the size is also a drawback to this product, brands such as cerave offer the same (if not better) quality for more product and almost identical pricepoint. nan
