Hello there! I’m a teenager that WAS going through hormonal acne, that was until I started using this serum. My mom gave it to me cause she didn’t want. I didn’t use it for a while but when my skin started getting worst, I made myself a skin care routine to really stick with every morning and night. The first time I used this I felt the complete hydration on my skin, I loved the way it felt and within days I started to see a difference. I love this product, it’s hydrating and soothing, not to mention it is very affordable. I recommend this 100% and I will definitely be buying again.The photos below show my before and after. The one that’s taken outside is my before and the other is my after.For reference, I have oily skin. game changer
