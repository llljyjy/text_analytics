Bought this serum about a month ago and I absolutely love what it did to my skin. Before i had dry skin and when I would put foundation on you could see the dry patchy spots. Once I used this for about a week the dry patches were gone. Not only is this serum affordable but it does do wonders. I would highly recommend and will be purchasing again. Good affordable serum
