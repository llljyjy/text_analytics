This product is amazing! I haven’t had the best luck in the past with this brand but this is solid, I’ve tried other hyaluronic acids that did nothing but I can tell the difference in hydration with this. It’s thick but I personally like that and it sinks in fairly quickly with no sticky residue. Whatever is left over I rub on my hands and they’ve stopped cracking. I didn’t even buy it for that but it’s a nice side effect. I had a fine line on my forehead that has gone away. I do use a serum and a moisturizer after this but I think this is what made the most difference. Will definitely keep buying. The best for hydration!
