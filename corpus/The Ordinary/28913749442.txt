So, I was originally skeptical because it’s such a harsh acid. However, it wasn’t that harsh for me. I use it every two weeks to sometimes weekly; I set a timer for nine minutes so I have time to wash it off and don’t accidentally keep it on for too long. As soon as I washed it off-WOW. I glowed, y’all. I really love this stuff, and it doesn’t act up with my other acids and skincare products. LOVE LOVE LOVE
