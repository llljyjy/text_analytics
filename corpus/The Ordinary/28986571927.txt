I don’t know what more anyone could want from an 8$ bottle of serum. I apply it to my damp skin after I shower or wash my face by pressing (not rubbing) in a few drops. I have never had issues with it making my skin sticky or hindering the next steps of my routine. Do I think this product is a holy grail for moisturizing and anti aging.. no. Do I think this product is an affordable, reliable and predictable means to boost hydration or act as a vessel for the addition of stronger actives? Absolutely. Of course everyone’s mileage may vary with how this product works for them and their skin but for this price, I would never try and talk someone out of trying it. I do find the packaging of the ordinary products like this one quite annoying (glass bottles with droppers). But that’s because I am a clumsy fool who knocks them over while they are open on my counter. I can’t hold this product accountable for my own lack of body coordination. its cheaper than avocado toast
