This wasn’t quite moisturizing enough for me for wintertime in Alberta (for reference, I have sensitive combination skin—oily T-zone, and dry, flaky cheeks). I took all the recommended precautions for using a hyaluronic acid product in dry climates (applying on damp skin, sealing with an oil, and also using a humidifier at home to increase the moisture my skin could take in) but I guess the dry winter air here was still too much for this moisturizer. I think I will try to avoid humectants like HA for the wintertime, but I can see this being a great summertime moisturizer, as it felt very silky and soothing during application. might not be great for dry climates
