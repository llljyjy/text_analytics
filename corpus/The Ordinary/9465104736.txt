When I use this product, I find my undereye lighten but not as much as I would like. I haven’t seen any depuffing but I have seen slight lightening. Also, this crust keeps forming and I don’t know how when I don’t put product there? I wish there was a way to keep this crust from forming because it keeps falling on my counter when I open it and it makes me think it’s not sealed properly? Not buying again
