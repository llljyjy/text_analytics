I use this mask twice a week and its the BEST as clearing up acne / congestion on your face ! Dont use it more than directed and be aware you might get a little redness after but this goes away leaving you with super clean beautiful skin - My only flaw in this product is the packaging sometimes its hard to get the mask out of the tube nan
