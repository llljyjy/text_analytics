like others have said the oil messes up the package so it’s unusable, i had to toss mine while it was half full because i couldn’t get the oil out and the container wouldn’t close. other wise i liked the oil, it was lightweight and although it had an odd smell i wouldn’t say it was bad like other reviewers have. beware pilling when used with certain products. nan
