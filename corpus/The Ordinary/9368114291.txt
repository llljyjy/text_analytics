For reference, my skin: fair, oily/combination, some adult acne, some rosaceaThis stuff is great for minor or major breakouts. Every time I’ve used it, they seriously disappear overnight. I found it to be very drying, even on my oily skin, so leave it on for shorter or just use it as a spot treatment if your skin is on the dryer side. It has a creamy consistency, like a thinner clay mask. It’s black in color, but it surprisingly hasn’t stained any of my facecloths. nan
