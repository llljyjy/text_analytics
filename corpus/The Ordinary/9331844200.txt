I purchased the 1.7oz Squalane Cleanser by The Ordinary in store to try something new. I’m a regular user of more expensive cleansers and wanted to see how this one compared.After a week of twice daily usage, while it does a good job of cleansing, I have to comparison points to the higher end brands that will inform my future purchases. First, I had to use double the volume of cleanser to get a comparable result to my regular cleanser. I used more than half of the container in the first week. That’s a much higher usage ratio than my regular cleanser and if I continued using it, I’m not sure this one is actually a better deal. Second, it took a few days for my skin to adjust to it. I had small bumps on my cheeks a few days after I started using this product, and this was the only new addition to my regular routine. After exfoliation, the bumps are going away after a full week of usage.It is gentle on the skin and does not strip the skin. It’s a safe bet, but give yourself time to adjust and expect to use a lot of it per wash. The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser
