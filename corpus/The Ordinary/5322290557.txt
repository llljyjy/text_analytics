i am 28F with sensitive drier skin that can turn combo depending on the weather and my routine. i tried buffet for a few months as a moisturizing and anti aging serum but did not see a significant difference. itâ€™s likely because i am too young to really benefit from this product. if not for the price, i might keep this in my routine, but i think for most under 30 folks, alternating between vitamin c and a retinol should be enough of an anti aging routine. i am excited to return to this product in a few years! not for most under 30 folks!
