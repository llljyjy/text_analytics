I’ve used this product for the past year to target my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. First of all, this product does not irritate my skin at all, which is great. However, suppose that it would take the acne scar 6 months to fade by itself, by using this product, the acne scar would take around 4 months to fade. So does it work? Yes, but only slightly. For the best results, I would recommend using this product with the ordinary’s 10% lactic acid. After using then together, my stubborn acne scars started fading in a month! If you are using this product to get rid of general hyperpigmentation that you’ve had for a long time (melasma, sun exposure, etc.), then unfortunately, at least in my experience, this product will not help at all. It (kinda) works
