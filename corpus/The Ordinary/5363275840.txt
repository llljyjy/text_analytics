It does it’s job. Exfoliates. I had gone a few weeks without really caring for my skin and saw my pores were looking congested with that white stuff if you look up close in a mirror and my skin texture was uneven and bumpy. Used this one time after cleansing. Took a cotton pad and swiped away, the white stuff disappeared. The next morning my skin looked pretty smooth. Only thing I will say is I formed 2 breakouts...one on cheek and one close to the chin. Not sure if this toner caused it as it’s that time of the month for me. I tend to get a bump or 2 around that time anyway. I don’t have sensitive skin and it adjusts pretty well to new products. Great for the price.
