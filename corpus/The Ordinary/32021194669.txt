Okay… so I’ve read the mixed reviews and I’d like to say that this has been a game changer in my skin care routine. My skin is combination, I try to stick to a regimen but sometimes I get busy… however this has completely changed my skin. At first I didn’t see much of a change..and then I realized I was applying the product to my skin incorrectly for it to work properly. Now, I dot the product on the problem areas and pat it into my skin with my fingers. It truly works my skin has never looked better and I’m so grateful. It lightened all of my dark acne marks and has shrunk my super enlarged pores. I will continue to use!! So worth it!!!!!
