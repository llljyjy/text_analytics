I bought this product recently and I wanted to wait until I write the review. I initially questioned my purchase as some review have mentioned pilling when used. I literally watched several videos from Haram to Mixed Beauty to learn more about the product. When using Ordinary Vitamin C, it’s best result when mixed in with a serum before applying. Also, do NOT use this with a Niacinamide as the formulation of those 2 does not mix well. Once I learned how to properly use the Ordinary Vitamin C, I did not see the “pilling”. I use this in conjunction with Pyungkang Yul serum and works wonders. Hope this helps! nan
