I do notice a difference in using this. I still get occasional acne during that time of the month or if I forget to wash my mask but I do like it. It helps my skin stay really plump too if I put on the HA moisturizer (from the ordinary). I also don’t understand what people are talking about with the scent, it literally doesn’t smell like anything!!!??? nan
