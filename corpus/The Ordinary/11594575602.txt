This cleanser is amazing. While rubbing it onto my skin, I can feel the gunk coming out of my pores. It does not dry my face at all. Before applying to your face make sure you melt it on your fingers first. To melt it just rub it with your fingers. The friction melts the product and that is when it will work best. This is best for all skin types. I have combination skin and it works with my skin. My mom has sensitive skin and she is in her 40s and it works great with her skin as well. My cousin has oily skin and even though the cleanser is oily it works great with her skin as well. This is a great product for everyone to use. I would recommend rubbing it on your face and neck for about 5 minutes for the best results. It is great to use everyday and does not strip your skin. Great Cleanser
