I used the online service and went to two stores.  I was  trying to determine what was the best hyaluronic acid to use for microneedling.  None of the staff had a clue what I was talking about.  Micro what?.  Maybe need to have more seasoned, experienced staff about what is going on in the world not just the names of the products. (which by the way they were very good at).  I haven’t tried the product yet, hoping it is good.  I said I would recommend the product, but honestly since I haven’t tried I., I don’t know Need staff with experience
