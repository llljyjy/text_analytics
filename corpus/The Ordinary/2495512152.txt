i love this product. it’s super lightweight and dries down quick with no tacky feeling left over. i started using this serum about a week and a half ago and i have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. i broke out at the very start, as to be expected, but it stopped pretty quickly. i haven’t been experiencing breakouts since. i have also noticed a reduction in oil production since using it. i don’t know if that was an objective of the product but it’s a pro for my super oily skin. i have tried multiple other bha serums with the same salicylic acid percentage and this is the only one to give me results without leaving my skin irritated. i like to use this in the mornings along with a basic moisturizer and spf. i haven’t experienced any issues using it during the day despite it being advised by TO to use this product at night. very effective with no irritation
