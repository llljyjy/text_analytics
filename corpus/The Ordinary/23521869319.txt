I ordered my second bottle of this mask back in May, and just finished the bottle now.I’ve been using this as a weekly exfoliating mask, but it is not my favorite one I have ever used. It is at a pretty good price point - and I first bought this as a way to start exfoliating at home instead of just when I had the time for a facial (it was recommended to me by a friend with similar skin: sensitive, with rosacea). After finishing my first bottle; I then tried the Sunday Riley good genes (used as a rinse off 10-min mask) and PTR pumpkin enzyme exfoliating mask. I then bought this again to compare and contrast. As far as price; it is obviously the cheapest and a great option for someone on a budget. As far as how well it works; I first got this because at the time I had just cleared up a few months worth of hormonal acne (I am not acne prone, this was my first bout with acne and I did not know how to care for it, so I was left with quite a bit of PIH). I read about how the use of exfoliating can be helpful for healing PIH. In all honesty, out of the three exfoliant masks I’ve used, this has faded my acne scars the most - but - it triggers my rosacea - whereas the SR and PTR I could use on my whole face without causing my rosacea to go nuts. So, I started only using this on my chin and jaw, but it would still manage to affect the rosacea patches on my cheeks and part of my neck.Since I have faded my acne scars to the point that I want to stop using an ’intense’ mask 1-2x’s a week, I don’t have plans to purchase this again - as it did what I needed it to do.If you want to fade acne scars- I definitely recommend this product (but definitely include the use of sunscreen in the morning) but - if you have rosacea, be wary because every time I used it - I had a reaction. (I just purchased GR watermelon overnight mask with AHA’s to see how that will help with fading remaining bits of PIH without triggering my rosacea) great for PIH; be cautious if you have rosacea
