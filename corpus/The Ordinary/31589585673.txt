This is a great product that has very fast results. It helps a lot with on the surface texture (because lactic acid is an AHA), and the Hyaluronic Acid is hydrating to the skin. I rated this a 4/5 because there are some more expensive lactic acid options that can be better, but overall, I HIGHLY recommend. Love this!
