I like this toner! Only flaw it’s a strong one that can’t be overused. I only use a very small amount once daily instead of twice after I remove my makeup. I follow with hydrating serums & moisturizer to prevent skin damage. If u have dry skin this is not for u. But if u use in moderation & hydrate it works well. Works well just in moderation
