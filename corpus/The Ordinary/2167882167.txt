OMG- I love this oil. First, let’s address the reviews that mention the smell of this oil. I have an incredibly sensitive nose and from reading the reviews I didn’t think I would be able to deal with the scent. This oil smells fine! Seriously! No issues. Now, we can move on the benefits. Endless! This oil is so hydrating, non-greasy, doesn’t make me break out, and my skin is so soft in the morning after wearing the oil all night. And, the oil has major anti-inflammatory properties. It helps with the redness on my neck and chest and it helps if I’ve increased my use of Retin A and my skin is sensitive. Love this stuff and the price is amazing. I have used luxery skincare from Chanel, SKII, SkinMedica, and more and this simple oil is one of my favorite products! OMG! Holy Grail Product!
