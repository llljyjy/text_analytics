For the price point you can’t beat it. I apply it on damp skin and most of the time when used correctly it gives me nice hydration. My sensitive acne prone combo skin doesn’t agree with any moisturizer so this acts as a good substitute when I need hydration. It’s counterintuitive but when I’m oily and breaking out sometimes it’s just because my skin was dry and in need or nourishment and this does it for me. Great product for price point
