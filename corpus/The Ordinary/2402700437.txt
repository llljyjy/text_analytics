The PERFECT amount of weightless hydration. I have dry sensitive skin so heavy creams and serums are a no-go for me. My friend recommended The Ordinary product line and Iâ€™m soooo happy she did. This hydrating serum is helping to quench my very thirsty skin with ZERO irritation or clogged pores. And the price is fantastic! Win Win! Totally Works
