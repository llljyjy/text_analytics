Seldom do I write a review. I’ll be leaving this same review on all 4 if The Ordinary that I use consistently; Hyaluronic Acid, Retinoids, Salicylic Acid, & Lactic Acid. Before using The Ordinary I had a list of issues with my skin; intense dry patches, small bumps, scarring, intense painful acne that just would not go away. I tried many paths, products and treatments to improve my skin and comfort and unfortunately nothing seemed to help.After about 1.5 months of continuous use of the ordinary my skin started to slowly change. The Ordinary products are wonderful, simple, no added unnecessary fillers/scents, ethical, and my favourite company. One of the only company’s I’ve remained loyal to because I respect their products and what they stand for. The Ordinary isn’t an end all be all, or a quick fix! Please take care of yourself. I’ve also worked on a lot of life issues, try to keep my stress low, take better care of myself and not overwhelm myself when I am able. I will say that in addition to all of this I don’t believe the drastic and intense changes in my skin are massive and I don’t believe they would’ve been possible without this brand. I’ve shared The Ordinary with friends, family, and clients. It’s affordable, simple, and wonderful. PHOTOS above are before I used the ordinary and after 7.5 consistent months of use. It’s taken me time and research to find which products are most beneficial to me! ☺️ There’s so much helpful info and videos from dermatologists on this brand and how to use these products, also suggestions on which will be best. Everyone I’ve introduced it to adores their products, I’ve never received so many compliments on my skin. (I’m my second photo I am only wearing a couple dots of concealer. (My scars texture is unreal)How ever, everyone’s skin is different.Just keep that in mind. ❤️ A Stand-Up Brand & A Staple Within My Home
