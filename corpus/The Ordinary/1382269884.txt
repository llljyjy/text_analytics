What does this do you may be asking? This treatment brightens, hydrates, and smooths the skin’s surface. It reduces fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation (such as dark spots, age spots, and acne scars).I use it at night because of the combination of product I use & because my skin is sensitive & I don’t want to increase any skin damage. Excellent for reducing fine lines & acne scares
