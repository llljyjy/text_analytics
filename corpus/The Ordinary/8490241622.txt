I have combo/dry skin with the occasional breakouts, and when my skin started to clear last month, I bought this to combat the hyerpigmentation. While my dark spots have not all faded yet, they did lighten significantly within the last four weeks! This is super easy to incorporate in my skincare - I cleanse my face with the Superfood Kale cleanser from YTTP and use the Glow Recipe BHA toner then layer this on top! I saw a lot of people use a similar routine and their skin is GLOWING. I can’t wait to see more results, but so far it’s promising! MY NEW HOLY GRAIL
