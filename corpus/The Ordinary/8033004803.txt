I used this product maximum twice at night  in combination with Matrixyl, The first time I fel a little tingling but after the second time my skin got badly inflamed and swollen. I stopped using it right away and stopped using any other products to make sure my skim can heal. It has been 2 weeks and my skin is still inflamed and swollen and only getting worse. I have sever burning feeling and swelling under my skin with redness and peeling. In am so devastated and dont know what else to do. I went to Saphia to show them and they returned the product but couldnt help in any other way.. If you se the pictures you will see how much it has damaged my skin. :( Davastated with the damage it caused to my skin
