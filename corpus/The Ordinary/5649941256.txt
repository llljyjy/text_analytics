I have stress induced rosacea and have a lot of trouble with my skin in the winter. Been using this for about a month and have noticed significant improvements, especially around the nose. It doesn’t leave a very smooth or velvety texture to your skin like other serums; it’s also more watery. But it seems to work and the price cannot be beat. nan
