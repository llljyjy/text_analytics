This is the best TO product, and the best azelaic acid on the market (and that includes prescription). I’ve probably gone through 20+ bottles of this stuff over the years. I use it morning and night. In the morning with salicylic acid if I have active breakouts, moisturizer + SPF. At night I use it with my sulfacetamide lotion, retinol, moisturizer & eye cream. You might be thinking: wow, how does your skin not burn off? It’s a mystery to me, too. Been using actives & acids for a decade since 16 and have built up the tolerance of a bull. Start slow if you’re new. I have hormonal cystic acne, dark spots & acne scars and when I use this stuff consistently with everything else my skin is smooth like butter. It also really helps with perioral dermatitis caused by masks. My derm suggested I use this twice a day to help with that and mine has cleared significantly! It’s one of the best things for pigmentation & dark marks. 100/10 I love this stuff! Best TO product!!
