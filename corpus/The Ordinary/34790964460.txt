Iâ€™m a teen experiencing some hormonal acne and this product has really helped with my skin. I still have a few breakouts but I have really noticed a difference in using this product. My skin is less oily, i have fewer blackheads, my pores are less visible, and my acne has calmed down a ton. I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks now and I really like it. If I continue using this product ever day than I think my skin could fully clear up in another week! love sm (great for teens)
