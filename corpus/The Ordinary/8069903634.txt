All I can say is, WOW! I have very dry skin and this product is extremely hydrating. I just received it this past week and have used it every night, and my skin is responding so well - itâ€™s smooth and staying hydrated for longer, and my skin is literally glowing after using this. I will continue using this and try some other serums from this line as well. I also have sensitive skin and have had no issues from using this product daily. hydrating and safe for sensitive skin
