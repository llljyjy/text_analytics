I use this on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris, and I think it works really well in reducing the redness and bumps. My dermatologist makes a lactic acid arm cream specifically for KP, but she only sells it in her office which is far from me. So, I’ve been buying this to combine with lotion for an alternative to her cream in the meantime. It does the job! I apply it to my upper arms after a shower and then, after it soaks in, apply skin fix’s glycolic acid cream for KP—or mix a few drops of the lactic acid into the lotion. The two together seem to work better than the skin fix-brand cream alone. I love that this is an inexpensive product, too. I haven’t tried using it on my face. good for keratosis pilaris (KP) on my arms!
