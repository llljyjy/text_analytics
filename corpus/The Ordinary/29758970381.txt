I have gone through 3 bottles of this stuff! Let me just say, it has “super star” performance. This has been the ONLY product that has diminished if not practically obliterated my 11 lines. I only have 1 of the lines and pretty deep at that. It has also smoothed out my forehead lines. I went without it after my first bottle and the lines returned. With any OTC product everything returns to previous state. Let’s just say, I repurchased this this quickly. I like be this stuff. I use it as the first step after cleansing in my skincare routine. Run don’t walk to purchase this and at such a beyond reasonable price. Super Star
