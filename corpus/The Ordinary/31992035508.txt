I use this every morning after I wash my face. I think the trick is not use too much or else it will (pill?) and take forever to dry down. Lightly pat the product on and do not aim to get every corner of your face. With continued use the product will eventually make its way around. Iâ€™ve been using for over a year and my skin looks fresh and bright. So worth it
