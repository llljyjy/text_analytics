I like this peel a lot.  I use it for the 10 minutes it instructs and then follow up with The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid serum and some jojoba oil.  It has helped dramatically.  And then with the hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil afterwards, it has definitely helped increase the efficacy of the jojoba oil (collagen production) and so it is helping me take care of fine lines by doing this process.  Love this and fabulous price point! Great Price Point AND results!
