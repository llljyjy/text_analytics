This is one of the best products for the price from The Ordinary range. It has made my skin so much more softer. Waking up nowadays to skin that has visibly changed. This along with Niacin-amide, HA, and Buffet completes my skin care for the PM. On a recent trip my friends asked me for my skin care routine. That is how much my skin has changed for the good! nan
