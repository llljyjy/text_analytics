Great! But I only use it when I’m either really tired, have to be up super early, or need to be super switched on, etcetera. I think using it every day could have a drying and/or negative effect. It’s amazing when I do use it, though, appearance and feeling-wise. I keep it in the fridge, too, and sometimes use rollers or a massager with it. It also works on the temples, wrists and anywhere it can absorb and wake one up. Winner!
