Y’all… I’ve been using this as hand cream and honestly it’s so good! My hands in this weather is cracked and irritated. This does not only have the hyaluronic acid to hydrate and draw moisture but it repairs without feeling sticky or greasy. I don’t think I ever need to spend $30+ for hand cream ever again. Buy this! USE AS HAND CREAM!
