I was staying at my friend’s place last fall and saw her applying this, but leaving it on. I had to ask. She described how it worked and I was sold, so I bought the mini size for a trial run. Will definitely keep this for travel, as airplanes and switching climates always makes my combo skin go wacky. Remember to let it sit on your face for a little while before you wash or wipe it away. It’s also great for cleaning parts of the body that are getting flaky. If you have keratosis on your arms like me, try it there. You might be delighted at the results. Like a combo mask/cleanser
