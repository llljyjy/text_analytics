This product is great if you are dealing with dryness during the winter. I have naturally combo/oily skin but for some reason this winter had me feeling like I had snake skin. My skin was dehydrated and this cured it!!! This works for those who are dry and oily! It has no scent and is like a medium thickness texture. It is not like a water cream or a thick lotion. Its in between and works well with makeup and sunscreen. Hyaluronic acid is a universal moisturizer ingredient and its popular for good reason. If you are sensitive to harsh ingredients or scents this could be your new holy grail! For ALL skin types!!
