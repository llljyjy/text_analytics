Love using this product on my face as a regular part of my morning and evening skincare routine. I apply this immediately after washing my face, and before hyaluronic acid and SPF and moisturizer. Works very well to make my skin feel hydrated. Squalane is supposed to help supplement your skinâ€™s natural moisture and I feel it does the job. I have dry skin and I have found that I avoid putting this on my nose and chin, as it makes those parts get dry and flaky. I have also found that I cannot use this alone, rather only in conjunction with hyaluronic acid and moisturizer (a must) otherwise my skin gets dry. But along with those two, I think it makes my skin feel good. Great for dry skin
