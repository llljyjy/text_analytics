It made my skin all shriveled up and crumbly. It gives you a false illusion of hydration as it makes your skin smooth (but I think itâ€™s just making it oily which gives the same impression as hydration). I stopped using this oil and noticed how much better my skin got without it. Do NOT try this oil as it will make your skin lose its plumpness and become crepe like. DO NOT BE FOOLED
