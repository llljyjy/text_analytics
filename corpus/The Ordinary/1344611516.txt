Great product that is very hydrating.    I use this as a night oil before bed or when my skin is feeling tight and dry.   I use it on the areas that are very dry on my face, neck and decolletage.  I donâ€™t put it on my nose area though since that area tends to be more sensitive to break outs.  Great price and a little goes a long way.  This company is amazing. Great product that is very hydrating.
