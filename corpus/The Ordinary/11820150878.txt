Only need one drop every time you use it so it lasts a long time. It’s an oil based feel but it absorbs so quickly. I’m not sure if I’ve noticed too much in dark circles, I have noticed that I’ve been getting some milia but that could be from other products seeing that I’m prone to getting them. It’s hydrating and doesn’t sting my eyes even though mine are very sensitive. Pretty good
