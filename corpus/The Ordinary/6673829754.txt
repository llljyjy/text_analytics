I have really sensitive skin and rosacea on my nose and my cheeks, and most moisturizers with scent like the lotus fresh one irritates my skin.I combined the ordinary’s moisturizer with first aid beauty’s sensitive skin face wash. This combo has been working so well with my skin! The only thing is that the moisturizer isn’t moisturizing enough, and I have to layer another light moisturizer on top for night time.Apart from that, it’s really worth it for the price. Will definitely repurchase when mine finishes. Perfect for sensitive skin and rosacea
