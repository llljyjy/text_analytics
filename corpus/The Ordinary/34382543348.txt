My Facial Skin Is Very Dry And Sometimes Broken So I Don’t Use This Product For That, But I Do Use This On My Scalp For Dandruff. The Point Tip Is Perfect For Application. This Just Helps Get Rid Of My Buildup And Danruff (I Have A Dry Scalp) I Apply And Wait 15-20 Minutes And Then Shower And It’s Perfect. I Also Use This On My Body Aswell But Mostly For My Scalp. Many Uses!!
