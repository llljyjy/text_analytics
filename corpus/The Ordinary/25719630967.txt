The smell isn’t bad no fragrance. Dry oil feeling. Doesn’t really absorb into skin. Heats up on face which to me DARKENS marks. Has this warm feeling. Tried to love this product twice. My skin just gets darker with each use. Once I stopped using this my skin gradually brightened back up. Very weird product. I say skip this. Didn’t break me out ! Just darkens my hyperpigmentation. I was hoping this did the opposite but nope. nan
