This is a great product with amazing ingredients 100% worth the purchase!!! ALSO just want to throw in how fun the little dropper is because apparently I am a child and had way too much fun using it (don’t touch it directly to your face/hand when using- hover lol) -I honestly ran down the stairs and showed my boyfriend because I felt like a little chemist haha soo fun and slightly embarrassing..Dont judge me.. this definitely isn’t my first face product with a little dropper in it....  Anyways it’s an amazing product for your skin in general and worth the purchase if you’re questioning it. all around a great experience :) Love This! :)
