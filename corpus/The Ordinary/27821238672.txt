Ok, so I had broken out in hives or something, and scratched all night... When I woke up my skin was unrecognizable. I had red lifted swollen patches all over my skin! It was horryfying.. I used THE ordinary Hyaluronic Acid followed by This Rosehip Oil...OH MY GOD MY SKIN HAD IMPROVED ABOUT 70% BY THE NEXT MORNING!!! I now use it regularly, and it has worked wonders for my face! 5 stars!!! I LOVE TO BASK MY SKIN IN IT BEFORE BED! Healed my terrible skin rash
