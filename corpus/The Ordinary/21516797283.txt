this thing is good, i am freaking good. i have dry skin and i am suffering from adult acne out of the sudden,, i had to stop using everything and the only thing that didn’t break me out was the cerave sa cream (which is good) but it did not cure the pimples and new acne so i kept using it for months, no improvement till i tried this mircle ,, in 3 days only i saw improvement! one week later i am and I am able to start using my other active ingredients again, i am back to using my c serums and all the other stuff at night , and i am using this serum in the morning. i got the one withiut the oil base as well and because it is summer i am trying to mix them together to make it less oily , maybe if you have oiler skin you need the other version without the oil... but for me this was perfect as i don’t even need to use a moisture after it in the morning,  note; i have been using prescription retinol for two months twicd a week to get red of the pimples but i saw no improvement (i will keep using it anyway), i saw the improvement only after this 7$ thing, i am impressed whoever made this thing, thank you!
