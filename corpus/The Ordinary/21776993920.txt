I never write reviews but wanted to make others aware. This product made my skin peel severely. I thought it was just the dry air but my fingers that touched this serum also started to peel. I would highly recommend spot testing before fully using this product. I have not changed any other products in my skin scare routine. As soon as I stopped using this product the peeling stopped.
