Honestly, I can’t tell if it’s doing anything but for some reason I like it. I’ve never been big on using serums though so I still haven’t learnt to recognize the good from the ’meh’! I’d say this is a ’meh’ for me though. I’ll finish the bottle then continue my search for perfection...that I never achieve :P MEH.
