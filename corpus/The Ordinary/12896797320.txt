I have a long history with acne. Cleared it up almost completely in my teens and twenties with accutane. It’s come back slightly in my 30s - especially jawline hormonal acne. I started prescription tretinoin and eased into a 6x/wk routine with that over 6 months. Tret helped but didn’t completely clear all breakouts. I thought about using benzoyl peroxide wash to help combat acne bacteria as another prong to my approach but I didn’t really like BPO. Realized Azelaic Acid can help with acne bacteria as well and so tried this for the past 4 months or so. It takes awhile to kick in - maybe 2 months for real results - I use at night with my tretinoin 6x/wk. Moisturize a lot. Adding this cleared the remaining acne that was bothering me and my skin looks great. Highly recommend for people looking for a multi-pronged approach to their acne. This + Tretinoin cleared my acne
