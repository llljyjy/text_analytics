Love love love! I have super sensitive skin so I’m always really hesitant when it comes to any skin products, especially serums, but after reading quite a few posts that this worked well with sensitive skin, I decided to go for it. I’m SO glad I did! My roommates noticed a difference in my skin, pretty quickly too, noting how clear it was and that it glowed. It didn’t cause any allergic reactions either! I even use it on my knuckles sometimes, when they get SUPER dry from washing my hands in the winter and doing dishes, before applying hand lotion and it makes a world of difference like you wouldn’t believe- even if that’s not a traditional use for it. Your face will thank you for this! Just be careful what products you pair it with- I’ve noticed that it works differently with different face washes and lotions. Either way, it’s worth it. It’s so inexpensive for what you’re getting too, and it’s a trustworthy company and not chalked full of extra ingredients. 10/10 Your face will be glowing!
