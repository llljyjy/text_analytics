I use this in my skincare routine, every morning and night. Right after washing my face with a Salicylic Acid Cleanser(The Inkey List), I apply a few drops of this evenly on my face, while my face is still wet/damp, as Hyaluronic Acid is said to absorb better into the skin with the presence of water molecules. I will never stop using this product, ever. This is one of my acne life savers(from The Ordinary), especially since I have Acne prone oily/combination skin. Along with the use of other serums from this brand, there is a noticeable difference in my skin. DO REMEMBER that the use of skincare will not only benefit your skin but will also increase its sensitivity(therefore more suspectable to UV damage), so ALWAYS wear sunscreen during the day.
