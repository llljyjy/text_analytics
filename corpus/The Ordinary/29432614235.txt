I love this product! I was a little scared to use this at first because I have combination skin and was worried this might make me feel more oily than I already am lol. But I was completely wrong! I only use this in my night routine and have been loving that it gives my skin the moisture it needs without it being too much for my skin, I have even noticed small bumps around my face (specifically on my forehead) have became basically invisible! Will definitely repurchase! Has worked amazingly with my combination skin!
