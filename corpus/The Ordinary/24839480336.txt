I had a broken moisture barrier and tried to add hyaluronic acid to my routine in order to rebuild it and this serum does the trick. Iâ€™ve noticed my pores decrease in size and my complexion smooth out, with no irritation. This is one of the more gentle serums from The Ordinary and great for hydration and firmness. nan
