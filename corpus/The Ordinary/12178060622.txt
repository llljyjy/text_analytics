Really disappointed. I bought this along with The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors and the two of them don’t go well together at all. This goes on very thick and sticky and once it absorbs into the skin, my skin still feels tight and dry. The moisturiser then goes on really thick and pasty on top of it. It also pills under my sunscreen and makeup. Not for me :/
