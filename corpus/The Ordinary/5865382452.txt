I used to use the now-renamed Buffet serum, but I decided to try something new because I felt like my skin was just so dry now that winter is here. As others have said, the texture of this is way more watery. I find that I have to use a little more product vs Buffet, because it soaks in SO quickly. I’ve been using Marine Hyaluronics AM and PM, followed by HA + Natural Moisturizing Factors, then sunscreen in the AM and a facial oil in the PM. My skin truly hasn’t looked this good in awhile and I’ve even noticed my under eye area seems more hydrated as well. This one is definitely a keeper for me in the winter and I’m curious to see how it’ll work in the summer months as well. Using twice a day and love it
