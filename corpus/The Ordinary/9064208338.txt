I don’t normally write a review but I really like this product. I have very oily skin, and I found mixing this with water and using first in my skin care routine has helped. My pores look smaller, my make up doesn’t melt off half way through the day, my skin feels smoother. Nice job Ordinary!! Yes for oily skin!!
