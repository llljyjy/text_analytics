Nice and gentle, got it to help support moisture on my face through the winter. I didn’t think it was doing much so I stopped using it but immediately noticed my skin was actually much more dry, tight and itchy without it! I hope it didn’t just get used to having it and now won’t be the same if I ever decide to cut it out though lol good for dry winters
