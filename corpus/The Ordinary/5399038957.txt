I love this toner! My skin is on the more sensitive side so I will use every other night with cotton, or pat a little bit with my fingers into my skin. I always wake up the next morning glowing, especially when paired with the ordinary retinoid squalane. Iâ€™ve tried other toners but I just keep coming back to this. I keep coming back to this toner!
