On my 5th bottle and will forever repurchase. Started using it while I was on Accutane to save my chapped, sensitive skin and haven’t stopped. Some people complain that it doesn’t fully absorb which I actually don’t mind, I want to make sure I’m getting as much moisture as possible at night and hate waking up with dry skin. I also use it under makeup in the winter for a dewy look. nan
