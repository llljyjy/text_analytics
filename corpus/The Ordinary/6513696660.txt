Please read the Ordinary’s instructions for this before leaving a negative review:1) this is not to be used in the daytime, so sunscreen pilling is irrelevant; 2) vitamin c is extremely unstable, so the grittiness of this formula is part and parcel to providing a stable formula 3) there are different types of C and this one is stated to likely cause redness and flushing on application; 4) C’s of all types have an *extremely short* shelf-life and brown-colored C is always bad (actually harmful)—throw it out!Ordinary (and other products) have shelf-life-once-opened icons on all products. This C is only 3 mo, which is why it’s such a bargain!It’s rare to have a product work as quickly as this does. When it’s fresh, it’s remarkable! Greasy, true:  I use this and only this at night (on nights I use C)And in the morning, voila! Noticeable improvement in texture and tone. Yes I change my pillow case frequently. I say, big deal against the results. Excellent, given limitations of Vit C
