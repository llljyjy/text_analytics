My husband got a penny size dark spot under his eye all of sudden last summer. I have kept applying this since then every night and after 3 month, we got shocked the dark spot was getting thinner. Now itâ€™s been almost for 6 month. It is very hard to see. But the dark spots on my face are not really changed... Better use this as soon as you find a new ones!!! It works especially for new dark spots!
