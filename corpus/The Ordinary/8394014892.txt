I’ve been suffering from hormonal acne for the past two years after never having acne ever. My skin used to look poreless but with my acne problems it’s emphasized the look of big pores on my cheecks. Since using this, it has smoothed out my skin, and it looks just like it did before my dry acne prone skin. Note, does not help with clearing acne, just helping the appearance of smooth, poreless skin. This could be just my skin type that it has helped this dramatically, but I definitely recommend for anyone with dry skin. Absolutely a life saver and it has really given me some of my confidence back. absolute favorite
