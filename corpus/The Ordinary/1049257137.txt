I love this powder! I like to mix it into my face masks to give them an extra boost. My favorite mask to mix it in is the Topicals Like Butter mask. I mix in a hefty scoop of powder and mix it in my palm before applying to my face, I leave it on for 20-30 minutes and it really brightens my skin! great mask mix in
