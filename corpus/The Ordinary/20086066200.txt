First of all, I love the prices of The Ordinary brand, so affordable. Second, I used this on my nose (I have clogged pores and blackheads on my nose), and I saw results overnight. When I woke up my nose wasnâ€™t as red as the night before and the scaring had almost disappeared. I was a little hesitant because it is an oil and I am not fond of oil on my face, but there was no irritation or stinging, it rubbed in and I washed of the access in the morning. Highly recommend. IT WORKS!
