I love this oil it’s not drying for me at all , I can’t tell if it’s really working that well since I’ve recently started using a bunch of products with acid in them so it could be a combination of all the products working but I would definitely keep using this , it’s soooo affordable and I do enjoy having it as part of my skincare routine . I would try it if this product is something you’re looking to clear up your pores my pores are definitely a lot less congested . The best it’s been in a long time and I have Very congested pores, acne prone skin, all that good stuff. nan
