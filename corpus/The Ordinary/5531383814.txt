I had the driest flakiest skin. My face has never been more hydrated and smooth! Winter summer it did not matter my skin around my cheeks made me want to ukh! I used to need to take off my make up to put on more moisturizer! Waste of makeup time and money! Saved my face and my pocket! WooOoOoOooooOoW is all I have to say!
