I bought this for all the ance scars I got during the pandemic and for some other scars as well. I’ve being using it for almost 3 months now and I literally have no idea if it’s even done anything. it is either very slow at fading scars, or doesn’t work at all. I’m considering trying Blume’s new fading serum instead; hoping that will actually work for me. I like putting this product on though, it feels like it’s helping, but isn’t really. I’m sure this works for many people, just not my skin it seems. Doesn't work for me
