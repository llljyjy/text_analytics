I absolutely love this. I break out easily and I’ve been using this twice a day (morning and night) I use it before I put on makeup…(I give it time to dry and sink in.. it takes awhile BUT 100% worth the weight it makes my makeup look flawless) I’ll def buy again just wish they sold a bigger bottle dry acne prone skin
