i don’t even know where to begin! i’ve heard a lot of mixed opinions about this product, but what azelaic acid targets were exactly my concerns so i decided to try it out anyway. very soon after i started using it my skin immediately just felt better, and as a result it looked better. it looked brighter and not as dull, and the majority of my texture concerns were taken care of. i will admit, it feels odd when putting it on. it absorbs very quickly into the skin. there’s not a greasy feeling at all whatsoever. i honestly think that this product only works for very specific skin problems and types, because i see so many people who have tried this and had the opposite result that i’ve had. just be mindful of your skin concerns, and take into account the other products you’re using, and your own personal preferences and you should be okay! have fun with your skincare journey :) this is a life changer!!
