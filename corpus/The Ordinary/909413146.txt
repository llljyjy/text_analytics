Love. Use with caution on sensitive skin (which I have) but this is one of my favorite peeling masks Iâ€™ve tried. I have sensitive/dry skin so as long as I put something nourishing on after I use this (Farmacy Niacinamide Night Mask, FAB Arnica Rescue Mask), its a great product that makes my skin look smooth and glowy. skin effective and cost effective!
