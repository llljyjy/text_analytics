My mother recommended that I try this. I have a micro-needler and I prefer this more. At first I could only leave a thin layer on for no longer than five minutes. Now I can make it a bit thicker for the whole 10 minutes. My skin looks smooth and even after I rinse it off. I think I use it 3 nights a week. nan
