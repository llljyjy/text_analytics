I’ve ordered this once and I’m here placing my second order for it. It’s a great everyday moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling plump and smooth without feeling oily at all. Doesn’t irritate my eye area if I accidently get too close to my eyes or rub my eyes after I apply it. I use it alternating nights with a heavier gel moisturiser before bed and my skin has felt amazing. A new regular in my routine
