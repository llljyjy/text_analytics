I wanted to love this so bad but it hasn’t worked out for me.. it makes my skin feel fabulous as far as texture & it really has minimized the pores on my nose BUT has caused me to have tiny whiteheads every time I try to incorporate it into my skincare routine. My cheeks & forehead especially which never break out are red and bumpy & I have new whiteheads when I wake up every day. I am discontinuing use & hoping it heals quickly. I think it would probably be more suited for someone with skin oilier than mine. I have combo skin & after reading a LOT of reviews all over the internet this problem is not uncommon. Unsure if it’s to high of a concentration (3-5% is the recommended) or if another ingredient in it is triggering it. So bummed! I thought it may just be “purging” which I could push through but apparently unless it’s an active acid or retinol it shouldn’t cause that since it isn’t increasing cell turnover. My skin doesn’t feel bad but the texture and bumps have got to go. Disappointed. wanted to love it.. but causing breakouts :(
