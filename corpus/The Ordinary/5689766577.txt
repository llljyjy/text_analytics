I don’t buy those expensive deodorant anymore. I stink a lot when I don’t put deo so it was a constant struggle for me to find a good one. I found out on Tiktok that you can use this as deo. So I applied on my ua and believe me I work in warehouse who constantly sweat but I did not stink. I never switched back to deo, it’s cheaper that it lasts me 8 months before I could finish a whole bottle for my ua. No to deodorant
