I really enjoy this product, but you need a decent amount of it to really remove makeup. There’s a little bit of a learning curve when getting used to this product because you have to really work it into your hands to warm it up and “loosen” the oil so it spreads more evenly. I’d say 30-40 seconds of intense rubbing between your hands melts the product down enough and there’s a noticeable change in viscosity. I like that this product isn’t too stripping and never leaves my face feeling raw or dry. The price is also great but I’m not sure how well it would work to remove heavier makeup nan
