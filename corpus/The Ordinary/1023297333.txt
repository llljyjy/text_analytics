I love this serum! While I don’t have a huge issue with oiliness anymore in my mid 30s, I bought this because niacinimide is a great brightener and redness calming ingredient. I take a medication that used to make my cheeks flush but using this has really tamped that down and my skin even looks brighter and more even. I use it twice a day after my toner and before moisturizer and it doesn’t affect makeup application or wear for me at all. It will be tacky feeling if you don’t follow with moisturizer, but it’s a serum and not meant to be moisturizing anyway. Plus that price point??? It’s all a win for me. Calms redness while brightening
