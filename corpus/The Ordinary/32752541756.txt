I love this product so much. inconsistent use has almost as much of an effect as consistent use; slathering this on when I have a random breakout works wonders the next day. it leaves your skin feeling clean and plump, and not overly dry (I’m a normal-to-combo/dry person). it doesn’t really minimize your pores (in my yearlong use of this product my pores have stayed the same) but it works beautifully in all other acne-related concerns. great for breakouts
