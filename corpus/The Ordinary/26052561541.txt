I am on my second bottle of the glycolic acid solution (which lasted me months to go through!!), and it is my favourite night time skin care product! I apply it most nights (6/7 days at least a week) and over the period i’ve been using it, i’ve noticed an amazing change in the uneven/dark spots from past acne. however this product did need some getting used it as it is a high concentrate of an acid and won’t work for everyone’s skin. i’ve always have tough skin that isn’t prone to irritation to strong products…so with caution i recommend this product to anyone with similar concerns!!!Lots of love to the ordinary!!!
