I originally bought this to just use on my face/hands occasionally. got it yesterday and really like it right off the bat. i used it for my face and hair and it made my hair sooo soft and no face breakouts today, it looks less oily than i usually wake up to too. I also have a really bad allergy to whatevers in our local water so my hands are literally wrinkled and cracked open with cuts constantly, noticed it felt less painful after i ran it through my hair so i put a bunch on my hands before bed too and today they are NOTICEABLY better. my skin isnt ripping open eveytime i move them and I havent even had to apply lotion today to prevent it, theyâ€™re still good just from the oil last night. i also love that theres nothing added to this, so i felt comfortable applying a bit to my young daughters long hair too. a little also goes a long way, my face only needed like one tiny dab from my fingers to apply all over :) it also smell kind of nutty to me. also imo keep this refrigerated! Amazing for rough skin
