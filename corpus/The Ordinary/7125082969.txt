PLS DO NOT USE TO PREVENT WRINKLES BEFORE YOU HAVE THEM! I am 22 years old. I didnt have any fine lines or pores that were too visible prior to using. I just wanted to be preventative. I only used this a couple times throughout 2 weeks. My skin DRIED OUT l a lot, makeup was NOT sitting on my face at all no matter how much I moisturized. My skin was peeling, exfoliating couldn’t even help it. I got smile lines (from the amount of dehydration I assume), my pores got insanely huge and I broke out. I stopped using and let my skin heal. In 2 weeks my skin got its hydration back/ makeup started to become wearable again, and in 3 weeks my pores shrunk back down. It’s week 4 of my skin healing, and my smile lines are definitely decreasing more each day. Maybe its designed to work for people who already have wrinkles, idk but I would not recommend this to ANYONE. NO it is NOT Botox in a bottle!!!!!!
