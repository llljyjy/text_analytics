This is the first mask I’ve tried that actually has made a difference. Right after rinsing it off I can already notice less redness and sensitivity on problem spots. It has a nice cooling sensation while it’s on. If you’re on the fence, go for it. I’ve been using it weekly and it’s been so good for my skin (along with other The Ordinary products) nan
