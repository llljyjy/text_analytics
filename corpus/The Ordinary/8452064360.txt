I am happy with the results of this serum. I personally had no issue and have seen results already, my pores are looking smaller. For those who have been breaking out from this serum, I think you should change the way you apply it. I also tried mixing this serum with my Cerave Moisturizing lotion and it hasn’t been breaking me out at all. Another way you should reconsider is to apply it after your moisturizer, especially if it’s a lightweight one. I hope this helps! It works! You just need to experiment a little
