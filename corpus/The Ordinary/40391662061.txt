I have  sensitive skin so i bought the smaller version of this moisturizer but to my surprise this turns out to be a great hydrator to my skin without giving me any redness or skin bumps. I usually use it after using ’The Ordinary’ serums. Great work by ’The Ordinary’ for creating these skin care products. A must have in my skincare routine
