I purchased this when I was at sephora returning the tatcha overnight cream (didnt like it and not happy that it contained PEGs). it was standing at the register and I figured why not, for 8 bucks its worth a try. i needed moisture and a barrier badly and tatcha disappointed me so so much. Let me tell you, its amazing. blew the tachta out of the water AND for 10x less. its the last serum i apply before my protini dupe (which I LOVE) and the results are excellent. this serum seals in the other serums and provides amazing moisture and moisture barriers. recommend a million times. Amazing
