If I could give this zero stars I would. Iâ€™m not sure why all the reviews are positive, this product has a strong smell that lingers on your hands for days, even after washing. It also stained my hands an orange-ish colour and it did not go away for weeks (almost looked like a self tanner stain) STAINS HANDS
