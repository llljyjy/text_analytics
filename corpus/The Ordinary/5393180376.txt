The texture of this product is better than the regular buffet, and I find that it is more hydrating. Iâ€™ve noticed better results with this, however it is a lot harder to use since you cannot use it with a retinoid or vitamin c. Also, make sure you completely wash this off before using vitamin c. I only lightly wash my face in the morning and my entire face my stained orange from the copper peptides oxidizing the ascorbic acid. Be careful if you use vitamin C.
