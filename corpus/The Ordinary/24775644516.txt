I can’t even remember how long I’ve been using this serum but it’s amazing. So worth the purchase and an amazing price. It’s hydrating and gives a tacky feeling for makeup on top but the tackiness goes away straight after face cream. Perfect for a simple routine or a start to skincare! absolutely an amazing buy!
