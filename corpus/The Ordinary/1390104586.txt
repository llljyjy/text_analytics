Iâ€™ve been using this mask for a few months, twice a week, and am on my third purchase. My skin is sensitive but always feels so fresh and clean after use. No irritation. Beware of the mess!!I usually do my mask before a shower to avoid making a mess in the sink or ruining wash clothes. messy but I love it!
