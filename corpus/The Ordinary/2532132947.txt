I’ve been using Three Ships skincare line for over a year now with phenomenal results, but thought I would switch to The Ordinary as it’s easier to get my hands on. BIG MISTAKE. I’ve used their recommended line up only four times, following the directions to perfection, and my face is red and breaking out. And that’s with their hydrating line! Not at all impressed. I’ll be returning the whole line up of products and staying with my tried and true skincare products. NOT WORTH IT
