Iâ€™ll open with a disclaimer:If you dislike slight stinging sensations on your face, steer away from this solution and look elsewhere!This exfoliating peeling solution is pretty effective, but SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY AND INFREQUENTLY! Please do not keep this on your skin for any longer than 10 minutes, though I recommend a little less the first couple of uses.Make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer afterwards. Great for those with blemishes / texture concerns. Intense, but effective!
