CAN I GET A HECK YES?! I hummed and hawed over purchasing this for months. After causing some irritation to my skin due to introducing retinol too fast as well as a toner that was too stripping, and knowing how my skin loves rose masks I decided to buy it. The results have been unreal. My current routine is a combination of Cetaphil soap-free cleanser, Dr Jart cicapair mist as a toner, Cetaphil hyaluronic moisturizer, Skin fix lipid moisturizer, Le Roche ultra fluid sunscreen, The ordinary rose hip oil, and youth retinol once/week (fyi don’t use rose hip with retinol on same night)… omg my skin is just radiant, velvety bliss. Can’t believe I went so long without a proper “routine”. For reference I have medium-sensitive skin, can be acne prone with the wrong products, and errs on the dry side. Every night after I use this stuff my skin just looks and feels “plumped” in the healthiest way, even notice a difference in my pore size and redness reducing. nan
