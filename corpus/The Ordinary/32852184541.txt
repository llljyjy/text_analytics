I was so excited to try this product as I love most of the ordinary products and specially because I have combination to dry skin. I thought this would work best for me during the cold season. That’s the reason I ordered 150 ml instead of the smaller one. It felt great for the first few days of use, my skin felt really smooth and not dry at all. But soon after I started to notice more blackheads around my nose and chin area plus the enlarged pores on my cheeks. And because I don’t use any makeup just my regular skincare products I only have this product is to blame unfortunately. I wish it worked
