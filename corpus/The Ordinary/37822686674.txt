This definitely doesn’t dry out your skin and I really like that but I feel it’s too oily for my oily/combination skin. I started breaking out when using twice a day so now I’m only using it at night and using another cleanser in the morning. This helped my skin clear up and stay hydrated. Not sure if I would buy it again, I guess when I run out of it I’ll see how I do with a regular cleanser and if it’s actually better for my skin to use this one once a day. Very hydrating - beware oily skin users
