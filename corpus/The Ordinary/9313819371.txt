So I have used this moisturizer for months now and this is what I will says. This moisturizer is good but not the best you will use. It does what it needs to do and nothing extra. However that isn’t necessarily a bad thing! I tend to gravitate to this moisturizer whenever my skin is agitated or can’t handle more intense ingredients. I have also had my teenage brothers use this moisturizer since I know that it won’t do anything too crazy to their hormonal acne prone skin. The texture is similar to sunscreen in that it’s thick and you have to rub it in but once it’s in your skin (for my dry skin) I don’t feel it anymore. If you are someone that wants a moisturizer that just does what it’s meant to be then this is your guy to get. And if you’re someone that wants to maybe get into more intense ingredient skin care products I also recommend this moisturizer as it’s helped me whenever I use new bha products. A Good Backup
