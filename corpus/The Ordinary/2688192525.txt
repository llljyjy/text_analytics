I bought this to lighten dark spots on my face. Irs rmtoo early to call it, but the texture of my skin has improved dramatically.  As far as the stinging mentioned in other reviews,  it stings slightly and is not nearly bad enough to make me want to discontinue use.( Maybe if someone had sensitive skin). It is slightly gritty going on, but I use it at night under a moisturizer so it’s not an issue.  It’s a steal at this price, so it’s worth it to keep using it to see if it fades dark spots. Absolutely worth a try!
