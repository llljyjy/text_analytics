Okay, don’t everyone freak out about it being red. It absorbs into your skin like any other good product.......and this stuff is good! I noticed an immediate improvement in the look And feel of my skin. There is a softness and a smoothing effect that seems to reduce the signs of age. I am not one to shout “holy grail” about every new flavour of the month....but this stuff is a glass of red wine in front of a fireplace. Don’t judge a serum by its colour.
