I have sensitive skin, prone to redness and I have rosacea. Over the last two years, I’ve begun to notice patches of my skin that were always rough and dry and refused to leave despite using exfoliators (Tatcha) and trying oodles of oils and moisturizers. I had hesitated about trying an acid to chemically exfoliate because of my sensitive skin. I saw the lactic acid on a TikTok and decided to give it a shot. My skin has never been smoother, more hydrated, or clear.I haven’t had any reactions or burning sensation with this acid. I might try the 10% next time around. This is an absolute gem of a product!
