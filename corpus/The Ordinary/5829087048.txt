I have mixed feelings on this serum. I’ve used it and repurchased it several times because it is such a great, inexpensive option for a hyaluronic acid. But as a lot of hyaluronics do, it dries down very sticky. The stickiness improves once you follow it with a hydrating moisturizer (I’ve had different results with different moisturizers, creams worked great with it, gels did not) and it’s best applied to a face that’s still a little damp. But the sticky, uncomfortable feeling it leaves is what keeps me from completely loving it. nan
