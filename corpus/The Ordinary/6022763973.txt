It does show a difference in the “vitality” look of the skin, super gentle, no scent. But I really hate serums that are sticky when they sink in. You absolutely have to put something on top that has some kind of moisture or oil base. I debated 4 stars but even at the great price point the absorbing texture is really a turnoff for me. Others may not have an issue and it does seem to “gently” work so I’d recommend it if you’re not weird about textures like me. nan
