I have combination skin. I tend to get shiny/oily in the t-zone as the day progresses, but I also have dry patches. I have the occasional breakout, but do not have acne. I am super- impressed with this product. It was recommended by Gemma (Pampered Wolf) on YouTube & I wouldn’t have thought to use a salicylic acid product in the past. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and have noticed my sebaceous filaments (pores on the nose) have cleared up & appear smaller. I will definitely keep using this product. Let it soak in for 10 min or so before doing your makeup (along with any other skincare) and you’ll be good to go! This will be a staple in my skincare regimen!
