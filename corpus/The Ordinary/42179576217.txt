I have stuck to one toner that I absolutely love for years now and wanted to try something new. I use this alongside the hyaluronic serum, and niacinamide serum by The Ordinary. I wish it had more of a nice smell, but it doesnâ€™t stop me from using it. It feel pleasant on the skin, but AI did notice it felt strange near my eyes. Think I may just be sensitive to the formula. Going to keep using it and post another update soon! Great Value!
