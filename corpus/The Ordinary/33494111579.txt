I tried most of The ordinary line. Some are so so, others are insanely good. This is one of them. I have combination skin. This serum is a thick formula. A drop or two is more than enough. Dries fast. Took about 2 months of daily use to see the real results. From the first application though it made my skin feel fresh. A month later, the oil production is reduced (and is summer! I cant believe it). I am 45 so my pores started to be more prominent that i like. This product shrunk them dramatically by month two. Used along with a retinol night cream and the Ordinary retinol oil, my face now is so much smoother and even colored. I still tend to have some hormonal pimples in that time of the month, but not anymore! I highly suggest this product, worked better than Glow recipe watermelon dew drops for me. No need to spend a fortune for products that actually work! Insanely good product.
