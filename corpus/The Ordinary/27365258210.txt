I love this toner. It really helped clear my skin up, however, I do find that it can be pretty harsh. I only use it on the days where I’m extremely oily, as I find that it can substantially dry me out (more than other exfoliants for acne). I would turn away from this if your skin is pretty sensitive, or dry, as this can bulldoze absolutely all the moisture out of your skin, more than other products. I do find that there are more pros than things to be weary about surrounding this product. The bottle is massive and  contains so much product, which is amazing for the price. Because of that, I find that you can use it on the body as well, as it doesn’t use up a lot of the product for the amount that you get. It’s extremely cost effective for the benefits that it gives, and is extremely versatile. It really helped with texture both on my body and face, as well as razor bumps. I would definitely recommend this product for those who have oily/combo skin thats acne prone, has texture, or dark spots. AMAZING for acne
