I use this every alternate day and after drying, I top it off with moisturiser. I noticed a slight difference in skin brightness so it works, but there’s pilling and it stings a little- especially at first. I developed some rashes but I am not sure if it’s the vit C or something else. I’ve read that this is a high concentration of Vit C and may not suit everyone, especially dry skin like mine. but I’ve never had a reaction to anything ever. it works but be careful
