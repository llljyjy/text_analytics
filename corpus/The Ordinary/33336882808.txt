I initially got this product to moisturize my skin and to brighten it, because rosehip seed oil contains a percentage of vitamin C. Anw, after 3 days of using it, I started developing comedonal acne aka whiteheads. So it turned out that it is comedogenic. However, I gave it 4 stars because i used it on my skin, and mainly on my back because of acne scars and it really helped with making my skin look healthier. It didnâ€™t suit my face
