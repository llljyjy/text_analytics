So far, so good. I added it to a tiny sifter jar to take on holiday, been shaking a bit in to hyaluronic acid (Chemistry), applying that after my sake toner, followed by CosRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, prior to moisturizer (Cetaphil, Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors), sunscreen (create 30SPF tinted). It tingles a little on my ageing, sensitive skin, but no redness. My face is tighter, I’ve had to add a thin layer of Clinique 100h because it’s winter. For the most part, The Ordinary products don’t irritate my skin, but if I used more than a small amount, it would burn my skin (likewise, the Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid toner is far harsher than Pixie Glow, and I can only use that 1x/week, at most). I can’t say I’ve noticed a difference yet, aside from tautness. I’ve tried other ascorbic acids in the past, which burnt my skin, were immediately donated to friends. So far, so good
