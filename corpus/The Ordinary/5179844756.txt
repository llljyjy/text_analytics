I didn’t expect this product to work, but it really did. I’ve only been using it for a few days and the stress acne I had in my forehead started fading away, and the maskne on my cheeks as well! The scent is faint to non existent, it has almost an oil like consistency so I only need 3 drops (forehead & each cheek) and it spreads smoothly and evenly. I used it after toner and before moisturizer. Will definitely continue to repurchase! amazing new addition
