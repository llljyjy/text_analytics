Finished the bottle today.Doesnâ€™t soak into the skin easily. It takes 5/10 to absorb into the skin. And leaves the skin oily.Nothing changed after 2.5 months of use.I have been using vitamin C since 2+ years and tried various brands. This one has been pretty upsetting. Takes time to soak into the skin
