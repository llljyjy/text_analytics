I feel like this toning solution just doesn’t do it for me. I hate that it feels as watery as it does and it’s such a small percentage of Glycolic that you just don’t really see results. I think it’s hyped up because I mean this is a very affordable skin care brand with SOME gems, but this just isn’t one of them tbh. Meh
