I have annoyingly dry winter skin right now. I’ve been using pure Argan oil on my face because it doesn’t cause breakouts. I recently switched to this instead. 10/10. No breakouts and a better slightly thicker consistency than what I was using before. Still a very light hydrating oil and sits nicely under makeup when I use a little to seal in my moisturizer. Can’t go wrong for the price either! love it
