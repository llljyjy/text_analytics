This product was recommended to me by a friend. I brought this at Sephora, I thought I could return it if I didnâ€™t like it. But I quickly fell in love with this product. It helped to reduce the appearance of my pores and slowly helped with healing my skin with hyperpigmentation.  A small amount goes long away with his serum. It worked beautifully in a combination with other skincare and makeup products. works wonders
