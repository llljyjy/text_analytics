This is my first facial oil purchase. It was on a list of top face oils and after reading reviews on it I decided to purchase it and give it a go. I am not a skin expert and donâ€™t know if my method of usage is correct but I add two drops of this oil to my moisturiser and apply it to my face. I have dry skin, especially in the cold dry months of New York winters, and this little recipie I use works wonders. It hydrates my skin better than my moisturiser alone and I can really feel the differance in how soft and supple it leaves my face. It is not greasy or oily at all but gives me the extra protection my skin needs in the cold weather months. It has a scent to it but its natural and goes away once on my face very quickly. No product is a miracle remedy and everyones skin is different, but this was a very good find and for me makes a noticeable differance in my skins moisture levels. I have very sensitieve skin and did a patch test prior to using to make sure I had no reactions to it. A Great Find
