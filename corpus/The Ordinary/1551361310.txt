Wow. I have good skin, generally, but it’s been dry and a little lackluster. I thought I’d mix it up and loved the reviews. Well -- I opted for 8 minutes having been warned that it’s strong. It left my skin a little dry but nothing crazy. Over the next day or two, though, my cheeks ERUPTED into the worst acne I’ve ever had in my life. Like others have said here, it’s not normal acne and nothing like I’ve ever experienced before. This is the only new thing I’ve tried. I’m uploading two photos, one of the day of the breakout and one two days after when I managed to get it under control. I’m terrified of this stuff now. Haha!I would not normally classify my skin as “sensitive“ at all so I did find this surprising.If this happens to anyone else: Take two Benadryl and slather hydrocortisone cream on the affected area after cleaning it with something very, very gentle. Drink lots of water, get lots of sleep for a day or two. Holy gross pizza, Batman!
