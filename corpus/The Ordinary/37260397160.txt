This product has quickly become an essential in my daily routine. It makes my skin feel super soft and hydrated, and I don’t seem to struggle with oilyness as much anymore now that I’ve started using it. It does feel kind of sticky on my hands when it dries a little, but I just rinse my hands off under the tap after I apply this and my moisturizer and the feeling completely disappears. The smell isn’t too funky and this product is super affordable. I would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a cost-effective way to add a hyaluronic acid into your routine! Makes my skin feel amazing!
