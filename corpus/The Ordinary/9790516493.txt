absolutely saved my skin! super hydrating and doesnâ€™t break me out. i used to have a really big issue with dryness after taking acutane and spent FOREVERRR trying to figure out how to calm my skin down. 4 years later and this is has been a tried and true for the past two. would definitely recommend, and (at least for me), leaving your face slightly damp with cold water when you apply it makes it work 10x better :) nan
