This works! I’m in my early 30’s and RBF has created a single pronounced line between my eyebrows. I wanted something that would calm it down without use of retinoids. You start to notice the difference in about a week. It’s not a permanent fix (hence the 4 stars). Add it into your routine daily, 20 min before makeup/moisturizer. For the price it’s unbelievable, and I view it as a preventative product. Gentle Fix for Set in Lines
