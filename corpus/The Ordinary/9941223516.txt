Super bummed about this. I love The Ordinary products but this serum breaks me out every time I use it. I notice no difference in my skin other than breakouts which then creates a whole new issue I have to deal with. I had gotten a sample of the Biossance copper peptide serum and loved it but wanted to save money. For whatever reason this just didnâ€™t agree with my skin. There are definitely better copper peptide serums out there for more breakout prone sensitive skin types. There is better out there
