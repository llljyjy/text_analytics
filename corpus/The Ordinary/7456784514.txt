I’ve only used this ONCE and I’m going to recommend it to everyone! I have KP (keratosis pilaris) on my arms and legs pretty badly. After one use this has helped a TON. My skin is so soft and clear. I use other KP products like a scrub and lotion but adding this to the routine is going to be a game changer. I only left it on about 5 minutes. The directions say no more than 10 NOT to leave it on for 10. It does start to burn a little, that’s just when I rinsed off in the shower. Put it on dry skin and rub in. A little went a long way and it’s crazy affordable. I use it in combo with the KP scrub from FAB and the lotion from Skin Fix. All of these products make you more susceptible to sunburn so make sure you wear your sunscreen. Also, I did use it on my face and it was nice, but the body was a big deal for me. Helps with KP!
