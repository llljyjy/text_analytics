a little goes a long way with this stuff! I mix with the ordinary rose hip oil or sometimes right into my moisturizer (Kiehl’s squalene). it is a bit tingly (which is normal) at first but not irritating. after a week of using it my skin looked glowy and fresh. it’s a big tub and I have a small face so use only about a quarter of a scoop (or less). the amount of product will last long but I’m not sure if it will provide the same quality over time. so far so good though. great boost for skin
