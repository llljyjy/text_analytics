I love this! I was using The Inky List Balm to remove my make up previously and WOW it doesn’t hold a candle to this cleanser. It’s not messy and thick like others. It’s a lotion consistency you emulsify between your hands until it turns into an oil and then rub all over your dry face. It doesn’t smear melted mascara all over (I have no idea how it doesn’t do this) it just simply melts it away. This cleanser is amazing! nan
