I was not expecting this to be so good but WOW. I get a lot of tiny little white head pimples on my face, especially when I use new makeup. I apply this onto my face at night time after my toner and then followed by a moisturizer. By the next morning there are literally no bumps. The only other product that i’ve used that’s really helped with texture and acne is the differen gel that you can only get in the states. This is definitely replacing that, my skin looks so good! It’s so hydrated and smooth. nan
