I tried to love this and I though I did for a while however I think it just ended up being to harsh on my skin which caused more irritation. I would not recommend using this more than once every two weeks if you do end up using it but I think there are better exfoliations on the market. I did see that people were using it on their scalp for dandruff or on their armpits as an alternative to deodorant. I might try the deodorant hack or end up using it on my feet or places that can handle the power. Overall just wouldnâ€™t use it on my face anymore. A little too harsh for me
