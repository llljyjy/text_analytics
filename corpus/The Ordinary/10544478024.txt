Since winters are so cold and the wind dry, I always apply the squalane before going out for a walk or 1h before bedtime so it has time to absorb. I also use it with my roller in the morning for depuffing, it works miracles - my face is instantly more awake and glowy looking. Although I have acne prone skin, it never caused me any breakouts and I am on the 3rd bottle. Perfect for an extra winter hydration
