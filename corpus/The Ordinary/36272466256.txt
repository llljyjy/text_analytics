I don’t demand much from my cleansers. I just don’t want them to make my face feel stripped and I want them to rinse off cleanly. I’ve been using this as my night cleanser, and this works great to get the day off without being stripping at all and without me feeling like I have to rinse a thousand times to be free of residue. Bonus: it plays nicely with my silicone electronic brush, and is easy to wash off of it. On the down side, I do feel like I need to use quite a bit of product as it doesn’t seem to spread very well. I don’t tend to wear much makeup, but when I do I have to double cleanse as this takes quite a bit of time to get rid of any makeup despite it saying “makeup remover“ right on the bottle. gets the job done for an affordable price
