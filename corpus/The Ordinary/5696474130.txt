I moved from Vancouver Island to Northern BC two years ago and have had the WORST hard water build up in my scalp. My hair was constantly dry and my scalp was always so itchy and filled with build-up from the products I use and the water. I tried a water filter in the shower head, clarifying shampoos but nothing was working untill I found this. I use this once a week on my scalp and leave it on for about fifteen minutes before showering. Then I use a scalp massager to masssage in my shampoo and this melts the build up away. My hair is finally back to its healthy, shiny state again with very little build up. I also go to the gym 5 days a week and I can now go a week without washing. My scalp is no longer itchy like it was when I first moved up here. I highly recommend this as a scalp treatment especially if hardwater if your issue! Use a scalp treatment for hard-water buildup
