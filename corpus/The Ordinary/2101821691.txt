Used as it directs you but even after trying this for about 2 weeks it continuously felt a stinging burning feeling under my eyes even though I kept the product from touching my actual eyes and water line. My skin is not typically sensitive so I found that strange and surprising but that’s something to keep in mind if your skin is sensitive. Overall didn’t add much hydration or noticeable difference to the skin in the short period I did use it. Stings my skin
