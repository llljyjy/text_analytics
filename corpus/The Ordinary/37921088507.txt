For the longest time all I ever did in the name of skincare was washing my face and moisturizing on occasion, but still had areas I felt needed some additional attention, such as redness and inflammation that wouldn’t necessarily be noticeable from a distance but was still very prominent in close proximity. I chose this product initially because I researched my needs and what might be suitable for addressing the particular issues I was having, would be gentle for sensitive akin, and also taking affordability into consideration. I remained skeptical simply because everyone’s skincare needs vary and products are not a “one-size-fits-all” so I was prepared for it to potentially not work as well for me as it did others. Saying I was STUNNED by the very visible results I experienced after just 2 weeks of using it once nightly is an understatement. My skin looks so much clearer and feels like it has more of a glow to it. I also use a hydration cream and collagen booster in conjunction with the toning solution, and honestly, upgrading my skincare routine has been one of the most pleasant decisions I could’ve made for myself recently and can’t wait to see how it helps my skin with continued use.
