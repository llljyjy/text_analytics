I thought I was a skincare expert and then I had a facial and the esthetician used a mandelic peel.  I had never even heard about mandelic. We both were blown away with the results.  So, I wanted to incorporate mandelic into my routine.  Wow!! My skin looks so radiant and I am on day 3.  $8… is just amazing.  When I was younger, I had very severe acne. Now I am approaching 48 years old and I’m concerned with aging and dryness. This product is simply awesome. I let it sink in for a few minutes and then I apply oil and then a moisturizer. Very happy. amazing
