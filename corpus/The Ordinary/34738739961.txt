I have been using lactic acid for 2ish maybe 3 months now and I absolutely love. I use it every night after washing my face and it is the first serum that has actually made my face clear up. My scarring is pretty bad and makes my face look hideousâ€¦ I am so insanely happy with how much my skin has improved. The only reason I say 4 stars is because it takes kinda a long time to see dramatic results but it is so worth it. My scarring has faded quite a bit and everyone keeps telling me my face looks so much clearer. I recommend, go buy. Personally, I think you should buy it :)
