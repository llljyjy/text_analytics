I was really hoping this worked for me after all the positive reviews. I use it twice a day for about 2 months now and don’t see a difference unfortunately. I’ve tried many eye creams and eye patches and nothing works so maybe it’s just me.. I get enough sleep every night so I think my dark circles are due to another issue didn’t work for me
