This is the second time I’ve got something from The Ordinary (the first time was their moisturizer, which was great), and as someone with really dry skin, I decided to give this serum a try.

My biggest issue is the pilling — if The Ordinary could reformulate and somehow get rid of whatever causes it, I would definitely rebuy. But for now, I’m just going to use it just because I have it.
