I love this product. I have repurchased this 4 or 5 times. I use it every morning after I get out of the shower and before applying lotion and then makeup. It instantly lifts my skin and helps to draw the moisture from my lotion. Using lotion alone does not provide as much moisture. It also helps to get past blemishes - even deep ones - by regenerating my skin cells. Using this product consistently is the key to long-term changes and it is so worth it! My Skincare Essential
