This does seem to help with my rosacea, although it stings quite a bit if I’m having an actual flare up, so it’s better as a preventative.You may need to experiment with the order or type of other products you use it with, as it pills quite badly in certain combos.I’m not a fan of the packaging. The cream is quite thick, and it becomes difficult to get out of the tube long before the product is used up. nan
