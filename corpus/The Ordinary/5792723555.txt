This is probably my favorite product from The Ordinary so far. My skin is super oily but when I wash my face, let it dry, and put this on, my skin soaks it all up. My skin glows. One of the Sephora employees was even surprised that I have an issue with oily skin because this really helped to control it. I’ve had no problems with pilling either. It’s rich, creamy, brightening… just perfect. Will continue to purchase just please don’t ever change the formula for this. nan
