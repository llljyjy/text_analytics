Omg, this is my new holy grail product! I was scared to use the serum at first because I’m new to skincare, but wow. This product is incredibly hydrating and doesn’t break me out. I put it on underneath my moisturizer; it helps prevent (and treat) dry skin. Imo this is a must-have product for those living in Canada who are forced to bear the wind and the cold! My new FAV skincare product! Bye bye, dry(ness)!
