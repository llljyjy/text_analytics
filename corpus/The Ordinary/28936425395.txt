For the price it’s great. I’m seeing nice results with my acne problem. I don’t use it every day and usually try to only use it at night or on the days that I don’t wear makeup because it pills a bit under my foundation and it’s a bit sticky when rubbed into the skin. I always follow with a hydrating serum and a moisturizer and that seems to do the trick. Would I repurchase? Probably not. I can problem get the same results from something with a nicer texture. But I will finish the bottle because it’s good for sensitive skin and it does the job. Good Price. I See Results. Not Amazing Texture.
