The first few times I tried this, I didn’t feel like it did much to my skin so I let it sit on my shelf for a while. I typically use TO’s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 serum but my skin is still super dry-- I also recently started using tretinoin (rx grade retinoid) and my skin has been more flaky and irritated than usual as I get used to it, even on off nights when I do a full hydrating routine. On a whim I decided to use this product again since my skin is still so dry (even with the HA 2% + B5), and much to my surprise I woke up for the first time without ANY flakes on my face. I was seriously impressed that this water-like texture helped so much more to repair my skin barrier than the thicker HA serum, especially after the first times I used it when it didn’t do much for me. This is now my go-to for when my skin is dehydrated and dry. Huge fan of this now. Helps when you really need it
