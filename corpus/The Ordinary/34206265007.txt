This product is so sticky and does not absorb nicely into your skin. It helped minimally with hydration but was not worth it as the stickiness made it impossible to wear makeup. Whenever I tried applying my tinted moisturizer after applying this serum, the moisturizer would clump together and make it look like my skin was peeling off in chunks. I even tried waiting 30 mins after applying this serum before moving on to my tinted moisturizer and it did not help at all. Very Sticky / Not Effective
