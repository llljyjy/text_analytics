This is truly one of the most important products in my skincare routine. Been using it for two years now, and nothing has come close to being as effective in terms of evening out my skin texture. It effectively brightens skin and gives me the most beautiful glow, and my skin feels much smoother. You can try the 5% solution if your skin is more sensitive, but this 10% feels just right for me! Most effective exfoliator!
