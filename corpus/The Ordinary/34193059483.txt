i have super oily and acne prone skin and i think this was the trick to hydrating my skin without leaving it greasy. hyaluronic acid is too heavy to me, and this was a great substitute. i had some acne breakouts recently, but i figured out that this was NOT the culprit (i tried 2 products at once which was my mistake). nan
