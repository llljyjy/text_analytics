I’ve been using this for the past two weeks and it has done wonders on my skin. I have combination skin so the downside is that my t zone is a little oily after, but I usually fix that with a little bit of setting powder. In my experience it has made makeup a little hard to stay on all day, but because of it I don’t even need to use my concealer that much anymore. Definitely recommend! Awesome!
