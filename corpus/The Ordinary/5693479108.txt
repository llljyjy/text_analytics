I really like this product. I have combo skin and sensitive skin, and this product works great. I apply it in the morning, and it does stink a little bit but when I add my moisturizer on top the tingling sensation goes away. It leaves my skin looking dewy and bright all day. I do not have any issues with pilling. Texture is grainy but it blends in well. If the graininess bugs you, you can add this product to serums and/or moisturizers. Dewy and Bright
