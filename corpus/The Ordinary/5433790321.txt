Love using this product, it keeps my skin really nice and hydrated. Especially during the super cold, Chicago winters!! I was peeling last week from the cold leaving my skin dry, repurchased and have noticed a difference in my skin within a week! (Along with using a super hydrating moisturizer). Love it, canâ€™t beat the price either love it
