For the price you’d think you struck gold! Cheap, affordable, 100% argan oil. Now why is this so cheap compared to other 100% argan oils that sephora offers? Well, i’m sure the money other brands have, they’re able to minimize or mask the scent while still keeping their products natural. In saying that yes this product literally smells like cow feces, or any sort of feces. Suddenly the expensive price point of other oils do not sound bad at all. I knew it was too good to be true! too good to be true
