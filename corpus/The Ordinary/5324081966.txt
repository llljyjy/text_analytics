I fell for this hyaluronic acid because of all the hype, I usually use LRP, but wanted to try this one that it’s all over social media, it says it’s an Allure winner and… well it’s pretty cheap. Honestly, I’ve tried layering it with different things and with nothing at all, and the result is always the same, it doesn’t absorb into my skin, you can just feel it there, making your skin feel super tight, and ends up pilling and leaving flakey residue. Its unlike any other hyaluronic acid I’ve tried before, but I guess you get what you pay for. Don’t bother, bad product
