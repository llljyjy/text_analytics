I’m on my second bottle.. I love this serum… HA’s are exfoliants so be careful, it might sting or burn a little if you apply this after washing you’re face…regardless, if this burns my skin off, I wouldn’t care, it does wonders for my skin, has never made me break out, the “redness” doesn’t last long at all, and it doesn’t really have a smell if you hate that kind of thing. love it love it, you need it
