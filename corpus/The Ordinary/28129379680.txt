This serum works excellently for brightening, hydrating, balancing skin~ (combo-oily)I have repurchased several times and it is a staple in my skincare routine !One thing I would mention is that it has a bit of stickiness and it can pill so ensure you apply on damp skin or after a facial mist perhaps ( ´∀｀) nan
