I recently battled a case of contact dermititus caused by using too many actives. This was the only cleanser I tried that didn’t further irritate my skin. I find it is best used with a facecloth to remove the oil after cleansing. Just rinsing with water doesn’t remove all of the product. It also doesn’t remove all of my makeup, especially mascara. However, at this price point, I don’t mind also using micellar water to get the rest off on those days that I’ve applied full makeup. Very good product at the price point
