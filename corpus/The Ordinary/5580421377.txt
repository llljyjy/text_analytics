After using other products, many. many other products from Sephora, from Sephora salespeople, which now feels like 1 out of 10 is going to be knowledgeable & helpful to me, not their commission or quota, I found The Ordinary products. My 1st thought was truly, what is this really made from as the prices were so low, it was hard to believe this product had substance and/or had unknown ingredients that may or may not be legal in this country...turns out this is a great line of products, priced so right that truly anyone can afford to have clean & clear skin. Thank you. This did help my acne, along with yr other products which I will also review. If you have any blemishes, this is a great bottle that will last a long time. The Ordinary is Extra- Ordinary
