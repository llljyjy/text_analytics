For the price point and simple ness, it truly is a great product. I use this serum everyday, making sure my face is damp before applying so it retains the water, and I haven’t had dry skin since! Very hydrating and doesn’t make me more oily or anything. Really recommend if you’re looking for a simple hyaluronic acid serum! would recommend!!!
