I’ve been using this for about a week now and at first I was mixing one drop of this with one drop each of the Ordinary’s Rosehip Oil and Resveratrol/Ferulic Acid, then warming the blend in my hands then pressing the mix on my face and neck at night. Lately I’ve been adding one drop of this to my Youth to the People Adaptogen moisturizer in the morning after washing my face with cold water and my skin feels so nice. I love how flexible the Ordinary products are. You can really customize and experiment by adding a drop or two to any other products you’re using. I’m in my late 30s and skincare is a priority for me. I haven’t worn makeup in over 2 years  because I needed to heal my skin from my acne issues. Now that I’m noticing some fine lines, adding antioxidants to my routine is helpful and this product is a very affordable way to amp up your skincare and make it suit your needs. Just a drop . . . makes a difference
