I don’t have acne, but I use this in my T-zone and a bit on my cheeks beside my nose when my pores look clogged up. For me, it works really well to rid of sebaceous filaments and make my pores look much less visible by the next couple days. I use a very small amount to spread a very thin layer and work it in since it takes time to fully absorb, then follow with “the buffet“ serum. I have no issues using it AM or PM, and I’m sure a clay mask would pair with it well. amazing for pores
