Okay so I have oily acne prone skin. Pros: This isn’t irritating and didn’t break me out. This sits nicely on my skin. It gives a bouncy feeling on my skin. Cons: it takes a lot to absorb into the skin. I apply it to damp skin along with the ordinary hyaluronic acid and it still needs a ton of massaging into the skin. I do feel the overall feeling my skin is left with is worth it especially for the $$. Black Oily Acne prone skin approved
