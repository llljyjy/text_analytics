This is a gel-like formula and wasn’t all that hydrating so I won’t be repurchasing and will be sticking with creams. I decided to finish the entire bottle cuz why not and there wasn’t any long-term results which I wouldn’t expect from a cheap skincare product. After a while, it does get crusty along the rim of the bottle from dried product Finished but saw no difference
