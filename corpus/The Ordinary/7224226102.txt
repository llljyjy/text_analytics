I’ve been using this product for about a year now - while I don’t think it’s made any improvements re: dark circles around the eyes, it definitely soothes the eye area when I apply it in the morning. I wouldn’t say the de-puffing is long term, but it has immediate results. HOWEVER, it’s been a miracle for my hooded eyelids. I rub some along my lid crease and after a few minutes the area is visibly lifted! Definitely makes makeup application easier and makes me look/feel more awake. Especially for the price, I would recommend trying this if you’re considering it. nan
