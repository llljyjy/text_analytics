If you have eczema, this is a must! Layering the Marine Hyaluronics with vaseline on top, was the only thing that helped heal my inflamed skin. I use this twice a day and my skin is so happy :) It changed my skin and for the first time in my life my skin feels in control and I get compliments on my glow! Great for eczema
