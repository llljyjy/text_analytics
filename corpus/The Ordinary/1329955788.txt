I bought this a while ago but was too scared to try it out of fear of a bad skin reaction. I ended up reading on a blog that it’s a great dupe for Sunday Riley’s ’Good Genes’ and decided to bust it out to try it. I ended up mixing it with my usual serum and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no harsh sting or burning like I had expected. I felt like my skin looked brighter and fresher the next morning. Will definitely be using this more regularly. Sunday Riley Dupe??
