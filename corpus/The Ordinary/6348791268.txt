I have sensitive skin and have found a way to absolutely benefit from this product. If this has irritated your skin stop using a cotton round to apply. Instead place product on clean hands and gently pat/press onto face. Brighter and fresher looking skin with none of the irritation. YOUâ€™RE USING IT WRONG (in the nicest way) :)
