This is a great product. When I bought it I really wasn’t expecting to enjoy it so much. It makes my skin feel healthy and gives it a very slight red tone (don’t worry that fade within the following minutes). I almost feel like if it prepares my skin for it’s moisturizer and helps it sink in. Seriously, will be getting more once I run out and just keep in mind that I use four drops and that’s enough for my WHOLE face and neck line. So worth it.
