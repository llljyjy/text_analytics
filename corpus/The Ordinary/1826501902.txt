I know itâ€™s a bit premature to give this 5 stars since I literally started using this hours ago, but holy cow just one swipe of this stuff and my dry winter skin is donezo! Immediately my skin felt softer and smoother. I have some experience with chemical exfoliants thanks to the Youth to the People Kombucha AHA, but when I ran out of it a while back I could tell my skin needed that layer of dead skin removed before it could enjoy the spring. So glad this is a big bottle. My moisturizer penetrated so much nicer after this. nan
