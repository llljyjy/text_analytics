I’ve been wanting to add glycolic acid into my skincare routine and I figured for the price, why not give this a go. I was a little nervous at first but the morning after applying this, my skin was noticeably better. I’ve now been using this about 3-4x a week in the PM (alternating nights with 1% retinol) and my skin LOVES it. It’s glowing, soft and smooth. This will be a staple in my routine from now on. If you have sensitive skin though, I would start using this once or twice a week and build up your tolerance slowly! LOVE
