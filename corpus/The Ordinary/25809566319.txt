This is a good and effective product for those whose dark circles ARE NOT the result of hyperpigmentation. This helps substantially with mine and Iâ€™d say gets rid of 70-90%of the problem. You only need a mid-large drop, and to tap it under the eyes gently on damp skin. This will last me months. Works for me:)
