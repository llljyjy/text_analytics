This one didn’t do anything. It’s very greasy and did not absorb into the skin. It didn’t seem to do anything at all and the smell is that of an oil. And that too is not a great smell.Ordinary products overall from my experience have been a hit or miss. The good thing is your not losing a lot of money when it doesn’t work for you. I always find up way to use up a product if it doesn’t cause me any irritation. This one I am trying it out on back acne. Didn’t do much for skin
