I’ve gone through two bottles of this, hoping to soften some minor forehead and laugh line wrinkles that are emerging in my late 20s. I did see a subtle improvement, but it requires very dedicated consistency (2x per day) to achieve and maintain any noticeable results. It has about the same temporary smoothing effect for me as using a really hydrating sheet mask. It’s definitely not a true substitute for Botox as the internet hype claims, but it could be enjoyable to try in your skincare routine if you can keep up the commitment. I am not sure if I’ll repurchase, at the moment I’d rather use that space in my routine to try other peptide serums. Lower your expectations
