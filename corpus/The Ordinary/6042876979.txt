I’ve been using this for about 2 years and it’s the product that put me onto antioxidants. I use it mainly during the day over my moisturizer or at night mixed with my retinol. It evens out my skin texture almost immediately. I recently switched to Pycnogenol 5% as it’s easier on the skin, which allows me to use it everyday. This tends to burn if overused. Great product
