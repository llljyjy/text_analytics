At first I used this product after my moisturizer and it left my skin looking a tad oily, although a bit more moisturized than usual. I was too afraid to use during the day while wearing makeup.Now I add two drops in my hand and mix with my moisturizer and it has done wonders for my dry skin which is also acne prone. My pores are much much smaller, my acne scars look softer and smaller also. I get a lot of micro needling treatments and this product is definitely helping my skin heal nicely! Amazing when used correctly
