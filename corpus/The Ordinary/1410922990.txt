Love this product and highly recommend it. I used to have super sensitive skin and redness issues I use this without any challenges and it’s been really wonderful and helped my skin a ton with hydration and even redness. It’s an essential product in my toolkit and use it day and night now.I’ve personally found that using hydrating spray before using it has made it even more effective. It’s incredible value for the money as well. Love this product and highly recommend it
