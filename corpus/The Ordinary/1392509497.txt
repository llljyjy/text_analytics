Has been really helpful with my maskne & overall breakouts. With it being an oil i find it helps not dry out  or irritate the problem areas but genuinely treat them with put dehydrated the skin around.  For daytime use sometimes i mix a couple drops in with a moisturizer if there’s others serums i’m wanting to mix in! Really enjoying the product will be repurchasing ! Finally!!!
