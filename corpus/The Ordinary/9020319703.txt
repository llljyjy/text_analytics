I love it, it maintains my skin really well. I’ve noticed that as long as I use this product in the AM + PM I don’t have breakouts. I also noticed that if I do occasionally have breakouts around my period they dry up before they can even really become pimples. I have bought 6 bottles of the larger size of this. I’ve been using it for almost 2 years. This + their glycolic acid and a very basic, generic, non-scented face wash. My breakouts are much more maintained. I really rock with this product because of the price too. I’m still working on clearing up scaring from acne as a teenager. The only constant in my life
