I bought this to use on my hair in the same way that I’d use a hair oil - to apply it on dry hair after blow drying to get rid of that fried look.  When I first applied it I didn’t really see much difference.  But the next morning my hair did look more supple and a little sleeker.  If you need some serious smoothing and taming, then you will likely need a hair oil with silicones in it like I usually use.  However, I do think this has a place in my routine.  I’ve been applying it in between washes when my hair needs a little something extra.  I will say that the price certainly factored into me keeping this.  If it had been significantly more then I would have easily done without this lightweight option. A lightweight option
