I really enjoy this product, I’ve used it for just over a week and my skin is already improving. Keep in mind you should not be putting this on compromised, raw, or broken skin. Additionally if you have sensitive skin make sure to do a test patch first, I have sensitive skin, did a test patch and found it fine but a little prickly for my skin so I avoided areas of my face I tend to be more sensitive like my high cheek. Make sure you are checking the ordinary’s site for products that don’t vibe with this good to add to your routine - carefully
