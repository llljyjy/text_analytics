I’ve been using this for two years now . If you have a simple routine with a few products, this is one that you shouldn’t go without. I wear makeup almost everyday and do a routine morning and night to care for my skin. I’m not acne prone but during both pregnancies this has saved my skin from being marked from hormonal acne. I use it at once a week. No cliche, but your makeup looks much smoother. You can see the texture fade from your skin and dead skin clear up after every use. It’s better than most facials I’ve paid for. Be careful not to use if you got your brows waxed or popped any pimples . It will feel like salt in a cut. Use a heavier moisturizer after to protect skin barrier nan
