This has honestly saved my life. I suffer from orbital eczema and keeping moisture within my eye area is challenging! This is my second time ordering and I am so thankful I gave this a proper try!! Before my eyes were super inflamed, red and itchy with flaking dry skin. After just 5 days of consistent use morning and night after cleansing; my skin is completely moisturized and only slightly red. Iâ€™m gonna keep this up and hopefully my natural moisture barrier replenishes! nan
