For some reason it interfered with my tretnoin cream and made me break out. It also did not provide enough hydration (especially in cold Canadian weather). It’s an alright moisturizer, but I would suggest to couple it with another moisturizer for a better effect. I prefer the Inkey List’s peptide moisturizer over this a 100%. And if you are on a higher budget I suggest the First Aid Beauty’s ultra repair cream. Anyway, I wouldn’t buy it again. Meh
