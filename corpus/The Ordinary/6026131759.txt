More like 4.5/5 stars as my Only complaint is that it takes time to make the product melt in your hands, but then once it does it’s absolutely fantastic. I’ll continue to repurchase and use as my skin hasn’t looked better since before puberty (I’m now 38) my skin was flaky scaly dry, and so red and irritated that even washing with a soft microfibre cloth and warm water resulted in me looking like a lobster. This is my daily go-to now! Definitely definitely recommend 4.5/5 stars
