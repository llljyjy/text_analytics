i love TO and my skin loves niacinamide so i figured i’d give this a go and take a break from my usual. this product is good but i think it’ll be more useful in the summer. it’s a little too drying with the zinc  for me in the winter. but i do like it and think it’s a good value better for summer or humid weather
