This has become a must-have in my skincare routine! I l use this at night, and I’m obsessed. Whenever I have a surprise blemish (especially around my time of the month) I put on this oil and it’s either shrunken down significantly or it’s completely gone by the next morning. I swear by this product for maintaining my acne-prone skin. I went from getting a new blemish daily to only one or two a month, if that! It’s a literal game changer!! I use this product in combination with the Cerave cleanser and a witch hazel toner at bedtime, or after using The Ordinary exfoliating peeling mask for hydration.p Affordable and AMAZING!
