I’ve been using this for a year now and I really like it! I literally have nothing bad to say. It’s a wonderful oil cleanser and it does a great job at removing water proof makeup. Since it’s an oil cleanser, make sure to always double cleanse by using a water based cleanser after that to make sure that it won’t clog your pores! Also, be careful when you apply it on your eyes cause it does burn a bit when you rince it off since it gets in direct contact with your eyes. I’d recommend you just wipe the product with a wet towel before hand to remove all the excess product. I live for this!
