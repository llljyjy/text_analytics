I learned about azelaic acid (AA) from Curology, since it was one of the potent ingredients in my custom formula. Curology’s AA did wonders for me, with no irritation and made my skin tone even. I took a chance on TO and 6 weeks later I am noticing a visible improvement in my skin tone. Blemishes are lighter, though any freckle-like sun spot seems unaffected by the acid. Warning: it did come with some irritation to the skin, making my skin itchy and stingy at times. I do have eczema prone skin though, so it was something I tried to use as a stand-alone active vs layering with other active ingredients. I tried to use it on a clogged whitehead but it didn’t seem to help with minimizing active acne as it did within my Curology formula. There are probably better formulations out there, though I would recommend for evening skin tone due to post-acne hyperpigmentation. 6 weeks and glowing
