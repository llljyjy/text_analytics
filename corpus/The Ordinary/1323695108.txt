Believe the hype, people. This is by far the best facemask in the world. I use it religiously twice a week and my skin looks absolutely amazing. My skin is smooth and clear and the acne marks are faded. Just make sure that you donâ€™t use retinol, glycolic acid, vitamin C or any type of scrub on your face the day that you are using this peel. Oh and you only need a thin layer when you apply it. Yesssssssss!!!!
