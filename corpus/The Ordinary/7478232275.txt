This stuff actually changed my life, I will never buy any other face cleanser. I had generally clear but oily skin with persistent random breakouts, blackheads on my nose, and red discoloration / scarring around my mouth. The cleanser causes you to break out at first but after a couple weeks of using it, it has evened out my skin, removed the scarring around my mouth, and has tamed my breakouts. 10/10 recommend if you identify with any of the same issues. I have been using it for about a year now. nan
