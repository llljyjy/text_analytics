I’ve used this product once a week for a few months now. It’s exceptional at reducing texture, fine lines, and minimizing breakouts. My skin is as clear as it’s ever been and old scars and pigmentation has faded considerably. I have very sensitive skin, but this product doesn’t bother me. I slather a nourishing and moisturizing cream on afterwards, and that helps to reduce any stinging or redness. nan
