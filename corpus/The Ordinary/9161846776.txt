It’s a very thick and heavy feeling moisturizer & it’s hard to blend on my face, I really have to work it in there for it to blend completely :/ But still - it’s a good moisturizer for the price. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily/greasy but i think i’ll need something else for winter months Hard to blend
