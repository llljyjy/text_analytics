I just finished my first bottle of the serum. I follow up the serum with moisturizer and SPF afterward and use the serum twice every day. It does exactly what is written on the bottle. After using the serum, my skin looks hydrated and plumpy. I have often noticed that using the serum helps prep my skin for makeup. I just use a light foundation, and it appears that using the serum helps in a smooth application of the foundation. However, it feels like my skin has become sensitive over time. This is the only acid based product I’m using right now, and it seems like the HA is affecting my acne-prone skin. So, I would say it may be a great serum for continuous use if you don’t have an acne-prone skin like me:) It's very good but not great for acne-prone skin
