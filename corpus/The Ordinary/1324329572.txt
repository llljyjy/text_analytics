pros: no fragrance, super gentle (it feels like lotion). the instructions says to rub the cleanser in your hands until it’s an oil. I find that if I apply the cleanser to my face like a cream, then wait a few seconds it turns into a more oil consistency enough to work with and clean. I like using this when I don’t wear makeup, I find it leaves my skin so smooth, and bright. however, when I wear makeup I always remove my makeup with a makeup wipe first, then use this. it appears my skin is completely makeup free until I wipe my face with my towel and I have foundation and mascara coming off still. so, not too thrilled on that. otherwise it’s a beautiful product and would buy again! Good, but...
