If I could give this zero stars I would. I am mind blown as to how this was an allure beauty winner. This is the worst skincare item I have ever tried, no joke. The formula is essentially like glue - it’s super tacky to begin with, you have about 6 seconds before it dries down, and if you touch it after it dries, you will end up with goo balls/pills all over your face. Absolutely couldn’t wear this under makeup. Idk what else is in here but this is the most bizarre “hyaluronic acid“ serum I’ve ever used; not hydrating at all. nan
