Beware if you have combination or acne-prone skin! I I purchased this product to have a lightweight, natural moisturizer when my skin is dry after peels, etc. Unfortunately, I only used twice (two days in a row) and I had a huge breakout on my chin. The oil does feel light, and it absorbs faster than others, but it wonâ€™t be a regular player in my arsenal. Bad for breakout-prone skin
