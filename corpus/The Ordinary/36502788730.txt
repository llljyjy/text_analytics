Love this peel! I’m a sucker for TikTok recs and am disappointed more often than not, but THIS - love it. Ease into it if you’re not used to chemical peels. I’ve had a few in my adult years and still only use this every 4-5 days for 7 minutes. This schedule works for my sensitive skin. Wonderful Addition to Your Skincare Routine
