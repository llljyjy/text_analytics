I have dry,acne prone skin. Which I find frustrating being 30 and STILL dealing with acne. This product has been a game changer for me. Saw results within 1 week with lightening of scars and reduction in acne. My skin barrier has improved greatly too. My pores have improved and when I do get a blemish it heals faster than before. I use this twice a day after washing my face and before moisturizer. I pat it in focusing on problem areas. Also, the price is unbeatable!Heads up to all that I did read somewhere itâ€™s best not to use this product for more than 3 months at a time. Not 100% sure on reasoning, but be smart and do your research before putting products on your face. fast results!!
