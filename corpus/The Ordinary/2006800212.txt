I’ve had Points Perks of Sunday Riley’s lactic acid product but balked at the purchase price so decided to give this serum from The Ordinary a try.  It is very good and gives excellent results at an amazingly affordable price.  I use this at night, alternating with retinol from The Inkey List and my skin tone looks brighter, my skin looks smoother and an annoying “thing“ on my jaw (maybe a whitehead? I don’t know) is diminishing rapidly.  No irritation, redness or stinging.  Simply an effective and affordable product! Does what it promises!
