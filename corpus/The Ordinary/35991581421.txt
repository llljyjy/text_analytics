I’ve been using this once a week for about three months. I personally keep this on for 7 minutes because if I go longer it is too harsh for my skin. It has a slight tingle but nothing too painful. I’ve noticed my skin texture has improved since using this. I have acne scars that seem to have improved as well since using this product. nan
