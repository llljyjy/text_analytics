I have left a review on less than 5 things in my life, this being one of them!! I notice an *immediate* difference in how bright and clear my skin is. I feel like my skin literally glows after I rinse it off. I do this mask twice a week and it helps so much with my blackheads and whiteheads, especially on my chin and nose. I. Love. This. Mask.
