I’ve been using this product for a few years now and finally decided to leave a review. This is one of the few strong and rapid exfoliants! Even more surprising because it’s extremely affordable, which made me suspicious about its effectiveness in the beginning. I don’t use this too often or even weekly. I try to use it once/twice a month since I also use retinol occasionally or when I notice my skin looks clogged with extra buildup. The first day looks fine and a little dull but within the week, I can expect some dryness and peeling of skin. By the end of week 1 or 2, my skin is rejuvenated, brighter and smooth. Any potential whiteheads I noticed before, have dried out and peeled away. Granted I’ve been exposed to chemical exfoliation since my late teens when I started experimenting with skin products, so now in my mid-late 20s, my skin is trained and doesn’t experience burns or serious stings when using this. Keep that in mind. I also do not use this frequently and wouldn’t suggest anyone to, especially if you’re not used to chemical exfoliants. You have to build up that tolerance. I also use this when I know I’ll be indoors for that day and the next. Wear sunscreen to protect your skin when you’re outside to avoid sensitivity and damage. Tried and True!
