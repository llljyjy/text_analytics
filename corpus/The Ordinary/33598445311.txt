I absolutely love adding a few drops of this Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil to my night skincare routine, I wake up with a nice healthy glow!It also works perfectly to lock all the other skincare products.The smell isnâ€™t too bad and I would say it absorbs quite easily.I will definitely keep getting it. The last step of my night skincare routine!
