this is the only salicylic acid product gentle enough for my skin, plus the squalane goes on like a dry oil and makes my skin so so soft. cleared up my stubborn forehead spots and doesn’t pill under my makeup. if you think it’s too greasy then use less and let it sink in for a few minutes before using anything else sensitive skin approved!
