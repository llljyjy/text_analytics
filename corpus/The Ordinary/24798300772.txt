Better than Botox!! My sister has been raving about this brand for the past few months. She suggested there primer and I love it. When I was looking at other items, After doing a little research on other items in this brand, I purchased this item. I have 11 lines beginning. Yikes!! I decided, one more item and then it was Botox for me, for the first time.  I put 1 drop on one of my 11 lines and the next day I was blown away!! It was visibly less noticeable!! I have been using it about a week and I’m in total shock. As long as the line doesn’t get deeper, Botox is on hold. nan
