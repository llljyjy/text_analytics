This is one of the few skincare products I repurchase again and again. I have combination skin with moderate-to-severe hormonal acne. I see a distinct change in the lengths of my breakouts when I use this serum. It doesn’t do much for my cystic acne, but for my regular blemishes it prevents breakouts and speeds up the healing time. For the price, I think it’s an excellent serum. Helps my breakouts clear faster
