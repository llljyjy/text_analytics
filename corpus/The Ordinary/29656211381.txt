Nice texture, great value! I bought this with the intent of using it on my hair and have since integrated it into both my hair and skin care routines. I have dry skin and it’s worked wonders as a final step in my nighttime routine. That said, be careful not to over use this as it can cause irritation and little whiteheads of sort if you do. In terms of hair I couldn’t be happier about the performance of this product! It makes my long wavy hair feel soft and silky. Because of its oily consistency it also works great as a hair oil on non-shampoo days. All in all would highly recommend! Great value, great product for soft skin & hair!
