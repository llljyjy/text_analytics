Obsessed !! I have combination skin and suffer with both oily and sometimes very dry skin can almost be flakey. I now use this every morning and then with a tiny bit of moisturizer after and my skin has done SOOO much better. My face is smooth and hydrated and my make up looks great when applying over top of the two. I personally am a huge fan of The Ordinary Brand and have been trying new product all the time to see what actually works with my skin type. As my skin is so finicky since it is both oily and very dry. Obsessed !!!
