I usually do not write reviews on products but this is a holy grail. I use it on my face at night after moisturizing and it gives me a beautiful radiant glow without it being greasy. When I wake up my face is evenly moisturized. Not an oily T zone but my whole face feels baby smooth! I love it! I also use it on my hair as a pre shampoo and on my ends after styling since since almost every hair oil Sephora has contains filler  and/or unnecessary chemicals. It is a lightweight oil that truly absorbs into your skin and hair. nan
