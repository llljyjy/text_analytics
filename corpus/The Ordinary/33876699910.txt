AMAZING! I have red/pink blotches where my skin cancer is and nowâ€¦. THE BLOTCHES ARE GONE. I never thought that this would help it but it does! Very light. Not oily. I still have some dry patches but I have noticed they are getting smaller. This DEFINITELY works for pink/red coloring on the face! I got the 3.3oz/100ml. It will last you a bit since it takes a lil squirt to cover the whole face! BUY IT NOW
