We all have different skin. My skin was smooth and great and I finally just received it today and was excited to try it. I have oily skin and I only break out when It’s that time of the month which was just 1 and half weeks ago and I broke out a lot from that which is why I ordered this and today I used it in the morning and then at night just noticed more bumps on my face which wasn’t there in the areas I put this serum. I’m glad it worked out for some of you but if you have oily skin I don’t recommend you getting an oil based serum, try water based instead. nan
