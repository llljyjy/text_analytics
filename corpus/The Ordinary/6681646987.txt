I’ve been using natural deodorant for the past few years, and though I like it; it doesn’t really keep me from sweating which can cause odor :( but I started using this right after I shower and let me just say this is like a deodorant in toner form. I literally don’t stink at all! Even after sweating all day and being from Arizona you know that happens a lot. Also noticed my underarms look lighter and smoother than before, also helps me prevent ingrown hairs. I honestly recommend this to everyone. Specially if you’re like me who uses natural deodorant and maybe even not use one at all! didn’t work for my face but…
