The mask was good and my skin was brighter after using this mask but the consistency was kinda thick and that made it really hard to squeeze out and put it on the face because I couldnâ€™t really smear it around without my face hurting. I did end up mixing it with a few drops of water and it worked better. (I gave 4 stars because even though the mask was kinda difficult it worked) Hard to get out
