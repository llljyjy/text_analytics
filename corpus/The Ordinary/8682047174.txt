This is my favourite product in the whole world. I’ve used plenty of vitamin c products from both the ordinary and higher end brands but this is the only one I’ve repurchased (currently on my 4th bottle). I use it at night on top of my hyaluronic acid and before moisturizer and have the brightest and smoothest skin in the morning. It’s helped fade my dark spots and minimizing the appearance of any acne I may have. It does sting but my skin is used to it. I love the texture and prefer it to the ordinary’s 23% vit c, would highly recommend! My holy grail
