This product is really good. It’s a “get the job done“ kind of product. You won’t get “wow“ results but your skin will be more hydrated if you use it correctly (apply it to a wet or damp face, NOT dry). Affordable, sensitive skin-friendly, and hydrating. Not a bad choice at all! Great for those new to skincare
