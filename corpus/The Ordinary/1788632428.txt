I just bought this a week ago and I am really enjoying it.  I use .1 percent tretinoin every night, and like many other tret users I struggle with dry peeling skin, especially in the winter.  I added this to my skin care routine and i has made such a noticeable difference in my skin.  My skin looks hydrated and glowy, and my makeup goes on so much better. I wear very lightweight makeup products like tinted moisturizers and when I use those with this product, the hydration and glow still comes through when I apply the tinted moisturizer, which I think gives a flattering, youthful look.  Iâ€™ll continue using this every morning and see if my opinion changes over the next month or so. Great affordable serum
