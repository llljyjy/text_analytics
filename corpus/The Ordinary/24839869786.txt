I love using this serum at night. I wake up with little to no puffiness the next morning. Ideally, i would use this during the day too, but I get pilling with EVERY sunscreen I have tried so far. And i only get pilling when I use this serum during the day. Definitely recommend this product for an overnight treatment, with some eye gel pads or a skincare tool to massage it in and increase the blood flow to reduce swelling or puffiness. nan
