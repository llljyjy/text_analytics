I’ve seen so many people raving about this online so I had to try it! A few things to note: I have combination to oily skin, breakouts many times a week, and blackheads all over my nose. After applying the mask my skin didn’t burn but it definitely tingled for a couple minutes before it settled down a little bit. I rinsed it off and my skin was so soft! My blackheads were still there but definitely less noticeable. I’ve been using this for a couple weeks and my skin is so soft, my pores are way smaller, and my skin is radiant. My blackheads are still there, but always look better after this treatment. I think if I continue to use this I will see more of a difference. Overall 9/10, I want to use it longer and see if it will completely remove my blackheads.Note: I’m also using PC’s bha liquid and that has really helped! Affordable product for super smooth skin!
