Bought this based on Dr.Shah’s recommendation to remove nose blackheads as mine were quite prominent. Been using for maybe 1~2 months now, once per week, and I think I’m seeing results. The flanks of my nose where I can usually feel the individual blackheads now feel much smoother. My current routine is face wash, salicylic mask, clay mask, sheet mask, regular night time skin care, been working well for me. Mmm, that’s pretty good
