This stuff is awesome. The only cleansing balm I like more than this one is Cliniques Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm, but with the price point - I’ll always buy this. It gets 95% of my make up off, washes off without leaving a residue or stripping. It doesn’t upset my over-sensitized, acne prone skin. It’s great. Buy it. My second favourite cleanser
