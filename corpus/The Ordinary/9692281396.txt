I’ve had small bumps on my arms (KP) since I was a teenager. Nothing really worked, until I tried this product. It’s crazy how much of a difference it made after one bottle. I use this 5 times per week.There is a small spot where I always forget to apply this product...and there is a HUGE difference. I hope this helps others dealing with KP. I just ordered my second bottle. Basically "erased" my KP
