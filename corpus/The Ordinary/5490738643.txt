This has evened out my skin tone so much. I want to start using it on my chest and arms to to reduce the appearance of sun damage but I’ll probly get the powder version to mix into my body lotion for that. Plus, I love the way it looks applied-  it makes you look dewy and keeps you dewy and moisturized for a long time throughout the day. It’s supposed to be grainy! Mix it in with your moisturizer a lil more each day to get used to it (it’s potent and can sting a little) and you will be glowing. Understand the product before using/reviewing!
