I know i’m ahead of myself because I’ve only been using it one day, but I can say that it goes on the skin very nice.  It’s not greasy if you use 3 or 4 drops.  It sunk it well and I put spf over it.  My face looks very glowy and like if i have primer on.  It reacted very well to my 40 year old skin Great for older skin
