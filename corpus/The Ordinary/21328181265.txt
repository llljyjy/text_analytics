I love this! I don’t just use this on my eyes I use it all over my face and neck in the morning! First glow recipe face mist, and then slather this on pat softly in around eyes and then let it sink in for say 10 minutes before you get into other stuff like vitamin c, serums etc love it wakes up my whole face! If I was tired and grumpy faced suddenly I am not anymore! My skin’s morning cup of Joe!
