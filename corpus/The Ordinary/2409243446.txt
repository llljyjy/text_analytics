I was tired of paying $40+ for replenishing my moisturizer every 3-4 months that it compelled me to search for quality yet affordable skincare. Then I discovered The Ordinary moisturizer. I have normal skin with occasional dry patches on my cheeks and nose. I gently message The Ordinary moisturizer into my skin, because it does take some time for it to absorb. After it absorbs, it feels and looks as if there’s a smooth blanket covering my skin. This is my new holy grail product and I’ll be repurchasing it for years to come! This stuff works!
