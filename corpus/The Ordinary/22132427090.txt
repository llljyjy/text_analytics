I’m not normally the review kind of gal, but this is by far one of my all time favorite products I’ve ever used. I have combo skin but I get a lot of dry patches and I use this either on top of my moisturizer or just as a moisturizer and I wake up with the softest, smoothest skin ever. I have used $80 moisturizers and would recommend this products over any other moisturizer! I’m obsessed. Also it is obviously an oil but it isn’t quite as thin as the plant squalene product by the ordinary. I’m a big fan of the consistency! One of my favorites already. Telling all my friends. Also - the smell kind of reminds me of green juice but it doesn’t bother me! Attached is a photo of me feeling so soft and silky and glazed with my fav product on. Ok plz go buy this now! BUY THIS PRODUCT ASAP
