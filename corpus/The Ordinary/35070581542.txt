This cream has a really good price and it hydrated my skin nicely. I have mostly oily skin and sadly my skin was still oily after using it. My skin was super hydrated and my skin was glowy with a bit of shine! I wouldn’t recommend using it underneath or on top of an eye cream because it almost blocks it form working. Good for wearing during the night but not for the day! Good size though it’s bigger than I though I would be, amazing if ure on a budget or broke like me. nan
