Holy grail for acne-prone combo skin, this serum effectively decongests pores all while maintaining the first layer of skin so it does not over dry and create a barrier that holds bacteria in! Idk about you, but usually acne treatments dry me out so bad that I have acne UNDER my dry skin. This squalene salicylic acid combo was an absolute win. Iâ€™ve tried it all, the product is unbeatable let alone the price. holy grail for acne-prone combo skin
