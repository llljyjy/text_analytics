I have no doubt it works but I used it once, on a completely clean and exfoliated face with nothing on it and it PILLED. And not just a bit of pilling either, like a million tiny orange clumps all over my face. I’m not sure if this is just the way it is or I got a bad batch but I’m really disappointed. There’s no way I can continue to use this it’s just way too messy. clumps up on clean skin
