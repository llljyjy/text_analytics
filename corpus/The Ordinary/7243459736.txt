my favvv exfoliant! i use on the face & body 2-3 times a week. always leave my skin perfectly smooth and helps reduce any light discoloration. love the price, formula, and lasts quite a while for the size- 10/10. for reference my skin type is dry, acne prone, and i am very sensitive to fragrance so love that this has none :) smooth skin & even complexion
