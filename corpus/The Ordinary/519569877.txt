I am a huge fan of The Ordinary, and this product does not disappoint. I donâ€™t use it necessarily for oil control, but at night under a retinol serum (from The Inkey List) to help with skin congestion and have seen a definite improvement in the appearance of my skin. Highly recommended! Love, love, love
