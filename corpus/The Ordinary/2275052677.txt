I’ve been using this product for a few weeks. It’s a very interesting delivery of salicylic acid, especially for users with sensitive yet acne prone skin. It left my skin initially glowy, but after a week or so I did start to get some breakouts on my forehead and the bridge of my nose. It could have been purging as now when I use the product, I haven’t seen any flare ups. One thing I adjusted with my application after the initially purging was continuing to use the rose hip seed oil after hydrating and moisturizing my skin, and then I use only a few drops of this serum on my fingertips and apply to my entire face. My skin seems to like this method so far. I would encourage folks to give this a chance if you’ve found other salicylic products to be too drying for your skin. I have deeply melanated skin and overall have not had a bad reaction to this product. Please note that I do not use this serum everyday and certainly not in the same routine with other exfoliators or drying products. I will finish the bottle before deciding whether to repurchase. On the fence but leaning towards “like”
