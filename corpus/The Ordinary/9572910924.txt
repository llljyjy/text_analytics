This product changed my life. I have been dealing with cystic acne for six years and recently debated going on a second round of Accutane. Within two days of using this product, my active cysts were dried up, and my scars had faded like crazy. After two weeks of using it, my skin is the clearest Iâ€™ve ever seen it. Even the pesky blackheads on my nose and chin would never go away no matter what derm prescribed product I used. I use it once a day (my skin can get a bit dry if I use it two) and make sure to rub it in thoroughly, then use cereve lotion over it. Layers fine for me under makeup.10/10 recommend I, for the first time in almost six years, have felt confident leaving my house with no makeup. So helpful for acne prone skin
