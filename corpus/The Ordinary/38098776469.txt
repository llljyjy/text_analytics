takes a while to get it to an oil consistency, but it does eventually. i like it for my mascara, but not really on the face. kind of feels like it sits on the makeup rather than sliding it off and i needed to use a lot more product than when using more expensive oil cleansers. for the price it is usuable with more effort. however, i would rather spend more on something that is quicker and feels more clean after. i wouldn’t repurchase, and i think you could find something better in the same price range okay for price, but wouldn’t repurchase
