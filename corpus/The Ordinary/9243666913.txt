Is this supposed to burn?! I’m trying reallyyy hard to like this and get this to work for me because it has great reviews but the first time I put it on i had the worst burning/stinging itchy sensation and had to wash it off immediately. Tried it the second time tonight and it was the same thing! After about a minute of horrible staining it calmed down and was able to keep the mask on but I’m just wondering if the stinging is normal? I do have a few blemishes maybe that’s why it stung? I’ll try again when my blemishes are gone! is it normal for this product to sting super bad?!
