I was probably the first buyer of this product. The moment i received a notification, The Ordinary Salicylic Acid. I was online ordering. This is water based which is great the other one they have is oil based but i still use it on my face because it has changed the whole game for me. You name the problem acne, blemishes, dull skin, dark spots and after using this little bottle i donâ€™t see any of those. I never run out of this product. I always have 2 extra waiting in line. I have started using it on my body now. I add this in all my body moisturizers. However, the results on the body are slow. maybe because it is mixed with moisturizer and i use it twice a week. It is still great. Extra Ordinary
