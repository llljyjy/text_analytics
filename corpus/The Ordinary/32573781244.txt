I was very skeptical to try anything on my skin as it was in the most bad shape. Breaking out constantly, dull, itchy and sensitive. This serum has worked considerably well to get my acne under control and clean up my blemishes. It is a milky texture but the best part is it does not burn or hurt. I am using it religiously and I can see results now. If you are patient enough I am sure you will see it work on your skin to give long term results. Very happy! Savior for Acne and Blemishes!
