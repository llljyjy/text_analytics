I keep coming back to this - hard not to. I’ve been using this since early 2020 and am now on my second or third bottle. I have flaking eyebrows which require constant exfoliation. Nothing works as instantly as this toner. I let it dry then moisturize (extremely important, or else you will be irritated and red), and my makeup then goes on flawlessly. It does sting a bit on other areas of my face and neck so patch test first. Haven’t noticed huge benefits anywhere else besides my flaky patches but it’s perfect for that. also missed wearing sunscreen many times after (oops), but haven’t had any real adverse effects thankfully. Excellent Exfoliator
