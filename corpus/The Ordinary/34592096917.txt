I just got the product today, and I tried it out the first thing this morning. It really is scentless and it left my skin glowing after (but idk if that’s supposed to be part of its effect on the skin). I don’t know yet if it actually minimizes pores and controls sebum, but so far I’m satisfied with the product. nan
