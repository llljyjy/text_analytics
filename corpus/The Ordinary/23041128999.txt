I thought all hyaluronic acid serums were meant to be sticky…I was wrong. I’ve tried several others (one the same as this, hyaluronic acid 2% and b5) and none of them were sticky. When I’m out of this, I will not be repurchasing. Only redeemable part of this is the low cost compared to others like it. Super sticky…
