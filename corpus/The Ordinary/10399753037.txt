I have oily skin and large pores I cannot get rid of.  I’ve been using it for a couple days, this serum is VERY oily. It is still early to tell how this will workout for me. I think for the first 20 minutes my pores look smaller but then they large later in the day. I’m going to try using it only at night after I wash my face (so my skin is dryer). Maybe that will make my face feel better. not sure yet
