I’ve only been using this for a few days and I’ve already noticed a huge improvement in my skin! My skin looks brighter and plumper with less redness. Like others have said, the formula is quite thick and might feel sticky if applied to dry skin but if you apply on damp skin, it goes on much smoother. The “stickiness“ is a non-issue for me as any other serum that works as well as this will cost 3 or 4 times the price. Definitely a permanent addition to my routine!
