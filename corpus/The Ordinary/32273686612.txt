I love it but texture is so weirdSmooth and very save money for a clear skin day, i totally 9.5 / 10 because it will hard to fit some sunscreen after because the texture may hard to apply on skin and sunscreen hard to match, for beginners i recommended choose a light texture sunscreen with quality spf 50 ( i recommended paula choice 30- 50sp bc the texture so friendly to apply and good finish) . nice but funny
