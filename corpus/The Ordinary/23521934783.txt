i started using this to repair my compromised skin barrier, alongside a gentle cleanser, alpha arbutin and sunscreen in the morning. it is very gentle, non irritating and very hydrating! PRO TIP: layer after water based serums and spray with thermal mistâ€¦ then apply for better penetration great product
