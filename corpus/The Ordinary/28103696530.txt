First of all, LOVE the price for the amount of product you get - mine lasts months (maybe even close to a year!). I use this every day, typically in the evening. It did burn my skin a little at first (I have extremely sensitive skin) , but my skin adjusted pretty quickly. I have really dry skin, and so itâ€™s prone to flaking, and this product pretty much cleared up that issue. With a heavy moisturizer and vitamin C oil at night, I wake up with clear, smooth, glowy skin. It gets rid of all the roughness and dry patches I previously had. I seriously cannot go without this product. Necessity
