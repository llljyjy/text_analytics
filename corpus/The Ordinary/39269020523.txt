This product is very watery which is good because that means that it is diluted and I don’t think that it has done anything because I have been using it for a while and have no change. You have to use quite a few drops to actually cover your face and I have a medium-sized face so this is relatively a problem I can’t imagine having a bigger face but, I would recommend if it magically will work on your skin because it didn’t on mine. This product is ok..
