Ever since I got off BC my face has been in a state of continuous breakout. Just one week ago I had three red raging swollen zits at the corner of my mouth and chin. I also get significant and stubborn hyperpigmentation from every pimple too. Last week I added three new The Ordinary products to my skincare regimen, and not only has my breakout cleared but the hyperpigmentation has noticeably faded, especially the spots from more recent breakouts. Especially the area near my mouth where the live zits were—whatever I’ve been doing must’ve helped them heal better too. There are still spots but they look so faded you wouldn’t believe how bad of a breakout was there just 1 week ago. Anyway, the three products I started were the Azelaic acid, Pycnogenol, and this one. I suspect the azelaic acid is mainly what kicked the acne since it’s what it’s known for, but the overall results could be all three or some combination thereof. Consider me incredibly, incredibly impressed. I didn't know skin could improve so fast!
