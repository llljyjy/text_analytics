What is oily skin again? I have acne prone skin and in the summer my head and nose are always so shiny. It’s been about a year and this product is amazing!! My skin barrier feels stronger, smoother and supple. It’s a MUST have in your skin regimen. It took me awhile to get a skin regimen down without it pilling on me but for the price I’m shocked at how good this product works. I can’t remember the last time I had to dap my skin of excess oil and I can apply stronger products without irritation all thanks to this niacinamide from The Ordinary! nan
