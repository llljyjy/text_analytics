Yep. The hype is very very real. I have been struggling with terrible adult acne (I’m 31) on my chin and jawline for years, I have tried everything under the sun and then some. I’ve been using the Ordinary Nacinamide serum combined with the Salicylic acid serum for about 2 months and the blemishes have improved significantly! I use the niacinamide serum all over my face twice a day (morn/night) and my pores are reduced, and my skin texture very improved, super smooth. nan
