This product helps treat skin from existing blemishes, removes texture skin, and any existing redness. I use this product as a treatment for my skin during the evening time. I use it every other day. In addition, after applying a glycolic acid toner, I apply this product by using gentle patting motions to the affected areas.This product has been life changing alongside the other products I use. Definitely worth the purchase! Effective
