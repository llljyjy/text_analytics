i like this! i purchased it because the price was very good and itâ€™s actually not what i expected. ive used cheaper skincare and ive had breakout after breakout! my skin is where i want it to be so i was very skeptical for a long time. but this product helps exfoliate my skin like no other. a lot of the time i have dry skin that likes to flake when i do my makeup, after using this mask 2/3 times a week that problem no longer resurfaces. a wonderful investment and you should try it if your skins not too sensitive :) good overall! no complaints
