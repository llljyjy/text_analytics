My previous favorites are skinceuticals AGE and valmont deto2x. They calm my skin down, but are priced at $150-$300. Now, I genuinely recommend azelaic acid 10% by the ordinary to everyone (with excessive oil or acne on their face). It works better for me, and it’s much more affordable. - pro: * controls oil and acne* VERY effective * my face will be matte for like ~3hrs after this. I’m combination skin. - con: * might be too strong for some* don’t use after surgery! * easy to use out (for me) * might not be that anti-aging * might not work for some * you could probably find more effective formulas, base on your skin condition nan
