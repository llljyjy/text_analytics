The only reason I’m giving this product a three star rating is because if you have sensitive skin it does kind of burn. There are tiny little microbeads within the serum that is really rough on sensitive skin and may or may not irritate your skin. I do kind of love this product however I’ve seen better products out there. It’s a little too watery for my liking, and I think it should be just a little thicker if they’re going to use this type of bottle to pour out the product. Also it kind of reminds me of sunscreen and I’ve been using this product for about a month now and haven’t noticed any drastic changes in my skin. I would only recommend if you have regular skin and if you have sensitive to really sensitive skin I recommend some thing that’s not as harsh on the skin. Overall a good product but not the best. good but there’s better out there
