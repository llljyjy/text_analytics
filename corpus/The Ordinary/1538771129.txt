After only a week, I can see a huge improvement in my skin overall. From dark spots to firmness and it feels smooth. I’m used to Kate Somerville and Drunk Elephant products, which either leave my skin feeling super dry when I don’t apply them, or super sensitive. So I’m beyond happy to have found this serum and now I’m looking for a lighter night-time cream to use with it! nan
