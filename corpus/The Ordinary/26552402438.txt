Product is oily so I just mix a drop in with some moisturizer before applying it to my face. To be honest this hasn’t really been helping with my pores. However, since this serum contains salicylic acid I decided to try it on a scar I have on my shoulder and it drastically faded after just one use. Now I just use it on that scar and I’ve noticed it helps fade old stretch marks too. They should’ve advertised this as a scar fading product lol. Helps to fade scars and stretch marks as well
