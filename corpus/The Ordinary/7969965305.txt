I loved the aesthetic of this product but it dried my skin out completely also caused slight redness. I have hyper sensitive skin so I payed attention to the directions and avoided the sun but I didnâ€™t end up with a good result nor did I feel relaxed which is what I mainly use skin products for. Love the look but not the product itself. NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
