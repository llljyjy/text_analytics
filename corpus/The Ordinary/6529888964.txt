This is the most affordable, efficient and useful product to have. It’s my fave! I normally use it after I wash my face, wait til it dries a bit then apply my moisturizer and or oil. Definitely locks in the hydration my skin needs. ❤️ I’m Pacific Islander but living in LA the air quality is so bad as well as the water system here that my skin needs an extra help to lock in moisture. This is a must have for me. Affordable and works!
