im not a big fan of excessive skincare stuff and think perfect skin is an unhealthy beauty standard. that being said, this just makes life easier, keeps skin smooth and soft. i usually have to exfoliate often and get really dry flaky skin and congested pores, but this just keeps things smooth and clean. i use it at night. so worth the money, Iâ€™ve hardly made a dent in the bottle and have been using it for 2 months nan
