This moisturizer, quite literally makes my face feel drenched in water after rubbing into my face. A satisfying sensation but it takes time for my face to dry after. I only have to use a pea-size amount to cover my face and still have more left for my neck. This full size tube lasts me months at a time (strictly using for my face). Overall good moisture you can see and feel on the skin at an affordable price. Great Moisture!
