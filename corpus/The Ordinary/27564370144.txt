I think this is a great product. The price point is gorgeous and the product itself is really nice. The only downside is the sticky texture it leaves after application. It doesnâ€™t bother me personally, but if you hate your face feeling a little sticky then this may not be for you. However, It does seem to go away as the day goes on. nan
