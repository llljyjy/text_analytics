long story short, i was obsessed with this moisturizer the first handful of times i used it, because itâ€™s thick and creamy but not heavy on my face or oily so naturally i added it to my skincare routine. well sadly it pills on my face TERRIBLY. it never happened before so im not sure what happened. i even use it right after my the ordinary hylaronic acid serum. very sad because i love this company. piling.
