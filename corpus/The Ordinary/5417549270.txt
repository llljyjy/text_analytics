I’ve been using this product for about a year or so now and I’m so obsessed with it. I’ve noticed such a huge difference in my skin. It feels much more hydrated and soft and I don’t have any issues with dryness or over-oiliness when I skip a day for whatever reason. It’s also SUPER affordable which I love (don’t be deterred by the low price tag, y’all!). When I use it, I don’t fully dry my face off after washing so the water helps this product absorb even better and let me tell you that is a game-changer all on it’s own. I can’t live without this product now and recommend it to everyone! nan
