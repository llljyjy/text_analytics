I recently added this to my skincare routine and WHOA. It was already good, but this INSTANTLY took it to a whole new level. Definitely my skin’s favorite AHA, my face absolutely loves this stuff.I switch it up sometimes, but typically, I use this after washing with Tatcha soft rice wash & Farmacy BHA toner, then follow with T.O. niacinamide, and T.O. retinol 2% with squalane mixed in with my Farmacy Honey Halo moisturizer (and/or SPF if I’m going outside that day). I’m so glad to have finally found the products that work for me and I couldn’t have done it without the lactic acid. *To be fair, I probably mix things that shouldn’t be mixed, but I consider my skin to be sensitive so I started with a really gentle routine and built up as I reacted well to everything.*I’m sooo incredibly grateful that The Ordinary offers such INCREDIBLE, pure, top-quality serums affordably and have such simple & aesthetically pleasing packaging.For reference, my skin is very pale/translucent and thin/stretchy from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I burn easily, don’t tan, and freckles I love. I have large pores & redness around my nose & cheeks, some shiny areas and some very dull. I had horrible cystic hormonal acne from PCOS as a teenager; with medication, the scars are still fading and I still get mild breakouts occasionally (usually patches of little bumps that don’t last very long).All of the above have approved in the last few months since starting my routine and now my pores are practically nonexistent thanks to the lactic acid.My legs and upper arms are on the bumpy, crepey struggle bus lately (I don’t know if it’s a rash or eczema or ingrown hairs or what but it flares up occasionally) so I actually just got another bottle of this to use in between F.A.B. exfoliator & reparative moisturizer. I’ll try to update later and let you know how it works for my body! Try it out!! Photo unedited, just a mirror selfie with iPhone 11 camera. It’s like I got new skin I swear. Where did my pores go
