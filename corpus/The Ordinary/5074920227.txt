I’ve been using this product for over a year now and it’s absolutely life-changing. I’ve had texture skin my entire life due to acne and this has cleared up most of my scars my face feel so plump and hydrated after. You do need to make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer to get the full benefits. My skin feels like I’m 16 all over again. I’ve also been using it for my hair and it’s got rid of most of my split ends and my hair is thicker than ever. love love love!!
