This moisturizer just doesn’t work for me. I found that it made my face feel dry and get a bit flaky which was something I had under control until I tried out this product. My face just feels very tight and not in a good way. If you have drier skin I would recommend looking elsewhere. Just isn’t worth it to constantly feel like you have to reapply moisturizer and feel really dry only 15 minutes after applying. It also doesn’t spread very well and I had to use a lot in order to get my whole face. Doesn't work for my skin
