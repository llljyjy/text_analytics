I’ve been using this product twice daily for all of 3 months, then I decided to only do it at night, and surprisingly, my skin stopped being so inflamed. Before using, my acne was manageable but I still wanted to get rid of it for good. I read various reviews telling me that this product works, and is pretty good for the price. However, after i stopped using it twice daily and used it only once, my skin looked a lot better, with only a some acne in my T zones. I’ve stopped using it after hearing from various acquaintances about how it inflamed their skin as well, giving them more acne. My skin is still acneic but now that I have stopped using it I’m not finding any new patches of acne like I did when I used it. Whenever I did use it, i would always have a sticky residue left on my skin. I do not recommend this product at all. If you have it at home right now, get rid of it. Do not recommend, left my skin worse
