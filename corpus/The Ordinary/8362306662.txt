I have tried dozens of moisturizers from low to high end and this is hands down the best one. I have been using this for a little over two years now and find it to be the most versatile product in my beauty cabinet. It is a creamy medium-thickness consistency that spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It is fragrance free and can layered well under makeup and sunscreen. My favorite thing about this moisturizer is that it is packed with skin-barrier replenishing ingredients which keeps my acne-prone skin clear and redness-free. At night, I mix a dollop of this with a pea sized amount of prescription tret and it keeps my plump and hydrated. In the morning, I layer this above my vitamin c serum and under my sunscreen without any issues. I have tried so many high end brands (la mer, estee lauder, drunk elephant) and nothing compares to this! HG Moisturizer !
