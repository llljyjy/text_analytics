A gentle and effective cleanser that can be used daily. It cleanses my face without stripping the moisture out of it and gives a nice glow afterwards. Squalane is also a great ingredient for acne prone skin. I highly recommend this especially at such an affordable price point. Another winner from The Ordinary
