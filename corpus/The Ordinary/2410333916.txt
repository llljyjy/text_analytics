I’ve tried this serum twice now and will probably throw it out. Both times I applied it before work on clean bare skin, no added makeup. Both times my eyes seemed puffier and the circles under them looked darker. I really hoped it would work for me, but I’m very disappointed by it. Made my under-eyes look worse
