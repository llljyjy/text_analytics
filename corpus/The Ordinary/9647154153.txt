Iâ€™m obsessed with this. It is a skin identical ingredient so I find that it just melts nicely into the skin. I use it at nighttime to enhance my hydration when used in conjunction with my other products and it really does have you going to bed looking like a glazed donut - in the best way possible. Love this serum! No oily feeling, just a water like texture that just feels so nice! Love this serum!!
