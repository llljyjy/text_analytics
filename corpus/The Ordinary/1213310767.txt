I have combination, extremely sensitive skin. I trust this brand and had high hopes for this product but it was just a no go.After one application, I had my tell tale red except like patches that flair up when my skin is not happy. Promptly stopped using it.Iâ€™m giving 3 stars as I could tell it was quality from the smell, a very earthy, plenty smell. This might work for some but beware if you have sensitive skin No-go for the sensitive skin folk
