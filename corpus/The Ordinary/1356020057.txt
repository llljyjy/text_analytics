This must be the most underrated skincare product on the planet. No one talks about this! But EUK 134 works faster and more effectively than anything else I’ve tried in reducing redness and hyperpigmentation. Better yet, I’ve never had any kind of bad reaction to it. It’s warm when it goes on, but that subsides. On my skin, it has been superior to Vitamin C and AHAs when it comes to immediate effect—I still use the others because research shows how important they are long-term. I saw real results within *a week,* significant enough that friends commented. I am guessing a lot of people steer clear of this one also because it has so many conflicts, but it *does* work with retinoids. Depending on your own skin type, it would go well over or under your retinoid. It is such a powerful antioxidant that I also like wearing it alone in the daytime under my SPF. If I am not mistaken, this is the top ingredient in Estée Lauder’s iconic Advanced Night Repair. This, as you can see, is $10. And it is the only skincare (other than SPF) that I absolutely cannot do without. So underrated!
