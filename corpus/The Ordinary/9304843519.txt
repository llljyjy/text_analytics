I love ! I never take the time to leave a review & im a lazy person when it comes to skin care .My skin was pretty dry that I was starting to get a couple of wrinkles on my forehead , I used this once along w all the other “the ordinary” products & it made my skin look super healthy and my wrinkle kinda disappeared the first time I used this *my wrinkles were mild *barley forming* my boyfriend was asking me what I had put on my face since it was glowing .These products are not expensive and they are honestly worth having , I’m obsessed <3 buy !
