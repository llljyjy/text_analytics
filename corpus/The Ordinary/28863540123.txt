This is my first review and I’m totally impressed by this product by ordinary. It keeps my skin hydrated all day long and gives it a healthy natural glow. I can’t say much about the long lasting effect on my skin since it’s been a month I’m using it but the immediate effect is impressive. I have received so many compliments from my colleagues and friends for my glow. My first bottle is already over and I’m ordering a second one. I usually use it in my morning and night routine after applying water based serums and before the sunscreen. I’d recommend everyone to try this product atleast once. A must have in my skin routine
