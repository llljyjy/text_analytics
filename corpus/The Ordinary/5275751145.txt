My first ordinary product ever bought and I’m in awe! It cleared my acne and has helped other products I previously saw no results with actually work (ex. Vitamin C serum that used to break me out). I have dry/combination sensitive skin and saw no drying or oiliness and had no bad reaction even from using twice daily off the bat. I cannot recommend enough if you’re looking for an all around serum or ordinary product to try as a starter. It’s lasted forever too with a couple drops going a long way, and soaks in after a few mins for you to apply anything else after without pilling as long as you make sure it’s absorbed first.  Cannot recommend enough! my new most cherished staple
