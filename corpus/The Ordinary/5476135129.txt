I think this product is helpful for those with acne and oily skin. I loved the smell and the texture of the moisturizer, as well as the cooling effect it had when applying. Unfortunately for me and my dry skin, this moisturizer dried me out a bit. I still think this is a great product and would definitely recommend it to those who donâ€™t have dry skin. Clean Beauty
