I bought this to use as a facial oil and felt that it didnâ€™t really do much for my skin. And so this bottle say there gathering dust for about about a year...until one day, for whatever reason I decided to use it on my hair. Boy does my hair love this stuff. Few things have ever left my hair so soft and smooth, even after the next shampoo! This is how I could tell that this product is actually improving the condition of my hair, instead of simply coating it and weighing it down like so many other hair products. Try this in your hair, ladies! Try it in your hair!!!
