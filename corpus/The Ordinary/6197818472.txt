Wow! It actually works. This was my first Ordinary purchase and I was somewhat skeptical. It helped de puff within a few minutes & I noticed the dark circles under my eyes improved a little. I’d say 75-90% reduction in puffiness and 50% reduction in dark circles. I’ve been using it for 1 week in the mornings. I’ve tried it all too! I do recommend an eye cream on top as this is just a serum. Depuffer! Wow!
