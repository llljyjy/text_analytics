I purchased this on a whim after finishing up my free sample of the Biossance Lactic Acid Serum and didn’t wanna dish out $80 on a new one.  People said this would be a good dupe so I bought this together with squalene hoping for the same glowing effect. While I did see small results, I don’t think it really did much for me I didn’t even end up using the whole bottle as I switched back. nan
