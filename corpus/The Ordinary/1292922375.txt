I don’t understand all the mixed reviews? How can this be so terrible for some but life changing for others??? I want to try it but I just don’t know what to believe. Also Why can’t we post questions anymore? Why can’t we see past the 4th line of our reviews? It always says there is a problem on the question part. It’s sooooo frustrating to not be able to discuss or ask questions about a product before or even after purchase please fix this problem Sephora nan
