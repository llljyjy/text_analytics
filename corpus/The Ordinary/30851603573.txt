They changed the name of this serum from “Buffet“. That was a great name. Now it’s a mouthful to say, but still a great product. I think it’s a dumb move by Sephora - what do I tell my friends I use? Well it won’t be “theoridinarymultipeptideHASerum“. Ugh. Folks, think of how easy it is to protect a one word product! Should have kept it as is. I won’t be able to share the love.This is my go-to product everyday of the week, so I hope they don’t change anything else about it! This is BUFFET for anyone whose as confused!
