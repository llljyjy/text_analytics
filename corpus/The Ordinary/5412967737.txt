I’ve been using this product for so long and I finally came to the conclusion that it is the cause of most of my acne. I took a break from using it and didn’t have any acne for a month! When I try to work it back into my skincare routine I breakout so terribly in places where I never even get acne typically. I thought I must be crazy since it works for everyone else so I’ve been trying to make it work for over a year now, but I’m finally giving up on this product.Anyways I’m glad it works for some people but be careful because it definitely made my skin worse! BEWARE!!!
