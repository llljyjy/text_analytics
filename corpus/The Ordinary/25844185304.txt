I don’t use a lot on my skin. Luckily, I don’t really have to as my skin is pretty clear. I just got this to try out the product as it seemed to be loved by many.  But I guess it’s just too harsh for my skin. I only used the product a few times & that was enough for me. My sin was sensitive to it also gave me some acne. (where then a beauty consultant told me that acne is good after using a new product.. because it’s taking out the “bad stuff“ from your skin.. ahhh, -I don’t know if I believe that one) Going to try to give it to my friend with acne issues & will re-review. shelved it.
