I’ve been using this product for about two months. I purchased it on recommendation from an employee who told me it would help with acne scarring. I have certainly noticed a difference after using it every morning between cleanser and moisturizer. My dark spots haven’t completely faded but they are definitely ligher. Consistency is Key
