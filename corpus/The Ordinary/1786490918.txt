I have been using this product for a few weeks and can already see improvements. It has helped with getting rid of a few small acne scars as well as general redness. My skin tone is much more even. This has also worked very well for layering. I put it on first thing in the morning and then my moisturizer/spf and it layers beautifully without pilling. Will continue to use! Love It!
