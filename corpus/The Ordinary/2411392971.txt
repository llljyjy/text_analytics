I’m not sure what the problem is, bad bottle? Unacceptable if so, but regardless this didn’t do anything for me. I had been using the retinol in squalene, and then I took a break when I lived abroad for ~7 months. My skin became textured again, had some mild acne, etc. so I decided I would restart retinol when I got back. I saw this, and was interested by its “fancy” formulation. It’s been 4 months I’ve been using this and it doesn’t do anything. I’ve tried so many retinoids. Tretinoin, adapelene, the squalene .5% retinol, Peter Thomas Roth in the blue bottle (my fav but not my wallet’s fav). I’m going back to the squalene. It’s very close to Peter Thomas Roth with how well it works at smoothing my skin, doesn’t cost nearly as much though! get the one in squalene instead
