I was reading through reviews and saw someone mentioned to try this as an alternative to deodorant. Peri-menopause must be causing wonkiness with hormones and in turn was making my pits smell off, even without working up a sweat.This works !    Keeps smell away and if you forget, just wipe and smell is gone.Kinda want a spray pump for it now. Finally found alternative to Deodorant
