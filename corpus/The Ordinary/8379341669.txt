This is my second time repurchasing this hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary. It’s a great basic serum that you really can’t beat for the price. It works well with sensitive skin and I really have no complaints. Just remember that your skin should be damp when you apply this serum! Your skin will thank you. nan
