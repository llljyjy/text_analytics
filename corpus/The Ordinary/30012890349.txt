I’ve been experiencing a lot of maskne I had to wear a kn95 and a level 3 mask not allowing my face to breathe and causing my face to break out. My face when I break out it eventually ends up scaring. I’m a month and 1 week into using this bottle and it has cleared my acne scars. I am on other medication to help with the acne but I’m so happy that I’m only half way done with the bottle and how much a difference it has made. holy grail in a bottle
