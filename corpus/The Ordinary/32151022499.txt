I bought this product because it had great reviews, but after using it for about a year I realized that it was breaking me out. At first, I thought the breakouts were just purging because skin does that, but I soon realized that it was the cause of my sporadic breakouts that I usually never had. I have combination skin that’s a little bit more on the oily side, but it also gets super dry in spots like my nose and my forehead so I thought this would help add a bit more moisture to my skin. I probably won’t be using this product anymore because it simply didn’t work for me. nan
