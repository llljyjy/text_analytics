I was struggling with really bad under eye bags and dark circles and was desperate for something to help. I tried this and it has helped a lot with the bags! I also noticed that the wrinkles that were starting to show (I’m 30, Almost 31) have gotten much much better!! The dark color hasn’t gone away completely but it went from being a dark purple to like a pink? I’m extremely fair with pink undertones so this may be a good as it gets. It works!!
