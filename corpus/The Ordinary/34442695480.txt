I love this product! Skincare beginner... I was interested in this product because it is supposed to help with acne scarring but since I have acne-prone skin, I was afraid to put it on my face since it’s an oil so I gave it 4 stars to no fault of it’s own. Everyone’s skin is different so definitely do a patch test. Instead, this is TMI but I put it on external private skin and it has helped alot with skin dryness. I believe it also has some healing ingredients. So something you can look into if you didn’t like it on your face. Multiple Uses
