I have super dry flakey skin ESPECIALLY ON MY NOSE and this really helped. Ive never used oil on my face but this is natural so i trust it and it does work. I only use it 3x a week because i noticed if i use it to much it builds up and i get 2 or 3 acne bumps because of the buildup but other than that 10/10 works great as a foundation primer as well, gives a glowy look. Works!!!
