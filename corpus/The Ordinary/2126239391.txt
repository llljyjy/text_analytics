Worst vitamin c product on the market. It goes on your hands like a lotion but the minute you put it on your face it turns to sand and also stings. It also has a terrible smell. Great price and I did notice it give me a glowy look but the application annoyance is too much for me, I canâ€™t with this product. nope
