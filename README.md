# SMU ISSS609 Group Project

## Overview
Welcome to our project! This project was created for our SMU ISSS609 Text Analytics and Applications module.
The aim of the project is to apply what we learnt in the module to streamline and improve Sephora's review pipeline.

## Problem Statement
Sephora currently lacks a system which is able to translate the product reviews it solicits from customer into actionable insights. Furthermore, the process is currently quite menial with interns having to sort through and make sense of the general sentiment in these reviews, and escalating the more egregious reviews for action by the various department. Without an automated process, the lead time for responding to high impact cases would be slow and customer service recovery, if required, would be less effective. Above all else, being able to understand the sentiments of customers on products, or brands, will allow Sephora to work with the brands it carries, and better strategise how to position it product lines to increase sales.

## Analytics Tasks
The 3 key analytics tasks are:
1. Document Clustering - to best determine the relevant department each review pertains to
2. Topic Modelling - to extract trends from reviews
3. Sentiment Analysis - to determine the overall sentiment of each review

Several methods were trialed and tested for each step and the more accurate model was selected and used to build the app

## App Prototype
The pride of our project: an app created on streamlit which is able to apply our working models on reviews in real time!
