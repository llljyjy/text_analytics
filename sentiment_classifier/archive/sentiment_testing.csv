First things first, I would not consider this an overnight lip mask as it only lasts about an hour/hour and a half (that’s even pushing it) after application. My routine with this is usually to apply it right before I head to bed. I’ll usually browse through my phone/read a book for an hour or so before I actually sleep. Throughout that hour or so, I am usually not talking or doing anything that would cause the product to disappear from my lips, but somehow, it still does not stay longer than the duration I mentioned above. Furthermore, I have not noticed a change in the moisture/hydration of my lips in the mornings after applying this the nights before. At times, I even find that my lips are drier after I use this product.

Just wanted to show you guys the color and compare it to the Gingersnap one which was discontinued and which I’m still hoping they will bring back... So, the texture and feel on the lips are the same as all the other Laneige lip masks.  It feels smooth, not grainy at all, kind of like a thick gel but without being sticky or leaving any kind of residue on the lips as it fades.  Those are the positive attributes of this one BUT, sadly, as with the previous limited edition of the Cherry one, I’m disappointed with the scent.  It does smell vaguely of pumpkin spice but in a plasticky, fake kind of way and without any kind of sweetness added to it.  After a couple of minutes on the lips the smell dissipates completely and the slight aftertaste you are left with is reminiscent of vaseline in some way, very artificial...Compared to my beloved Gingersnap (on the left in the included picture), it doesn’t add even the slightest bit of tint to your lips and, of course, doesn’t smell nearly as good.  So, if you are looking to replace your Gingersnap mask (like me) this won’t do it but overall, it’s a good product and does the job it’s intended for.  Moisturizing, doesn’t interfere with other products you plan to apply afterward (when used during the day) and is definitely suitable for this time of the year (I’m writing this in September).  So, if you are just looking for something to “refresh“ your Laneige arsenal, this would be a good addition to it but don’t expect a sweet, gourmand pumpkin spice smell and/or taste.",Good but not a very natural flavour...,light,green,combination,blonde,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,Skincare,Lip Balms & Treatments,,review new pumpkin spice flavored lip mask wanted show guy color compare gingersnap one discontinued still hoping bring back texture feel lip laneige lip mask feel smooth grainy kind like thick gel without sticky leaving kind residue lip fade positive attribute one sadly previous limited edition cherry one disappointed scent smell vaguely pumpkin spice plasticky fake kind way without kind sweetness added couple minute lip smell dissipates completely slight aftertaste left reminiscent vaseline way artificialcompared beloved gingersnap left included picture doesnt add even slightest bit tint lip course doesnt smell nearly good looking replace gingersnap mask like wont overall good product job intended moisturizing doesnt interfere product plan apply afterward used day definitely suitable time year writing september looking something refresh laneige arsenal would good addition dont expect sweet gourmand pumpkin spice smell andor taste,<Text: review new pumpkin spice flavored lip mask wanted...>,positive,945

I hate dry cracked lips and other than Medicated Blistex.. nothing seemed to work until I found this! Even my fiancée is pushing me to get two of the new flavours in full sizes since he has started using it too! We wear it through the day as well not just over night. We do NOT wash it off EVER and our lips have never felt better! We are a pretty affectionate couple so we kiss a lot and his whiskers often chafe up my lips and surrounding skin but …this gets rid of the lip irritation in no time! If my lips become super dry & peely.. this lip mask seems to slough off peeling skin at the source and seal the little nasty paper like cuts the peeled skin leaves. I’m so excited to get the new flavours and I hope they actually taste good! I’m out of samples now so .. I’m going to jump in like Hubby wants me to and order 2. If they are not up to standard.. I’ll return them but I really hope that’s not the case.  He said doesn’t even care if there’s a pigment .. that’s how much he loves this!  I’m really hoping that the full size is actually the same quality as the sample size since there have been some comments in that regard. It’s not cool to lure us with a great product if you are changing the amount of certain ingredients in the full sizes. The last thing I want is drier lips.
