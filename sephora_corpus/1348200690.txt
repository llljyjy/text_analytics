far good havent luck finding physical sunscreen doesnt cause irritation skin one hasnt cause severe issue moisturizing sits well foundation thick didnt like moisturizer alone though instead putting primer preferred putting primer slight sunscreen scent alarming bearable overall would recommend product especially super sensitive skin like mine need make sure double cleanse face night make sure everything washed Good for sensitive skin
