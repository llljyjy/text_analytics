far favourite tan hard find one natural undertone one done also hate wearing tanner long period time express game changer great payoff short time left super easy apply know basic application color usually last day notice fade also get bit blotchy chest around think better using moisturizer regularly may fix problem though cant blame product overall really love product would recommend Finally a natural looking tan!
