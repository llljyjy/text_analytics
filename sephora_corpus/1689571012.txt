received product complimentary via influenster honest review first impression good pump much appreciated smell little like creamsicle looking ingredient worried citrus would irritate eczema prone skin thankfully didnt even prolonged use vanilla extract doesnt seem serve purpose apart fragrance impressed byi happy brightening effect though wish moisturizing dry skin there serum might pair richer cream nan
