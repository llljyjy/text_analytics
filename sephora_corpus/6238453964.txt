based recommendation mature skin beauty influencer decided try murad retinol serum ran skinceuticals retinol serum couple thing like firstly important think work well andor percentage retinol low used skinceuticals even lower version skin smooth clean renewed like feeling morning applying night using murad skin didnt notice change improvement anything like skinceuticals retinol product expensive unacceptable secondly product light scent sensitive skin absolutely hate skincare product added fragrance please save money buy better retinol product Not a great retinol product compared to others
