using previous version water bank cream silky luxurious moisturizer provided perfect hydration without making oily skin feel like oil slick decided try new gel version thinking would somehow work oily skin disappointment really doesnt much anything certainly doesnt provide enough hydration dont understand brand change formulation often case newer formula pale comparison better performing older formula Average and over priced
