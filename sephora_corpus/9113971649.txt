dont really consider sensitive skin react well product skin basically inflamed first time used tried day later see maybe needed get used got worse ended throwing away strong herbaly smell found offputting like something wanted put skin generally use unscented product skin maybe accustomed something gentler definitely surprised moisturizer expensive would contain many known irritant like botanical extract fragrance definitely recommend Stay away
