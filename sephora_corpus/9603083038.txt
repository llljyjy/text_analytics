excited try teatreebased cleanser good acne clogged pore past decent job reducing redness size large pimple breakout didnt much oil control also recommend using moisturize area breakout usinglayering slightly thicker moisturizer rest face even oily skin often didnt seem provide enough moisture overall good product think probably cheaper alternative would perform well Good for acne-prone areas but not for whole face
