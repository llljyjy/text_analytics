really like sunscreen far there smell sits well skin greasy feeling combination skin breakout agree others rather come pump runny feel like use quite bit adequately protect face attribute thin consistency sure long bottle last like formula considering spf mineral sunscreen spf like sleekness bottle flight wont take much room liquid bag seeing review saying bottle becomes flaky hasnt happened yet mine new overall say prefer mineral sunscreen scent free high spf youll probably enjoy within budget great spf but not perfect
