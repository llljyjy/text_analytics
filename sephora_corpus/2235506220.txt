honestly think called mist rather lotion would preferred spray top using cotton round basically absorbs product irritates sensitive skin didnt see change using product sample size tester work could face change term moisture soothing red skin felt looked like applied water face even sprayed face still change would pay hundred dollar would pay nope said may like product may skin would thrive didnt anything find sample try first Meh Product for Me
