glad got sample kit didnt purchase full size bottle first smell awful smell like cheap crayon dollar store lipstick middle school art classroom paint mixed together aside gross smell make skin back hand soft place applied luckily said effect better maybe worse use neutrogena hydro boost smell way better insanely affordableseriously would anyone pay much Totally Not Worth It
