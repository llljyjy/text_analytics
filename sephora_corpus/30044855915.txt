received product complimentary estee lauder influenster honest review first really like scent overwhelming way light fresh smelling first felt thick texture cream figured might sink way cause pulling foundation rich cream surprise soaked minute applying skin felt soft supple issue pulling either foundation tried skin type typically pretty dry gave much needed hydration without feeling heavy way around really good moisturizer Really like this for my dry skin!
