ive read lot really critical review online lot product perceived overpriced though say really lot okay moisturizers get job done since ive started using night might bit heavy combo skin skin felt soft hydrated fine line forehead also dont seem prominent couple week use quite expensive limited edition great deal though would say extra dollar spend skin care definitely worthy purchase This moisturizer won over a huge skeptic
