received exchange honest review ill start saying prefer oil free sunscreen one one heavier lotion feel similar light floral scent found nice dont like fragrance might sensitive scent applied morning skincare routine waited minute applying makeup normal noticed pilling applied foundation maybe didnt let dry long enough didnt issue oil free version though love hyaluronic acid keep skin moisturized dont think formula right personally would purchase product think price point bit high Not bad but prefer oil free version
