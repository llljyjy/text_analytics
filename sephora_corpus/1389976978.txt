used moisturizer happily month loved plump soft made skin feel great makeup heavy however started retinoids began burn skin dont see fragrance listed ingredient definitely slightly botanical scent think good inexpensive option beware sensitive skin retinoids Good moisturizer, bad for my sensitized skin
