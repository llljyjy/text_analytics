guess expecting little bit based everything promised texture reminded night cream thicker consistency wellknown oatmeal body moisturizer found hydrating put without serum treatment possible second ingredient dimethicone help seal product thats case use makeup primer instead moisturizer however require moisture based experience dont believe could recommend anyone purpose moisture need decent make primer well maybe buy instead hate leaving bad review also want honest Decent makeup primer alternative at best
