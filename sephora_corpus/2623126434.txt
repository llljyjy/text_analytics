sure got idea dermalogica product might heavily scented think maybe due simplicity classic whiteblack packaging oil smelled strong bad like essential oil strong also didnt rinse completely could feel skin still coating oil splashing water several time perhaps washcloth required based review sound like many find great product returning Not great for scent sensitive people
