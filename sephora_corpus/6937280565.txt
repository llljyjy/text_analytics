trying bunch different bha toner formulated sensitive skin first one doesnt irritate skin upon application scent might bit much dont mind also like consistency toner say noticed blackhead dont seem prominent even though still noticed skin looking clearer even though combination skin toner doesnt overdry irritate dry zone would say gradually work using daily sensitive skin could get intense Works well on my sensitive combination skin!
