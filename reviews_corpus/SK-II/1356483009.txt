I purchased this product & used the entire bottle. Needless to say, I saw zero results. So...why was this? To the manufacturers credit, they don’t actually promise results. They simply tell the consumer what was discovered when workers (who had their hands submerged in this stuff for 12-16 hours per day) had younger looking hands vs. other body areas. Therefore, a couple of drops on your face once or twice a day...not going to do anything for you. BTW - this is mostly water. Save your $$ & try something different, don’t pay for fancy water. Buyer Beware: Expensive Water in a Bottle
