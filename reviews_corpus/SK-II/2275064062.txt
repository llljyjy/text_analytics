The toner in this kit is far too harsh for those with sensitive skin. It caused redness and blotchy skin for me but glad I tried it in this kitNow the Essence and the mask are excellent! The mask is super hydrating and there is so much excess formula that I could use on my neck. The Essence made my skin so smooth and soft and there is so much product in the bottle (mini size). If you want to try this brand to see if it’s for you I definitely recommend trying this first to see if it’s for you. A luxury line for sure but I understand the hype from the Essence alone essence and mask are worth it!
