I love this mask! It’s the only one that without fail I’ll get complements about my skin the week after. That said, how on earth are other people getting free samples in exchange for “honest reviews?” I’ve been buying from Sephora for years and have never received such a thing. The recent addition of all these free gift reviews on Sephora’s site is irksome at best and insulting at worst. That said, I really like this mask and ration them because they’re outrageously expensive, but it’s better than a spa treatment. This is how I rationalize the cost. Love this mask - I wasn’t “gifted” for my review
