TL DR - yes this delivers unique skin benefits, that so-called ‘dupes’ don’t, but you don’t NEED to go into debt for it Ok. I’ve been curious about this essence forever. But, like a sane person, I thought it was too expensive to even try. I did experiment with essences, though, from affordable k beauty brands to other essences that only seemed affordable when compared to this. Without naming names, I used a very well-known essence that everyone calls an sk-ii dupe, but after going through that bottle I didn’t notice any results. Fast forward to the semi annual sale at Sephora, and I decided, sure why not. I’m 37, have barely spent anything on makeup in two years of lockdown, let’s splurge. It was after using this for about 2 weeks when I saw a photo of me and was like .. that’s me? That’s what my skin looks like?? It’s hard to describe exactly, but basically my skin has a dewy, almost ‘wet’ look, all glowy and shiny. Like my face is covered in gloss. But it doesn’t *feel* goopy or sticky, it’s completely smooth and soft. I have already bought a second, much larger bottle. The thing I want to end with is that, while this has worked great for me, I’m using this as the capstone to a skincare routine that covers all the well-aging essentials ( you know, from regular exfoliation to active-packed serums ). Before spending $200 on this, most people would be better served by incorporating clinically-proven active ingredients and figuring out what cleansers and moisturizers work best with their skin. But if you think you have a pretty complete skincare line up and are still looking for that level-up wow, this might be perfect for you. wow. my skin has never looked better
