One of the most effective brightening masks I’ve ever used, hands down. Over the years it’s been slightly re-formulated and re-named multiple times. ’Brightening Derm Revival’ is the latest incarnation and every bit as good as the original. Truth be told, there isn’t a great deal in this tissue mask, the ingredients listing is quite basic. You have Pitera (obviously) and only a couple of brightening agents (Niacinamide and Vitamin C - which are in every other brightening mask I’ve used) but for some reason it’s like the perfect storm! Just the right quantity and combination of ingredients for something exceptional. As with all tissue masks, I find these fiddly and end up cutting a line between the mouth and eye slits (both sides) so that the mask can adhere to the sides of my nose and cheeks instead of hanging over them. I leave on for up to 30 minutes and then massage in any excess into my face, neck, arms etc. Pricey - yes, but for me; very much worth it as an occasional splurge. It reduces the sallowness that my skin is prone to and leaves my overall tone brighter and more luminous. I find it works even better when used for a few consecutive nights, right before a special occasion, as the effect seems to accumulate. Been using this mask on and off for years, and keep coming back to it.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
