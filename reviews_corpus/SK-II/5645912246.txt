Got a little trial size with my points I thought I couldn’t believe my luck! I actually really liked it, I felt like it did help my skin esp on my forehead. I’m running low on my trial size and had added the mini size in my cart. I figured it would be my splurge product lol But right when I was ready to buy it I saw it has parabens. I’m not paying $99 for parabens, not  in this day and age when there are so many products now without any. I’m so bummed cause I really wanted it.. Ugh nan
