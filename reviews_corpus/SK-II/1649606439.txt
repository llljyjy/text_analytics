Man, these are expensive but WOW, do they ever create an immediate effect on the skin. I first tried this in the discovery set that comes with 1 mask, a smaller essence and a mini toner. Great set to try all 3. The pack is loaded with juice. DON’T WASTE IT!!!! Before I even open the mask I’ll cut a small corner off and squeeze the juice into the palm of my hand and apply it EVERYWHERE with my hands. And I mean, everywhere. Face, neck, arms, stomach, chest. I can do it 3-4 times before I even take the mask out. There is so much essence and if you don’t use it you are simply wasting it. The mask will be drenched regardless. After I’ve squeezed most of the essence out and applied it all over my face and body then I take out the mask and apply it like normal. 20 minutes and then remove. Let the essence dry and then follow with your regular skincare routine. I think some people say it pills because there is too much product being left on the skin which again, is why I recommend using it with your hands first and applying it all over the body. This mask makes the skin look instantly stunning. Brighter, smoother, Glossy, radiant, airbrushed; all the good words. I remember the first time I used it I was standing at work and a woman walked by me and yelled, “WOWWWWWWWW YOUR SKIN IS AMAZING.“ They are expensive but I use maybe 1 mask a month for an event so even a box of 6 will last a long time and on the daily I use the regular treatment essence. The ULTIMATE special event mask.
