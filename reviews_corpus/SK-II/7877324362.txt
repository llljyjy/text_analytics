I really loved the RNA face cream so I was excited to try this set. Sadly I have to agree with the review that it seems like water that I’m putting on my face. I haven’t seen any difference in my skin after daily use for 2 weeks. The bottles are small, but 2 stars for no irritation or scent. The face mask was very thick cotton like material and wouldn’t stay on my face. I wouldn’t recommend. Disappointing
