I got a sample with the pitera starter kit. I had to travel and grabbed this thinking it was the essence and was surprise with how clear my skin got. I also was using with Augustine’s based cream as a new part of my routine but I purchased the full size. I still get blackheads but no pimples with two heads anymore. I use the essence and this lotion it’s great
