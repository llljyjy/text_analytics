This stuff is amazing, but expensive. My skin tends to break out when I try new moisturizers or face washes but it did not with this essence. My skin is noticeably softer and — it sounds cliche to say — more luminous. (I have been using it for 3 weeks.) I use it after washing my face, 2x a day, with the Fenty Skin Fat Water toner/serum. It’s been a little slower in evening out skin tone, but I can see it’s changing. Good thing a little of it goes a long way. Expensive, but a little goes a long way
