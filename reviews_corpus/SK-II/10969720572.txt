I try to stick to using only one product on my eyes— my goal for it to address my severe dark circles, puffiness, and the small fine lines beginning to appear around my eyes.I began using this cream dedicatedly every morning and night. I immediately noticed results after the first application (skin appeared slightly brighter and fine lines less prominent). After continued use for two months now, I can say that the effectiveness of this cream is undeniable. For me, the best I’ve ever seen for my undereye area, in particular. As far as application, I’ve found it to be of very soft/creamy texture, extremely lightweight and fast absorbing. No noticeable oiliness left behind. Love this stuff! Skeptical at first, but VERY surprised by results!
