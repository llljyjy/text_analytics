This is changed my face in every way I didn’t think ipossible. Especially with acne scarring and skin tone evening. I do wish it wasn’t so expensive, but it is what it is. It really bothers me when I read reviews and people advise other people not to use something just because it didn’t work for them. That is so irrational everybody’s skin is different. You’re supposed to review your experience only and not tell other people what they should, or shouldn’t do. nan
