Love SK-II Pitera (especially their Essence), great patent ingredient for moisture and anti-aging. I wanted to love this mask, I really did, but I couldn’t. For the price, you’d think you would get a much more luxurious and high quality mask. The actual sheet mask itself is VERY thick and stiff, it doesn’t sit on the face very well especially at rounded areas like your chin and nose. This isn’t a huge deal breaker for me, but I this masks pills like CRAZY once you take it off and try to pat the leftover serum in. Overall very unpleasant, there are so many other choices for mask at a better price point. Could do without.
