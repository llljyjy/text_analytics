The previous version of this product (RNA Power)  is my all-time favorite moisturizer but this version is still the best currently available in the market. The texture is soft, spreads nicely, and absorbs well, leaving my skin feeling supple with no sticky residue. The cream moisturizes deeply but is not too rich and does not clog up my skin. I love that there is no sunscreen and use this both day and night. The fragrance is stronger than in the prior version, but I got used to it. I no longer think twice at paying the relatively high price because I find the product to be worth it. The only moisturizer I will use
