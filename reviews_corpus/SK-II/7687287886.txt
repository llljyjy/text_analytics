I have a simple skincare routine: Dermalogica microfoliant, Skinfix barrier+ lotion, sunscreen. I also very rarely use face makeup (concealers, foundations, or bb creams). This essence became an added step because I was finding very fine lines across my forehead, even though I’m only 23 (Likely sun damage). Previously, I couldn’t find a moisturiser that would was hydrating enough to get rid of the fine lines without making me look greasy. I’ve been using the essence for 3 weeks now, 2-3 times a day. I splash a few drops on my hands and pat them into my face. Don’t use cotton pads as it would waste so much of the product. I kept the rest of my routine the same, but found that my skin retained moisture better, like it made my moisturiser work better than it had been on its own. Because of its watery texture, I highly recommend this for oily skin (it seriously is like patting water into your skin), and it has never added any “weight“ to my routine. It’s expensive, but I’ve been using the mini size and it’s only 3-4 milimeters down from the top of the bottle, so this is going to last a while. What drew me in was also that the active ingredient is the first on the ingredients list, which I have never found on anything else (at least when I was shopping around for essences). But a warning: it has a weird smell, subtle but weird and almost unpleasant, which is likely the natural scent of the ferment filtrate. TLDR: Worth the hype, will last a long while, will buy again. Took off a star for the price. Works with a simple routine, but expensive
