I’m glad to be adding the NEW Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream to my Belif brand skincare collection! It has great ingredients like vitamins C and E plus a proprietary Quadruple Hyaluronic Acid Blend. It even has niacinamide. It applies easily and glides across my skin. I especially like the hydrating and smoothing feel it gives to my eye area.  It has a pleasant, light citrus scent that is noticeable for the first few minutes and then fades. I look forward to using this in my daily morning skincare routine. It’s a recommend from me! Vitamin C morning routine
