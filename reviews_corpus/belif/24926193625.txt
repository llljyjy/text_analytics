ðŸ’¦ The summer of sunscreens isnâ€™t over yet! I received a sample of the @belif.official Aqua Bomb Sunscreen from @influenster a while back and Iâ€™ve got some thoughts formulated about it now. First things first though, while this is a super cute mini, how am I supposed to accurately test a product that I can only get 2-3 uses out of? So take my thoughts with a grain of salt.ðŸ’¦ CLAIMS ðŸ’¦- Two in one moisturizing sunscreen that hydrates and protects- Promises no whitecast or residueðŸ’¦ PACKAGING ðŸ’¦- Cute. Very small.ðŸ’¦ MAIN INCIS ðŸ’¦- Homosate, Octocrylene, Octisalate and Avobenzone for sun protection- Marigold extract (reduce UV oxidative stress)- Woodbine (antioxidant)ðŸ’¦ TEXTURE AND SCENT ðŸ’¦- Thick and creamy but also slightly greasy and a bit difficult move around and to blend into the skin.- Leaves me slightly glowy and healthy looking but with a bit of a greasy feeling left behind. Took about 10 minutes to disperse.- No whitecast on my skin! Wouldnt call this the most hydrating so I need a moisturizer before using this on my drier days- Citrusy, herbal scent that dispersed quicklyðŸ’¦ EXPERIENCE ðŸ’¦- Not my favorite texture wise, but the finish is really quite nice and I havenâ€™t had issues with pilling. My biggest issue is the greasy finish left behind for much too long after application. I hate feeling greasy and Iâ€™m impatient and donâ€™t like to wait too long. But, as promised there is no whitecast and while it might be a bit difficult to spread over the skin, it really is comfortable once applied. No stinging, no burning, no issues around the eyes. I personally wonâ€™t repurchase at full price ($38 on Sephora for 50mL) but maybe if it was on sale. Creamy, glow chemical spf
