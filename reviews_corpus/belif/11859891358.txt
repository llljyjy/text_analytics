I am loving the moisturizing bomb! I actually layer it on top of the aqua bomb and it works great. I personally prefer products with a pump so that I don’t have to dig my fingers in and get product under my nails but I was able to compromise. The moisturizing bomb is lightweight, not really a scent but moisturizing! Does well in colder temperatures. It gave what it’s supposed to give!
