I received this sample from Influenster in exchange for my opinion and review. First off the smell is very heavy citrus and herbal which I really did not like. It’s very strong. The cream is a lightweight gel That goes on nicely and sinks and well it doesn’t leave any type of residue. If you are looking for a product that introduces a high dose of vitamin C into your skin care regimen this would be a good product. Personally I couldn’t get past the smell. High-dose vitamin C and herbal citrus scent
