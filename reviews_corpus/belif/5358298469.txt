Love this toner - it is hydrating and just feels so refreshing. You don’t always needs acids in your toner every single time you wash your face and that’s why I purchased this. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling sticker like most toners. Not too too bad in price. I just wish it was more aesthetically please packaging wise - but I alternate between this and the summer fridays Aha gentle exfoliating toner. nan
