I received these products for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I purchased the full-size after using every drop of the samples. In this super dry season (doesnâ€™t it feel dryer than usual?) the Belif aqua bomb and moisture bomb kept my skin hydrated for longer than my previous moisturizers. I am happy for the chance to sample these products because I am usually a skeptic to trying new-to-me skincare brands. This one is a good one. This is your sign!
