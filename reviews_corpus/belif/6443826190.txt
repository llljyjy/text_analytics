LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER. I have dry combination skin that is severely dehydrated. This product feels so nice on the skin. It’s cooling, calming, and absorbs nicely into the skin. My issue with some moisturizers is that it only sits on the surface of the skin. I felt this product absorbed quickly and didn’t leave my skin leaving greasy at all. I 10/10 recommend and will looking into other products from this line :-) nan
