Been using this moisturizer for years but never wrote a review until now. This stuff is my holy grail. I have very sensitive skin (a light breeze could break me out), and very dry skin as well that’s made even dryer by overnight acne cream. This moisturizer is pretty much the only thing that works for me to keep my skin nourished. If they ever stopped making it I think I’d be screwed. lol My holy grail
