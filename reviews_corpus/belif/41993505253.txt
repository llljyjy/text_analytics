The sunscreen felt really nice and smooth on my face. I used it before going out for a long walk in the sun. I had no white spots from the sunscreen and once you rub it a few times itâ€™s a clear application. My skin was still smooth and shiny after application. I would definitely use it again the next time I go out. Sunscreen!
