Literally the only product that my skin likes!! Most moisturizers irritate my skin and make it burn. Whenever I switch to a different one, I notice a change right away so I always go back to this one and it heals my skin. This gel is so gentle, soothing and has a cooling effect. However, in the winter, my skin gets really dry so this isnâ€™t moisturizing enough :(( Best moisturizer ever
