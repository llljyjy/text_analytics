I was sort of disappointed because of the amount of fragrance in this product. I thought it was super brightening, hydrating, and effective but it’s not suitable for sensitive skin. I personally was not bothered by the fragrance and I liked the scent but what about people who have sensitive skin? I just would not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin or anyone who feels they could possibly be bothered by the fragrances. I would not risk it. But for people who don’t have sensitive skin, you all would love this vita c cream! It’s quite a amazing and worth the purchase. I like how it glides onto my skin and how hydrated I feel after using it! It’s so amazing and you won’t want to miss out on this product! It’s okay
