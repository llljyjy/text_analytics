I love the texture and how it makes my skin so supple and hydrated! Definitely for my dry pals out there. It a thick whipped gel texture and absorbs immediately into the skin. I also enjoy the scent a lot.  After showering I like to apply this on my face and it very refreshing. Knocked off one star because it is quite pricey in my books :( Will most likely purchase again if I have the funds. Will check out the aqua bomb next, seems great for summer! Great moisturizer
