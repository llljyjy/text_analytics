Very soft, light-weight formula. Takes less than a minute to fully sink into the skin. Spreads easily since it isn’t a heavy cream, and pretty moisturizing. It’s very lightly scented with what seems to be lemon and verbena (?) which I liked even though I’m not usually a fan of scented skincare products. Enjoyed trying. Received complimentary sample via Influenster. Belif The True Cream - Moisturizing Bomb
