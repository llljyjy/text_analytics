I love this one and the gel moisturizer. The only issue is, the smell. My skin can’t handle fragrances, natural or not. I break out like crazy. It’s the best moisturizer I’ve ever used just not for sensitive skin. Your face is constantly not dry, You don’t need much at all and it last for a while. I just wish they had this in an unscented/ fragrance free one. nan
