I’m a lip balm and mask junkie and this one is great. After trying it at night for a couple weeks, I decided to use it mostly during the day to keep my lips moisturized and protected since I live in a very dry climate and it worked great for that too. You can’t go wrong with this lip mask. Great for day as well
