This is a good product. It has a very nice spa-like fragrance. I like to use it for that reason, but otherwise, I don’t see a huge improvement in my skin with this product. I usually layer it on top on the nights I am using a retinol. While it provides moisture it wasn’t like a moisture mask. I have other products I prefer over this one, but again, this isn’t terrible! Just not my favorite or first preference. Good moisturizer
