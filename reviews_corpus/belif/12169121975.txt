I had thought this was going to be a great restorative moisturizer as I am incentivised to review s free small sample a few things I noticed Immediately was the extremely strong scented moisturizer.  I found their body lotion is less scented which I find backwards,  but it also stings my skin when I put it on after washing my face. I believe it’s probably the vitamin c to give that “glow“ but it was way too strong for my sensitive skin, and I would not recommend this moisturizer to others who have fair delicate and sensitive skin. Kinda stings..
