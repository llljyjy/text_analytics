I’m a constant user of face sunscreens and am always open to trying new ones. I was excited to try this one, it had good reviews and was recommended by a friend. After trying it, I really like the way it feels, and how it absorbs in my face. It didn’t make me breakout and I love that. No crazy annoying scent, or skin irritation. The only flaws about this was the price, and it will burn your eyes. nan
