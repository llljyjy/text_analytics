Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamen C Cream has the same light texture as the original Aqua Bomb and soaks in just as quickly. It does have a citrus-y scent, so if you are bothered by fragrance in your skincare this may not work for you, however, the scent does dissipate once you’ve applied makeup on top of it, not so much at nighttime, especially if this is your last step in skincare. I have very sensitive skin and this did not aggravate it,  I’ve woken up glowy and refreshed every time I use it. Belif Aqua Bomb Vitamen C Cream
