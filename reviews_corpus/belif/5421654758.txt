This moisturizer gives my skin such balanced hydration and I come back to it time and time again. It has a non-greasy formula that never feels heavy and doesn’t clog/congest my pores. I love it the most for change of season/ drastic weather when my skin doesn’t know how to respond. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbs which makes it suitable for morning and nighttime use. My skin is happy and at peace when I use this moisturizer. Holy Grail
