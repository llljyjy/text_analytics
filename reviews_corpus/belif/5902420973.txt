I wanted to love this with all of my heart so badly, but everytime I try to use chemical sunscreen, my skin gets red and warm. So I have to stick to the physical/ mineral sunscreens to keep that from happening.Initially when I put it on it feels beautiful. But that’s where I’m forced to remove it after 5 min. It makes me sad because I adore this brand. I can guarantee if I didn’t have that issue, I’d give it 5 stars. I enjoy the packaging though! And the fact that it’s spf 50. I prefer the stronger sunscreens on the marketbecause I try not to burn or tan my skin. My skin doesn’t like chemical sunscreens
