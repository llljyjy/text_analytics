It’s difficult to review vitamin c cream because honestly you don’t really see big drastic changes. It’s more for prevention. But I did like this one compared to others I’ve tried. I liked that it was a thin cream not a gel or oil. Didn’t have a bad smell like others.  Overall pleased with it and would recommend. nan
