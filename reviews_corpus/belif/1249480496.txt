I already use the regular aqua bomb moisturizer in the summer time and the moisturizing bomb in the winter. I was waiting for a spf version for my lazy work days, so I won’t have to apply moisturizer and then sunscreen. I really love this product. I have normal to mildly dry skin and this product works perfectly for me. I haven’t experienced any adverse effects like some others have reported. I’ve tried a few spf/moisturizer combos (tatcha/glow recipe) within the last 3 months and this one was the best. No white cast, no greasy residue… nan
