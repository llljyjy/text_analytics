I love belif aqua bomb cream, & my skin loves vitamin C, so I was excited for this product. It has the same lightweight gel texture of the original that becomes watery on the skin, which feels really refreshing & light. It doesn’t become sticky unless you use way too much, and it doesn’t interfere with sunscreen or makeup. Overall it’s a really nice product & also smells great! For dry skin, I’d layer it under a slightly heavier cream. As juicy as the original and smells amazing!
