I absolutely love this moisturizer!! I have dry skin, live in a dry climate I’m 45 & use Retin-A. So I have tried a lot of moisturizers in my search to find the best ones & this is definitely one of my favorites! It’s great at night, during the day, it plays well with other products (skincare, makeup & primers) in my experience. It’s great on its own or paired with other serums & moisturizers. Some nights I’ll use a thick moisturizer but still feel a little tight & dry, I’ll put this over the other moisturizer & it instantly fixes the problem. It’s lightweight & breathable while still being incredibly moisturizing & it never breaks me out no matter what I pair it with. It’s a hero product & definitely a staple in my skincare arsenal. Hero Product!
