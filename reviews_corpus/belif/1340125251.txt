This is my second purchase and I swear by it. I immediately feel hydrated skin when I put this lightweight moisturizer on my skin before my SPF. I tried another water based cr√®me from origins and it did not work as well as this. Even better to layer this on under a mask on flights. Keeps your skin hydrated. Second time around and I still love this product!
