This is my new favorite daily sunscreen, and I’ve already repurchased! It’s moisturizing enough that I usually don’t need moisturizer underneath. It feels soft and pleasant during application and once you’ve applied, and doesn’t have a strong sunscreen smell. It’s easy to apply enough to get the full SPF 50 protection, and the “washable” formula makes it so easy to reapply (no gross feeling like can happen when trying to reapply a waterproof sunscreen that has already “set” on the skin). I love this one for daily use, it makes applying sunscreen daily easy and enjoyable! I hope Sephora stocks this one forever!! Pleasant to use, moisturizing, and effective!
