It’s very light weight and great because I don’t like the heavy lotion feeling some moisturizes give you. I also thought the scent was light and nice. I really wanted to love. I have very sensitive, picky skin so unfortunately I broke out in a few red pimples on my face after using for a few days. My search for a winter face moisturizer continues. :( Wanted to Love but Broke Out (Sensitive Skin)
