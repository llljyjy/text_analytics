I overall liked this product! I gave it a 4/5 due to scent. At first this is a strong scent and on your face it stays a little longer and obviously strong due to it being close to your nose. But it does feel moisturizing and lightweight. The scent does fade but at first it was strong, which some people don’t like. I don’t mind a whole lot but worth mentioning. Overall, I would buy! Really like!
