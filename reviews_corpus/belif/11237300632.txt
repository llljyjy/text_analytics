I really loved this vitamin c aqua bomb cream! My skin has been very dry lately and my makeup applies so patchy. As soon as I received this I tried it out and I instantly noticed a difference. My skin felt so smooth and hydrated all day long. I had a nice moisturized glow to my face. Even when I applied makeup, I noticed how smooth my base went on. I absolutely loved this and I recommend it if you have dry skin. So moisturizing!!!!!
