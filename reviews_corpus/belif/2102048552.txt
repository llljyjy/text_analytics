The best part about this sunscreen is it’s very fluid texture and how quickly it absorbs without leaving a white cast.It has a slightly runny lotion consistency - a little goes a long way. It spreads quickly and looks dewy, but I prefer a slightly more satin dry-down. The humid summer weather makes it more difficult to wear such a rich feeling sunscreen without feeling like it’s too much or greasy so I may recommend this for winter or dryer skin.For reference I am oily combination leaning towards normal during the winter. Otherwise, it’s a great option available at Sephora. I prefer my other Asian beauty branded sunscreens, but this isn’t too far behind. May be too rich for oily combo in the summer
