I really wanted to love this one! It has a nice gel consistency, but it wasn’t hydrating enough for me. I liked that I didn’t get nearly as oily as I usually do with my go-to moisturizer, but it left my t-zone SO dry that it was flaking, and I started breaking out after 2 days of use. I returned it and ended up getting Lala Retro from Drunk Elephant. I’m really happy with that one! Not enough moisture for me
