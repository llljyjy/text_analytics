The cream feels nice. I have to apply more than I normally would to make sure all of my skin is covered but it still gave me the hydration I needed. I felt refreshed after putting it on. I don’t think I would purchase this though. The container looks kinda boring and every time I look at it I think “meh” I will continue to use what I have though. nan
