I honestly don’t understand the high end lip mask craze or paying anything more than like $7 to moisturize your lips, but I received this complementary and have enjoyed it - but it’s not worth the price tag. It definitely moisturizes and lasts, I use it at night and wake up to still have moisture, which is great. I just can’t justify spending $20 on chapstick. nan
