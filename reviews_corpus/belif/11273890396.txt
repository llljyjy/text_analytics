It’s got fragrance FYI but I love the smell, I love the feel it’s hydrating and penetrates and the texture is cooling on the skin. It feels thirst quenching for your skin. Arguably a personal preference as per the experience. I enjoy wearing it but can’t be precise that there isn’t better or cheaper for the same price point. nan
