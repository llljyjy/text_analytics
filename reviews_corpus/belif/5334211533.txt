$38 is higher than I would pay for sunscreen—but it goes on very cleanly and has a pleasant scent, I put it on my tattoos since SPF 50 is higher than I use normally. Seems to work very well and doesn’t feel greasy! I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for an honest review. Pricey but works
