This moisturizer was okay to try out but not my favorite. This product comes in a plastic jar, probably the coolest factor about this product was the lid, it was just fun to interact with. This is a lightweight gel that has a more robust citrusy smell that didnâ€™t linger too long. Upon first use it did not absorb into my skin right away and sat on top of skin kind of filmy throughout its wear until it was washed off. After using the full sample sized jar I am not super impressed by this moisturizer, it can work for an everyday moisturizer but nothing special in terms of effects. Overall this was just my experience but I would not consider a repurchase. Just Okay
