I received the Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream and just in time for these hot sticky Summer days! I have used the original Aqua Bomb True Cream in the past and really enjoyed it, especially at night I would get it out of the refrigerator and it would feel so cool and refreshing on my skin. This Vitamin C cream seems to be a replica of the original plus added bonuses. The cream itself is a bouncy gel like cream that goes on the skin easily and it really is super lightweight. I have used it at night before bed and my skin feels clean and healthy in the morning. It gave my skin a nice glow during the day without looking oily or greasy, instead it looked healthy and natural. The scent is pretty light and I smell more of a Lemon scent than an Orange scent (which is fine). I have sensitive skin and none of the ingredients in this cream irritated my skin which is really nice, especially for a vitamin C cream, because it can be hard to find a good cream that doesnâ€™t have hidden irritants! The only thing I would watch out for is this cream has a heavier amount of silicone in it than the original which can cause some creasing in makeup or some residue on the skin if you apply too much. Other than that this is a great cream! I loved the original and this one is definitely on par with it! Go grab a jar! So Glowy!
