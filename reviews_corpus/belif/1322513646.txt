I’ve used this brand before, and was happy to receive some new products to try. I’ve used this once so far, and so far, I can’t say anything bad about it. I used it as the last step in my morning routine. I loved the texture of it; felt smooth on the skin. It felt & kept my face very moisturized. nan
