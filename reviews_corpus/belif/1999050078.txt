Wow! My face never felt softer, BUT I got some sort of allergic reaction where my nose wouldn’t stop dripping. Like a sinus sensitivity. I tested using it and not using it to make sure, but it happened every time. It’s such a shame, because I really love everything about it (smell, texture, effectiveness), except for the fact that I get this crazy reaction. I’m a long time user of the other Aqua Bomb Moisturizers, but now I’m on a search for another moisturizer like this one because I had no idea how well moisturizers could really work! So I highly recommend this if you don’t have any skin sensitivity. Amazing, but not for sensitive skin!
