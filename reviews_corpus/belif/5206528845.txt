I LOVE Belif aquabomb. I’m not just saying that. It’s been my staple moisturizer for years now.So aquabomb in sunscreen form?! Absolutely fantastic. Belifs products are in the mid-range of affordability and worth every single penny. Aquabomb sunscreen goes on just like normal sunscreen, thickness being the same. It feels a tiny bit greasy at first and then dries down very soft, leaving a nice glow to your face. It also has the signature aquabomb light citrus scent that’s refreshing and not overwhelming, with a hint of that typical sunscreen smell(that i happen to really like lol). I have sensitive skin and had no problems. The best of course
