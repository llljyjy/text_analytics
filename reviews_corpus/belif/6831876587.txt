FINALLY, a sunscreen that is truly hydrating! No matter how moisturizing other sunscreens claim to be, they always dry down matte, they pill and overall actually seem to suck all the moisture out of my dry skin.This is the first formula I’ve tried that isn’t a moisturizer WITH spf (those formulas require a lot more volume per application to meet the spf claim) but is an actual spf with a hydrating base. I’m in love with this! Finally, a truly hydrating SPF!
