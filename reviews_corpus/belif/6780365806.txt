I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster.I love the overall formula of this product as it is lightweight, applies on the skin with a cooling gel like feel, and creates a lovely moisture barrier that lasts long after application. I found that it gave my under eye area a more bright appearance in just a few weeks of use and overall made my skin feel more hydrated. I will continue using this product in the future! Extremely hydrating!
