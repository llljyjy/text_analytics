I use this every night before bed and even in the mornings especially since it’s snowing and freezing where I live. I get really dry cracked lips during the winter months and have usually just use Chapstick, but this stuff is amazing it’s not sticky and doesn’t have a residue. It’s nice and creamy and goes on easily and it keeps my lips moisturized throughout the night and I apply some more in the morning before my day for some extra moisture. I recommend this for anyone wanting to prevent dry or cracked lips before they happen. Your lips will thank you!
