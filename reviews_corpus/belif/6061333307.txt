I loved this moisturizer! I have oily and acne prone skin, and this didn’t aggravate my skin at all! It is a thinner, gel-like cream that soaks into the skin quickly. It is not greasy or heavy at all. My skin fresh and brighter. I haven’t noticed a huge difference because I was already using AHA’s, but I do see that my skin has been clear, a bit more glowy, and it hasn’t made me break out. I love the faint citrus scent to it as well. Overall, I really enjoyed trying the sample I got, and would love to get the full size! Great moisturizer
