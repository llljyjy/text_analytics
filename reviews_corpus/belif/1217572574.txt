This is one that feels great for summer, but beware, there are sensitizing citrus oils in the ingredient list! You’ll be able to tell from the fresh and natural citrus scent. Most people don’t turn pink as quickly as I do, but I could also tell there were citrus oils in there from my redness. I’m not a gal who enjoys silicones in my facial products, I prefer more interesting ingredients at the top of the list. This product goes water, then silicone, so it’s nice and light, but it has that silicone feel that you either love or hate. No breakouts for me, which I was worried about with the concentration of ’cones, but no long lasting or noticeable results either. Feels nice, but for me at this cost, it’s not worth it! Gel Cream
