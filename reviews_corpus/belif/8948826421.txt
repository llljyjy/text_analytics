I wish this wasn’t fragranced but thankfully, it’s not overpowering. It’s a thicker consistency than I expected so I put a little too much on at first causing my skin to already look oily. I haven’t noticed any breakouts from that initial application, but I don’t think I will keep this in my routine. Could be better
