This moisturizer is an okay alternative to my regular cream which is out of stock everywhere right now. The pros: it is light, not heavily scented, has a gel like texture; and does not cause breakouts. The cons: it comes in a very heavy container which is unnecessary and a waste of plastic, you also don’t get that much product, it’s not that moisturizing for winter time but might be better for summer. nan
