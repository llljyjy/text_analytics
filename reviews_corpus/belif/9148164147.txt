I was looking for a replacement to Laniege water bank since they changed their formula but unfortunately this just did not do it for me. I like the light scent but it is just too heavy and sticky. It takes forever to soak into my skin and then pills under makeup and sunscreen. Itâ€™s going to have to go back! A swing.. and unfortunately a miss!
