So I’ve used the aqua bomb and moisturizing bomb. Both have been great. I wanted to try this because I need to even my skin out a tad bc I’ve developed some sun spots and acne marks but nothing crazy. I’ve been using this for about a month maybe a little less and although it’s a good moisturizer it really hasn’t has any visible results. It’s just a lotion and I don’t really think the lightening factor has worked. But overall it’s a good lotion and I will continue to use it! good!
