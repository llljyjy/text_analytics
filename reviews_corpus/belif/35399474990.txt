I absolutely love this product. The picture with my hair up is the first day I used it and the second picture is today 2 weeks later. Granted I went to the beach so I’m a little tanner, but my skin is so much healthier and brighter. There is no filters used in these photos. I deal with dull uneven skin tone and this did wonders for me. Shortly after applying it absorbs and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy. I have stayed on top of using this daily and am so happy with the results. I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy it. This cream is the bomb
