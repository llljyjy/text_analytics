The sunscreen does a great job of hydrating the skin while acting as a sunscreen. I got the sample size which was perfect to use at a festival I went to. We were out in the sun in the entire day but my skin felt highly protected. I reapplied it once in the afternoon just for the extra protection. The application melts into your skin within minutes. Highly recommend! Belif skincare for the win!
