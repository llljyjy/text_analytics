Belief Aqua bomb brightening vitamin C serum has been part of my skin care from a month now and i can surely say that it is very hydrating and gives a natural glow to skin. I have also stopped using a hyaluronic acid serum as it already has 4 types of hyaluronic acids in it along with Vitamin C and E which gave my skin the maximum moisture.First time when i used i felt a different feel of a mild fragrance but im not sure if i got used to it now and doesnâ€™t feel anything much effect of it now. nan
