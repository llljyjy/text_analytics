I received this cleanser in a Belif set I bought.  I love it!  It is jelly like and you only need a little.  The scent is sooo good, citrusy but not strong or overpowering.  It feels like it cleans really well but is not drying at all.  I used it during winter when it was -30 C. I would recommend and buy the full size on sale for sure! Amazing cleanser!
