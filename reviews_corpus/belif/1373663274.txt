First off… I love how this product smells! I tend not to love products with too much fragrance but the light citrus scent I get from this is so good and dissipates quickly on the skin! My skin looks great after using it and I’m able to apply makeup on top of it without any problem! It’s super lightweight which I prefer in the heavy California summer! Amazing Scent and Perfect in Summer!
