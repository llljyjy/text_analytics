Bought this lip mask because I’m on accutane (causing dry peeling lips!) and this has SAVED my lips! I feel like the second I put it on the dead skin comes off and my lips are completely plump and moisturized. I use this before bed but also when I feel I need the extra moisture during the day when I’m just at home. It doesn’t have a scent to me and doesn’t sting or anything. A little goes a long way as well! Amazing product I will be buying more when needed! Accutane lips no more!
