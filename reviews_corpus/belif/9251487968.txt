I received this item complimentary from Influenster and Belif  in exchange for my honest review. For starters the packaging is always chic and minimalist for this company and I’m here for it! When buying the full size I think it’s a pretty standard amount and the price point isn’t terrible but I wouldn’t call it necessarily affordable either at roughly 40-45 dollars depending on the store. Now for the product itself…citrus scent…hence vitamin c brightening. Not overwhelming though and enjoyable. Definitely gives summer vibes and sunshine. The consistency is my favorite and my skin loves it. It feels refreshing and not heavy and leaves my skin glowing and renewed in a sense. It’s not greasy and my sensitive skin has had no adverse reactions and I have super sensitive dry to normal skin and it’s psoriasis and scents and things really trigger my skin issues and this did not. In my opinion it’s a definite try and staple to have for summer moisturizing. Citrus Sunshine
