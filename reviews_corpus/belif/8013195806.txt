I really loves this aqua bomb cream. The texture was light and fluffy. The cream was easy to apply on the face. I have really dry skin for some reason and this really helped with keeping it moisturized. I felt like it lasted all throughout the day so didnâ€™t really have to apply more then once a day. Loved this and definitely recommend. Aqua bomb was bomb!!!!
