I got the product free from influenster and belif for my honest review. This product had a good consistency and applied well. It blends in and doesnâ€™t leave residue. The smell is subtle. I prefer mineral based sunscreen and these ingredients are not my favorite. Overall I think there are similar products that are cheaper and have cleaner ingredients. Not my fav
