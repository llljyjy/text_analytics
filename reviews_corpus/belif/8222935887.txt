It actually feels really good, it’s not heavy. So fresh. It doesn’t have that wierd sunscreen smell, it also has a light and refreshing smell, it feels moisturizing. I like to use this during the day and then I go in with the true cream by belief at night after washing my face. It doesn’t leave that ugly white coat on your skin. I blends into the skin really nice and smooth. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone literally. I received this by influenster to review, it’s a legit unbiased review Amazing!! Love it
