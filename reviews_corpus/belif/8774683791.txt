Thick patch of grease that did nothing for my dry chapped lips . I used it for a few consecutive nights in a row in varying proportions just to alter the amount  I was using and application procedure ( tried with a lip mask applicator ) but nope this just wouldn’t work . It’s unfair  that it’s sold at such a high price point . Glad this was a free sample . Won’t be buying it . nan
