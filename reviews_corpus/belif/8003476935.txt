this definitely has a heavy consistency. i would recommend for people with very dry skin. for any other skin types, application at night would be the best. it wakes you up with such a nice glow! i havenâ€™t used it as a mask yet, but i can totally see how that would work in moments of deep hydration before makeup! using too much of this does make me oily, so thats the only thing i would be weary of. nan
