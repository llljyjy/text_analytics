Though I’m not sure that saying that this is one of Belif’s best products is really saying much - the bar seems pretty low. I will say that this cream version of their Aqua Bomb towers over the denatured alcohol-heavy formula of the original Aqua Bomb. This version did not burn my face, nor did it turn it a fiery red. The formula IS moisturizing and contains beneficial antioxidants. Don’t get me wrong. But, I do wish they could just give up on all of the potentially irritating extracts and frangrances. Without those, their products could be appropriate for all skin types. They really seem to be cutting themselves out of the sensitive skin market. nan
