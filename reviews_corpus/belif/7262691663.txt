I quite enjoyed this moisturizer. The vitamin C and hyaluronic acid do you provide brightening effects for the skin, but I find them to be somewhat temporary. Hydration does not last that long, so it doesn’t have that greasy feeling, but also doesn’t hydrate for longer periods of time. The smell is rather pleasant. I find it to be better for morning use under my make up, rather than a sleeping mask. Dullness goodbye, Short-term hydration
