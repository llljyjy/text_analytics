I really wanted to like this toner as I am a fan of their cream but this is just meh. It does somewhat absorbs but mostly sits on the skin and then pills with other products as the day progresses; there are better toners out there that are much more hydrating and suit my combo skin that tends to dehydrate very fast. I’ve got the full bottle so I guess I’ll finish it, but it’s a no for me. Just meh
