I wanted to like this product, but it just didn’t work out for me. It does absorb into the skin nicely, although it left a bit of film on my skin like the original aqua balm. Unfortunately I’m pretty sure it also broke me out, because it was the only new product in my skin care routine, and the breakouts went away after I stopped using the moisturizer.  This might be great for others, but it’s not a product for me. Not a good fit for me
