I got a 10ml container of this with my beauty reward points, and I’m back buying a full size of it - I’ve dropped so much money trying to find a good moisturizer that works with my combo skin and one that I can use through the seasons/year, and I finally feel like I found it! My face gets really dry in the winter, and not only does this soak in and last all day - it’s not greasy!! It also has a very subtle but clean smell, and my face has smoothed out a lot since I started using it. I’m a belif-er now :) Finally found it!
