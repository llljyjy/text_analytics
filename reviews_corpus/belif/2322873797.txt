I enjoyed this, it does have the sunscreen smell that i am not a fan of. It is something that i will always keep my purse. I felt like i had a slight white cast on my face afterwards but i am also used to using the EltaMD uv clear tinted sunscreen. Overall a good product but i am not sure i would buy a full tube Would recommend
