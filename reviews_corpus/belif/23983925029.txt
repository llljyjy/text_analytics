I received this complimentary lip mask and was super excited to test it out! I like the product. It doesnâ€™t have a strong fragrance and I could feel the moisture on my lips. My only issue with the lip mask is I think it could be longer lasting. If I put the product on at night I find myself having to reapply before actually going to sleep. Could be longer lasting
