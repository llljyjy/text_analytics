I actually really like this product. It has a slight herbal scent that is not over powering. Since this is a moisturizer and sunscreen, I was expecting a bit more white tent left over. But it actually blends out really nice on the skin. Also, it does not make the shin feel sticky! Wears well under makeup! Love!
