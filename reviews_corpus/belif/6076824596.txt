I’m 32 weeks pregnant and my skin has changed completely! I have these dark areas on my forehead and neck area. I wanted a cream that can provide enough hydration (because of the weight gain, my skin is stretching) and have vitamin C to keep me bright and glory. Belief just does that! I lii on be how it has my skin feeling afterwards. I’ve noticed such a difference in how I’ve looked this spring. It’s a must try! Pregnancy Hormones
