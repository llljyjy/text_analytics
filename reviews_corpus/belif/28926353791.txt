Has a very smooth consistency. The formula is relatively thin compared to regular sunscreen. This thin formula allows for easier application, and leaves less of a white residue. However , itâ€™s not may favorite sunscreen, and I would definitely say that there are better options. 3 stars from me :/ Average
