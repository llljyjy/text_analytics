The first day of use on this product I definitely felt like my skin was hydrated and looked brighter. I was really happy but after about 3 days of use I started to notice my skin was breaking out. I continued using it and my breakout didn’t get worse but it was clear my skin wasn’t liking the product. After I stopped using it my skin normalized. Sadly a little disappointed but could be good for others! Good at first
