I received this product free from Influenster and Belief in exchange for my honest review. The Aqua bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream is a great vitamin C moisturizer. It absorbed quickly into my skin and has nice light scent of citrus to it. I like that it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy like other moisturizers I’ve tried. nan
