I bought this mask as something to put on my lips before bed, hoping to have them hydrated in the morning, especially during the winter. The goal was to also purchase an exfoliator as well, but I wanted to try one thing at a time, so I chose Belif because it’s a brand I’d also been dying to try. Uhhh this ish is AMAZE! It’s a thick clear mask, similar to Vaseline on look, feel and texture, but super moisturizing AND it works. I use it every night and have been for the last 4 weeks and I always wake up with soft, moisturized lips with no dead skin on my bottom lip. Love this product and I highly recommend it. And a little goes along way, so spending $20 on the jar, you get a lot of product and I’d be surprised if one jar didn’t last you the minimum months with daily use. Love it!
