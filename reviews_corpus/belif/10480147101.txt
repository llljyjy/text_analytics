I really liked this cream, although i didn’t notice it was much different (if at all different) from the original moisture bomb, but still a great cream, it doesn’t clog my pores, it leaves my skin feeling really soft and supple. I would definitely continue use of this if the other isn’t available. Great, cool feeling cream
