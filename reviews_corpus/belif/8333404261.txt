This is great for when my skin is feeling oily and like I just need a light moisturizer. It feels really good and has a cooling sensation. I can’t give it 5 stars because I am not sure it’s worth the money and I probably wouldn’t repurchase as I’ve used better products. If the price isn’t an issue and you have oily skin I think it’s perfect! nan
