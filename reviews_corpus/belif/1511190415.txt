Thanks to Influenster, I’ve actually tried Belief products before and I love them! When using the Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream, this cream actually repaired my skin when it was suffering from some dryness from my current skin routine. I used this a few times and the dry patch went away. I really do love Belief products, they do wonders for your skin. As a bonus, I’ve been using Aqua Bomb Hydrating Body Moisturizer on my elbows and have really soften them. Belif Has Amazing Products!
