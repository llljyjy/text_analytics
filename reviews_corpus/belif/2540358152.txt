Pretty non-irritating for a vitamin c cream and it did feel nice on the skin, although the smell of fruit loops cereal was really distinct. I also haven’t eaten sugary cereal in years but this smell really punches you in the face. I would probably pass on this because of the scent alone, but it’s a great option if vitamin c serum is too concentrated for you! Just make sure to use SPF if you put this on in the daytime. nan
