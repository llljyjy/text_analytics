I received this product as a sample for free on behalf of Influenster and Belif in exchange of my honest review. I live in FL and even though the weather doesn’t get as cold and dry as in the northern areas, this past weeks it’s been rough on my skin. These samples came at a great time to try and hydrate my skin. I’m not a fan of moisturizers cause it’s usually so humid I don’t need it except of actual hydration. Been using these for the past 2 weeks and my skin has been kept pretty plump and soft. No tightness whatsoever. Skin is now soft and plump
