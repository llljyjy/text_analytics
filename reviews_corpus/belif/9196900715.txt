I’ve received a sample size. Im huge on moisturizers! I’ve been trying to find one for years! I’ve tried so many, so many wear off after hours of work. & this one does not!!! It’s so moisturizing, not oily, super lightweight!! It’s lasts through the cold, dry weather, I love it. I will be purchasing the full size when I run out if my sample sizes. A little also goes a long way, I also put some on my boyfriend, he also loved it! For the cold, dry weather!
