The best sleep mask! I was using laneige water sleep mask religiously for years and it’s decent but then I got to try this as part of the 30$ travel set and was blown away from day 1. I recently started using tretinoin and finacea for acne. Before this mask, no matter how many layers of moisturizer I put on at night, I woke up with dry tight peeling skin. But not since using this at night!!! I’ve been able to up my tretinoin (0.04 micro in the pump bottle) to almost every night thanks to this with almost no irritation. Worth every penny. At the very least, get the travel set, I’ve tried all of them and every product has been amazing, super impressed with Belif in general, 100% recommend! Tretinoin uglies be gone!
