This belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin  C Cream contains Vitamin C, E, and 4 types of Hyaluronic Acid, which my skins loved! This is a very light cream with a sort of gel-like consistency that feels silky and has a fresh citrusy scent that I have also been loving this summer. The cream leaves my skin brighter, feeling hydrated, and silky smooth. I can’t say enough about how amazing this product made my skin feel!I received a bonus sample of belif Aqua Bomb Hydrating Moisturizer with my cream. The moisturizer has the same fresh citrusy scent as the Vitamin C cream, so your body will smell just as good. I love how hydrating the body moisturizer is on my dry arms. I used this product a couple times a day and my arms are so much softer than before I started using it. I love it!I really like belif products, so I wasn’t surprised when I was pleased with these products as well. I would recommend anyone looking for brighter, smoother skin to try the belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream and grab the belif Aqua Bomb Hydrating Body Moisturizer while you are at it! Makes my skin feel silky smooth!
