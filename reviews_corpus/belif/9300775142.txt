My skin is dry, not only due to living somewhere with so much sun but also because it was damaged during my radiation and chemotherapy treatments. So, when I get the chance to try a new moisturizer I am in! First thing I noticed when I opened this was that it smelled so good. Not super strong, that’s not good in skincare, but very subtly fresh and citrusy. It also is a gel like texture like the regular Aqua Bomb which makes it glide onto your skin. If you keep it in the fridge it’s so soothing and cooling. I’ve used this now for just about a month, added it to my nighttime routine, I stretched this sample as far as it would go and I am really enjoying it. It’s moisturizing without being too heavy. I’ve you have oily or combo skin this will be perfect for you. It works well to put over a serum.I love that it’s got vitamins C and E, and four types of hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is so beneficial and something our bodies naturally produce. It is really good at retaining water, helps with your skins elasticity, can reduce scarring, and even helps wounds heal faster. The vitamin C will help with aging and brightening of the skin. I always love when a product has hyaluronic acid because so far it’s been so helpful in getting my skin back to it’s pre C state.If you’re extra dry like me you may need to put another moisturizer on top, but if you don’t have desert dry skin, or even oily skin, this is the one for you! Regardless, with the benefits of this one I will definitely consider using it under one of my heavier creams. With the sample size it’s hard to say if the brightening works but my dark spots do look slightly better. It would definitely be worth it to purchase the full size to see what using it longer could do. Great for oily or combo skin
