Super happy seeing this, I always hate to wait after applying sunscreen to apply moisturizer and then rest of makeup. Itâ€™s just too much layering for me. Belif aqua bomb moisturizer was my all time favorite, I got ecstatic seeing it with broad spectrum SPF 50 sunscreen - all in one. Non greasy, no white residue and it does not contain oxybenzone. Enough SPF with my favorite moisturizer
