If you have dry skin you need this! I use the moisture bomb at night and love it. I had a sample of this so decided to try it.  At first I used it alone and it was great, the texture is different but not stucky or tacky. As the description says it is pillow proof, it stays on your face. Then I applied it on top of the moisture bomb. MAGIC!! My dull, dry, winter complexion is gone. Do yourself a favor and try this combo. Moisture Bomb + Aqua Bomb Sleep Mask, it will change your life.
