I really like the Belif moisturizing cream bomb so when I saw I was getting a chance to try another product from this brand I was beyond excited. This product does not smell the best, it is similar to the scent of their other products, but with a stale orange/corn like tinge to it which I didn’t like. It has an amazing texture though like thick, but as you rub it in it becomes light weight and feels super moisturizing. I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and this product didn’t irritate my skin whatsoever which was nice since some vitamin C creams can be a little irritating for me. It targets pores, dryness and dullness or uneven texture. It has vitamins C & E plus four types of hyaluronic acid for visibly brighter glowing skin.  It is described as a light weight gel but I’d say it leans a little more to a creamy cushiony gel. One of the highlight ingredients I found most interesting was the addition of “lady’s mantle (alchemilla vulgaris) which is traditionally used by herbalists for its anti-inflammatory properties. It is not horribly priced at $43 for 1.69 ounces. I’d say if you’re looking something brightening this may a fun product to try. Personally I prefer their other moisturizers to this one. Good, but not my fav from this brand
