I have tried this product the aqua balm and the vitamin C moisturizing balm this one is by far one of my favorites. The vitamin C one wasn’t moisturizing enough and kind of dried out my skin which is very interesting since it’s not supposed to do that but for my skin type it did. This product however the true cream moisturizing balm was very moisturizing kept my skin moisturized and soft all day long! I pair this with a little bit of sunscreen and I wear it in the a.m. to the p.m. and then wash it off and apply the aqua balm at night Great product better than the others
