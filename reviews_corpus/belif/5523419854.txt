Recieved free from Influenster. If you look at my previous reviews you’ll see I have received and mentioned Belif moisturizers and cleansers. I really love the brand and I have a difficult time finding products for my skin. This is similar to the Aqua bomb moisturizer. I love the gel like texture and I love the citrus scent, although I know some people do not like scented skincare. Scented skincare can often cause breakouts for sensitive skin but I have very sensitive skin and eczema and had no problems introducing this into my skincare routine. Skin feels hydrated hours later without any greasy feeling (for those who have oily/combo skin) I’ve used all of my vitamin c sample but these are my other products. My original moisturizer is almost out so I am considering buying the full size vitamin c. However Belif, in the past, has came out with products (an aloe Vera moisturizer) then quit carrying it. So I’d hate to try a new product and love it then not be able to find it I belif in this product
