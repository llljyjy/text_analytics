I got to try Belif’s Moisturizing Bomb. Moisturizing Bomb is great for night time. It felt super smooth and has a light refreshing scent. It did dry quickly and lasts all day and night for great hydration.  Moisturizing Bomb works well for winter dry skin. I’d definitely recommend this to a friend. Very moisturizing
