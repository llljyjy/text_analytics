I received these products from belif and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. While I wasn’t able to test this out over an extended period due to the fact it’s a sample size, it did a good job hydrating my face and body for the days I used it. It has a nice neutral scent and nice packaging. It’s also filled with tons of great ingredients. If you’re looking for moisture, it’s worth a try! #complimentary #aquabombheadtotoe @Influenster @belifUSA Moisture
