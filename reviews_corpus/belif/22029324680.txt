I’ve been using this moisturizer for 2 years now and felt compelled to write a review since it’s life changing. It’s weightless while nourishing and melts right into your skin. It’s perfect over serums, under makeup, and on its own. I stopped getting acne and dry skin since I started using it everyday. I live in PA so wanted to point out that it’s a great cream for changing seasons as well. I honestly will never use another moisturizer! life changing
