This is the most beautiful lightweight gentle yet effective sunscreen I have experienced in the last 2 years.  I love the clean formulation with no harsh chemicals as well as the gentle and light texture that literally melts in to the skin.  It does not leave a white pale residue and also is really hydrating without feeling too heavy or greasy.  Such a beautiful and innovative travel and user friendly product that I even love to use it on my 7 year old that is sensitive to sun e posture and works like miracle on my whole family.  Totally a must have in every beauty and skincare lovers collection! Love my SPF love my skin!
