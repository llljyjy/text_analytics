I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I was really impressed with this lip mask. I have tried other brands from Sephora and they ended up sitting unused in my make up vanity. This one is great and I have used it daily! It does not feel greasy at all and my lips are so smooth. Itâ€™s been perfect for winter time here! I definitely recommend. Perfect Prep for Soft lips
