I received these products complimentary from Influenster and belif skincare in exchange for my honest review. The only thing I disliked about this moisturizer is that the samples weren’t full size! I have super dry skin which typically requires a heavy moisturizer, even in the summer. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this kept my face feeling soft and hydrated. It’s a gel texture which usually doesn’t perform well for dry skin, but this one is heads above the competition. It has a soft, pillowy texture as you’re applying it and then starts absorbing. it does not pill up or cause other products to pill. It has a light and very pleasant smell that isn’t at all overpowering. I bought a full size jar as soon as I finished the sample! Velvety texture and smoothness.
