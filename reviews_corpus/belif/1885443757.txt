Was looking for a replacement after Farmacy Daily Greens formula was changed. I didn’t think I could find another one I liked as much. But after a very patent employee showed me all the gel moisturizers in store I settled on this one. The scent is beautiful and fresh. I can’t do perfume and this is not overpowering. It’s light and not oily. Really love it! My new ride or die moisturizer.
