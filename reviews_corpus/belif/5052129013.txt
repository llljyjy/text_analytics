Love the none oily feel that it provides. Most sunscreens I have issues with the white cast after you try to rub it in, but that’s not the case with this product. I tried my sample on my face and needless to say I didn’t have a burnt face by the end of the day so I was more than pleased! A must have for any beach trips!
