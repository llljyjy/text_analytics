I love this cream! Doesn’t break out my very sensitive skin; and I like that there’s not a scent to it. It’s not oily, and penetrates the skin well without leaving it too tacky. I just wish that the packaging wasn’t so bulky. It appears as though you potentially get a lot more product than you really do. I’ll still repurchase though. nan
