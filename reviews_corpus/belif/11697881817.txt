I’ve been using this product a few times now and so far I Love it!! It works great as a Moisturizer and it leaves no white cast after applying it like most sunscreens. It does leave my skin a little shiny right after I apply it, and at first I wasn’t sure because I have oily skin and didn’t need the extra shine, but the shine went away within a couple minutes, and there’s no greasy or oily feeling at all. It leaves your face super hydrated. It does have a light citrus sent, but it’s not overpowering at all. I will definitely be purchasing this product and will reccomend to others. If you have oily skin, combo, or dry I feel like this would work great because the hydration is there without any residue at all!!! Love it. Definitely a must have!!!
