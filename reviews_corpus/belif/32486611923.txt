LOVE LOVE THIS sunscreen!! First off there is absolutely no WHITE CAST! whatsoever! and I am skin of color!! (I revived this product for free to share my honest opinion/experience!) It didn’t make me break out, feels amazing on skin isn’t oily or greasy feeling, doesn’t peel and so far my skin is loving it!! So I definitely recommend though it is pricey, other then that love it! Amazing sunscreen
