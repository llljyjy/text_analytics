I have combo skin with dry patches mainly on my forehead, eyebrows, and near my chin. I really liked the dewy finish of this moisturizer but I don’t like how I can feel the dimethicone inside. I personally prefer other moisturizers that have SPF included but would recommend if you need a moisturizer to help with dry patches. It’s light weight but does leave a bit of a sticky feeling on the face. I could see this wearing well with makeup. Dewy Finish
