I liked that this brightening cream had vitamin c in it which can be very good for your skin. The packaging was very pleasing and the bottle/jar was very appealing as well. It’s all very clean, fresh and modern looking which is a good move on Belif’s part. The cream itself was a nice consistency and went on my skin rather nicely. It wasn’t tacky but wasn’t too thin either. It made my skin very supple and smooth and really like this on my skin. Nice Cream!
