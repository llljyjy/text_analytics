I don’t get the rave reviews on this. A texture and appearance similar to Vaseline, and it performs about the same. No lasting power, and no difference with nightly use. As with any lip mask, I make sure I exfoliate my lips on a regular basis before application. The tub does appear to be pretty big, which sucks because I’m probably just going to throw it out. MILK Make-up’s melatonin lip mask worked way better for me. Meh.
