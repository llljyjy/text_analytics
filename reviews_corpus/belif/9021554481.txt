This moisturizing daily sunscreen is to die for! I love how smooth is comes out of the bottle and it blends into the skin without leaving a oily or sticky residue. I love that is has an SPF of 50 because I am fair skin and need good coverage in the sun. Other lightweight daily sunscreen moisturizers do not compare. I highly recommend! I love Belif products!!
