I really wanted to love this product! I got it for free to try from Influenster and put it on that night. I didn’t feel like it did any better then another product I have that costs less than 5 dollars. It felt really nice on and it kept my lips moisturized overnight, but in the morning they didn’t feel much better. I got really chapped because of winter and I used this a few nights in a row and didn’t notice a huge difference. I put my other product on and it was better by the end of the day. I would say it’s good for maintaining, but not serious repair. Okay, not for super chapped.
