I received this product in exchange for my honest review!This sunscreen gets a 7/10 from me! It’s fragranced but didn’t break me out and has a barely-there white cast. This is a chemical sunscreen so it wasn’t greasy and applied very well for me. It also has a dewy finish and makeup applies well over the top of it! I took points off for the fragrance and it didn’t really stick out to me but it is a good sunscreen! Good sunscreen but better options for less money.
