As someone with extremely sensitive and dry skin in the winter and combination skin in the warmer seasons, I have always struggled to find a moisturizer that works. I bought this on a whim after getting a $100 gift card and not knowing what else to buy, I had always boughten drug store moisturizers and finally decided to go for something a little more high end. I immediately fell in LOVE. This moisturizer actually moisturizes and replenishes your skin barrier, not to mention it doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin!!! I also have chronic burning eye syndrome which my optometrist says could be worsened by moisturizers, but when I changed to this one all of my symptoms seemed to disappear. I know the price is a bit high, but it is 100% worth it. 10/10 product, definitely my favourite by far Amazing Product
