It’s a lovely formula, sooo hydrating, itleaves my skin looking so dewy andbeautiful. I appreciate it being a vitaminC formula, so I like to wear it during theday. I don’t know about its brighteningproperties, tho, only time will tell. But ifyou have dry skin like me, you’ll really enjoy this! hydration nation
