I received this complimentary for my honest opinion from influenster. I gave this lip mask 4 stars because it reminded me of a good chapstick.this is an over night mask at it was nice to add it into my nightly routine but I actually used it more as a chapstick during the day then a lip mask at night. It has a light smell bearly noticeable. And it is quite thick and last a long time so I really did like it. However, for the price and the way that I used it… it’s not worth the price. nan
