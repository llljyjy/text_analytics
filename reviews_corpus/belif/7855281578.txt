Right off the bat I noticed the subtle citrus scent when I opened the lid. Not over powering and refreshing for those sensitive. The formula is a mix between a watery lotion and a gel. I felt like it absorbed quickly into my skin but I did notice a slight film feeling left on my skin. I used this underneath my moisturizer instead of my vitamin C serum and didnâ€™t notice too much of a change. Overall I enjoyed this product and would recommend Vitamin C Gel
