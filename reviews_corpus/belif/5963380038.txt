I was excited to try this as I normally get vitamin c in a serum, I have never tried it in a cream before. I really liked the consistency of this cream, and it had a really nice, soft citrus scent. The cream was lightweight and went on smoothly- it is almost gel-like. In my short time using this product so far I havenâ€™t really noticed a brightening effect per say, but it is super moisturizing! nan
