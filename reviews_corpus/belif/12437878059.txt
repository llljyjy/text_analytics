If I could give this 100/10 I would!!!! I am OBSESSED and have found my new daily sunscreen! I love the original product and couldn’t have been more excited when they released a daily moisturizer with spf 50. It’s so light weight, smells like citrus instead of sunscreen, and leaves no white residue. It leaves my skin SO glowy! I use it daily!! My new favorite daily sunscreen!!
