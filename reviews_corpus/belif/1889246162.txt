I have gotten (and devoured) a few Belief samples before and was pumped to try this out... I wanted to love moisturizer, like REALLY wanted to love it considering the reviews, formula and price point.But alas- it’s definitely a product I WOULDN’T try again. Yes, the price point is great for a higher-end moisturizer, but I guess sometimes what you get is what you pay for. I had to slather it on to feel like it didn’t just disintegrate on my skin and STILL didnt feel moisturized. It was simply awful. I have a hard time thinking this would work for anyone with dry, combo or aging skin. I gave it 2 stars for the price, formula and that it may work well for oily skin. It's A No From Me, Dawg
