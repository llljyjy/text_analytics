I liked this better than the Aqua Bomb. It’s not my favorite but it could be the scent. It keeps me moisturized but I find I still like using my regular Olay Moisturizing Cream better and it suits my skin.  I think there are other creams out there that could work for you based off skin type. I did like this one because it was thicker and more hydrating personally to me. I have dry skin so I need something that lasts on my face and doesn’t dry up. nan
