I received this product free from influenster and belifusa in exchange for my personal review. I actually really like this product. I have used vitamin c serums before and they are drying and sticky- overall unsatisfying. This is different. It does feel like it refreshes your skin. I do feel my skin looks more radiant after introducing it into my routine. I usually put mine on every night after a shower.  Def recommend 5/5 stars Love it!
