I see a lot of reviews are saying “you won’t regret buying this.” Unfortunately, I definitely regret buying this. Overhyped, an average moisturizer AT BEST - and that is being more than generous. It’s also fragranced but smells bad. If you’re going to risk irritating someone’s skin, the fragrance better be heavenly. This one wasn’t. It smells like what an apothecary would give you if you asked for some herbal medicine. Also, way way overpriced. Not super great
