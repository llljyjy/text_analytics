I liked this lip mask a lot. It was very smoothing on my lips, and not too sticky. Iâ€™m not really sure what lip masks are really supposed to do except for hydrate your lips, and this one definitely did that. The only thing I would say is that on the smaller sample sized container it was kinda hard to get the product out. nan
