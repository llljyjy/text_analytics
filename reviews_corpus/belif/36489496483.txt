I have been eyeing on getting belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream once I am done with my other moisturizers because I read many great reviews on this. Luckily I received a complimentary sample to try and I l-o-v-e it. My face is usually dry & dull. Upon applying it, I can feel the cooling effect of the creamy gel texture that glides smoothly onto my face with a nice fresh light aroma of citrus scent. I can also feel it absorbing quickly. There is no heaviness and sticky sensation to it. My face feels soft even after wearing it the whole day and/or after wash. This container may seems small but the ingredients in it are very effective in helping to hydrate, soft and brighten the skin. Highly recommended. Cooling effect that glide smoothly
