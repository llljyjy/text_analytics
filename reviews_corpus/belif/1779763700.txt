I received a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I really don’t like the packaging, the opening is so small and with long nails, I can’t really get my fingers in the container. I used a qtip to scoop out product. I found the lip mask to not be super hydrating. When I woke up after putting the product on before bed, it felt like I didn’t even put it on. I’ve tried better overnight lip masks. I’ll use this as a regular lip balm throughout the day. nan
