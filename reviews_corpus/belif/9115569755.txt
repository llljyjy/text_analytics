Really light weight and hydrating. I have oily skin but it’s also very dry in winter so it starts peeling. It’s a hard balance to find a moisturizer that provides enough hydration without adding to the greasyness and making me break out. Surprisingly this really did the trick. It’s light enough that I can get away with using it in the summer humidity too! nan
