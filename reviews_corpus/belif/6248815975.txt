Before using this product I originally used the aqua bomb for couple of months and loved it so much. This has the same smell earthy/herbal scent itâ€™s light and clean. I have oily/combo & acne prone skin but during the winter I am extremely dry and this helped me and my skin relax& stay moisturized for 12 hours. It is a must! Highly recommend. extra moisture bff #2
