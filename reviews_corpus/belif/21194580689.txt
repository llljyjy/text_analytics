I have extremely dry lips, so dry that I put on my O’Keefe lip chap and 2 hours later, they are dry, cracked, and bleeding again. This lip mask is amazing! It’s not too sticky not slippery but it is like water to your lips. I wear it in the day time too and it gives me relief as well as a nice gloss lip! This is a game changer for me I love it!
