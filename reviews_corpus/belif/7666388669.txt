I got a sample of this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This vitamin c cream is a nice, light moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and does not feel sticky afterwards. It works well under makeup, as well! I like the light, citrusy scent it has.. it’s not overwhelming like some vitamin c creams/serums I have tried. For the price, I’m not sure I’d purchase this in the future, but if you’re wanting to incorporate a Vit C without an extra step, this moisturizer is a good option! Nice Moisturizer!
