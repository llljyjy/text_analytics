I really loved this product once I got to try it. The consistency is medium, not to thick not to thin. When applied it has a slight tacky feel but once it absorbs it leaves skin feeling moisturized but not greasy. This price point is decent and it doesnâ€™t have a chemical smell like some or a grey cast like others. Very good sunscreen from a great company. Highly recommend 10/10 for anyone will to pay just a little extra for the better quality. Best Mid Price Sunscreen
