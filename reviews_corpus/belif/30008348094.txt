I received this product for free from Influenster and Belif in exchange for my honest review. So to start this off I feel like they went the wrong direction trying to compare it with their aqua bomb moisturizer. I have used and love their moisturizer. This just isn’t really comparable for me. BUT. That doesn’t make it bad by any means. I’d say it’s pretty standard in the new era of a thousand types of sunscreens. It has a nice smell and it absorbs without leaving a white cast which is nice. It’s definitely one you need to reapply more frequently if you’re sweating or doing water activities. The first time I used it ran into my eyes and burned so definitely wasn’t the best for the pool without at least 20 minutes to let it settle, which makes sense. I also didn’t love how shiny and pronounced it made allll the hair on my face look. Overall I’d say it did its job, but there wasn’t anything spectacular about it and I didn’t feel it was overly moisturizing. Not the bomb, but not bad
