As someone with combo skin, this moisturizer has been fantastic in absorbing and not leaving a heavy finish. Unlike others, I didn’t really have any issue with breakouts. Super watery and lightweight and the texture is similar to the Laneige sleeping mask. Would’ve been nice to see a small spatula of some sort to scoop out some each time for sanitation purposes but otherwise, highly recommend this product. Love the texture and absorption
