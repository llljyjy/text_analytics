Well, it’s not for me, I have a combination skin and when there’s fragrance on the products it usually doesn’t work well. I tried this for days but I didn’t do anything on my skin. I thought it doesn’t absorbed well and kind of oily and also takes time to dry up on face. So i stopped using it. Not for me
