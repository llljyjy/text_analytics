I received this product from Influenster. The moisturizing bomb has a light scent compared to the aqua bomb. It’s silky and smooth. It fires down quickly compared to the aqua bomb and it gets the job done. It’s hydrating. I have dry skin and used it couple times during this winter and my face feels hydrated throughout. Hydrating.
