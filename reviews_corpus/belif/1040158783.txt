Not my fave gel cream moisturizer.  Has an alcohol smell (almost like Barbasol?) and doesn’t feel super gentle going in the skin - like I feel I need to be very careful not to get it near my eyes.  But then also leaves a bit of a sticky feeling after it absorbs.  Had been using the Peter Thomas Roth water drench, which I much prefer but is quite expensive.  Wanted this to be a somewhat more affordable alternative, but I just don’t love it and won’t be buying it again. nan
