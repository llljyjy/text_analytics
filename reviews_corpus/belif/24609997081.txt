I was given the opportunity to try this product for free through Influenster. My first thoughts upon opening was how amazing the citrusy smell was. This moisturizer is light yet very hydrating! You only need to use a small amount so it lasts long. It contains Vitamin C which is so important for the skin. I have very dry dull skin and have difficulties finding a moisturizer that actually keeps my skin hydrated under makeup and this moisturizer did an amazing job at keeping my skin hydrated. Added bonus my skin looks bright and glowy. I highly recommend this moisturizer and will definitely purchase when I run out. Glowy and bright skin
