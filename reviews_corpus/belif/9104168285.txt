I received this product for free from Influenster to test and give an honest review. Between the Moisturizing Bomb and the Aqua Bomb I prefer the Aqua Bomb. I have dry skin so I’m always looking to hydrate. This product maybe gives me hydration for an hour but it dries up quicker than I would like, leaving my feeling dry again. It’s an okay product, but it doesn’t last enough for me and my skin type. Nothing Special
