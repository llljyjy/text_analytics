This sunscreen I felt was really nothing special. First of all it had a very strong lemon citrus smell, which I did not really like. The fragrance also made my skin burn. It blended in nicely and it didn’t give me a white cast so that was nice. Overall if didn’t WOW me, it just seemed like a basic sunscreen. I couldn’t really get past the scent though nan
