I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I don’t remember loving the original aqua bomb, but I do love this. I have oily skin and during the summer I just want a really light moisturizer over my other skincare, but most things are still too heavy. Just a small amount of moisturizer is enough after my essence and serum, but it does feel moisturizing and cooling on my face. It works fine under makeup. I also LOVE the scent. It’s very lightly scented but it smells like lemon pound cake, and it dissipates once you rub it in. I can’t say anything about the vitamin C properties especially since I don’t trust vit C products in pots anyway, but I love this moisturizer enough otherwise that I can see myself purchasing it later. Lightweight moisturizer with light scent
