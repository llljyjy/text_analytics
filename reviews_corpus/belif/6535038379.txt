I tried 3 or 4 different moisturizers after my previous was discontinued, and this has been my holy grail! The texture is a mix between a gel and a cream, and feels hydrating without being oily. I have combo skin and my fianc√©e has dry skin, and we both use it every single day because it works so well for both of us. Really nice subtle citrus-y scent as well. I feel instant hydration with this product. The only moisturizer I swear by
