So far I’m really liking this sunscreen! I have tried sooo many brands and they all clog my pores and make me breakout. This sunscreen feels really light on my skin and isn’t greasy and so far hasn’t made me break out like the other sunscreens I have tried while keeping me from getting sunburnt. The only thing I don’t like about this sunscreen is the smell. It’s a pretty strong natural essential oil type of smell, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star. Non-greasy sunscreen
