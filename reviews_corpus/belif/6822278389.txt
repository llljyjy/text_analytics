This is the worst thing I’ve ever put on my skin… it made me break out terribly.I’ve never been one to have acne.. and after turning 30, I went on a mission to get really great/healthy skin. I started using sunblock every day, using vitamin C, retinol.. all the works. My skin was looking AMAZING.. until I decided to switch moisturizers. This made my skin sticky after applying.. and within 2 weeks of starting to use it - I started getting angry, red, breakouts. Like never ever before.Worst product I’ve ever bought. Save your money. I ADDED BEFORE AND AFTER. Don’t buy!!!!
