I had really high hopes buying this. I’ve seen it highly recommend high derms online. I have VERY difficult lips. They are always dry and get irritated ridiculously easily. This is a great product, just not moisturizing enough for me personally. It feels nice and smells great but it really didn’t live up to the hype for me. Nothing Special
