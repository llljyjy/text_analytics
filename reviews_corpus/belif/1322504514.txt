I can have a lot of excess oil in the summer. I’ve been using this as my every day morning moisturizer in my routine. It’s a perfect gel-cream texture and lovely light and bright citrus fragrance. It absorbs into the skin instantaneously and leaves no greasy resi-doodle-do. My only criticism is that Belief tests on animals (sold in mainland China). I would be a regular customer if this wasn’t the case. nan
