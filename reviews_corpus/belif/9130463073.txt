I don’t know that I’ve ever been so excited to try a moisturizer! This cream is just thick enough that it takes a few minutes to soak in, but not too thick that it leaves your skin feeling greasy. I’m so glad I’ve finally tried this and will be adding it into my nightly routine. I received this product free from Influenster and Belif in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own. Love this- will continue to use it
