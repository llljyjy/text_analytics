This is just not it. I love Belif’s aqua bomb moisturizer, especially in the summer months, so the added SPF should have made this the perfect summertime product. Unfortunately it just isn’t as hydrating as the original moisturizer, and it causes my eyes to sting. Such a bummer - was really hoping this would be a much cheaper alternative to the spf moisturizer I usually use, but it’s not even an equivalent of the original aqua bomb moisturizer. nan
