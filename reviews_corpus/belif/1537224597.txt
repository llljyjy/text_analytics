I use Belif’s Aquabomb as my daily moisturizer and also wear sunscreen every day so I was excited to try this sunscreen out.  I love it, it does everything that I want a sunscreen to do.  It goes on mostly matte, it doesn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores.  It doesn’t sting my eyes or cause my glasses to slip.  I find that it rubs in easy without leaving a whitish cast and I can wear it every day without any problems.  Belief has not let my skin down yet. Perfect so far
