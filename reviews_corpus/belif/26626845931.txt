I used belif Aqua Bomb Overnight Lip Mask for the first time this month and I like what it has done for my lips. It has a very smooth texture and it is colorless. After my face cleansing routine I apply a thin layer of the mask on. My lips were already dry so the mask helped the new skin shed the dry outer layer to help and retain my lips hydration. nan
