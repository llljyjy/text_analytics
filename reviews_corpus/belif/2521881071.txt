I feel a little bad putting a non-stellar review here, but I felt that it was just okay. Donâ€™t get me wrong, this is still a good moisturizer, but it did not quench my dry skin unfortunately. It had a pleasant scent, and I think if someone does not have dry skin, it might be great. Unfortunately it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin, still leaving me dry in the morning after applying at night. nan
