I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this product, my skin loves it. I have a sensitively dry skin. This is super lightweight with a little citrus scent not bad scent bearable. Definitely doesn’t feel sticky on my face at all my skin absorbs it quick. Moisturized my skin the whole day a small amount of the product goes a long way. I’ve been using this for a week now and i can feel and see the results. It does makes my skin glowing as it brightens. Love it! Works amazingly well!
