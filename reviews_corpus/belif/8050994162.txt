I love this product so much! It goes on smooth, almost no white cast immediately, feels nice on the face. It does have fragrance, a nice citrus scent that you can smell for a bit, so if you don’t like fragrance this definitely isn’t for you!!! It’s a very liquid-y sunscreen, which I personally love. It dries quickly to a nice semi matte finish, but it isn’t drying at all! I think this would be great for oily to normal/dry skin. My only issue with it is you have to be careful on where you apply; if you get it too close to your eyes and sweat a lot it will burn. Overall I really like it! I got this product complimentary from Influenster!!! Hurts if you get it too close to your eyes
