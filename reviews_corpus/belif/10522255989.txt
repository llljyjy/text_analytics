I had been looking for a new moisturizer to deal with a dry climate and man did this deliver. It is very lightweight and really does keep your skin moisturized for hours. It’s (very) lightly scented so if you’re looking for something unscented this may not work. As long as the formula remains the same I may never use a different moisturizer again. nan
