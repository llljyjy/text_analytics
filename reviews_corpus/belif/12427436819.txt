This aqua bomb Vitamin C is one of best moisturizer I have ever used.  This is exactly the bomb of moisturizer a little bit can cover all my face and moisturize my skin all day.The great thing I loved about this moisturizer that it not clog my pores. It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.After using this cream for few weeks I saw huge difference on my skin like my skin looks more brighter and softer. I read about it’s ingredients and it is very safe to use and made of great formula.The scent of this cream is my favorite it’s like fresh peels of orange and it really gives me positive energy.Highly recommend if your looking for a great moisturizer to work for your dry skin. best moisturizer
