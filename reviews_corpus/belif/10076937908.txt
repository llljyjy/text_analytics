I really love this moisturizer. I have super dry skin and it gets so dry in the winter. I used this at night for a week and felt a huge difference. It wasn’t flakey or dry at all. As affective as the product was, I’m not a fan of fragrance. I don’t typically use anything with fragrance because I have sensitive skin. This didn’t irritate my skin, but I still am not a fan of scented products as a whole. If you don’t care if your products are scented and you have dry skin, this is for you! Effective- but NOT fragrance free
