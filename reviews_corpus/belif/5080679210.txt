This was my first time trying Belif brand products and I always heard great things about them. I have dry skin and some pigmentation. This brightening cream really keeps my skin moisturized and it feels super lightweight. It includes vitamin C, E and different types of hyaluronic acid which helps make my skin look clearer and glow. While using this cream, I have not had any breakouts. This suits my skin I want to continue using this. It looks promising and I am planning on purchasing another bottle. Hydrating and lightweight!
