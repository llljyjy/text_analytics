I’ve always liked water-based moisturizers because I feel like they’re not too heavy. This is exactly what I was looking for. It’s light enough that I don’t feel like I’m putting too much on, but I’m still hydrating my skin really well. I have combination skin and still feel like I can put it on greasier areas. For people with really dry skin, this might not be enough, though. In my drier areas I will apply a few times a day. nan
