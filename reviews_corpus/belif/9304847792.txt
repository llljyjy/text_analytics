My experience was certainly above average! I want to follow that statement saying I have never had anegative experience while using Belif products,can also tell you that I am not overly obsessed.The overnight lip mask was definitely one of myfavorite products and I actually did buy one afterI received my free sample. These two creams Iwould not go out and buy. Although I can saythat the body lotion moisturizer is great to bringto work and leave in your desk drawer because itdoes not have a strong scent and it is certainlynot oily. I find that the Chanel hand cream has abit more of an oily finish to it. I work retail so it isimportant that I do not touch the merchandisewith any residue on my hands and I canconfidently tell you that this does not leave anymarks!
