I really enjoyed the gel texture because I donâ€™t like heavy moisturizers that sit on my skin for too long, this product absorbs really well but I feel the like the original one absorbs even better, just a little observation. It felt a tiny bit sticky at first but then it was fine, it did brighten my face in just one use which was impressive! I put it on at night and woke up to a bright fresh face and some of my redness was reduced. I can only imagine what it will do with continued use! Nice gel moisturizer
