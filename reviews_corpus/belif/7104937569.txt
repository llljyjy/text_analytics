The texture of this sunscreen reminds me of their Moisturizing Bomb. It does everything it says; a hydrating finish with NO white cast. The ONLY issue I had was that it made my eyes water. I ended up having to remove some of it around my eye area. If it didnâ€™t have that issue, it would have been 100% perfect Hydrating but made eyes water
