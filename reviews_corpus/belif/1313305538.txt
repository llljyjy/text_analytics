It does a good amount of makeup on my face but not clean enough. I still need to use other cleanser to remove the remaining makeup (and I don’t put on a full face of makeup as well). But what I don’t like is it leaves a thin layer of “wax” on my face afterwards. I have to scape it off or use another cleanser to get it off. Too much work, I expect just using this balm to clean everything off. Not going to repurchase. nan
