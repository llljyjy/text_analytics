Nothing to rave about…. A creamy gel moisturizer that provides pretty good moisture but nothing else special. I gave it 3 stars for moisture that lasts several hours, but that is all it does. It didn’t affect darkened circles or do anything for small or large wrinkle lines. There are better products out there. Needs a different inside plastic protective cover. The inside cover is a real pain to get off. It has a little tab you use to remove it but it doesn’t come off easily….All in all it’s just ok, nothing special. it’s just ok…,
