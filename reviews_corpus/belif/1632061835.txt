This is an AWESOME summer moisturizer because it’s really hydrating but doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. It banishes dry skin super quickly, but without any breakouts or feeling oily. It absorbs fast and kind of feels like it plumps up your skin. I also have extremely sensitive skin, and found while the vitamin C causes a very mild brief temporary tingle, it doesn’t burn, sting, or cause irritation in the slightest. I don’t know if it “brightened” my skin exactly, but it seemed to even it out and get rid of dullness nicely. Nice and light!
