This is the absolute best face moisturizer I have used! I love the fact that it’s not greasy, it doesn’t leave my skin looking like it has a thick layer of moisturizer. It absorbs flawlessly. I have oily skin and I have always struggled trying to find a moisturizer that doesn’t add to my oiliness but does keep me hydrated. Especially through the winter months living in Oregon this has been a game changer for my skin. Will be a staple in my skin care moving forward ! BEST FACE MOISTURIZER EVER !
