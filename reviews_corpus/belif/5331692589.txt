I got this Belief lip mask from Influenster complementary for review purposes. I really liked this! I think itâ€™s pretty comparable to my previous staple the Laneige lip mask but is not scented so it would be great for someone sensitive to smells. It really helps with the dry lips I get in the winter. nan
