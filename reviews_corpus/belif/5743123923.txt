The product itself is amazing. Lightweight but somehow incredibly rich texture at the same time. My skin feels so moisturized after using this!  It has a really light and natural fragrance that is really pleasant. It doesn’t irritate my reactive skin and it really moisturizes for a long time. I feel like my skin has improved since using it!  I wish they would change the packaging though, I don’t like dipping my finger in the pot. nan
