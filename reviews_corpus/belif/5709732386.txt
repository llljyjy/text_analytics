This product is amazing, I honestly feel like you can’t go wrong with any Belif product. I’ve tried other balms, Farmacy being the closest thing to this one. I liked Farmacy, but it didn’t melt the tough make up as easily and it gave me more issues with making things look fuzzy for a while. I think the formulation is different, this melts like butter. I’ve used it like a double cleanse also, it’s great for both! nan
