I received this product complimentary from Influenster to provide an honest review. I think this cream smells amazing! It has an energizing citrus scent which I love. It is a nice thick moisturizing cream. I prefer to use it before bed as a great moisturizer, but I could definitely see people use it in the morning with that great smell. I definitely recommend this product. Smells Great!
