I applied a generous amount each time but it just didn’t have the hydrating effect for me. It has a watery texture which I hoped meant it would moisturize nicely but it quickly fades. I will say applying it right before makeup smoothed my foundation nicely but I didn’t trust the moisture to last. Aqua means water and it sure felt watery.
