I have been testing out this cream for about a week now and have been LOVING it! I’ve been using it as my nighttime moisturizer because it is a bit to heavy for my skin during the day. It is very thick but still sinks into my skin leaving it soft and hydrated during the night. This product is scented so if you’re sensitive to that, this may not workout for you. After leaving this on overnight I wake up and my skin feels soft and hydrated! If you have very oily skin this may not work because of how thick it is, but it does work on my combination skin just fine. Belif Moisturizing Bomb
