My biggest pet peeve is usually sunscreen that feels heavy and has a white caste left behind. This sunscreen didnâ€™t do any of that. I have combination skin and this sunscreen stayed on even with the little dab I put on.  The best part is that it also had a nice citress smell unlike sunscreens that smell like chemicals. It is a must try! nan
