I really love the texture. The “cream” is yellow and has a light gel consistency. A little goes a long way. It absorbs nicely and isn’t tacky once it’s absorbed. It seemed to break me out a little. At least, i think it did, because I broke out soon after I started using it.  It also made me a little oily later. It does smell good though. It smells like citrus . Smells good
