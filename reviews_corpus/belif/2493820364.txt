I was sent this product for my honest review. I do love the hydration from this product . My skin feels hydrated and dewy. I’ve been wearing this for over a week  now I don’t notice brightness to my skin yet. But I do love the freshness it leave my skin. Not overly oily or greasy. A little goes a long way Ok
