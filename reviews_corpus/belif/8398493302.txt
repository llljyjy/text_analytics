I think that belief makes products with good formulations; however, they use too much fragrance. This smells so strongly of citrus that I wasn’t willing to use it on my face, so I used it on my legs instead. I received this product free to review, but I would have returned it had I purchased it myself. Wish it wasn’t so heavily scented
