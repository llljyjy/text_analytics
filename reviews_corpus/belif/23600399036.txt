This product isn’t terrible but isn’t my absolute fave either. It’s a pretty thick balm that definitely coats the lips but I think that it’s lacking moisturizing properties because it doesn’t leave my lips super hydrated feeling. I tend to drink a lot of water through the night and it stays on okay but I feel like I get the same results, if not better results from a basic chapstick. I have used this product during the day and though it’s a bit sticky it leaves your lips looking great. Just Not Sold
