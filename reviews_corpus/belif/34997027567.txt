Intense amount of hydration. Get supple, plump, full of life skin with this moisturizer. This one is thicker than the aqua bomb, so be aware of that. I would use this one at night or if you are super dry during the day. Great for dry, cold climates. I can still work makeup onto this, but I would only do that in winter. Itâ€™s incredibly hydrating and makes my skin so plump. Highly recommend. Super hydrating
