I LOVE BELIF PRODUCTS AND THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! This cream is a lightweight cream with added vitamins C and E. It also has four types of hyaluronic acid! It brightened my skin and left it glowing. I am always looking for a good summer cream and this was great to add into my skin care routine. I have combination skin and this gel cream took away the dullness and left my skin looking refreshed after days in the sun or just a long day. My favorite part and why itâ€™s good for summer is because it is super cooling and refreshing!! Light and refreshing gel
