I love this product - I got the Charlotte Tilbury serum in a voxbox and was having such issues with pilling, but once I got this all of my issues were gone! I use this as an in between the serum and a heavier moisturizer but I also feel like my skin is just brighter and glowier with it in my routine! I’m disappointed the jar was sample size because I can’t not have it in my routine!! Love it!!
