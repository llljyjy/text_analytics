Ok, vitamin c can be hit or miss for me. Also, I either LOVE belif products or have a reaction. This has been a complete winner! Hydrated really well, great texture. Not too heavy or too light. Sinks in well and doesn’t leave a residue on the skin. No reaction and brightens the look of my skin. I use it in the am because I’ve heard spf and vitamin c work well together. I always use it on my neck and chest as well. nan
