I really liked this cream more than I thought I wouldsince Iâ€™ve not liked other products by Belif prior totrying this. Amazing texture/consistency to it witha lighter feel. No pilling when applying. Smellsgreat and kept my face moisturized all day. I likeusing skin brightening products occasionally toeven out my skin tone and I felt like this oneworked well for me. I will be purchasing this again. Love It!
