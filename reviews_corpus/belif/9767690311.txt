Honestly a good moisturizer just doesn’t work with my combination skin. It’s a little too heavy for me but better suited for normal to dry skin. I gave my mom my sample and it works perfectly for her especially during the winter months when she gets extra dry on her cheeks. She also has sensitive skin which isn’t irritated by this. If you fit that criteria definitely give this a try. Perfect for normal to dry skin
