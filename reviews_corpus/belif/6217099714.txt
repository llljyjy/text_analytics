I was asked to try the belief aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream for free in exchange for my review!! Unfortunately due to some of my skin sensitivities and allergies, I could not personally try this product. I offered it to a friend to review for me. Here’s what she says:“I’ve used the product a handful of times. After the times I’ve used it, I did notice it brightens my skin and leaves it feeling super smooth and fresh!  I would give it 4.8 out if 5 stars. It’s a very good product.”Even though I couldn’t test this product myself, I am looking forwarding to buying the original aqua bomb for myself. #complimentary #headtotoeaqua @Influenster @belifusa nan
