This is an intersting product. I like the wand, but you definitely need some moisturizer on before this. Iâ€™ve used it with a few different creams, and it seems to cake up with caffeine-based creams (thus the 4 stars). I like the product, but am not sure I would buy it again at this price point. Still figuring out if it's worth it
