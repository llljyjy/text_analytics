I LOVE this product so much. The metal tip is probably my favorite part. The simplicity of pumping the product out and smoothly applying it under my eyes without having to use my hands was nice and felt sanitary. However the metal tip made the application feel cool (temperature wise) to the touch which felt AMAZING on my tired, puppy morning eyes. I seldom remembered to apply this in the evening except if I was going out and then again the application was reduce the the bags under my tired eyes. I felt like this product worked wonders. I absolutely love it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
