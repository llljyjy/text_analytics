Reading some of the reviews here compelled me to write this review as some people just can’t read the name of the item that clearly says “attachment head”. The tool and this particular attachment are game changers. They change the texture, elasticity and overall skin appearance. I use it more or less once a day followed by a body cream (ideally anti-cellulite or anti-aging) because this is one of the purposes of this tool - increase the absorption of your skin care. It hurts to do it the first couple of times as it is needles prickling your skin and it itches, which is a natural result of skin healing and producing collagen which is the whole point. It really really is amazing. This is my third body attachment and I’ve purchased a second body for it. I can’t tell you how much of a difference it makes. it is absolutely worth it!
