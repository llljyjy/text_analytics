I’ve been using the quench for about 4 months now and I am still not 100% sold. For the price I expected a lot more out of this moisturizer but it seems to do the “job” for about 30 minutes and it dries up completely. My face would not stay hydrated and it would start looking very dry. I didn’t see any effect toward anti aging like I was promised by the sales girls who pushed me to purchased this product. Overall- I would not recommend to anyone who has oily to dry skin. Not the best for oily-dry skin
