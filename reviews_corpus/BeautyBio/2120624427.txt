Really enjoying this product! The packaging makes it super convenient to use and the metal tip feels so nice and cool against my eyes, specially when I’m feeling extra puffy after a long night. The formula itself is lightweight and a little goes a long way. I’m not usually one to use eye cream but I have seen an improvement in the darkness of my undereye as well as fine lines so I’ve officially been converted! The packaging makes it easy to travel with and the pump style makes it fun to use. Converted Eye Cream User
