As a BB loyalist, I was so excited to get my hands on this tool! It’s sleek, fun, and brings the facial to your home. I have seen such incredible results from other folks, but either my pores are not clogged (I wish!) or I need another round of videos to demo how this tool is supposed to be used because I’m not getting any of the gunk goodness in the chamber at the end, and I would love that satisfaction! In any case, I love BB’s approach at bringing quality skincare to our daily routines and will continue to work on this for results! One thing to be careful of- the cap on the serum! I’ve accidentally unscrewed it completely twice instead of the dropper part, leaving a ton of the solution on my counter. BB Loyalist - Need some hydro practice
