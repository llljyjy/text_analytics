Best plumping treatment I’ve used yet. I have very finicky lips that are thin skinned and sensitive. I bought it with the micro needler as I’m always on the hunt for the perfect lip treatment. This never disappoints. It IS a bit tacky but I let it soak in for a bit and wipe off any excess before applying any other lip product. It tastes really good too. Just sweet. No real flavour… Great applicator and generous size. Best Plumping Treatment Ever!
