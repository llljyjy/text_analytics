The lady in the store showed me her before an aftwr of using this product so I caved and bought it. In my opinion not worth the 65$ at all! It did not improve my skin in any way and I felt I was needing to use more than normal because it did not feel hydrating. Also not to mention the very little amount of product it has, the packaging is very deceiving. Not worth the money at all not worth it
