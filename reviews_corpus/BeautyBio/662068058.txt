I purchased this product in an attempt to find a moisturizer that helped with oil control. I currently have a drugstore oil control moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling “tight“. This moisturizer feels so silky on my skin, absorbs rather quickly, and yet doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. I have oily, sensitive, aging skin - yet I haven’t had an allergic reaction and this moisturizer has helped with oil control. I purchased it during a 50% off day, or I probably would never have tried it. I didn't want to like this
