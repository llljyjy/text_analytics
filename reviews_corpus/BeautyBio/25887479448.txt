This was recommended to me at the store when I told the salesperson that I was looking for a night time moisturizer and unfortunately, this wasn’t as hydrating as I hoped it would be. My biggest issue was the container. Less than a week after buying it, I was already struggling to get product out and I didn’t like that I couldn’t see how much product I had left. Ended up returning this. Bad packaging
