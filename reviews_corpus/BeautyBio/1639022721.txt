I think it’s a fairly expensive tool and I usually don’t buy things like that. But I also suffer from allergies, I have rosacea and like everyone I have occasion morning swelling around eyes. I turn red easily, especially when working out or being in the sun. This roller is a life changer. I keep it in the fridge and use it whenever I need it. It’s amazing. It’s really worth it, especially that it’s not a cream or serum that will run out. It feels amazing on the skin, gives instant relief. I didn’t try it yet with skincare products but I’m sure it will work great. My skin is less red, tighter and feels cooler. I LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin and you fight redness on a daily basis. Amazing
