This product with tool/applicator is wonderful! I have used it twice a day, almost everyday for 2 weeks and could immediately see a reduction in puffiness and dark circles. I love that the Eyelighter Concentrate has all the ingredients I typically use but like the name of the product says concentrated - hyaluronic acid, retinol, vitamin C, and vegan squalane. Between the coolness of the depuffing tool and overall hydrating feeling after use, it is a great way to start and end the day. Soothing and Effective!
