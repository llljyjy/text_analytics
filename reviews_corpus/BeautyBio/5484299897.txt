Recently purchased this product after receiving a sample, and I can’t recommend it enough. I’ve used a whole range of different moisturizers (for dry skin), across a range of prices, and this one takes the number one spot! I also suffer from rosacea, so i love the combo of barrier repair, skin-soothing ingredients, and anti-aging treatment within this cream. Best part, it doesn’t feel too heavy on my skin, and this helps to keep my rosacea at bay. I would swap my higher-end moisturizer for this too. New HG Moisturizer!
