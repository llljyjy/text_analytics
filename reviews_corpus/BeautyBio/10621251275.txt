The first 2 times I used it I thought it was great. Kind of a bummer that the little bottle of concentrate is $40 to replace but I felt like it actually worked so I was a fan. I was so excited to use it the 3rd day and there is no suction. I just threw the box away. Can I get a replacement without the box? As soon you throw the box away, it stops working.
