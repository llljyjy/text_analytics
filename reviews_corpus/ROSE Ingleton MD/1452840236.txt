I had never heard of this brand until I browsed Sephora and purchased this cleanser based on the reviews.  From first use I was hooked!!  I have normal/combination skin and was looking for something different and that was in the clean beauty category.  I love that this is fragrance free, does not dry my skin out or make it oily.  My skin looks fresh and evenly balanced.  I am sold and plan to try other products from this line.  Try this and you wonâ€™t regret it! My New Favorite Cleanser!
