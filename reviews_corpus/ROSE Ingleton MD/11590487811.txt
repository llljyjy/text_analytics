Received this as a gift and it is very gentle on my skin! I struggle with dryness and finding a cleanser that didnâ€™t dry my face out before the rest of my routine was not an easy task. No irritation or flaking after first few uses and I felt a lot more glowy than usual. I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 only because I still need to use a separate cleanser beforehand on days I wear full makeup. nan
