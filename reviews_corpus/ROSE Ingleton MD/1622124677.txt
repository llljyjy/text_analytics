As a mom of seven, I rarely spend time (or money) on my skincare routine. Now that I’m in my 40s, I decided it’s time that I buy a moisturizer and take better care of my skin. I rarely find a moisturizer that I love. This moisturizer, however, has changed me! I love the texture and the consistency. I find myself eager to wash my face and apply the moisturizer daily. I also noticed a difference in my skin after just a day or two. My skin just felt so much more hydrated. It also just felt soft. I would recommend this to everyone. Beware, though, once you try it, I doubt you’ll ever want to use anything else on your skin! The absolute BEST moisturizer!!
