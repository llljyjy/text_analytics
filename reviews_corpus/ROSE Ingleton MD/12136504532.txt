Read all the reviews and took the chance on this serum. Worth the purchase! I’ve been managing acne and rosacea for years and using this serum calms my red patches and fades the redness from acne scars. I used to think the only time I would have clear skin would be taking medication, but this serum provides that relief. I’ve already purchased twice and use only a few drops per night. 5 stars Would recommend calms rosacea and acne redness
