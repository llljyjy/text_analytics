Received from Rose singleton MD to try and review. Follow directions for use, give your skin about 2-4 weeks to adjust. It will transform your skin! My skin is more even, radiant, pores smaller. Skin even hold moisture better.  Using barely any makeup this summer. It is incredible. My skin did get irritated at first using every other day, moved to every two days until skin adjusted. Now I use daily, in the morning. Followed by hydrating or brightening serum. Able to use retinol at night again after 4 weeks. Made for those looking to infest in the long-term health of your skin. Be patient. Itâ€™s worth it!
