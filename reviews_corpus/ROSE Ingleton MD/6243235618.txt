I’ve struggled with dullness and hyperpigmentation over the last few years, and most cleaners I’ve tried seemed to work temporarily. Dr. Ingelton’s superfruit brightening cleaner is the holy grail. I instantly noticed the difference in the texture of my skin after the first use. If you are looking to brighten up and tackle those dark spots without sacrificing moisture, get this cleanser. I use the cleanser in the morning and night, and my face never feels dry. I highly recommend following up with the moisturizer to seal the moisture. nan
