I’m only giving 4 stars because it’s a little bit too greasy for me but a tiny amount sure goes a long ways! I’ve started to use less to see if that helps any. I did get a little bit of bumps at first small acne but it cleared itself up for the most part already. It didn’t say around. I like that with this, it’s not stripping of the skin so it is great for people with sensitive skin. Overall great product and I hope as I use it more I’ll see good results cause I will repurchase again. nan
