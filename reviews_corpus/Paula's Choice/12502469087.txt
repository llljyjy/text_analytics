My hands down GO TO exfoliating toner. When I finished my last bottle I decided I wanted to try something different and boy do I regret it. Nothing works for me like this. This gives my skin a nice glow and keeps me clear of blackheads+whiteheads. I use this before my hydrating toner and I feel like it really adds some extra hydration to my skin that I need. GREAT PRODUCT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
