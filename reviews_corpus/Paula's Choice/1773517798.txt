I was gifted the serum and I’m so glad! I love Paula Choice and Niacinamide is one of my favorite ingredients. I’ve been experimenting and adding the booster to both my creams & serums I’ve also used on its own. So far it’s mixed well with any other product I’ve used with the booster. I’ve also seen improvements with my skin as my skin. I’d definitely recommend the booster to help any of your existing favs or to use in its own. MixOlogist!!
