I love this brand! I love how they make amazing products with key ingredients and retail them at an affordable price - so thank you Paula’s Choice! My skin has totally changed postpartum and I’m trying to get the tone to even out again and minimize some dark spots. I am loving this product so far. The formula is amazing. It’s lightweight, gel bait and I’m easily able to apply for mixing it into my moisturizer daily. Totally recommend. Loving the formula!
