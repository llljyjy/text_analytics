I was hesitant at first to try this for two reasons. 1st reason being 9 percent sounds like it’s too high of an amount and may be irritating and the 2nd is the price point lol. However, after seeing how much Felicia from Beauty Within (who also has oily acne prone skin like myself) talked about how good this was on a few different occasions and with a $10 coupon from my Sephora credit card I decided to finely give it try… glad it did! This stuff is very gentle nothing like imagined I’m guessing because of the formulation. Use it the night before for one or two nights and that pimple will be gone! You only need a little, be mindful if you put on too much it run down your face because it’s like a thin liquid it doesn’t dry down hard. ..now I just have to wait and see how long the tube will last. The price point is kind of high but I definitely will be repurchasing. This stuff is GoOd!!
