A few weeks ago my dermatologist recommended that I include vitamin c in my routine and I think moisturizers are a great way to test out a new ingredient as the formula tends to be less harsh. I enjoyed using this moisturizer, it felt nice on the skin, not too heavy or greasy and immediately absorbed into the skin. It didn’t have a strong fragrance which I liked. It absorbed but kept my skin feeling hydrated but not sticky. I have seen some improvement in my skin’s brightness and I do plan to continue using the product to help my dark spots. nan
