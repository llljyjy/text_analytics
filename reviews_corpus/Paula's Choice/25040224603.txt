THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL NOW! After KraveBeauty discontinued their ’Beet the Shield’ SPF due to Koreas labs producing faulty results that didn’t match the product SPF claims. I needed to go back on the market hunt to find another hydrating and 50+ sunscreen that worked wonders for my skin, and something that worked perfectly like a primer under my CC Cream (makeup). THIS SUNSCREEN WAS THE ANSWER! This product was a recommendation from the Youtube Channel ’Beauty Within’ and I am so glad that I tried it because it sinks so perfectly into my skin and gives my skin a natural glow without making it look oily (picture to prove it). What I love the most is that it helps keep my redness at bay, usually my normal skin will have me looking like a cherry tomato —but not this. Thank you so much Paulas Choice for having such amazing products. My skin type is: Combo(Oily), Acne Prone, and Sensitive. I also suffer from P.I.E hyperpigmentation so this sunscreen has helped in preventing anymore of my dark spots from getting darker, maybe even lightening my dark spots (but that’s because of the combination of my current Vitamin C and this sunscreen. they are the perfect match since Vitamin C enhances the benefits of sunscreen). I love this sunscreen overall. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone! there is no white cast because of its thin consistency so your skin absorbs it so quickly - LIKE MAGIC. If you do not believe, go into a Sephora and try it out for yourself - I promise it will not disappointment and you will thank me later ;) SPF HYDRATION PERFECTION
