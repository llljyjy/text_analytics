The 1% retinol was too much for my skin. It gave me a glow but my skin would peel and burn even just using it twice a week. But this stuff is perfect. I can use it every day with no irritation and I get that great glow from it. They say with retinol itâ€™s consistency over potency. Excellent if 1% is too much for your skin
