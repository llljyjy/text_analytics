I really like how this cleansing balm melts away my make-up. It also gave me a deeper clean after I let it soak in my skin for one minute. This cleanser helps with product buildup and makes my skin cleaner. My skin was super dry, and this product made it feel really smooth and soft since using it. I massaged it in my skin and used a warm cloth to remove it. Now my skin is so hydrated. Love it! I love all of Paulaâ€™s Choice products and I tell everyone when they ask me about my skin care routine. They always say I have a nice glow for my age. I love it!
