This toner has been amazing. I have oily skin and it does a good job at removing all of my excess oil without making my skin feel dry. After a week of using, my skin feels a lot softer and more hydrated. A little goes a long way with this toner, and it clears up breakouts pretty quickly Iâ€™m impressed. Perfect for oily skin!
