I’ve only been using this for a week. For the last few months I’ve had a consistent, horrible hormonal breakout on my jaw line & neck. In one week, it’s been cleared with only one big problematic blemish left & shrinking. So far I am in love! The product doesn’t feel harsh but I have noticed a little dryness if I don’t moisturize. A savior for my stress induced breakouts
