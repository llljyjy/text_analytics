I have been testing this out for a week so far and have been enjoying it. I love the pump dispenser! I havenâ€™t experienced any eye irritation or any dryness in the under eye area. I did notice the eye area is much more hydrated and the fine lines are appearing less prominently. There is a light citrus decent  that I enjoy  and it absorbs beautifully into the skin. Very promising!
