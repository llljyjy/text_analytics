I’ve had this product for a while and I always rely on it to clear up small acne patches but I recently went on vacation and could not bring this product because it was too big. My acne absolutely flared up. Worse than I’ve had in many many years. As soon as I got home I used this and it was amazing how quickly it worked. I’ve used this product for so long I’ve forgotten how amazing it was until it helped me that much. Thought I needed to share this!! Life saver
