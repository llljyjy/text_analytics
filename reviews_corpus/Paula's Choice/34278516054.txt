I am loving this toner! It is very hydrating and does an amazing job at removing excess makeup after I wash my face. I have oily skin and this toner helps manage my oil without striping my face dry. It’s very soothing on the skin and after using it for a week I’m already noticing a difference in the texture of my skin it’s a lot softer! A must have toner for my oily skin!
