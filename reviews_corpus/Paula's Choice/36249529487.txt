I wanted to love this but every time I use this I see no difference whatsoever. I feel like it doesnâ€™t take anything out of my pores and it is very overhyped. Glow recipe strawberry serum worked wonderfully to get stuff out of my pores and help with texture and I would use that any day over this. nan
