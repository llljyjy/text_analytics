I was gifted this by Paula’s Choice in exchange for review. I honestly don’t think I have been using this product long enough for it to have made a difference in my under eye brightness.  I do know I like the eye cream. It’s hydrating and plumping, which helps to make me look more awake. It sits well under make up and does not run in my eyes. I will continue using it and look forward to seeing long term results. nan
