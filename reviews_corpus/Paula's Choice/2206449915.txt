I received this product from Paula’s Choice in exchange for a review; these are my honest opinions.PROS:- I love the texture of this -- it’s a lightweight cream that spreads beautifully across the skin and manages to suit my oily skin for both morning & evening- the formula layers well with other products too -- no pilling to be found- it leaves a nice satin finish behind that isn’t matte but isn’t shiny either- I love knowing that this has the added benefit of a vitamin C derivative in it, so it’s a great two-in-one product- love the airless pump packaging, as it means I don’t have to worry about getting every last bit of product outCONS:- I wish this had a higher concentration of vitamin C in it to boost its efficacy, but I like that it hasn’t irritated my skin and feels gentle enough to layer an additional vitamin C serum underneath- at $45 for 50mL, this is definitely not cheap; however, if you are looking to streamline your vitamin C & moisturizer into one step, it may be worthwhile great 2-in-1 step!
