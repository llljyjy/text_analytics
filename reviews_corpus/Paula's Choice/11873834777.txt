I tired this product because of the hype around it. I normally used the Youth to the People Yerba mate mask which essentially has the same process as this product. The goal is to remove dead skin and give you a more clear flawless complexion the next day along with lightening dark spots. I have very acne prone sensitive skin and found that this product irritated my skin. I really wanted to like it but my skin was red and oily looking after. The next day I also did not notice much of a difference. I used it every couple days for two weeks to give it a solid chance and woke up with weird red dots (not acne or hives-not sure what they were) the dots were mostly under my eyes so maybe avoid sensitive skin areas. I’m sure this works for others but if you have sensitive skin beware! Giving it 3 because I know this works for others and is a great brand even though it didn’t work for me. nan
