Paula’s Choice C5 Super Boost Moisturizer lasts all day and is ideal for Florida sun. It’s lightweight and doesn’t make my skin shine or look greasy/melt. It feels like a gel and I usually follow with an spf. That truly would’ve made this the perfect moisturizer but it’s other benefits help me overlook that. Great moisturizer
