Got the mini size to try it out and will definitely be purchasing the full size! I have combo skin which is more dry in the winter, with breakouts and bumps around my chin and nose. After the first couple uses, my skin was tight and dry, peeled a bit, and slightly red (like I had just used an at-home chemical peel mask) and was worried it would be too harsh, but after 2-3 days my skin adjusted and now I use it once at night. It has gotten rid of the texture and breakouts. It has also faded away two fine lines I had on my forehead I was considering baby botox for but not anymore! Love this stuff and highly recommend! nan
