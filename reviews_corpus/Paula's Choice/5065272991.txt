“I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review“As a 30 something year old woman, I’m embarrassed to say that I wasn’t quite sure what enlarged pores were, so I was curious to try this product  that everyone raves so much about. I introduced it into my routine as instructed and reduced its usage on my 3rd week trying it.  I have been battling extreme hyper pigmentation after having my toddler 3 years ago and since it’s not completely gone,  I honestly hadn’t noticed a difference until my husband just kept going on and on about how good my skin had been looking and kept asking me what I had been using. Also, my makeup application was looking much smoother. I’ve been receiving compliments from friends as well. So I can only  attribute it to this product since this has been the only knew thing I’ve introduced. Based on all of the compliments I’ve been receiving, I highly recommend this product. nan
