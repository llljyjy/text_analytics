This brand doesn’t do me wrong with any of the products I have tried, including this serum. The niacinamide booster works really well with my oily acne prone skin. In the week that I have used this product I’ve noticed that my pores aren’t as noticeable, my skin tone has evened out, and I have not experienced any irritation while using this product. nan
