After using this product for 2 weeks my skin feels softer, smoother, and firmer. I have sensitive skin and had to ease into using this product. Using it every other day has yield the best results for me. My pores appear to be smaller around my nose. I haven’t noticed any changes in the redness of my skin at this point. The product has an interesting scent but it isn’t bad by any means. I enjoy using the product! So far so good
