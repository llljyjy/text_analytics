I’d been researching for awhile and heard AMAZING things so I finally pulled the trigger during the sephora sale.  I’ve noticed a big improvement in the overall texture of my skin and my dark spots are def lighter.  In conjunction with cream based cleanser, HLA, retinol, grow recipe Niacinamide and Kiehs moisturizer I’m like a glowing goddess without the oil! I’m an oily skin type, but want to battle all things antiaging without feeling like I’m wearing a blanket of grease on my face... This product helps me do just that! I use once a day at bedtime and have recommended my dry skin type friends use twice a week to start as it may dry you out at first (just like a retinol). Now a forever holy grail in my regime!
