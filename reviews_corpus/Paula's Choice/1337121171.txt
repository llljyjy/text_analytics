This is a very potent treatment and works excellent on me. I am in my late 40â€™s and have tried many Retinol products and can say this is the real deal. The consistency is thick and applies very easily, it has very nice scent and absorbs very quickly.  It helps with fine lines and the overall texture of my skin. If you are new to Retinol follow the directions and build up the usage.  Consistency is also key to get results, I use it every night with exclusion of peel/exfoliation night  and seeing great results. And always wear a good SPF with any retinol product. Very Effective
