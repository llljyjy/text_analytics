I have been working with an esthetician before my wedding and battling a bumpy jawline (non-inflamed acne) so I have been trying to stay away from anything she doesn’t directly give me, but then I heard Hailey Bieber talk about how this product actually “changed her skin“ and was the impetus behind creating her line, so I was shamelessly influenced. I know this isn’t an exfoliant so I had doubts about it helping with the bumps but I wanted to try an alternative to vitamin C for dark spots because I usually get irritated. THIS PRODUCT! The texture was a little weird at first but I got used to it when I saw the results. My skin is so much brighter, more supple, and smooth! I don’t know how it does it but I will always have this in my arsenal! Actually does what it claims!
