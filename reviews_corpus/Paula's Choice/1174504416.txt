I am a huge Paula’s Choice fan in general, but this product deserves its icon status. I have rosacea and slightly acne-prone skin (it has chilled out a lot as I’ve gotten older), and this really brings things to the surface and evens out your skin tone. Now when I get a zit this brings it to a head much more quickly, and after a zit patch it’s gone within a day or two rather than a week or two. In conjunction with their Vitamin C, Azelaic Acid, and Niacinamide 20%, as well as an intense hydration routine, my skin has really never been in better shape. If you’re looking for a staple and a place to start with your skincare routine, this + a nice gentle cleanser + a solid moisturizer (and SPF in the AM) can’t steer you wrong. Worth the Icon Status
