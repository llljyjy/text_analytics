I really really like this sunscreen. It’s one of the first ones I’ve tried that doesn’t feel like it needs a whole beauty blender to apply because it goes on easy and doesn’t leave a white cast for me. Additionally it doesn’t feel greasy or leave a residue like many others might. Highly recommend even though it is pretty pricy. Easy to Use
