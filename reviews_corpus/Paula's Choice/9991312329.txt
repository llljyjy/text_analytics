I was skeptical on using thisProduct; as I am with all. I have oily skin, and can never find a good spf that mattifies after use. This is going to be my new holy grail. Thereâ€™s no white cast, and it has a nice finish for no makeup days, or just under your makeup for a complete finish. Game changer!
