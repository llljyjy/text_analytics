I’ve used this product for about 3 months and I use it as my night time cleanser. I still have some breakouts, but they’re less frequent than they use to be. This product hasn’t irritated my skin or caused any purging (I have dry skin and this has been fine for me). There’s some really nice ingredients in this and it’s a really affordable price, especially for this brand. I recommend trying it out if you have acne prone skin! good ingredients at a great price
