I really liked how gentle this product was on my skin. I am somewhat of a retinol rookie but I have used it here and there, and I’ve always struggled with irritation off the bat. This didn’t irritate me (so glad!) and it felt really smooth and hydrating on my skin. I don’t feel like I’ve noticed a big difference in fine lines in 2 weeks but I am also not using it daily because I needed to gently introduce the product to reduce that irritation risk. Overall, I do like it, and I really love that it was formulated with other ingredients from my routine (vitamin c, peptides) so I can skip those steps! Really liking this so far!
