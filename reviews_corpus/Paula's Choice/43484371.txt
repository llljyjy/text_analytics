I was about to buy the Supergoop every single face when I turned it over and saw that one of the main ingredients is alcohol. I knew that would wreak havoc on my moisture barrier so I kept looking and found this Paula’s Choice with a similar watery texture. Have to say I absolutely love it, it smooths on so nicely, absorbs quickly and does not leave my face shiny or like I’m wearing sunscreen. I can’t speak to how it does under makeup because I usually don’t wear any, but this is a great everyday sunscreen that’s so pleasant to use and wear that I actually do use it every day. nan
