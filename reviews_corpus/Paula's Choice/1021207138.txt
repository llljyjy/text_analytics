I have combo skin, and I finally found a sunscreen that doesn’t make me oily! The tint is light in color but blends away into my NC20 skin tone. I wouldn’t say it gives any coverage but it somehow evens out my skin and reduces redness. Similar to Supergoop’s matte sunscreen but this is sooo much better. It’s thick but feels weightless on the skin. I could always feel sypergoops on my face. This also dries to a semi matte finish. Doesn’t really transfer to clothes, just a tiny bit. nan
