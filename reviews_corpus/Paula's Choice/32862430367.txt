I received this product from Paula’s Choice for review.The texture if this moisturizer is so soft, it practically sinks into the skin. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue and make the skin glow afterwards.  My skin looked healthy and felt touch soft. My skin looked so much healthy and firm after the two weeks I’ve been using it. It wasn’t dull anymore, but looked hydrated and clean. I love it so much! Firm supple skin
