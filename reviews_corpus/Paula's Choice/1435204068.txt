I have some rosacea in my cheeks and acne problems around my chin. I used this for like a month and nothing changed. I really wanted to like this since everyone loves this brand except me. Neither my random acne stop appearing nor my redness decreased. Itâ€™s a waste and there are better products out there. Back to my previous favorite from glow recipe. not useful if you have acne issues
