I’ve been trying this product  for 2 weeks now. I’m impressed with the results. It does not irritate my skin the way most retinols products do when i first use them. I’ve oily skin acne prone and I’ve been using it everynight; i like it  because it is very light and absorbs fast, every morning my face feels soft and non greasy. So far i’ve noticed lightly improvement in the texture of my face. I think it has a great formula and with consistency, it will keep improving my skin concerns. Non irritating retinol
