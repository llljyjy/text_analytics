I love this toner from Paula’s Choice! First off, this product has such a nice light texture which  leaves my skin feeling so smooth after each use. I’ve noticed how hydrated my skin looks because of the hylaronic acid ingredient. If your looking for a toner that will work, this one is it! My fav toner!
