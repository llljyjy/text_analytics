Sometimes I feel like I have the world’s most stubborn hormonal acne, just when my skin looks like it’s finally cleared up, new bumps come right back around that time of the month. A friend recommended I try azelaic acid to help the skin heal faster, and it totally made a difference! The breakouts still come monthly like clockwork but they disappear a lot quicker, and I feel like I get fewer inflamed spots in general. Paula’s Choice Azelaic booster is one of the better products I tried with AA, even though it’s a little pricey for the amount you get. I like the texture and it’s easy to mix with my daily serum; it also doesn’t irritate my skin. So far so good! nan
