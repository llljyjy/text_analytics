The Paula’s Choice Clinical Discoloration Repair Serum has been a great addition to my daily routine! I have dry skin, so hydration is very important and this serum definitely provides that. Over the past few weeks, it has helped start to brighten my dark spots and leaves my skin looking smooth and bright. My skin is only a tiny bit sensitive to it and turns very slightly red after application, but it doesn’t burn or hurt and the redness goes away within a few minutes - so for that I would not recommend this to those with very sensitive skin. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this serum! Love this serum! Great results!
