Paula’s Choice C5 Super Boost Moisturizer is a silky lighweight formula with a barely there, citrusy scent. It feels instantly hydrating and refreshing on the skin. It’s a shelf stable formula that is non-irritating on my skin. I love the pump dispenser and how nicely it absorbs into the skin. It helps to brighten, firm, and moisturize the complexion. nan
