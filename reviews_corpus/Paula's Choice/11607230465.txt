I’m loving this exfoliating solution from Paula’s Choice. I use it once a night and I can definitely tell a difference in my skin. It’s helped with my redness around my nose and cheeks, keeps my acne at bay, and makes my skin look glows. My skin feels smoother and alot of the rough texture spots are fading. It doesn’t dry out my skin or cause any irritation. It’s perfect for my combination skin. Very happy with this product. Works great for my combo skin!!!
