Took a little getting used to, it’s thick and the first couple times I tried I put on too much. I see other reviews saying it was drying and I think different ingredients must work better or worse for different people because most every lip balm and color leaves me dry, Aquaphor keeps my lips going (not better or worse), but this... actually seems to make them better?! They don’t feel dry and between applications they feel softer. I’m a fan. Buying another one so I can have one in my purse and one in my nightstand. Works great for me!
