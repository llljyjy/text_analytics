I love this! I saw it recommended on a few blogs and wanted to give it a try. I have super sensitive skin and a lot of exfoliants really irritate my skin and this one worked really well and actually felt nourishing. I use it 2-3 times per week when I exfoliate. Great chemical exfoliant for sensitive skin
