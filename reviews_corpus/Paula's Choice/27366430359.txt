My skill had been feeling very dry and dull, and working late nights you could really tell I was struggling to get sleep by the bags under my eyes. I haven’t been an eye cream girl before this because in all honesty I didn’t see the point but this stuff really works. My under eye area feels so much more hydrated, looks glowy and full and I don’t see a raccoon in the mirror every morning now. Huge fan of Paula’s Choice for great quality and affordable skincare. Great under eye cream for 1st timers
