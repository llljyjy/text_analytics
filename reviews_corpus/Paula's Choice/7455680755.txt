After using this for one week, all I can say is wow! I’ve tried so many different toners, and none of them nourished by skin the way this one did. It’s hard for me to find the correct skincare products, since I have dry skin that is also acne prone. This toner hydrated my dry skin without making it breakout at all. I also feel like my skin is already looking younger. I’m in my late 20’s and starting to notice my first signs of aging, but this toner is making my skin look how it did when I was 20 (minus the acne). Best toner I’ve ever tried
