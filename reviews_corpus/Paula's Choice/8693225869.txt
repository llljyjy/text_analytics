I love this product, I use it in the morning and night after I wash my face. I wanted something to prevent dryness, especially during the changing seasons/weather. I feel like the hyaluronic acid really improved my skin barrier and helped retain more moisture. Iâ€™ve used it on my hands too and noticed a huge difference in preventing dryness. Amazing product, highly recommend!!
