I tried their 10%  Niacinamide booster in the past and really enjoyed that product, so I’ve been eyeing this one since it came out. I was worried that the concentration is too high that might cause irritation, but that didn’t happen at all. My skin loves it and you can tell the difference in a couple of days. I use it on my trouble areas such as around the nose, chin and breakout. You can feel the texture is getting smoother and the redness is reduced as well. I feel like I’m gonna need it more as the weather is getting warmer and my skin is getting oilier.  Highly, highly recommend! Works great!
