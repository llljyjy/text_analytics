I have loved every single product I’ve tried from Paula’s Choice, and this is another great one! Retinol has seriously been a game changer for my skin. I definitely recommend starting out only using a few times a week until your skin can handle more frequent use. It’s fragrance free and absorbs quickly! I love that it doesn’t dry out it skin and I swear I can tell a difference in how smooth my skin looks with just a few weeks of using it! The best!
