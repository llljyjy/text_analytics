In LOVEEE with this product! My morning consists of two steps, this moisturizer and an spf - a lazy/rushed morning dream! I love that I can get my vit C in without having an exra serum to apply, and this is lightweight enough for my oily skin to still wear during the day. The consistency is creamy and smooth. My skin is left supple without adding a sticky finish. I had some hyperpigmentation around my lip (left after a hormonal breakout) and it healed so much faster with this in my routine! I do wish the pump released less product, but since quite a bit comes out, I just bring it down my chest and neck. Adds convenience to any routine
