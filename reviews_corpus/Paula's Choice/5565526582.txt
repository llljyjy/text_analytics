Definitely recommend! It’s like water texture so you put some on your hands or on a cotton pad and just smear it once or twice all over my face and just washing it off or even leave it on with my moisturizer sometimes if I’m late and honestly my classmates noticed a huge difference and how smooth my skin was!(a few drops goes a long way!)i recommend tho using a plastic bag if you’re gonna put it in your bag bc it leaks through the top cracks but otherwise will purchase this forever Best exfoliating solution for me personally tbh!
