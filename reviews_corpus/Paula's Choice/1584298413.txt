I absolutely love this product, it is by far the best niacinamide I have used. The price is a bit steep however the results make it worth it. I have noticed my pores are smaller and less noticeable, blackheads are clearing up, and my complexion is more even and bright since adding this in. I do not get any irritation from it even after using a strong AHA or BHA. I did not notice a strong or offensive scent. Will definitely keep this in my regimen. Great results
