The active ingredients in this serum are just skincare all-stars, and I can totally see the impact on my skin! it has evened out my skin tone and made it brighter and more luminous. Iâ€™ve also noticed that my skin is firmer and it has smoothed out the fine lines beautifully! I love that it contains both retinol and bakuchiol, so I do t have to choose and can benefit from both! Great nighttime serum!
