I like this product! I think it is practical and useful. I’m not going to tell you it’s like an amazing amazing product that transformed my skin forever (don’t really think those exist), but if you’re looking for a practical product to enhance the effectiveness of vitamin C and provide some brightening effect, this will do the job. I use this after toner and before vitamin C in the morning; it NEVER pills and absorbs really easily and I never have an issue applying another serum and moisturizer on top. It’s great also for getting skin pH lower for vitamin C to absorb better, which allows me to use whichever toner I want before without worrying about pH levels. And overall it has had a brightening effect. I would love for it to be slightly cheaper, but overall it is a good product and I will be repurchasing (I received it through Dermstore BeautyFix last year). useful, practical product with good results.
