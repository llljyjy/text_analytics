This isn’t like buying chapstick or putting Vaseline on your lips… this literally has saved my lips and brought them back to life. They are no longer flaky, dry, or chapped. They’re also feel so full and can less lines are visible. The metal tip applicator helps it glide like butter so smooth. It goes on perfectly. My lips feel so amazing. Nothing has ever worked like this before and I’ve tried everything. I’ve also been applying at night before bed and when I wake up in the morning my lips feel and look good. Definitely worth it. Lip Must Have !
