I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a big difference I suffer from post acne spots and have been trying everything to fade them. This has noticeably started fading my spots in my cheek!  I am pleasantly surprised and will continue to use. I have been using this in combination with my moisturizer the texture is thin so it blends in easily I also add a couple extra drops on top.  I have acne prone skin and this seemed to help keep break outs at bay and if I did get one they cleared up quickly. I will definitely be using this as a staple in my routine. Must have for brighter skin and post acne marks
