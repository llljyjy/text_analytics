I can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on this for so long.. I’ve got dry skin prone to breakouts, mostly hormonal acne and this product is the best of the best for clearing out the pores and preventing, but also quickly healing acne. Also resurfacing patches of dryness and texture on your skin. It’s a miracle worker for your face. I don’t like to use this everyday to avoid sensitivity but when I need a lil extra TLC this is what I reach for and it works every time. It’s also great for just spot treatments if you don’t want to put it all over, just dab it where you need it and go along with the rest of your routine and you’re good to go. This is a new must have, highly recommend it! does it all
