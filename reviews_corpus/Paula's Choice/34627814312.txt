This worked so good! I was having hormonal acne and stress acne and this cleared me up within just a few weeks but I used it along with dermalogica special cleanser, and dermalogica toner I applied dermalogica first then the Paula’s choice and only used Paula’s choice 2 times a day, I tried the 3 times a day and it dried my face so I stuck with the 2 times a day! But works so good!! Highly recommend highly recommend!
