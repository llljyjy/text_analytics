I use the paula’s choice 1% retinol, which can be very drying. I took a break from using it at the beginning of the year because my skin was so sensitive. I started using the retinol with this and i haven’t had any sensitivity. This is a product i will use forever just because it does such a good job at helping sensitive skin Good for sensitivity
