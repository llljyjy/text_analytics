There’s a lot that’s great about this moisturizer. I think it’s great for a transitional skincare routine. The summer months are ending and we’re all definitely going to need a moisturizer that addresses cooler air and all that goes along with it. It’s a thicker, creamier texture. I have found that it will pill beneath makeup so definitely give it a chance to sink in before application! But I prefer to apply it at night. Creamy goodness
