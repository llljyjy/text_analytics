*I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review*I have been trying Paula’s Choice BHA for several weeks now and I can say that so far I am enjoying it. I finished my last BHA so this was a perfect time to finally try this cult fave. I started using this once every other day and I could immediately feel a difference in my skin’s texture but I was using this too frequently, and with the cold weather here in New York, my skin was dry. So I took a couple days break and started using this every third day which seems to be working perfect. This is the only new product I introduced into my skincare routine. I was struggling with under the skin acne and some congestion which this definitely helped. I currently have a break out on my chin and I believe it has helped with any redness/irritation. I suggest you slowly integrate this into your skincare routine to see how your skin will react and learn how to listen to what your skin needs. :) Great for skin texture and congestion!
