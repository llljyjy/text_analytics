i’ve suffered from acne + hyperpigmentation for years and never thought to try this cult classic product until now. i finally decided to buy it after i had a pretty bad reaction to a moisturizer that left me with a lot of tiny bumps and congestion on my cheeks & forehead. since my skin is already pretty dry/dehydrated, i only used this twice a week in the mornings to avoid overexfoliating and drying out my skin further. even then, my skin still felt quite dehydrated after each use and i also noticed that i broke out after those two uses. part of me thinks it could’ve been an initial purging period but i know my skin is already accustomed to exfoliation so idk, it does make me wary that this is just making my problem worse. i also just can’t stand the texture + finish of this product, it feels quite oily on the skin and leaves a sheen that i just can’t stand. overall, i’m pretty disappointed with this toner, i’ll keep using it to see if there are any further improvements but i doubt i’ll be repurchasing since there are better options out there :/ meh
