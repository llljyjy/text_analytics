Most cleansers I have to remove my make up fully before using. However, this cleanser are used and I had a little bit about the real mascara and some foundation on my face in it, clean it off perfectly well also still cleaning my face overall. this cleanser was really good for my acne prone and combination skin, and I can definitely see myself buying again. nan
