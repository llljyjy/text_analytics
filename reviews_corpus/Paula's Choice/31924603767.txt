I adore this concept and have used a cleansing balm in a tube before. I had high hopes for this and enjoy it but don’t love it. The texture is a bit thicker which is good but takes a little warming up or working in to get it to really massage into the face. It does have a faint smell (for those who are more sensitive). It wasn’t as good at removing stubborn mascara, but did a good job removing makeup on my face. Overall, a good convenient choice for shower or travel. Convenient First Cleanse
