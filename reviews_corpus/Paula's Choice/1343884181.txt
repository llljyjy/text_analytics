This all-mineral sunscreen is really easy to spread, has a really beautiful demi-matte finish, and leaves zero white cast on my light skin. My skin is normal to dry, so there’s an occasional tight feeling on low-humidity days. I’ve learned to apply a moisturizer underneath to mitigate that.Two things that would make this sunscreen even better:1. increase the SPF to 50 (I want all the protection I can get!)2. make it water-resistant (I have to set my eye area with powder, or I get stingy eyes when this migrates in) Almost a perfect sunscreen
