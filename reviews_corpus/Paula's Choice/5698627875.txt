The finish of the sunscreen is perfect for me, I have semi oily skin and so many sunscreens end up looking greasy on me. But this one has a natural finish even after reapplication. However, this sunscreen smells weird, kinda like saliva and it pills and the worst part, it burns your eyes so so bad. It only pills if you have multiple layers of skincare underneath but that’s annoying enough to not repurchase again. But as I mentioned, it will burn your eyes so bad, like I couldn’t open my eyes for a while after rinsing. Good thing the brand refunded me. Ok
