The packaging is the perfect size for an eye cream and I love the pump. The formula itself is lovely, not too thick or too thin. It absorbs really nicely under my eyes and fairly quickly too. I especially can’t wait to see a difference in discoloration. So far I really love how it seems to plump my undereye by keeping it hydrated. It works so well under makeup without making my concealer crease. Yes, my eyes look less dull now definitely. I really enjoy this eye cream and will finish it up. I have faith in all of Paula’s Choice products and have a feeling this one won’t disappoint. Love the way my undereyes absorb this cream
