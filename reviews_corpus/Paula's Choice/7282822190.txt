Iâ€™ve always had very clear skin with minimal effort (i.e. I washed my face once every two days in the shower) but right after college, things took a turn for the worst. I was getting huge, angry, scarring pimples on my cheeks that just would not go away. I considered going to the derm for a prescription since this was so unusual to me. HOWEVER, this product saved me a copay! I started using it every morning right off the bat, and my skin has cleared completely. (I also started washing my face 2x/day like a normal person lol.) Not a single pimple. I do still have the dark spots from picking past pimples, but nothing new has shown up. I apply the exfoliant with my hands to avoid wasting product. This will be my holy grail forever. Saved me a trip to the dermatologist
