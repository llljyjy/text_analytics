I try to use this morning and night, everyday because it’s good for 3 months only and it definitely helps with texture and lightens my blemishes. I have oily skin and glad it’s in a watery consistency since it doesn’t make my face greasy, I just use a moisturizing sunscreen after and opt out for the moisturizer for morning routine nan
