I never write reviews but I stopped using this for awhile sense my face was breaking out and I didn’t know what was causing it my skincare routine is very simple so I just recently used it and let me tell you I fell in love with it all over again my texture is almost gone and it even made redness more calm my face feels so smooth and soft My face haven’t felt like this in awhile I’m also very sensitive my face reacts to almost everything buy it! nan
