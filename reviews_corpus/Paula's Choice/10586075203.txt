I really don’t know why I continue to buy foundations when this product makes my skin look so nice all on its own, and gives me the SPF I need too. Skin care, then an SPF, then foundation, it’s just too many layers and chances for products to not work well together.  If I feel I need it, I might apply a very light moisturizer first, then this…it is lightweight, provides light coverage, and dries down to a soft, matte finish - I really don’t even need powder.  Doesn’t burn the eyes, I wouldn’t say this is moisturizing, but it doesn’t make my skin look dry either. I’ve tried putting foundation over it, but then I’m back into that too many layers area…however, it will work under foundation, unlike so many mineral sunscreens.  I’ve tried other tinted SPF products, but have to say, this one is the best. Best tinted SPF, no need for foundation!
