This is a very nice retinol treatment. I have very sensitive skin and this one doesn’t irritate or burn like some of used. It does have a slight tingle depending on the cleanser I’ve used but it only lasts a bit. It’s gentle enough for regular use and I can’t wait to see the full benefit. Gentle and effective
