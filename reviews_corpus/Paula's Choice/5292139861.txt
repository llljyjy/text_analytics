I really love this 10% Azelaic Acid Booster. I have very sensitive skin so I only used it at night, but I noticed after using it for a week my skin really did seem to glow. It didn’t irritate me and I didn’t break out at all while using this product. Overall, I was very happy with the results. Love it!
