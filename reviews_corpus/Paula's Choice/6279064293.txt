This is a unscented serum with a very watery consistency. It is fairly sticky and takes a bit to dry down but once fully dried down and absorbed the sticky feeling fades. It is brightening and has helped improve skin dullness. My sun spots are also fading, especially since using in conjunction with the Paula’s Choice Discoloration repair serum.  Overall skin tone is more even and bright. I haven’t had any trouble layering with other products or makeup. A bit sticky but does improve dull skin tone!
