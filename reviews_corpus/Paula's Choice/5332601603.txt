I don’t have acne but I have some reddness and red spots on my skin so I decided to try this product. First of all, it is a treatment product not a beauty one that’s why I don’t mind the smell. I have been using it for two weeks already and can see the improvements on my skin,  the red spots haven’t gone completely but they are less noticeable as before. I will definitely continue using it and keep updated with the result. nan
