I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review — all opinions 100% my own!I have combination skin that’s very acne prone and has a ton of pigmentation. I deal with a lot of uneven texture from breakouts, especially even after breakouts. This has done so much with helping my skin feel softer and look smoother. I use it every other day because I have other actives in my routine, but before adding this it has never felt this soft. I always had little bumps on my skin but now, even though I still have some pigmentation, my skin feels completely smooth. At first, I wasn’t sure if this was working, but I realized my skin has never felt this soft before. It definitely didn’t completely solve every skin concern, but there is a noticeable texture a difference from when I started using this. I also noticed I haven’t had any big breakouts recently… Definitely keeping this in my routine, I get the hype. It’s gentle, didn’t dry out my skin, and I love how my skin feels For skin that’s smoooooth
