I am really impressed with this acid product. I’ve used few exfoliate product from Paula’s choice before and some smell badly. This acid is nearly unscented and texture is very watery and spreadable. I love the applicator design that I can use it on targeted area only. It refines a lot my blackhead on my nose. refine blackhead
