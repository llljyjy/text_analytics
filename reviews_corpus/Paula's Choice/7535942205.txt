I started using this product because my holy grail sunscreen didn’t work well with the new products I started using. It’s a pretty basic sunscreen, very lightweight, it doesn’t smell like much, and it blends into my skin well. I will say, if you have dry skin be sure to moisturize before putting this on!! No white cast. yes for brown and darker tones
