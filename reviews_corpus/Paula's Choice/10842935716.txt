This product has been working well with current skincare routine and leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed after applying. Compared to my other retinol serums this has a creamy texture and feels cooling when it dries down. It blends out completely with no sticking residue too. Glad I got it to increase smoothness on my Awesome product
