This isn’t the worst cleansing balm I’ve used, but it was far from the best. Pros: It breaks down sunscreen - both chemical and mineral - pretty well and leaves my skin wonderfully soft. It doesn’t contain any fragrance, dyes or irritating ingredients, so it’s fantastic for sensitive, reactive skin.Cons: The product didn’t have a consistent texture. It wasn’t great at removing makeup. I tried it on both a full face and just (waterproof) mascara days, and was left unsatisfied every time; I had to go back in with micellar water after double cleansing. In sum, I expected a much better performance from this balm based on the rave reviews and the hefty pricetag, but was left disheartened. It leaves one’s skin soft but is far better at removing sunscreen than makeup. Not worth $28. Average at best
