I switched for this because of the “ phobia “ generated around skincare that contains alcohol. I was doing quite well with Tarte Knockout for even skin tone and pore size control. I have normal oily combo skin. Was very pleased with that Tarte Knockout Tingling toner. Used this for a full year. I can definitely atest to it’s inefficiency in helping pore size stay at minimum, no glowy feeling skin like before, dullness and insufficient exfoliating power. My make up didn’t look as good all during the time I used this. But I was going with the “ no alcohol “ moviment and ended up setting back my skin wasting a year on this over hyped product. Of Tarte Knockout is too strong for you I started years ago with the Climique ones. Both better than this product. Used it for a year
