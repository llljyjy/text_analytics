I don’t think that two weeks is really enough time to see major results but so far, this eye cream is very nice. It’s hydrating and not too heavy for use during the day. I don’t have a lot of undereye darkness but this does seem to be making an improvement in dullness. It feels very refreshing and I enjoy applying it especially in the mornings. Nice eye cream
