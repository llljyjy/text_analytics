Lovely cleanser! I have dry/combination skin, not super sensitive. This light foaming cleanser was very pleasant to use. The texture feels creamy & light, less tacky than most foaming cleansers. Since I do have dry skin I half expected this to leave my skin tight but I am happy to report that did not happen! I would say it’s more geared towards normal/oily skin types but not bad for my dry skin peeps. Also the price makes me so happy! A good cleanser at a good price. My only qualm is that I noticed the pump straw is shorter than the bottle - so I’m going to be fishing for the remaining product when this gets low & it won’t pump anymore. A pet peeve of mine, but it’s pretty common with these bottle types, so not a deal breaker! Hard to RESIST.
