I has my eye on this toner for a while because I have really dry skin. It’s surprisingly hard to find a good toner focused on hydration. This was just what my skin needed! It’s a lightweight toner that feels refreshing when I use it. It soothes and moisturizes and just makes my skin feel so much better. Even though it’s winter this toner has helped keep my skin looking plumper and more hydrated. Highly recommended! nan
