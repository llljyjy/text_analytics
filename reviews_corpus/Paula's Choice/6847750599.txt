i have combination skin that’s super sensitive & acne prone. i also struggle with hormonal acne issues. i’ve been using the PC liquid exfoliant for around a year now and it’s amazing! it doesn’t break me out (at least not more than i normally do from my hormonal acne) and it doesn’t leave my face tight and dry before moisturizer. my skin is nowhere near perfect, but definitely a lot better than it was thanks to this. any time i try a different liquid exfoliant, i always come crawling back to this one. i loveeee that sephora started selling paula’s choice products!!! sensitive acne prone skin approved!!
