I got this delivered just in time when my monthly pimple sprang up.  I immediately tried this and hoped for the best.  The next morning I can say it definitely went down a bit.  I feel that this works wonders on bumps and will continue to use it in my problem areas.  Love how effective Paula Choice products are without being drying or irritating!  This will definitely be a keeper in my skincare routine! Bumps BYE!!
