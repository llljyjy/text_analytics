It smells terrible, but it works....for a while. Until the breakout. It did wow me when I use it for the first time.Even tho it smells like nail lash remover, but the result is good. Skin looks bright and smooth I used twice a week and I always wash it off after 5 minutes. Because I canâ€™t stand the smell. 2 weeks later, when I use it again, I got break out. Bummer. Not for Combination sensitive skin
