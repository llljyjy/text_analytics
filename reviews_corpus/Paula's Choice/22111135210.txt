I myself have somewhat sensitive skin, I used this product once and when I did I used it with a cotton pad. Once I the product was applied, I felt as if something went wrong and I was correct. The next morning I woke up with a staph infection on my cheek that was caused by the combination of this product and the cotton pad. I would not recommend for sensitive skin and I would recommend not using a cotton pad. nan
