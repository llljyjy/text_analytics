This is one of the best Niacinamide products i have ever tried. The way it minimizes my pores, prevents breakouts, and brightens my skin has me in love. Itâ€™s also totally dry skin friendly, which most niacinamide products are geared towards oily skin, so I really appreciate that. Not to mention it also comes in a really luxurious glass bottle, that is easily recyclable. It checks all of my boxes for sure. One of my favorite niacinamide products!
