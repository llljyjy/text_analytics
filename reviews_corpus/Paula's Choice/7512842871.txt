I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I used this toner when I started having painful breakouts on my neck and lower chin. After three days, the acne on my neck and chin all dried up. I also had some blackheads on my cheeks, that I noticed were starting to clear and overall a smoother feel to my skin.It’s now part of my weekly acne routine but I wouldn’t recommend it for daily use as it can be drying. Maybe 2-3x a week to help reduce and curb any breakouts you’re having. If you’re on the fence about it, get it, you won’t regret it. Got rid of the breakouts on my neck and chin.
