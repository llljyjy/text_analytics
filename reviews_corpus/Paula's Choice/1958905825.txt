I have been really enjoying this eye cream! I’ve noticed that my under eyes look a little smoother, and less tired. It feels lightweight but nourishing at the same time, and plays well under makeup and with other skincare products. It has a buttery texture, and leaves the under eye looking and feeling so smooth. I haven’t had any negative reactions, irritation or milia which is a plus. I’ve noticed an improvement in the look of my under-eyes after 2 weeks of consistent use! Such a nice eye cream!
