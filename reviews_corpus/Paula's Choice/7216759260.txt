I was super excited to try this line of paulas choice skincare. I am very particular when it comes to moisturizers, this has been my go to since receiving it. The moisturizer is right in the middle when it comes to consistency, I love that it isnâ€™t very thick or thin. You can feel your skin plump and hydrated, it has a slight scent reminds me of oatmeal but it goes away after a few minutes. Recommend! Try it!
