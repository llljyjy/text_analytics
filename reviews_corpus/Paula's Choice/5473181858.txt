I like that Paula’s Choice has travel sizes to try products out and I really ended up enjoying this. I wanted to treat a couple of things: uneven skin texture, enlarged pores, and old acne scars.  I noticed surface level results by the end of the first week. My spots were fading, my forehead where I have the most texture began to slowly smooth out and my pores on my nose began to clean out. I’ve used up the bottle and have since moved onto the full size and I LOVE it. I didn’t really notice any stinging but my skin isn’t particularly sensitive. I use this 3x a week. LOVE this so much!
