This eye cream is alright, but nothing special. It definitely is hydrating and makes my under eyes feel nice, I think it is a good product minus the cost. You can get similar results with a less expensive eye cream and vitamin C serum combo IMO. Totally a nice product, just not worth the money:) not worth the price
