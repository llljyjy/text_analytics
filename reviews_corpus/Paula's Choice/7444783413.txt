I used this toner for about a week and when i tell you i was shocked at the results… i was! i have textured oily skin and this product has helped my skin for the better. it’s not like most toners it has a bit of a gel consistency but i like it! left my face feeling smooth and i woke up with clearer and less acne on my face! i love other paula’s choice products so i definitely recommend this as well!! Hydration omg!!!
