This is honestly the only eye cream that ever worked for me. I’ve tried Inkey list caffeine eye cream, Kiehl’s vitamin c eye cream and the biossance one and it still didn’t get rid of my dark under eyes near the corner of my eyes. What I like about this product is that it doesn’t have dimethicone like the Kiehl’s one which made my eyes feel weird. The other 2 eye creams I mentioned only hydrated my eyes but didn’t reduce the darkness underneath. I’m so glad Paula’s Choice released a vitamin c eye cream because I’ve been looking everywhere that didn’t break the bank. I’ve been using this product now for 2 weeks and I’m already seeing results. It glides on so smoothly with no irritation and I think the price is decent. Just because it works for me may might not work for you, but I recommend trying it. A must have in my routine!!!!!
