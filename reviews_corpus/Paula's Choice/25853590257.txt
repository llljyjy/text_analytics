Niacinamide is one of my favorite ingredients! I have dry acne prone skin and this ingredient has helped my skin so much let alone this product! This is a product you definitely have to work your skin up to but it is so worth it! It has helped strengthen my skin barrier while brightening my hyperpigmentation! It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated! My skin texture is so smooth and my overall complexion is brighter! Iâ€™m absolutely in love! The best!
