I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I chose this product because I heard good things about it on instagram.  The packaging was really nice and there is a lot of product for the price of it.  The product is a clear liquid with no noticeable fragrance that I could tell.  I usually applied the product with a cotton pad and it does feel really nice on the skin.  It is not drying or sticky.  I thought this would be the perfect product to try because of acne.  It took about a week for acne to reduce in size and redness and so far it has been working nicely to keep new blemishes from appearing.  Iâ€™m going to continue to use this as my go-to toner!  It feels very nice so I recommend it! Great Experience
