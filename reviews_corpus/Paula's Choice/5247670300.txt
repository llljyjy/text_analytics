I had been using retinol for 4 months before I decided to try the 1% strength because I just hadn’t really seen much difference prior. I was nervous as to how much it would irritate my skin so I followed recommendations if only 3 times a week, moisturize well, stay out of sun, etc. I used it for 2 weeks, saw more results than I had in the previous 4 months, had no issues with irritation, redness or peeling/ flaking. I’m now at 6 weeks and friends, family, co-workers have told me that I look really good. Others have asked if I changed my makeup. My partner, ( who uses bar soap to wash his face and never specifically mentions my skin but compliments meand tells me I’m beautiful or I look really nice), without knowing I had changed anything told me… to my face… that my crow’s feet had disappeared and I had lost 5 years, (I’m 41). I instinctively wanted to respond to the statement that I had crow’s feet to begin with but realized that when your kind partner says something that blunt and honest  that’s positive to just shut up and be happy. I told him I started to use retinol, (had no idea what it was or what it did), a couple of months back and he just told me that my entire face and complexion was younger, vibrant and the fine wrinkles I had had had been visibly reduced and smoothed.I use it 5 times a week, still no problem with irritation though I use Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy Cream morning and night which is a pretty rich and moisturizing cream. Overall, I’m looking forward to next month! Went from 41 years old to 36 in 7 weeks!
