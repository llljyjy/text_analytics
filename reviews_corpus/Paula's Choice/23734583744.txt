This serum uses 15% Ascorbic Acid, it’s the most powerful form of Vitamin C you can find. This concentrate helps to boost collagen production and brightens overall skin tone. I have sensitive skin, when I started using this serum I didn’t get any tingling or pitching feeling. I am so glad I finally found a Vitamin C serum that I didn’t have to train my skin to get use to. nan
