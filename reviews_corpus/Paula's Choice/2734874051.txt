Amazing! I have combo skin but it gets drier and drier over the winter months. Already my skin feels all irritated. When i take off my makeup normally my skin is so red and irritated. Enter this amazing face wash, cleans my skin really well - even removes the makeup and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling all irritated and red. I feel like my skin looks refreshed and even dare i say more plump and healthy looking. Huge win. I need more from Paula! nan
