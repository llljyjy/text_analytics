I was gifted the resist advanced replenishing toner by Paulas choice & I have been using it day and night. Right off the bat I love the consistency of the product. I was expecting a liquid formula and it is more creamy/gel-like. It is a milky color. I like to apply it directly to my hands and tap into my skin as part of my daily skin care routine. A little bit goes a long way. I immediately noticed my skin felt hydrated and smooth. I do feel it plumps you my skin making it look more hydrated. It makes applying my skin care routine refreshing while allowing my other products to soak into my skin. I have not noticed any dry patches on my skin now that the winter weather has settled in. I really love this product! A must-have in your skin care routine!
