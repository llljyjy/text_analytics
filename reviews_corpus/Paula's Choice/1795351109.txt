This is my new favorite Retinol product and I’ll tell you why. My skin is super dry and sensitive to retinol in general. I didn’t think my skin could handle the 1% and this is honestly perfect. I experienced no irritation with this and have seen a difference in the fine lines on my forehead already. I love that it has Bakuchiol and some soothing ingredients as well. It feels really nice on the skin and absorbs quickly. Definitely good for those new to retinol or those who are sensitive to it. Gentle yet effective
