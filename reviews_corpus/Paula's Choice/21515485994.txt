This product has lasted me an entire year, and it’s amazing. It really does clean and shrink your pore size. With continued use, some of them will even go away! I am 37, in a dry mountainous climate and have combo skin: oily t-zone with normal-to-dry other areas. This product is the only thing that has ever actually shrunk my pores, and you don’t flake like a molting lizard the day or two after use! It’s very powerful, so even using just 3X a week is enough for results. It is very sticky/tacky though, and could not be worn during the day like it claims. But as a night treatment it is worth every  penny. My skin is CLEARER and my pores are clear, and shrinking still! Will change your pores! Not for daytime
