Since the first day I tried Paulaâ€™s Choice products I adopted them into my beauty routine.  They have the best formulas I ever used and they work so well. This Niaciamide serum is the first one that my skin is willing to approuve. All the other ones that I tried made my skin breakout so bad. This one smoothes my skin and refines my pores perfectly.  I use it a few times a week. Best Niaciamide serum on the market
