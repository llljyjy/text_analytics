I am absolutely OBSESSED with this cleansing balm. I have tried so many cleansing balms as I find that they are superior to any other makeup removing product. I love that this product comes in a squeezable tube rather than a pot that you have to dip into. The formula is great for breaking down and removing makeup. I apply it my full face and begin to massage the product in. Once it has been spread everywhere, I add water and continue massing the product in to remove my makeup. It works super quick and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. New holy grail makeup remover!!!!! New Favorite Makeup Remover!
