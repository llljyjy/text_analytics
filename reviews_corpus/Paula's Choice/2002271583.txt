The packaging on this product is absolutely horrible!!! It cracked open and about 80% of the product is now gone straight onto my carpet. Sad, because I actually like this product, itâ€™s the only sunscreen/moisturizer that does not make me super oily or break me out. But until they can get better packaging I am not wasting anymore money on this. nan
