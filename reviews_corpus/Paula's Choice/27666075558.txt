This is not my first time trying Paula’s Choice products. I have been a fan of these products for a while now. I love that this product is cruelty free and also fragrance free. It’s very important to me to look at the ingredients before I apply anything to my face  , I love the ingredients in this product super clean . I use this every night before sleep , I apply it on my face , definitely avoid the eyes can be pretty harsh since it’s pretty concentrated . I had few dark spots on my face that bothered me very much and I noticed after I used for few days they disappeared I really hope they don’t come back. I would definitely recommend this to anyone dealing with pores, dark or red spots on their face. Great Product !!!!!
