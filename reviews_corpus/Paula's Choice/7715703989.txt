When I say life changing, I’m not exaggerating! Obviously, the same thing won’t work for every single person, but this has FINALLY fixed my skin! After 8 years, dermatologists, Curology & numerous other attempts to fix acne that suddenly showed up in my early 20s, at 30 my skin is BEAUTIFUL. In one week my entire face is clear, soft, & glowing! I haven’t worn more than concealer since the day after starting it! If you’re on the fence TRY IT! 8 years of acne & my life has changed!
