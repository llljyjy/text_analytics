This is one of my favorite leave-on BHA exfoliants.It uses salicylic acid and does wonders to improve my stubborn skin that has enlarged and clogged pores. I have used it on my patches of dry skin, but find the way it helps most is clogged pores. I use it as the last step in my evening skincare routine. This is a great product.
