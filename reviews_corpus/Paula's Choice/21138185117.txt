I am at that age where my smile wrinkles are starting to set in permanently and I need a good retinol. This one sounded good and was affordable. For reference I’ve got dry/combo/aging skin.I’ve tried prescription Tretinoin at the lowest dose and after a week my skin is irritated, dried out, flaking horribly, and it’s raw and painful. It works but the biggest downside is just waiting for your skin to heal enough to continue the treatment. It’s not pleasant.I started using this 3 times a week to try to avoid any irritation. The consistency is a creamy serum and just 2 pumps was enough for a thin layer over my whole face.It has a scent that I can’t place; Maybe alcohol and something medicinal, but it disperses almost immediately. I think this would be okay for those with scent allergies.I also made sure to use a nourishing moisturizer with it to counteract the retinol’s drying effects and I had no problems. If I was feeling a little dry I would pat on a thin layer of a facial oil to over the moisturizer. My skin didn’t get irritated and I didn’t start flaking. Success!After almost 2 weeks my skin felt firmer for sure. I’ll have to use it a bit longer to see any wrinkle diminishing action but from what I’ve seen so far, this is the closest to the prescription stuff (sans irritation) that I’ve tried and the price is fantastic. I recommend it! A great retinol at a great price!
