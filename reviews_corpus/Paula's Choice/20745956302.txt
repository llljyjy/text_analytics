This sunscreen has SPF 30, which is very light as they motioned on the packaging. Itâ€™s not runny, has no white cast, and has an incredibly lightweight texture that feels light on the skin. Perfect for normal, oily,  combo, and breakout-prone skin by targeting enlarged pores, oil control, and redness. I have a combination skin with slight acne. This product works very well on my skin. Perfect for year-round sun protection, but I especially recommend it for winter. I like to recommend it a good moisturizer with SPF
