I have been using this in the evenings for a couple weeks now and I am really enjoying it. It’s got a nice, silky texture that absorbs pretty quickly and doesn’t leave the area tacky. My under eyes do seem brighter after repeated use. I don’t feel like makeup layers well over it so I suggest using it at night. nan
