Most balms leave my face feeling like it has a little layer of oil on it, but this balm rinses completely clean with minimal effort and leaves no residual oil or buildup on my skin.  It does a great job of emulsifying my beauty products and before I even add water, my face looks almost clean. I do need to give a little extra love to my eyelashes and lids if I wear mascara and liner, but that’s about it.  Also, it’s unscented but the combination of natural oils in this balm has a very faint scent that is reminiscent of coconut and I really enjoy it. Rinses away cleanly and without residue!
