I usually am not a big fan of using moisturizer, however I decided to give this one a try! A lot of product comes out of the pump (so be warned), but it feels a little sticky, but mainly hydrating and kind of plumps the skin. The moisturizer feels like any other liquid makeup product and overall helped my skin feel hydrated and firm. A great Moisturizer!
