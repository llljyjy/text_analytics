I have been using retinol for a while trying different ones to find “the one”. This is it! I was using a retinol I thought was pretty good, potent so when I started using this I figured since I was just switching brands I could continue with nightly use. Nope, absolutely not. This is so much stronger than the one I was using and left me with a light chemical burn on my upper cheeks and I had to stop for almost a week. I now use this every other day or sometimes every second day if I use an acid mask or toner. Works incredibly well and will always be my go to. As far as good retinol goes the price isn’t terrible either. I’ve found “the one”.
