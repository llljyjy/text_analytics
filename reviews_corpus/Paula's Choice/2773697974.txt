I received this cleanser in exchange for an honest review. I love the texture of this, and how it really lathers well. It’s a great option for a second cleanse, although I find it can be a touch drying. I do like that it’s fragrance free and that you can a lot of product in this bottle - a little goes a really long way! A solid cleanser option
