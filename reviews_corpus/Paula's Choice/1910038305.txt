This isn’t enough moisture for me in the winter but it’s absolutely perfect in the summer. I hope it’s never discontinued and I’m surprised by the negative reviews. It has a lot of good ingredients and does wonders for when I don’t want something too heavy in the summer. I’ve gone through at least 3 bottles. I have combo skin for reference. nan
