I’ve used a number of Vitamin C products from various companies over the years. Since I wanted to try a C + ferrulic acid serum but didn’t want to spend the huge amount of money on what is probably the most popular one out there, and I have loved all the Paula’s Choice products I’ve used, I picked this one up from Sephora. While it feels nice on the skin and doesn’t pill - and I can use it alone or with my hyaluronic acid serum - it unfortunately started oxidizing very quickly and here I am, 6 weeks from purchase, with am already yellowed serum despite keeping it sealed and in a dark drawer away from light. I’ve not had this occur with other serums this badly, and some of those weren’t even in opaque bottles. I usually get at least a few months out of them before this becomes an issue.I don’t know if I just got a bad batch or if this normal, but sadly I won’t be repurchasing this product because I can’t get through a bottle quickly enough to beat the oxidization and get my money’s worth. Unfortunately, I’m past my return period, so I’m going to have to eat the cost so thus was a pricey lesson to learn. Good, but oxidizes way too quickly
