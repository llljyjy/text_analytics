I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.Over the past few weeks of use, I’ve noticed my skin is softer to touch, and my dark spots (especially around my chin & neck area) are beginning to fade.  I use this in both my morning & night routine, and can’t wait to see how my skin improves with continued use!  I also have oily skin, and find that this doesn’t leave me feeling greasy throughout the day. You need this in your routine!
