Before I became a skin care junkie and knew anything about how to take care of my skin I was using an apricot scrub, I won’t say the name but we all know which one! Lol. I came across a video a few years back and learned how damaging physical exfoliants can be to the skin so I did my research and discovered this gem. I haven’t looked back and I never will. Forever customer! amazing stuff!
