Was gifted the resist advanced replenishing toner with hyaluronic acid by Paula’s choice in exchange for an honest review. I have combination/ oily skin that tends to be on the sensitive side. This toner did not dry out my face nor did it sting or cause any redness. My skin really enjoyed this, and typically with toners they leave a tightness to my skin but that didn’t happen with this product. nan
