Paula’s choice products tend to be on the stronger side. This packaging is a bit different from their other items (comes in a glass bottle), but is none the less strong like the others. I’ve tried the 20% niacinamide before and I don’t see visible results with either of them. The 20% one does feel heavier on the skin and I only use that once a week. With this, I think I can use it more frequently but I’m going in with caution because a lot of reviews online say that they experienced irritation from this product. Could be a good entry product
