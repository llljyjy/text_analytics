I have balanced skin with some rosacea and have been using retinol for a couple years now. This product is great, but proceed with caution. My skin tends to be pretty resilient and I’m typically able to use new products without patch testing (including exfoliants), but the PC 1% retinol is very strong. I’ve used Cerave’s retinol and the PC .3% retinol with no issues and wanted to give the 1% a try. I did have a lot of sensitivity and redness on my cheeks after using the 1% and had some neck irritation. Doing the 3x a week patch tests so far has been working well and I’ve also been putting this retinol over a moisturizer to build up a tolerance. Overall, I think this product has a lot of good things going for it, but definitely take your time to incorporate it into your routine. 4.5 Stars; Not for Beginners
