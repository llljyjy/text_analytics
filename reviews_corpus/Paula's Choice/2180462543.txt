I’ve heard great stuff about Paula’s choice exfoliating toner and been wanting to try it for the milia under my eyes but then I saw this product and soooo happy I’ve discovered it! I’ve been using similar ingredients in pads form before this and I saw some difference but this one was AMAZING. I saw significant difference in the sizes of the milias. It’s so much smaller and less noticeable. I’m so excited to continue using this product. ( I just have to be very careful since it’s used around my eyes. Dabbing with Qtip was better than applying straight from the tube!) Works really good on milia!
