Love this toner! I have normal-dry skin and use Tretinoin nightly so I love incorporating a product like this to add much needed hydration to my skin. It’s milky but lightweight and absorbs quickly. I am acne prone and this didn’t cause any breakouts. Great product! The perfect lightweight, milky toner
