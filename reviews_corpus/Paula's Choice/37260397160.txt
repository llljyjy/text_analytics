I am in love with how this product makes my skin feel! I use it 2-3 times a week in the evenings, and I can confidently say that my acne gets better after every time I use it. The only reason this got 4 stars is that the smell is pretty funky, which is understandable because of its ingredients, and I can honestly deal with the odor if it makes my acne better. I will definitely be purchasing a full-size of this when I run out! Made my acne much much better!
