A nightmare for removing basic eye makeup. The bottle states to wash twice for makeup but sometimes two washes still doesn’t do much good and you’re left using double the amount of product and still looking like a raccoon. Cheaper brands from drugstores do a better job at makeup removal. If you don’t use makeup you’ll love this product and it’s a dream, doesn’t dry out my skin and product feels really nice. Great if you don't wear makeup.
