I am a huge fan of Paulaâ€™s Choice products and the RESIST Advanced Replenishing Toner with Hyaluronic acid has become another favorite from the brand.  Not only does this toner help to balance my skin, it leaves it soft and hydrated, too.  The toner has a very nice almost lotion-like consistency and I love that is has no scent! nan
