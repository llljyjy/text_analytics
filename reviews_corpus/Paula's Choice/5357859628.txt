I have a newborn and am barely getting sleep. This product does make it noticeably more hydrated and brighter around my eye area. However the product balls up and pills leaving little clumps of the product which drives me crazy. I would not wear it under makeup because it will not sit nice because of the product pilling up. I’ll most likely keep the product but won’t repurchase. nan
