So far I’ve used it for 3 days and I see the texture of my face has cleared. I was very skeptical about buying This product but so far it hasn’t disappointed. I have acne prone skin and I am doing really good so far. I know some ppl said it irritated their skin I would say to start out 1 or twice a week to test the product and see what works. Don’t forget to use spf and moisturizer when using this in the daytime. Didn’t disappoint (acne prone skin)
