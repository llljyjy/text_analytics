If you have oily skin, you NEED this! Niacinamide has changed my life so much for the better. I can still have that glowy it girl look, without looking like a greasy piece of pizza. I use this everyday to help with oil production, and it sits so well under my makeup. It even claims it’s great for brightening dark spots. I haven’t had it long enough to notice any drastic changes, so stay tuned for that review. But so far, I am loving this product! Must have for oily skin!
