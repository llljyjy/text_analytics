This moisturizer is alright, but not the best. I feel like it isn’t as deeply moisturizing as other “barrier repairing“ moisturizers I’ve used. It would probably work well for people with normal or combo skin than it works for my extremely dry skin. I’m not sure if the retinol is making any difference in my skin, it’s hard to tell since it takes longer to work than other actives like AHAs and BHAs. But on the plus side, it hasn’t irritated my skin or broken me out. It’s decent enough for me to finish the bottle, but I won’t be re-purchasing it. It's decent, but not my favorite.
