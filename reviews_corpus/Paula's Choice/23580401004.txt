Okay, I NEVER write reviews, but after using this product for a week I just had to. I have had hormonal acne for over 11 years. I have tried all the pills, spent hundreds of dollars on skincare, and been on Accutane, but nothing could keep my acne away. Right before I decided to go on Accutane for the second time, I wanted to try to clear my skin with products one last time, causing me to end up purchasing this BHA. The way this stuff removed redness and cleared up my skin within two weeks was unbelievable. I did purge, but it cleared up within a few days!!! Despite having oily skin, I do have somewhat sensitive skin so I only use it every other night, and on nights when I do not use it, I use the Sunday Riley U.F.O oil (also a fantastic product). I am in shock at how well this product works. Make sure to ease your way into it though since it can be a tad harsh! Acne of 11 years gone!
