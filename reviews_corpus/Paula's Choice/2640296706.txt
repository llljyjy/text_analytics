I am obsessed with this line and have been using a couple of other products from the same line. First time trying out the foam cleanser already loving it. I love the foam formulation, which doesnâ€™t stipe my face and does work to lift any makeup residue.  It does NOT experience any irritation or dryness for my combination-sensitive skin. LOVE IT
