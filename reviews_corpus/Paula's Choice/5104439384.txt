This milky toner feels nice on the skin, light and absorbs well. But I don’t find it that hydrating. Perhaps it’s because my skin runs drier in the winter, but this toner just wasn’t doing enough for my skin, I have others that are more hydrating in my collection. I do see this being a nice one for me in the summer tho! I prefer more lightweight toners for my combo oily skin in the summer, excited to revisit this then. nan
