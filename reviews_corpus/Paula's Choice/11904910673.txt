Been loving this moisturizer! Lightweight, creamy texture that applies like a dream and sinks in easily. For my oily/combo skin, I find that it’s perfectly hydrating + moisturizing for both the colder and warmer months. A bit expensive, and haven’t seen any noticeable differences to skin brightness though, but it’s a really nice daily moisturizer. Really elegant formula!
