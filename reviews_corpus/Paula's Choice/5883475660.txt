This is a decent vitamin c serum that helps brighten uneven skin. I have combination skin and noticed that it gave my skin a nice glow boost after consistent use. It absorbs into my skin easily and quickly and has a light but not unpleasant scent. I think this is definitely worth trying if you want even-toned skin. nan
