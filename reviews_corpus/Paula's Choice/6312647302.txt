Personally, I really appreciate the products that have this type of applicator and in this way not have any type of contamination to the product.  I have been using this cream for a few weeks and I love its texture and how the skin maintains that hydration, it has a very slight fragrance, I am using the complete line of Serum and eye contour and I love the results I see on my skin day by day. nan
