This works well on my combo, sensitive skin. I love  that it doesn’t have a perfume smell - no migraine trigger. I also sometimes use it on my arms when they get a little crepey. It helps smooth the skin and keeps it silky soft. Yes, there are probably less expensive moisturizers on the market for my arms, however it doesn’t take much product and it really seems to help. Great moisturizer
