I know spf is of paramount importance for fighting signs of aging so I was happy to find this product. Besides a good mineral spf, it’s got loads of other ingredients that are good for the skin. I don’t normally wear foundation but I like that this is tinted because it camouflages the white cast that comes naturally with mineral sunscreen. This tint is clearly in the “cool” color family. My skin tone has warm undertones but the tint is subtle so it doesn’t look off on my skin. It’s just enough to disguise the white cast and to give a little smidge of color. I don’t think this would work for women with skin any darker than  “light” color unfortunately. The texture feels light. The finish is dewey but not greasy (I have slightly oily skin). The formula rubs in easily; I use my fingers. The coverage is sheer. There is no scent. Definitely recommend SPF Without the White Cast
