I was really excited to get the Paula’s choice advanced replenishing toner. I have very dry skin especially when it starts to get cold outside. The toner has hyaluronic acid in it which really helps hydrate my skin. The texture is nice and I’ve been happy so far with the results. Im excited to keep using it and see how it helps my skin even more!! Must try toner
