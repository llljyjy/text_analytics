This product works so well to calm my redness and lighten my dark spots. I have acne prone and sensitive skin, but this doesn’t break me out or irritate me. But the smell!!!! I only put it on at night and I can barely stand my own stench. It reeks like sweaty vinegar. When I was my face in the morning there’s a brown tint of film. I am so pleased with the results but I don’t know if I can repurchase due to the stank! Great results, but beware of the smell!
