My favorite product for preventing and treating my acne. My most repurchased skincare product. Don’t be afraid to use a good amount, I noticed more of a difference when I started using a considerable amount instead of a tiny dot of product which I did at first because I didn’t want to waste. I use a generous amount and it helps to prevent and reduce my acne and gives me a more even skin tone. Love it! The description of the product doesn’t tell you how much to use so you have to try it for yourself and see what works. nan
