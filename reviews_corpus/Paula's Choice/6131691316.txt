To preface, I LOVE Paula’s Choice as a brand and have gone through several serums and liquid exfoliators. Generally their products are on point both in price and ingredients but all that said, this is just not worth the money or stress. My acne-prone skin has been relatively under control for nearly 2 years and two days of using this (the only change in my routine) has broken me out beyond belief. Obviously this won’t happen to everyone but even without the break out, I wasn’t happy with this product. There are plenty of similar sunscreens on the market at a higher spf and lower cost, plus this pilled immediately as I was applying it. Again, not a problem I’ve had with other sunscreens when adding them to my skincare routine. This might work for you but honestly I wouldn’t risk spending this much money for an overpriced sunscreen that may or may not break you out. Not Worth the Risk
