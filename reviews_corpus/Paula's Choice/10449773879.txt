This is a great sunscreen! It doesn’t pill, it mattes down super well without being drying and I love how it acts like a bb cream basically - perfect for people with red acne/acne scars. The only reason I’m giving it 1 less star is because when I keep reapplying it throughout the day it starts feeling really heavy, like foundation. It’ll also come off a little bit on clothing so just be careful you don’t rub something on your face. I’m still repurchasing because tinted moisturizers are good for hyperpigmentation and it just makes my skin look so good. nan
