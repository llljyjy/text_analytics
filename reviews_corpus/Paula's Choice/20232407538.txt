I have very sensitive and dry skin which makes me scared to try any new products. Typical winter weather had my skin soo dry, flaky and peeling. I was starting to get frustrated and realized I needed to add something else to my routine because a hydrating moisturizer wasnâ€™t doing it. This worked wonders within 2-3 days. I use it every day now and can tell this helps any texture I have stay balanced. Had a pimple start and it was gone in 2 days consistently using this. Worth the hype! A little goes a long way.
