This is the first time I have tried any product from this brand. I use this vit c booster by mixing with my serum to make it more effective.  I have suffered through  dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I have used many many vitamin C products.  I love to use them in my skincare a lot and I prefer adding them into my  daily routine. I like this vitamin serum. I can mix it with my other serum or my moisturizer.  Dark spots started to get brightened. It’s nicely made with good ingredients. I think it’s worth to give it a shot as a supplement to your daily skincare. I will repurchase because I think it’s good to have such a volatile product/ supplement to have on your skincare. I have sensitive skin and I haven’t experienced any irritation at all. Recommend. nan
