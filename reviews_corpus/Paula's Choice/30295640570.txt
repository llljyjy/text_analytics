I absolutely love this Paula’s Choice Niacinamide booster!! Packed with vitamins B3, and B5 This is a must if you’re looking to refine your pores and smooth your skins texture. A little bit of this goes a long way. You can use it once or twice a day and apply it to your face and neck. I started using this twice daily and have seen result much quicker. Definitely give this a try! A must try!
