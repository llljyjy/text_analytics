I’ve used this treatment for a week. As directed on the label, I applied the cream three times in a week. I did notice some mild irritation and see peeling after my third application, which revealed firmer looking skin after a few cycles with a gentle scrub. I’d say that the product does yield the results it claims on the bottle’s packaging. My skin is very sensitive, so I’m not usually open to trying products with retinol, but I’m curious about long-term results of this cream. Excited to See Long-Term Results
