So I have been using this for about two weeks now. I am Latina so I am a little tan but still sort of on the pale side and it doesn’t leave any sort of white cast. I also have combination skin, pretty oily in my T zone but dry everywhere else. And this product feels great! Doesn’t cause any oiliness like most sunscreens do. Doesn’t make me sweat immediately like most sunscreens do. Provides the perfect amount of moisture like my old moisturizer did but with the benefit of SPF. And I don’t know if you’re like me but I honestly love the smell of sunscreen and this product does smell like it, but for me that’s a plus. Anyway, love this product! So glad I took a chance and purchased it great moisturizer with SPF!
