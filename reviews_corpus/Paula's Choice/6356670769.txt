When first trying a cleansing balm, it’s gotta pass the 4 major criteria for cleansing balms. 1.) Does it spread easily and melt away all the makeup, sunscreen, waterproof mascara? 2.)  Does it sting or make your eyes super cloudy when rubbing it over your eye makeup?  3.) Does it wash off without leaving a greasy film on your skin? and 4.) Does it break you out?This one passes all 4 of the standards for me! I’m very happy with it and plan to make this my staple cleansing balm! Passes The Cleansing Balm Test!
