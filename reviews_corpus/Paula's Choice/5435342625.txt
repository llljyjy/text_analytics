I had been struggling with severe adult hormone acne and tried everything from over the counter treatments to prescriptions and nothing worked. Just as I was about to give up I decided to try Paula Choice Clear Acne Treatment kit and I am thrilled to report I am acne free!! I use the treatment morning and night along with the niacinamide boost. Love this line of products and recommend it to anyone who has really been struggling with acne. The Extra Strength kit is what I started with and now that my acne is controlled, I use the regular strength Clear. Holy Grail! Only products that actually worked!
