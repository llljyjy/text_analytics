While I did notice some improvement in pore size with this product, any benefit was overshadowed by the product causing dry and flaking skin around my nose and chin. I have a dry skin type so this may not bean issue for everyone, but he flaking skin was new to me. I tried decreasing the amount of product, and began alternating days, then only using once a week - but the dry skin shows up after each use. I will continue to try to use the product sparingly because I did actually see some benefit to my pores. Dry Skin Types Beware
