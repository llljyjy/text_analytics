It’s ok but not miraculous by any means. I don’t think it’s a terrible value but after going through 5oz of this product and then stopping, there isn’t a big difference. Don’t get your hopes up, but not bad by any means. I’m going to compare a less expensive item. No irritation with this product, but I’m not that sensitive. not worth the hype
