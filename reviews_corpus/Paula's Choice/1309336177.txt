This is the first time I’ve used a cleansing balm in a tube and I think it’s such a great idea to get the product out.   I warm up the balm in my hands and   a little bit is all you need and it breaks down my makeup and melts it away.  It’s perfect for double cleansing and leaves my skin soft and clean. nan
