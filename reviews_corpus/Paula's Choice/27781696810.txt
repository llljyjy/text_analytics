I’m surprised there aren’t more reviews on this product! With both niacinamide and vitamin C, it’s a powerhouse of ingredients! I used it every morning before applying my spf, and noticed a HUGE change in the brightness of my skin. It is also very moisturizing - I didn’t need a moisturizer with this product and spf. I would highly recommend it! nan
