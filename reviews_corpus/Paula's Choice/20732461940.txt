By far my best sephora purchase this year. I wanted to try a vitamin C serum for a while to help with hyperpigmentation and skin texture and needed it to accommodate all of my allergies and this DELIVERED. I saw results within days and they were even better than I expected. My skin texture improved AND looks glowing. I am so impressed and happy and would recommend this to everyone. nan
