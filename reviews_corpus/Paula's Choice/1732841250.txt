As someone who suffers from sun damage and melasma, Iâ€™m always looking to incorporate vitamin c into my routine. This includes both vitamin c and a moisturizer in one product. It was lightweight, yet hydrating. I would definitely recommend this to add to anyones day time routine to brighten and protect from free radicals, while giving all day moisture Love the vitamin c / moisturizer combo!
