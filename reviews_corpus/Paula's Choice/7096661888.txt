This is a vitamin c & peptide packed creamy moisturizer that helps even skin tone, brighten skin, & boost the skin barrier. It has no scent & comes in hygienic pump packaging. I like how creamy it is & quickly melts into my skin, leaving my skin feeling plumped & hydrated. Although I havenâ€™t seen very visible brightening results, my skin barrier definitely feels a lot better & my skin is more firm. Also love how the pump packaging makes it easy to dispense, versus coming in a jar. I would recommend this product! nan
