I have finally gotten to try this raved about product! I initially loved it but skin definitely purged and was very sensitive so I had to limit to every other day, I made me nervous to continue to use but I did and it did brighten my skin but it didn’t prevent my acne I did like that it made my skin smoother and brighter. You can see my skin looks healthier in the photo I’m wearing a black shirt It made my skin glow
