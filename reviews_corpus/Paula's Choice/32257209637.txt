Well, this works. I had a bad journey with tretinoin, but i thought retinol wasn’t strong enough, but i gave it a shot to start slow again because i have dark spots and i feel under the lips a bit saggy and i tried every vitamin C or glycolic serum and nothing happened. And i started with skin cycling at least 2 weeks and then i used every 2 days. And i bought the serum Faded, so I’m using the two of them, but never the same day. And yes i felt my  skin  a stinging sensation, so i use Cicaplast from La Roche Posay before retinol over the more sensitive parts like the nose, lips and eyes, then retinol and after 20 minutes i use Tolerance lotion from avene, and i don’t like the farmacy stuff, but believe me, those stuff keep my on my retinol journey without irritation or break outs. The mineral water it is really good to keep the irritation away. So i felt in one month my skin very nice, less pores, the dark spots are amazingly cleared up, the texture is the best i had in years. So good luck and be patient and gentle with your skin. It works!
