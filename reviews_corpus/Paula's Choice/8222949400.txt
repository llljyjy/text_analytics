I think it’s a product thats trending for the moment And everyone hypes it up. Me personally it doesn’t work for me I used it for a month and it broke me out terribly. I thought maybe it will purge but nah once I stopped using it my skin cleared up. It’s a Big No for me. Indie Lee CoQ-10 toner is better. That’s probably why I only shop at Sephora for fragrance. nan
