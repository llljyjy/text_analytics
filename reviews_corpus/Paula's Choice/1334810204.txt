This Omega+ Complex Cleansing Balm by Paula’s Choice comes in a handy tube.  It is fragrance free which I love.  The texture is creamy and rich. It effortlessly removes makeup, sunscreen and all the day’s grime from my face.  It is a balm and doesn’t lather, but it cleanses so well.  It is great as a first step in double cleansing.  My skin feels great, soft, nourished and hydrated after using this product.  The product contains a complex of Omegas 3, 6 and 9.  It softens and soothes skin as it cleanses.  It is gentle enough not to disrupt the skin barrier. Key ingredients include jojoba and meadowfoam seed oils to nourish the skin. It really does melt into the skin and dissolves away makeup, oil and grime.  It rinses away easily leaving skin refreshed and clean.   I love using it in my daily skincare routine. nan
