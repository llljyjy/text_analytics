This is the most comfortable sunscreen I’ve ever used! I actually want to put it on in the morning! I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this sunscreen works perfectly for my skin. It leaves it feeling hydrated but not greasy or cakey. The sunscreen is very lightweight and blends in easily. It gives a natural dewy finish and does not highlight any of my texture. It layers well over my moisturizers and under my makeup. Such a good product! A sunscreen you’ll actually want to use!
