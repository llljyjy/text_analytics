I’ve been using this product for about a month now and I would like share my personal experience. My skin is on the dry side and I do not have sensitive skin. However, I am new to vitamin c and when using vitamin c in the past, I’ve always felt a sensation of irritation. Due to this I’ve been reluctant to included it in my skin care  routine.  I’ve decided to start back including it into my routine because vitamin c has so many benefits and I love the way it brighten my skin. My advice to many viewers is to please read the instructions, and read the questions and answers on the Paulas choice website. This formula is pretty strong for my skin. Since I am a new beginner I’ve tried this several different ways and my skin can only tolerate it when it is mixed with my serums. When I placed the formula directly into my bare skin (as if it was a serum), my skin begans to feel dry and irritated for the remainder of the day. I’ve tried to use it twice per day morning and night and I’ve experience the same skin irritation. My skin does not turn red or peel but it does feel tight and sensitive for a day or two. On the bright side, my skin absolutely looks brighten when applied directly to my skin but the con is the discomfort. Maybe at some point my skin will build a tolerance. 2-3 drops is truly the most my skin can tolerate with a serum. The formula is thin therefore it is easy to mix with serums or moisturizer. I do not too much care for packaging due to the potential of oxidation.  The benefits of this product is it does what It claims and it does brighten and provide a youthful glow. I am not sure if I would repurchase due to potency of this serum but then again maybe all vitamin c’s come with this risk of irritation. Once again, please read and follow the instructions on Paulas choice website and read the  questions and answer section so you can maximize the benefits. By the way, I’ve purchase this product with my own funds. Please read if your new to vitamin c
