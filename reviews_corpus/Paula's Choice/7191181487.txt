Paula’s choice does such a great job formulating lovely and effective skin care products. This retinol cream is a heavy treatment, but it’s comfortable, didn’t cause me any irritation or discomfort, and layers well with other skin care. As my skin continues to mature, I think this product will be a great addition to my skincare routine! nan
