An absolute must-try for those who struggle with clogged pores like me! My main skin concern is white bumps all over my cheeks and forehead, which are super stubborn and don’t disappear after exfoliating. This treatment showed visible results even after the first use. I applied a little drop on the affected areas before going to sleep and I woke up to a lot smoother skin with a few bumps being almost gone. Id highly recommend using a good moisturizer, since salicylic acid dries up the skin, btw Paula’s Choice oil free moisturizer works really well on the acne prone skin.Overall great product and does exactly what it’s supposed to. nan
