This does what it says! I only use it at night. I have oily skin and it feels too sticky to go under my make-up (I swap it out for the Tatcha Toner that goes with my routine in the AM). I cleanse and put it on. I spot treat any hyperpigmentation with vitamin C cream. It works fast and my pores are less visible. I wake with glowing smooth skin! I used to swear by the Ordinary Toner but, this just edged it out. Only complaintâ€¦ very small for the price. I am going to need to restock more often. Overnight face overhaul!!!
