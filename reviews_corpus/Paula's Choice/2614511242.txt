So great under makeup! This eye cream is creamy and blends so well under the eyes. Vitamin c helps with dark circles, I have been using for a few days and havenâ€™t noticed any too significant, but it does help brighten and feel nice under the eyes. The texture is really smooth and does give hydration and smoothness. Pretty good! nan
