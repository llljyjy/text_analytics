I don’t use alot of foaming cleansers because they are quite drying. However, I did find this product to be unique..it was not drying as other foaming cleansers and it had an amazing silky texture. And the product contains Hyaluronic acid, which is a very hydrating active ingredient I am obsessed with. A very small amount of product went a long way, so I anticipate this bottle lasting me a long time. It’s also fragrance free which is a must for me, I avoid fragrance because I have sensitive skin and I usually get red when I use products with fragrance. I am also super acne prone, so i am very picky about what I put on my face. Definitely something I’d recommend to my gal pals Definitely A Cleanser I will continue to use in my
