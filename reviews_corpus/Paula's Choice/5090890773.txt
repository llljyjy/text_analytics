Nowhere near 50 spf. Even though I like the texture of the cream, I get sunburned every time I wear it under california sun. It doesnâ€™t protect my skin AT ALL. Moreover, the packaging is not good, there was a hole in the tube and every time I squeeze, the cream comes out from two places. Nowhere near 50 SPF
