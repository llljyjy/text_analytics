This product has completely transformed my skin and I’m obsessed with it! I was super skeptical of it at first and hated it, did not notice a difference at all until I started applying it with my hands. I used to apply with a cotton pad and hated how it felt on my skin (super oily/ greasy feeling for some reason) Now I apply it with my hands as if I’m applying a moisturizer and it seems to soak into my skin a lot better. I use it everyday as part of my nighttime routine, sometimes also apply it in the morning. My skin is so smooth now and I’ve noticed a slight lifting, almost tightening effect on my face. Must buy forsure!! A must have in my routine!!
