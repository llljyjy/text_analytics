Unfortunately, this sunscreen lotion ended up making my skin breakout in multiple small red pimples all over my face on the 2nd and 3rd time I applied this. First time was fine. Guess I’m still on the hunt for a sunscreen that won’t irritate my rosacea prone and reactive skin. my skin didn't like this
