I’ve used other products with niacinamide before that I’ve really enjoyed, but this was just not it for me. With every application, I would find more tiny whiteheads on my face (particularly around my nose). The liquid was also much too thin for my liking; I prefer more viscous fluids so I have more control over where it’s applied. Unfortunately this product just did not agree with my skin, so I couldn’t use it for longer than a week. Broke out in tiny whiteheads
