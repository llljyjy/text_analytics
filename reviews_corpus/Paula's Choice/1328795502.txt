I have been using this very sparingly as it seems like my skin is a bit sensitive to it, also since it contains salicylic acid. At first I started using it every other day, but I think that was a bit too often for my sensitive skin so now I lowered it to once a week. I haven’t seen any major improvements yet, but hopefully I’ll see more results soon. This is probably better suited for acne prone skin nan
