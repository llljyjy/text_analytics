Not one to write a review but I’ve been shopping at Sephora for 10+ years. I was recommended this product in store by sales associate for having large pores around my nose and on my chin. I have very sensitive skin and I wanted to make sure with her that my sensitivity on my skin wouldn’t be a factor while using this product. Two days after buying it I tried it for the first time while following the instructions and making sure my face was cleanse that I use to clean cotton pad and it broke out my chin instantly. If you have dry skin or SENSITIVE SKIN DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I’m so upset and returning asap. don’t use if you have sensitive skin.
