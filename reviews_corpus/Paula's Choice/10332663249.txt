I was really excited to start this product since everyone is raving about it on tik tok. I used it for about a week, and it broke me out drastically. At first I thought it was purging, but my skin was burning and very irritating looking (if that makes sense). Once I stopped using, my skin cleared up. So sad this item did not work for me. nan
