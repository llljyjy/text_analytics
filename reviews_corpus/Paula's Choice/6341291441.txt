Was nice at first and the retinol part of this definitely worked. However, I think the soybean oil was too comedogenic for my combo skin. Plus, I wound up having to use this with another moisturizer because it wound up still not being moisturizing enough. Not horrible but not the greatest retinol product out there, maybe works better for someone with smaller pores. nan
