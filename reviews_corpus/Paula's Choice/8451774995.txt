Really thick and creamy texture. It made a nice foamy lather and cleansed very easily. It was also very gentle. My skin didn’t’ feel super stripped after using this cleanser. It felt like it took a lot to wash it off but that could be because I used too much cleanser, so a little goes a long way! I really love it and think it’s perfect for everyday use. Gentle and effective
