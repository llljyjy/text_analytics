This eye cream had a thicker texture than I was expecting but that’s not a bad thing. I found the formula to be really nourishing and it didn’t irritate my sensitive eyes. Normally I use my vitamin c products in the morning only but this has a nice weight to it that makes it appropriate for both morning and night. Nice weight for both morning and night
