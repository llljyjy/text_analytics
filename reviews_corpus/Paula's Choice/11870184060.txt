This is definitely the best vitamin c serum I’ve ever used. Vitamin C was always something I tried to incorporate into my routine because I know I’m supposed to but I had never really seen enough of a difference in my skin to keep it in rotation. Until this one! First of all, it is a perfectly watery formula that soaks right in and isn’t sticky. It also has a pleasant smell. My skin only after a few uses looked noticeably smoother, brighter, and the few red acne marks I have are fading much quicker than they normally do. This will definitely stay a part of my morning routine. nan
