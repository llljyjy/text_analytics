I absolutely love this moisturizer and it has quickly become my favorite Vitamin C moisturizer. I use it in the evenings at the end of my skincare routine. The texture is luxurious and fast absorbing, and leaves my skin looking fresh and radiant. I wake up with supple, glowing skin. I’ve noticed better overall texture as well! Perhaps best of all, it doesn’t have the strong icky smell I associate with a lot of Vitamin C products. Highly recommend!! Radiant and supple skin!
