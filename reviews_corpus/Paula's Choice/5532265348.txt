This product was gifted to me by Paula’s Choice. Honestly, I wanted to love this product but haven’t been wow’d by yet. It’s lightweight, the Vitamin C doesn’t seem to bother my eyes, and it absorbs into the skin quickly. However, I haven’t noticed any difference in the color of my undereyes over the last month. Don’t hate it, don’t love it. Meh, not wow'd
