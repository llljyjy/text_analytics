I unfortunately received this product late and am unable to do a full 2 week use review, but I did use this product consistently for one week. Although it’s small, I did definitely notice a difference in the darkness of my under eyes. Im using this product at a point where Im really busy and not getting as much sleep, so I was able to notice the difference a lot more! I also do think I experienced a little more hydration under my eyes. The product itself is a nice consistency, applies smoothly, doesn’t have any sort of weird feeling after application. I think this is overall a good product and Im excited to see how things look in another week! nan
