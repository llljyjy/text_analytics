I wanted to try this because I had some texture issues and was hoping this would even them out but instead I hadn’t worst breakout in years. I thought if I kept using it, that was just my skin purging and it would turn around but 3 months later it’s not the case. I stopped using it and am now working to repair my skin barrier. My esthetician told me it’s absolutely destroyed right now and this product was too harsh. It might work for others but it just harmed my skin. Please be careful using this, it’s not easy on the skin. nan
