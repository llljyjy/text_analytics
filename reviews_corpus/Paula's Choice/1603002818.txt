This is fine. Very liquid viscosity and doesn’t leave skin too oily (for me at least). I’ve been using SPFs from Korean brands that are also very liquidy like this one, so I didn’t mind it. I’m pretty sure this is meant to be scentless but it does have a smell. Not terrible but also would rather have a scent than for it to smell like it does. nan
