I have been loving this eye cream so far! I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks at night and when I’m not wearing makeup and my eyes have been SIGNIFICANTLY less puffy. My dark circles have also brightened. I have noticed that this does not sit well under make up though. Helps so much with my puffy eyes!
