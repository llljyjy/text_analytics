I have acne prone skin and this product has a creamy/cloudy consistency. It doesn’t leave a white residue and it isn’t tacky/sticky. A little goes a long way. I haven’t used it long enough to see long term benefits but overall I have been enjoying it.  It doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I enjoyed it!
