I wanted to love this! And with so many good reviews I thought I’d give it a shot, especially usually having good luck with this brand. Unfortunately it’s been breaking me out and making me very blotchy. I tried it on more than one occasion to make sure it was this product doing it, and it was. Still on the search for the perfect sunscreen! Didn’t work for my sensitive skin
