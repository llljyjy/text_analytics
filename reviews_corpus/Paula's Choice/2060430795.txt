I’m on my second bottle of this. There is nothing life changing about this toner other than it is really basic and safe for the skin barrier, and that’s why I like it. There are no frills. It does what it says it’s supposed to do. The first thing I want to put on my skin after washing is something to restore my skin barrier, and then I can follow up with any active ingredients in other products afterward. It’s just a safe choice and nourishing for the skin. I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated my skin, and it’s why I will keep repurchasing. basic and safe option for skin barrier
