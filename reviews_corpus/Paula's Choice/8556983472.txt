Best daily sunscreen I’ve tried for my super oily skin. It’s moisturizing when applied and dries down quickly to a perfect matte finish. I’m almost 40, and I don’t have to wear eye cream under this at all. It keeps me matte throughout the day, even in the 110 degree humid TX summer. Zero breakouts. This makes my skin look like I’m wearing a blurring primer. It’s gorgeous for no-makeup days. The tint keeps it from looking white, but I’m pretty fair skinned. For reference, I wear Light-Medium Sand in Tarte & C3 in Mac. If you have darker skin than me, I can definitely see this causing a white cast. Can handle super oily skin in TX summer
