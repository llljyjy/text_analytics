I was so exited to try this product as it has such amazing reviews but unfortunately it broke me out REALLY bad. I’ve used multiple different niacinamide serums so I was super surprised to have such a severe reaction but it was really bad. My entire face broke out in tons of pimples. I know sometimes your skin can purge when you start using a new products so I tried to use it for multiple days before writing it off but unfortunately it just wasn’t right for me. That being said - Everyone’s skin is different and just because it didn’t work for me doesn’t mean it won’t work for you. I wanted to love it but it gave me severe acne
