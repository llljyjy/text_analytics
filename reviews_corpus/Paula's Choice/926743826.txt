This serum is working! I’m new to it, so I may have to follow up after I’ve been using it longer. It’s been a few weeks of regular use (3-5 times a week at night), and I can tell my texture is improving. I am48, and have normal skin, but unfortunately have OCD and tend to pick at my pores, which has really damaged my skin. I’ve stopped picking, and want to repair, so I have been experimenting w serums. I alternate this with either Tara Harper serum, or a Good Molecules hyaluronic acid serum. I’ve only noticed mold purging of skin, no major breakouts from this product. Skin is gradually smoothing and glowing more! Serum is working!
