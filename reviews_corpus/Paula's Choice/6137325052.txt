This product was sent by Paula’s choice for review purposes only. I like how this product came in a pump so I didn’t have to dig all my fingers in a jar. I also like the gel texture. It wasn’t too thin or thick. It absorbed well into my skin and there was no irritation. I’m not sure if it helped with my skin texture or the brightness of my skin tone but my skin did feel hydrated after using. Nice moisturizer!
