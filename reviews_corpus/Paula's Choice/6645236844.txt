I’m in my late 60s and my face has such uneven texture that has been almost impossible to smooth out. Feels dry and flaky and rough on forehead, chin, edges of cheeks. Charcoal masques and any masque to be honest, and course textured face wash never touched it.I used this ONCE at night after cleansing my face and it’s like I have brand new skin.  it’s soft and smooth and much more comfortable feeling.

I’m waiting to see what it does with wrinkles, only been using it for less than a week. This smooths out skin where other products failed
