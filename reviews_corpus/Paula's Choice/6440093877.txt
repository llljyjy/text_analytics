only used 3 times and returned! since it’s an airless pump, I had to hold it upside down just go get anything out. the first time I used it it took over 5 minutes plus some googling to figure out why it wasn’t coming out. once it did it squirted out and was not consistent in dispensing. took it back for the belif eye cream instead. poor packaging design
