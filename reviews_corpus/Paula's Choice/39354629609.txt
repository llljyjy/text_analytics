This new moisturizer from Paula’s Choice has been my go-to lately. It has a multi-active Vitamin C that combines proven hydration with anti aging properties. It’s a lightweight gel cream texture and it is supposed to help brighten the skin and get rid of any skin dullness. It does exactly that! My skin after the first 5 days instantly looked more bright and refreshed. My skin feels more soft and plump. It also isn’t harsh on the skin and it also helped repair my barrier when I damaged it. If you’re looking for a good everyday moisturizer that has vitamin C then you will love this one. Best Vitamin C moisturizer!
