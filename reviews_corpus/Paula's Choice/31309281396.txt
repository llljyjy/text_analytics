I love this product! I have been moving for the past week and my skin has been so dull, dry, and I just have been breaking out badly.  I used this a few nights in a row and it definitely helped with texture and the redness of my flare ups. Also itâ€™s very gentle on the skin! Gentle for an exfoliant!
