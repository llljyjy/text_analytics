I recently bought this product and it’s been 16 hours since I first used the exfoliant. I already feel a change in my skin texture, so dramatic it’s visible. My skin is more even and glowy. The texture and consistency of the exfoliant is great and super easy to apply with hands. There is 2 things preventing it from a 5 star. The first is the smell. It smells horrid like hydrogen peroxide. I don’t mind too much but I hate the smell. Second is the instructions on the bottle. I’ve seen so many people talking about the fact that the bottle says to use twice a day which to me is crazy. I plan on using this no more then twice a week as it is a chemical exfoliant which should be used lightly. Despite that I loved this product and it will be my go to exfoliant from now on. LOVE! Immediate Results!!
