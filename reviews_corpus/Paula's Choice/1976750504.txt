This Niacinamide Booster is a great addition to my winter skincare routine. I’m a big fan of layering on products when necessary to give my skin that extra boost of hydration. Since this is a newer treatment for my skin, I’ve only been applying this at night. I apply this after my toner and before my serum and night cream. Great Addition to My Skincare Routine
