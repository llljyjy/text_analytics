Love the overall ingredients that helps even out the skin. This product also  leaves your your skin skin hydrated and radiating. Not greasy at all and pretty lightweight for a cream. I have sensitive skin and have yet to experience any issues with it. I perennially like it more as.a day time moisturizer layered with SPF as I prefer a heavier cream at night. Just wished you got a more product at the price point. Skin brightening & hydrating.
