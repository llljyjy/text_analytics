I’ve been curious about adding niacinamide to my skincare routine so this one seemed like an exciting addition to my routine. I use this in the morning before moisturizer. I love how this sinks into my skin and doesn’t leave a tacky feel. So far I can’t say I’ve seen a huge difference after two weeks, but I’ve enjoyed using it and can’t wait to see continued results! Great Into To Niacinamide!
