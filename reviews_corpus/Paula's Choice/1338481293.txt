I’ve been using this on days when I don’t use tretinoin. It is very lightweight and skinks into the skin almost immediately. I do need a few more than 2-3 drops to cover my entire face. It does not sting my face, and doesn’t interfere with any of my other skincare products. I see a slight brightening effect, hope to see more of a chance with continued use. I do wish this was a bit more viscous and that it could be pumped out rather than a dropper, I feel like it would be less messy this way.  Given that there is no irritation, I’ll continue to use and hoping for better results after I get through the bottle. Non irritating and layers well
