I have heard so many great things about Paulaâ€™s Choice skincare and was excited to try this Vitamin C Moisturizer. I have used skincare with Vitamin C in the past and love the results of this moisturizer. After giving this particular product, I noticed my skin looked brighter, smoother and firm! The consistency of the product is very creamy and absorbs into my skin very well leaving it feeling very hydrated. I would recommend this product! nan
