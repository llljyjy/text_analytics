Now this is my all time holy grail for acne. I’ve bought more than 10 products from the Ordinary and the Inkey List, desperately trying to get rid of my acne. Not to hate on those products because they did help my acne in someway, but this product is just on another level. I’ve been so insecure for the past couple of years regarding my t-zone acne, but thanks to this, I’ve been this confident in my own skin. I usually NEVER write a review but I felt so overwhelmingly happy that I bought this product so I just had to. Finally I don’t have to spend 20 minutes every morning trying to put layers of thick concealer and foundation over my pimples, and be sick to my stomach over the thought of going out cakey. I don’t know if using this will have a long-term effect, but I am beyond satisfied and was able to resolve so much of my acne-prone, oily, textured skin. my HOLY GRAIL
