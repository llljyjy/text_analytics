I have tried many Paula’s Choice products over the years and they have never disappointed me and this is no exception! I love this stuff so much. I am very prone to redness on my chin due to acne and this has been a life saver. It has really helped to calm down my skin and reduce much of the redness that I deal with. It sinks into my skin very easily and doesn’t pill with my other skincare products. My skin has not had a bad reaction to it at all or peeled because of it. I think this product is gentle yet very effective and I noticed results immediately. Amazing!!
