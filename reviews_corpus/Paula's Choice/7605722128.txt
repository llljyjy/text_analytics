WOW. Just WOWWWW. Only been using for a few days, literally a FEW DAYS. I use it at night and in the morning, and I already have a dark spot that’s been bothering me for soo long fading. My skin is also sooo soft and smooth and just all around looks SO MUCH BETTER. I only bought the $11 bottle bc I didn’t wanna waste money on another product that didn’t work but I regret that decision now. This stuff is literally amazing. I just put it straight on my skin like a serum and then rub it in w my fingers. Amazing. Will be buying again and again and again. SPEECHLESS!!!!
