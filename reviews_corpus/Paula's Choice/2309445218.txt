Niacinamide is known to help with pores and texture, and I was excited to see how it would change my skin. This serum is watery, so be careful of dripping and wasting the product! It is meant to be used alone or layered with other serums, hence why it is so watery. I do notice the scars on my face have lightened since starting this product! nan
