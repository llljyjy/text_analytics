the retinol was what initially attracted me to this product. i’ve never even heard of bakuchiol, but after reading more about it, i became more eager to try this. i’ve been using it once a week so my skin can get used to this new addition to my skincare routine. i haven’t noticed much of a difference except for my skin feeling softer. i’m more intrigued to see what the results are long-term. nan
