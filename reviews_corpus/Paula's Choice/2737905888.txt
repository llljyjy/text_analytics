Spoke to my dermatologist about this product today and she was happy to hear I was using this! So far, I notice a smoother complexion. I like the velvet and light texture of this moisturizer. It soaks into the skin in a very lightweight feel but not jelly-like, which I appreciate. Iâ€™m excited to continue trying this! So far so good!
