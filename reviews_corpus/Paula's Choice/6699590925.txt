About 3 months ago, I went off of curology treatments (if you don’t Know what that is, it’s a subscription company that makes prescription creams catered to your skin). The products contained 2% of Azelaic Acid, Niacinamide, and Clindamycin. Pretty intense prescription compared to the Paula’s choice. After I stopped using curology, I noticed I was getting tiny blind pimples on my forehead and chin, so I decided to look in on some treatments. I heard this was good so I have been trying it for a little over a month. Maybe my skin is just immune now to gentler prescription, but this didn’t really do a whole lot for me.  My face hasn’t gotten worse or anything, more no huge improvements. Also,  not a huge fan of the texture it leaves on my face. It’s very oily and… almost sandy? I am going to try Sunday Riley’s UFO oil now. not a huge fan?
