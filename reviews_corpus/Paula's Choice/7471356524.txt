I’ve really been enjoying this eye cream and am excited to continue to use. Looooove that it comes as a pump and that I don’t have to dip my finger into a jar. The consistency feels like a gel cream and applies very nicely to the under eyes. Leaves them looking and feeling very hydrated. It wears beautifully under makeup and I’ve had zero issues with it pilling and there has been zero irritation. As far as the smoothing and brightening claims, I have yet to notice any immediate results after using it for a little over a week but am excited and hopeful to continue use. Leaves eyes looking and feeling hydrated.
