Huge fan of Paula’s choice- I’ve been using their azelaic acid booster for years now and my skin loves it so I’m super excited for this retinol serum though it is ok the pricier end. I love that it has both retinol and bakuchiol, which works better together. Great smooth and easy to spread consistency and No sensitivity from my skin so far! Love the retinol and bakuchiol blend
