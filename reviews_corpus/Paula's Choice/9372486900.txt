This moisturizer was nice. To be honest, it’s not my end all be all moisturizer or product from Paula’s Choice, but overall, it’s a good, solid option. I would love to see how this helps my skin over a longer time period, as I only got to test the product a few times before making this review. I like that it’s lightweight, it’s scent free, and it’s hydrating and brightening. Good, solid Moisturizer!
