This is a very nice eye cream! Doesn’t feel sticky or greasy, makes my under eyes feel plump and look brightened. I don’t have extremely problematic under eyes to begin with, so I can’t speak to how this preforms for super dark circles or extreme dryness, but I do have some dryness around my eyes that this has remedied nicely in the time I’ve used it! Nice Everyday Eye Cream
