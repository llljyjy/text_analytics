This is a really nice booster serum. I have never tried azelaic acid until now and it has helped my skin a lot! I have normal to dry skin that can look dull, and also have somewhat large pores around my nose. After using this for two weeks, I can see brighter looking, smoother skin overall!It has a silky creamy consistency that absorbs instantly, and I love the brightening ingredients like licorice root and azelaic acid mixed with salicylic acid to take care of redness and blemishes.I have hormonal breakouts every month and they always leave red marks and this product really helps diminish the appearance of that redness (see before and after picture)It layers well with other products and I love wearing it before makeup since it really smooths my skin, and most of the time I donâ€™t even need to wear foundation. Overall I love this product! Great for roughness and redness
