I have slight texture sometimes on my jawline and around my nose and love to use this maybe once a week to clean up the surface of my skin. I don’t use a cotton swab, I’ll actually apply directly to my hand and pat into skin before my serums. Don’t love the scent but doesn’t bother me. Doesn’t bother my sensitive skin either. nan
