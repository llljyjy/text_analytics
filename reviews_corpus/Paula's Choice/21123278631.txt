I love the Skin Perfecting BHA 9 Treatment from Paulaâ€™s Choice. I used this product for a few days and already see a difference in my skin.I love that it helps improve the appearance enlarged of stubborn skin concerns such as enlarged or clogged pores, bumps, and patches of rough, dry skin. Salicylic Acid works so well for my skin because it is acne prone and this treatment delivers a controlled, sustained release of salicylic acid. The most noticeable change ive noticed is my skin appears smoother. I use it as my last step at night and my skin has consistently looked better in the morning. Amazing!
