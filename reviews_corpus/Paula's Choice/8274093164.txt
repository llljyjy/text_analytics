Love this stuff!! I have super dry, acne prone skin and this product keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It really isn’t a “typical” scrub and I use it every evening to take off whatever is left of my makeup and SPF from the day (then follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is clean). Overall, I will continue to repurchase! nan
