I love to use it am and pm! The texture is creamy yet it absorbs into my skin easily. I love that it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I also like that it doesn’t have any odd smell unlike other moisturizer with vitamin c. The packaging is awesome. I just need 2 pumps to cover my whole face and neck. Every time I wake up, it makes my skin super hydrated and smooth! I definitely recommend this to anyone! Great vit c moisturizer
