I’ve had great success with this product! My skin is oily, combination, with occasional dry patches when the air is dry, but this product is definitely for oily skin. I had to try this product for a month or so to get results of reduced acne, but it was well worth it. I pair this with their Clear Toner, BHA, niacinamide serum, and moisturizer AM/PM, sometimes including AHA. This routine significantly improved my acne, skin texture and tone. I haven’t had issues with combining any of the above Paula’s Choice products, but I spot tested my skin before using them all in the same routine, everyone’s skin is different! I recommend Paula’s Choice as a whole, it’s just down to finding the correct product for your needs! 100% Recommend
