Real bang for your buck for the trio. I have terrible blackheads and I got the mini Paula’s choice exfoliant before I bought this kit and i didn’t feel much difference with that by itself but decided to give it another try because I have dark upper lip hyperpigmentation and I had seen reviews about how the Azeliac acid booster helps with that and I’ve really seen a positive difference. My skin feels so smooth! I do hot yoga and both the exfoliate and booster have kept my skin clear when I see a breakout happening. I use it twice a day. I do have to say however that I have not messed with the retinol much. I used it once and it made me breakout and I am not very confident with using it. It says to really be careful and slowly introduce it to your routine but it’s really not my vibe so if anyone wants it, I can just send you mine. This is my second kit. You get the 4oz exfoliate and the acid booster cheaper that way. I’ll update with my bottles are empty. Good luck with your skin journey y’all. The booster is a game changer.
