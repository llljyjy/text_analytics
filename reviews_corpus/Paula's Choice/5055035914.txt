I am no newbie to Azelaic acid, so I was very excited to try this out! It’s not harsh on my skin and I can see a bit of clearness in my skin having only used this a week. I’m very excited to follow up with the results. The consistency is thin and can be used alone or mixed with your moisturizer! Clear skin
