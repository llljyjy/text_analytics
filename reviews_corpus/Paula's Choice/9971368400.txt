This is one of the best face cleansers I’ve tried! It doesn’t strip your skin if it’s moisture, instead it just removes left over makeup and oil that was produced throughout the day. I have very oily skin, so it’s amazing when I’m able to find face wash that does not completely dry my skin out, but remove all my natural oils and leaving my skin feeling smooth. Absolutely amazing!
