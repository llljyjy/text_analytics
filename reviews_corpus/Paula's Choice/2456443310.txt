Works very well with the perfectly balanced foaming cleanser, leaves my oily skin feeling hydrated but never too moisturized. I like how it takes off the last bit of spf at night. Has improved my skin tone and helped get that nice glow. My only gripe, and the reason I take off a star, is that the bottle is too small for the price. I go through one of these every six weeks — just not long enough for the price tag for Paula’s Choice. Usually her products are a better deal than this. nan
