I’ve used it for only 2 weeks but love having Niacinamide as part of my skin care routine. I’ve noticed just a few drops will treat my face and neck and within the 2 weeks I’ve been using it, the Dark spots on my skin have gotten lighter and the texture on my face has faded a bit. Great addition to my skincare routine
