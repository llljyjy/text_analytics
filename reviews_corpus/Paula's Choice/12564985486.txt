Wow! This is the best moisturizer I’ve used in a long time. A little goes a long way and instantly soaks into your skin. This doesn’t leave a sticky residue like some moisturizers. The texture of this is a lightweight gel. My pores look smaller and my face looks and feels hydrated. This also has not broke me out, which is huge! I will definitely repurchase! So good!
