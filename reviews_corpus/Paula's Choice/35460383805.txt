Paula’s Choice have amazing products I’m so glad I got to try there moisturizer. Especially hoped it would help my uneven skin tone and dullness. I’m barely getting into skincare and love this product it always leaves a perfect glow to my skin. So hydrated and moisturized. When applying it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling I lightly cover my face with a small amount and love using it day or night . Beautiful Glow
