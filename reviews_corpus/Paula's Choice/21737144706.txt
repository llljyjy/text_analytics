I’ve been using this product for months and it hasn’t done anything for my skin. I heard great things from the employees at Sephora so I thought I would try it, and they told me that it just takes time. Well it’s been a while and still nothing, maybe it’s just my skin, just disappointing. Did absolutely nothing :(
