I’ve been using this for years and it allows my powder foundation to glide on evenly. I’m not a fan of liquid concealer since it sinks into pores and fine lines, but this sunscreen paired w powder foundation actually gives that flawless, “filtered” finish.  I have oily skin that’s dry (so frustrating) and this def takes care of the oil without drying my skin out. Doubles as a primer!
