I have used this daily for the last few weeks, I haven’t noticed any major differences but it does make my skin feel soft and moisturised. I don’t think you get Alot for your money, I bought this for less than half price and personally wouldn’t pay much more. Overall I would still recommend people give it a go if you use retinol products. Worth a try
