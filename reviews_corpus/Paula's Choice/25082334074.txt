I have been a long-time Paula’s Choice fan. This one has a great lotion consistency, which feels moisturizing on its own but not too heavy. Of course, with any retinol products I will pair it will a good moisturizer. I like the combination of retinol and bakuchiol, and this one doesn’t feel irritating on my skin at all. I followed the instruction of starting slow and building up the tolerant to it, and my skin has adjusted well. nan
