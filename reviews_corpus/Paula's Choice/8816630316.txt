This moisturizer was so lightweight and gentle on my skin and letâ€™s not forget the hydration it gave my skin. I also noticed an improvement in my hyperpigmentation over the past couple of weeks using it. The packaging is simple with the pump applicator and one pump is plenty. Toned down hyperpigmentation and acne scars!!!
