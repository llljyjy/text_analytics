I have combination skin with large pores and texture on my nose and cheeks.  I have been using this for 6 months and see no difference in my skin.  I was really hoping this would work for me, but I canâ€™t see a difference in my skin when I use it.  The one good thing about it was that it did not irritate my skin and it was gentle enough to use every night. Not worth it
