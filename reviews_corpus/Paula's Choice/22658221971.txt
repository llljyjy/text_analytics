I received this in exchange for my honest thoughts. During Winter my skin tends to feel extra tight and dry so I was excited to try this toner. It has a light and watery texture that absorbs quickly with no detected scent. It feels soothing upon contact and instantly offers my skin a boost of hydration. So soothing!
