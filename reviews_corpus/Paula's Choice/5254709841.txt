So I bought this about 2 days ago, which I know isn’t a lot of time, BUT I have seen amazing results so far. I got this as a sample in my Ipsy bag and been obsessed ever since. I have large pores, oily and acne prone skin, with alot of texture! I’ve only been using it at night and I’ve seen a pore difference and smoother skin overall. I notice I wake up to smooth, clear skin. If you have dry skin this might make it a little more dry but if you have a good serum and moisturizer you should be good! love it!
