I was so looking forward to this eye cream since it’s my second product from Paula’s Choice and everyone raves about the brand. The eye cream feels great, very soothing and applies smoothly and easily. But the biggest con with this is the scent. It definitely has a strong vitamin C burnt smell that I could still smell hours later that deters me from using it. I don’t know if I’ll get used to it to continue using it to see its full effects sadly. nan
