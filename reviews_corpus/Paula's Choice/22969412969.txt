I’ve gone through 3 bottles of this stuff now and it is life changing. No more pores, blackheads, or texture. If I ever do get a little breakout, this helps reduce and heal it within days. I would recommend integrating it once a couple times a week, and then slowly incorporating it more and more. I’m at a point where I use it morning and night and I don’t get any irritation, just a soft even complexion. loves it My holy grail product
