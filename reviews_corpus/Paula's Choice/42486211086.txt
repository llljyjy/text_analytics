To be totally honest, this is the very BEST vitamin c moisturizer I have ever tried! Most do not hydrate my dry skin like I need but this keeps my skin so hydrated and seriously plumps it out! I’m seeing some of my weird dark spots starting to lighten already which is crazy good! It soaks in and leaves my skin feeling so soft. Seems like it’s an all in one, plumping my wrinkles, lightening dark spots, and hydrating so well! Just try it! Absolutely LOVE!!!
