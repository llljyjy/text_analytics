I decided to purchase this after reading the reviews and knowing the ingredients in this serum are effective in lightening dark spots. In conjunction with using other serums that help lighten dark spots like vitamin c, AHAs, and retinol, I am convinced incorporating this into my skincare routine has lightened these two pesky sun spots on my cheek that were annoying me. I used to have to layer on more concealer or bb cream on the spots to cover them but now I need one layer to diffuse and cover them well. The key to this product and any other for the matter is to be consistent and GIVE IT TIME. Be good about exfoliation (not too much and not too little), serum usage, moisturizing, and sunscreen during the day, rain or shine. nan
