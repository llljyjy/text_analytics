It really did help minimize my black heads and pores on my nose, chin, and cheeks! When I first started using this I was applying once a day everyday but I eventually realized it was drying out my skin and irritating it a little bit. For reference I have dry, patchy red skin that’s a little sensitive. I decided to start only using it once or twice a week and all those issues went away! Don’t overdue it with this product even if your excited seeing the results, you might damage your moisture barrier. I follow up the toner with essence, a serum, and then moisturizer! don’t overdue it!
