I always get random breakouts on the apples of my cheeks, so I started using this exfoliant at night and bam, breakouts have subsided significantly. However, over the past 5 days, my breakouts have exploded! Normally I’ll get one or two zits pop up at a time, but I’ve got like 5 on one cheek and 2 on the other. What the heck! I’m hoping it’s a coincidence, but it seems odd that I’ve never had this problem before. I’ll keep using it in hopes that it’s just a coincidence! 4 weeks of daily use
