This is excellent, but not something that would be a part of my daily routine. I found it can be strong, but can cause redness and drying if applied too frequently. For my purpose, 2 times per week at bedtime is probably about right for maintenance. Maybe increase to 3 times per week if I am having troublesome breakouts. nan
