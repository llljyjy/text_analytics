While I really like the texture of this eye cream upon application, it doesn’t seem to fully absorb into my skin and just sits there until it’s pills and rubs off. At first I thought I was using too much, be even with less than a pea sized amount (for both eyes), it still happens. I’m going to keep trying to get this to work because I like the ingredients and hope it’ll eventually lighten my under eye circles. 3.5/5 It’s okay.
