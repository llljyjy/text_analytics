I purchased this moisturizer because I really like other PC products, and I wanted to begin to introduce retinol in my routine and this moisturizer had a really low concentration that I thought would be good for my first time. Iâ€™m SO glad I bought this and have repurchased several times since, I apply at PM and by the morning my skin is baby soft, any irritation/pimples are noticeably reduced, and my milia has completely smoothened. LOVE!
