I used to use some drugstore brand Benzoyl Peroxide treatment that was 5% but it was discontinued. I’ve had a great experience with the Paula’s Choice Chemical exfoliator so I decided to try this. I work it into my skin care rotation about twice/three times a week. It’s great; I actually broke out a few days ago after heavy makeup usage, I washed a few nights in a row with this and it has helped clear my (cystic) acne so much! Painful pumps are much less swollen and getting better daily. Great
