This is best sunscreen I’ve ever used! I have oily, acne prone skin and most sunscreens break me out. I’ve never had an issue with this one. It is super lightweight yet also hydrating but not too heavy. You won’t feel greasy after applying which is a huge bonus. It sinks into the skin beautifully. I can’t recommend this enough! nan
