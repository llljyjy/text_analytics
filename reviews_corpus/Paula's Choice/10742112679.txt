i honestly hated this product when i first started using it, it would dry my skin out and leave it a flakey mess so i would have to layer 2 moisturizers on the day after using but after a couple uses my skin started becoming used to it and have now been using it once/ twice a week for 6 months and have not gone back!! highly recommended to all my friends and had helped their skin concerns aswell. dont give up on it
