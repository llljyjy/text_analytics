Paula’s Choice makes great skin care that really works. Out of all acids, azelaic acid is my favorite. I see a difference in my really quickly yet it is a gentle acid for my skin. Some other acids irritate or make my skin red, but not this one. This product feels very comfortable on the skin and works great with the rest of my skincare. It’s one of my must haves. nan
