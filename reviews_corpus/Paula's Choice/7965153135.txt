I normally don’t write reviews but I feel like I need to speak up on this since the reviews are so low. I have combo to oily, acne prone skin, & live in a humid climate. I don’t wear makeup on a daily basis but I like a matte finish. This moisturizer keeps my skin balanced with a matte finish all day, no need for powder or matte primers. I’ve gone through plenty of bottles & haven’t had issues with the pump yet. The only thing I would say I don’t like is that you can’t see what you have left in the bottle so it’s hard to gage when you’re running out. I like it
