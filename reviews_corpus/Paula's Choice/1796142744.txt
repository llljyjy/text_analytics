I haven’t used this vitamin c long enough to see if it works well but the dropper has already annoyed me so many times. Vitamin c isn’t stable so I really don’t understand it when companies don’t put a pump with their vitamin c. I hope they change it soon cause the actual product seems promising. The texture is a light liquid and dries sticky on the face. Great Consistency Horrible Dropper
