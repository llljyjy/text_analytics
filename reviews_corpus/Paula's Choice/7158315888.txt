I have used this since the beginning of this year (2022) and have loved it. The work it has done to my pours is amazing however, I decided this time to just order a mini because unfortunately money was a little tight, for $25 dollars I would expect the “mini” to be a little bigger then what I received. What a waste save your money and just order the regular size for $10 more.. nan
