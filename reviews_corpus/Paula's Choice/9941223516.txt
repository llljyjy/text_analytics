I have probably repurchased this 10 times. This is the perfect sunscreen for my oily acne prone skin. It does not make my skin break out, it controls my oils without making me look flat or dry, and it gives a lovely tint that helps blur imperfections. This is the only product I use on my skin in the morning after cleansing and itâ€™s become my sunscreen/moisturizer/primer/base product all in one. Do yourself a favor and try it! Holy grail
