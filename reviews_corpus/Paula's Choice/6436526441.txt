Since this is a concentrated leave-on BHA exfoliant with salicylic acid, I wasn’t sure what to expect but I’m hooked after just one use! It helps to improve the appearance of pores and is great for those patches of dry skin some of us on colder climates may experience in the winter months. I love the texture an can’t wait to see what this does for my milia! So good!
