I tried a sample of this for about a week 1/2.  I use retinol for the anti-wrinkle benefits but mainly I use retinol for my milia which pops up if I don’t regularly exfoliate. This made practically no difference to my mila. I used a light amount with a soothing oat serum underneath to help with the irritation and it still made my skin a little more irritated and drier than normal. It also had a very medicinal chemical smell. I noticed a slight difference in the suppleness of my skin but that’s about it. Overrated
