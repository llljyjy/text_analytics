Decided to try this after running out of the retinol I previously used and I’m glad I made the switch. I don’t use it on my whole face, just on the wrinkles I want to smooth (smile lines, around the eye) and dark circles under my eyes, and have seen results after ~2 weeks. I also recently began using it on the stubborn dark scars on my legs from shaving and they’re fading faster. I like how this has added vitamin c which helps fade scars and works well with the retinol to stimulate collagen production. At 1%, this retinol is stronger and more effective than others I’ve tried, but the redness/peeling was not bad for me. I started using it on my face 3x a week at first, then every night. It can be drying, especially if you’re newer to retinols, so recommend moisturizing after and avoid combining or layering it with other strong ingredients like AHAs, BHAs, etc. I like how the product is mostly odorless and doesn’t feel sticky or make my skin look greasy. Definitely buying again! effective retinol with multiple use cases
