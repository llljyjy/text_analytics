This is one of my favorite foaming cleansers! It has a creamy consistency when you pump it out of the bottle and lathers up very well into a nice foam. It is gentle enough to not strip the skin and leaves my skin feeling hydrated after cleansing. I never feel dry or tight. You can use this as a first cleanse or a second cleanse. When I wear a ton of make up. I will use it after using a micellar water when I’m in a rush I will use it on its own. It’s fragrance free and such a great size that last me a while I highly recommend this cleanser. Favorite foaming cleanser
