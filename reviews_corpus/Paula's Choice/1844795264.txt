So far, I’ve been pretty impressed with this treatment. My skin feels firmer and plumper after using it. I didn’t seem to have much irritation from it, but I would advise to be careful when combining it with acids or any other strong treatments with it. I generally apply my bha/aha treatments in the morning and use the retinol in the evening. That being said, I’ve just repurchased a second bottle. nan
