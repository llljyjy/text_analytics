I don’t know how I feel about this product yet. I think it’s aggravating my acne but I can’t prove it and I don’t think it’s moisturizing enough for me. I have oily (but dehydrated), extremely sensitive and acne prone skin. This product feels so great going on. It calms my skin down and leaves it feeling nice and hydrated. It’s also completely weightless. It sinks right in. However, the smell takes some getting used to. All that being said, I’ve used the whole bottle. So it’s a really good option. Feels great, lightweight, funny smell
