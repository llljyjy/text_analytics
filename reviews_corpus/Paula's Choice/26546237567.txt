I love this moisturizer! I came across it on a YouTube video while looking for hydrating moisturizers. I have combination skin and my skin feels so hydrated after using this. It’s important to note that I pair this with the Laniege hyaluronic revitalizing toner which is also very hydrating. I also use an exfoliating cleanser, Paula’s Choice vitamin C serum and Innisfree sunscreen during the day. I use the moisturizer at night as well with other products. Love the combo! I barely have any breakouts and the ones I’ve had healed sooo fast. LOVE! Great for combination skin!
