Ok, i am actually obsessed. This is one of the few gifted products I would actually buy myself. My dark circles under my eye were never really bad but as ive gotten older i have started to notice them getting slightly darker. Eye creams ive used in the past only ever helped with puffiness but this in the past 5-7 days ive been using it ive seen a difference. Dark circles almost gone girl!!!
