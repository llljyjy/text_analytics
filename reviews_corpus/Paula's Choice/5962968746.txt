I love the texture of this sunblock because it doesn’t make you feel oily but I had a reaction to this product. It caused my skin to burn/tingle and turn red. I am also using vitamin c so I’m not sure if there some sort of reaction but I didn’t notice anything in the ingredient list that would cause this. nan
