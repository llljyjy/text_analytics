Feels amazing on the skin, absorbed quickly and didn’t feel greasy. Doesn’t pill under makeup even when using a brush. Unfortunately I have to return it because of the tint. I’m too fair so it gives me an orange undertone. Wander Beauty please make an untinted version!!!! NOT FOR MY FAIR SKINNED FRIENDS
