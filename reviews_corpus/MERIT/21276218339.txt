I was gifted this serum about 2 weeks ago now. My initial reaction was very clean and sleek packaging like Merit usually does it. The ingredients sat separately so you definitely have to give it a good shake before use. I found the texture of it to be a little too oily for my liking, and I have combination skin. Definitely had to wash my hands immediately after using the product, which I don’t normally have to do with other niacinamide and hyaluronic acid products. It hasn’t made my skin breakout yet or anything like that, but I feel like it has the potential too. I think this could be great for those with dry skin type. With regards to the “glow“ aspect, I don’t think it necessarily gave me a particular glow, but it was fairly hydrating! I don’t know if I’d necessarily re-purchase for the price point and texture. I am fairly particular when it comes to texture and wearability throughout the day and I feel as though there are other products out there that could do similar for a different price. Gifted |  It was just alright
