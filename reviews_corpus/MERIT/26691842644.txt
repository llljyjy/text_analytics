This serum feels great on skin.. It spread easily and glides on smoothly.. It doesn’t feel tacky and greasy.. It is watery or runny and thicker than water.. It is more like oil but not heavy at all.. As a primer this is wow on my dry skin, it makes a beautiful and seamless canvas..  I didn’t see dry and patchy spot unlike using other primer and or using moisturizer alone that makes it too  obvious that I’m wearing foundation and leaving my skin with dry and patchy on some parts.. It also makes my skin glow, hydrated and moisturized.. I love glowing looking skin.. No more dry and patchy!
