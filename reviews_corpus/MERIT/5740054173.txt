I love this serum! First of all, all the ingredients are all clean (no pore clogging ingredients) which is really important to me as someone who is acne prone. Yes, I looked through each and every ingredient in this product which is something I do before I commit to any new product into my skincare routine. :) I love to apply this in the AM right before my sunscreen to provide that extra glow and dewiness before I apply my makeup. Great for glow addicts with acne prone skin!
