After using this products for a few days, I noticed glow and just overall hydration. Niacinamide is an amazing ingredient and it’s gentle on the skin. I have eczema and it didn’t cause any flare-ups. It’s a big yes for me + as always, MERIT packaging looks GORGE on my shelf!!! YES for my sensi skin humans!
