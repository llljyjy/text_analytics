MERIT sent me their newest Great Skin Instant Glow Serum to be one of the first to try it. I usually have normal type of skin with some dry spots due to teenage acne. I have tried dry oil and other cream type of product but this product from MERIT really helped a lot within a few days - it is still not perfect but it looks a lot better! I love the fact that it is fragrance-free for my sensitive skin. I also really love the ingredient list without anything harmful. I use it before my daily moisturizer and then put my makeup on. It really gives you that nice, glowy and healthy look. Will definitely buy it once over! A new must have
