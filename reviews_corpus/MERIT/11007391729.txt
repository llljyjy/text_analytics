Great Skin is the best name for this product because it truly makes your skin feel amazing! I love how it simplifies my routine since it has so many amazing ingredients all into one. The packaging is also gorgeous! I think the dispenser pumps out a bit too much of the product so I like to use just 1 pump instead of the recommended 2. Simplifies my routine!
