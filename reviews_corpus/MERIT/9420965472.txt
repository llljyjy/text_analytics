I have been a huge fan of Merit for the past few years so I was very excited to hear they would be releasing skin care. Niacinamide and hyaluronic acid are staples in my skincare routine so I was happy to have both of these ingredients in the product. the serum applies so smoothly and is not sticky or greasy at all. It leaves my skin looking healthy and glowy. Perfect base for under makeup as well!  I have been using this product for over a week now and I am so happy with the promising results. Bonus points for the packaging, I love the glass bottle! So excited for the future of Merit skincare. A Healthy Glow!
