After continuously using the same serum, I was excited to try a new one. While it definitely gives you a glow, I felt it wasnâ€™t really sinking into my skin, but rather sat on top of my dry skin. I personally prefer a thicker consistency when it comes to serums and this one had a very liquid, slightly too oily consistency for me. A bit too liquid-y for my taste
