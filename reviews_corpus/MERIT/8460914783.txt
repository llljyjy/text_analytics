Really nice serum that leaves my skin looking dewy and hydrated. Makeup blends really beautifully over it. I like the watery consistency and how it isn’t super thick or oily. I took one star off for the packaging. It’s a beautiful bottle but the pump makes zero sense and wastes product. Put it in a dropper please. Nice serum but needs to be in a dropper
