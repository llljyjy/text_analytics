I have been using this amazing serum for a couple of days and I’m honestly very impressed, I have very dry skin which means sometimes the serums I have used tend to break me out however this one doesn’t. My skin feels hydrated and very smooth. I usually apply this just before my make up by adding it to my moisturizer and it creates a very beautiful effect on the skin. I can’t wait to use it more + it’s very lightweight and packed with many beneficial ingredients. A must have.
