I am over the moon about this new serum - Great Skin literally leaves you with great skin! What I love most is that the formula is so lightweight compared to serums I’ve used in the past and feels incredibly hydrating on the skin. I’ve used it both in the mornings and at night and my skin loves drinking this stuff up, definitely a great addition to my skincare routine! Love love LOVE!
