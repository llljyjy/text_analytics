Another MERIT staple for me! It has left my skin noticeably glowy and softer. I used one pump since I have combination skin, and was a little nervous with how oily it felt at first. It’s incredibly light and soaks right into my skin. It doesn’t have a fragrance either which is perfect for my sensitive skin. It’s absolutely my new go to serum! Another MERIT staple for me!
