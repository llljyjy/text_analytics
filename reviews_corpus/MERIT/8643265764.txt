This serum is everything I’ve been looking for.I love taking care of my skin but I dread having to remember to apply so many products onto my face day and night. The mixture of oil within the serum truly hydrates and brightens up the skin yet feels light and does not feel overly oily at all.It’s like a serum and face oil mixed into 1 product which I LOVE. Because that means I have less skin care products to have to remember to apply. A 2 in 1 solution that perfectly brightens and soothes your skin leaving it soft, glowy, and healthy.The instant glow serum makes taking care of your skin so easy! A new fave in my skin care routine!
