I have been using this product for almost a week now and I love the how this serum feels! It’s light while not being sticky and still hydrating my skin. It’s the perfect layer right after cleansing and right before applying sunscreen and makeup. There are a lot of serums that are too thick or sticky and it making applying sunscreen/makeup afterwards super heavy, but not the new Merit Great Skin. I love that I have found a new favorite skin care product to add to my routine! My new favorite serum!!
