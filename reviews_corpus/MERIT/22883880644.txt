This product is perfect for dry skin! As we transition into the cooler months, this serum has been the perfect addition to my routine for that added plump and glow. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy residue which makes it a great base under moisturizer before my daily makeup routine. I love that it’s fragrance free since I have sensitive skin and the water-like consistency is super soothing as I start my morning. Highly recommend if you like a simple and hydrating skincare routine! A fast dose of long lasting hydration!
