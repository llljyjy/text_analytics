This is an absolutely gorgeous serum; first thoughts- the glass packaging is stunning.  Very high quality, with a beautiful top and excellent pump.  I will say the pump is a bit forceful with expending product so be careful.  Otherwise, this is a gorgeous honey hued serum that is so incredibly light, but potent.  Shake well before squeezing two pumps onto my fingers and immediately pat on my face and decolletage.  A little goes a long way so do not use more than the two pumps listed on the directions.  I immediately have a rich, supple complexion upon application; this imparts the most stunning glow and subtle bronze to my skin.  At my age, any glow serum will not work; the product needs to be able to add plumpness to the skin while also making it look refreshed.  This serum does both; a noticeable benefit is how truly soft my skin feels after and for many hours later as well.  I have keratosis pilaris, rosacea, and psoriasis and the Great Skin Glow serum does not aggravate my skin at all; I have not had any breakouts, dryness, irritation or excess oiliness.  I have used the Great Skin glow serum morning and night for the last four days and am very happy with this product.  I have other Merit products that perform just as beautifully; if you want makeup and skincare products that are simple yet effective, Merit is for you.  I prefer a more minimalist approach to makeup and skincare, and this fits right into my collection.  Minimalism is easy, fun and elegant with Merit.  5 out of 5 for the Great Skin Instant Glow Serum, Merit does it again. A truly glowing serum for my over 30 year old skin
