I have dry, mature skin and I use about 2-3 pumps each time for my face and neck. It’s my second to last step of my skincare routine. This serum is really good. It provides my skin with a nice amount of hydration and plumps my skin. I love that my skin just has this healthy appearance every time I use it. Not oily at all. It’s lightweight, gets absorbed fast and glides easily. My was pleased with this product from the beginning and will continue using it. Very happy
