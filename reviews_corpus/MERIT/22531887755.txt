This is a light, gentle serum that will change your skincare routine. One to two pumps of this serum is enough to strike a dewy, luminous look, especially for the cooler days ahead. There is no sticky residue, or strong scent left behind so I’m very pleased with how hydrated my skin has felt. The dispenser does spring out a lot of product at once, so you don’t need too many pumps. Glowy skin, perfect for the cold weather
