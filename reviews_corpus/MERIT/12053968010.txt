It really like this serum, it’s very lightweight and makes my skin very hydrated and glowy! I like putting it before my makeup too because it makes my skin really smooth. One drawback- I am not a fan of this packaging- the pump is not the best idea for a very liquid serum and whenever I use it, there is quite a mess as it splashed everywhere. A “toner” bottle wouldve been much better with this consistency. Great product but the pump makes a mess
