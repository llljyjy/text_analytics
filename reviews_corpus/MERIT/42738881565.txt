Amazing serum, leaves my skin so soft and hydrated all day long and my makeup looks flawless over it, BUT the packaging is awful. The pump distributes too much product at a high velocity so it sprays everywhere. I end up wasting so much product everytime I use it which is disappointing considering the price. This needs to be in a dropper. When I’ve used up enough product, I make carefully transfer it to an old Kiehl’s dropper bottle. Packaging wastes product
