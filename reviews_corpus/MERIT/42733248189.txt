I was skeptical about this product because my skin is super sensitive and acne prone but I was pleasantly surprised! I use an acne topical cream at night so I’m scared to mix it the products on my face (even though it shouldn’t interfere with each other) so I use it in my AM skin routine on top of my moisturizer. It gives me glowy skin that I love and I haven’t had any breakouts. I’m not the biggest fan of the packaging though (even though it’s gorgeous!)—the pump is a little strong so I worry I may be wasting the product. I def would recommend this product! Great for sensitive and acne prone skin!
