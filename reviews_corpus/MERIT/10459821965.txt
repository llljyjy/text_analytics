This product is 10/10. The smell is wonderful and not overwhelming. I’ve used it a few times; underneath my foundation, and it has made the biggest difference! My skin is glass like smooth and hydrated. Haven’t had any signs of irritation, which is my biggest problem when using new products. Will definitely continue to use! Instant Glow is RIGHT
