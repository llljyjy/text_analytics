Love the bi-phase formula for under make-up â€” I definitely noticed an instant dewiness on my skin immediately after application. Consistency is very similar to a toner/watery essence so I found it worked best before moisturizer/sunscreen. Hydrating, brightening, and seemed to help lock-in moisture through the day. Excellent instant glow
