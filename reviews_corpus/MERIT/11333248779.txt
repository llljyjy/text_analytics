I’m love having dewy/glass skin so hydration is my main focus for skincare. Once I saw hyaluronic acid and niacinamide in the ingredient list, I had to try. The formula is definitely more on the liquidy side and I used by applying after toner and essence. It feels very light and leaves a glow to your skin! I’ve used with and without makeup and both times my skin has a dewy glow that I get compliments on daily. Also, this is the perfect addition to the front of the shelves because the packaging is so perfect! Will def reuse this product, over and over again. So incredibly good
