This is a stunningly formulated bi-phase scentless (truly scent free!) serum that is meant to hydrate, soothe and brighten the skin over time. It contains 4 key ingredients; Hyaluronic Acid (4 different types for all day hydration), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Caffeine (Antioxidant) and Japanese Goldthread root (antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties). There is also Vitamin E close to the end of the ingredient list.Merit suggested 2-3 pumps but I highly suggest starting with one pump and then add another if it’s not enough. For the record I have mature (43F), normal-dry skin and I personally find one pump is plenty for my skin. The texture is lightweight, watery and the serum spreads beautifully and allows me to massage my face and neck. It absorbs into the skin quickly, leaves no tackiness or residue and layers well with all my other skincare products.I’ve been using this serum twice a day and my skin is definitely softer, smoother and brighter. My skin texture has also improved; softer fines lines and my pores are less noticeable. I haven’t been wearing any foundation, just a couple dabs of concealer under my eyes and around my nose and I am good to go.This serum is a staple in my routine and one that I will continuously repurchase. It’s decently priced and I appreciate that it comes in 50mL instead of the usual 30mL. Healthy, glowy skin
