I have very sensitive skin so I’m always weary of breakouts trying new products. That being said I’ve been using this for about a month now and it’s amazing with one caveat. This makes my skin so fresh and healthy looking. I can use this without makeup and every product after glides on and blends in so well. I have dry skin and this gives me a fresh healthy glow all day. The one complaint I have is the pump. It dispenses a lot of product and is messy. I think a dropper would be much more effective to get the amount of product you want.
