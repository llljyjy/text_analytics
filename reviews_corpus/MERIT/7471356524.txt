I usually can tell immediately if I’m going to enjoy a hydrating product and this one was an instant love. Not only is the glass component and the “unmixed” formula beautiful to look at, but the formula itself it a major WOW. A little bit of product goes a long way and leaves your skin feeling and looking like hydrated healthy skin. It almost has a little bit of a slip to it and the glow is just GORGEOUS. Very much that “post facial glow” we all know and love.  I also love the addition of the caffeine and the soothing properties making it safe for sensitive skin - I have had zero bad reactions or irritations to it. It wears beautifully under makeup (especially the merit complexion stick) with zero pilling. I cannot say enough good things about this and have def found a new must have glowy Hydrator.
