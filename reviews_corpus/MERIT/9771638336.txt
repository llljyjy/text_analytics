This serum truly does leave your skin with a glow! My skin type is on the oily side so Iâ€™m always wary about adding extra products before my moisturizer, especially in the morning. However, this product gave me the most luminous glow and provided the perfect base for my moisturizer! My skin always feels super hydrated with this serum and I LOVE that it includes niacinamide because that consistently fades any dark spots I may have. Leaves you with the most luminous glow!
