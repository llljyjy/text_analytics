After using this product for about a week I would say that it does instantly create a glow to my skin as if I have a subtle sun-like tan. I am in love that merit has made this with Niacinamid and HA to benefit my skin. The dispenser is the only downside to the product as it is a pump (for sanitation reasons) yet the product itself is very liquidy and therefore is a little messy when dispensing. Although this may be the case, it is much better than a droplet harvesting bacteria everytime it is taken out and dispensed onto the skin. Overal would recommend the product! Merit Great Skin Instant Glow!
