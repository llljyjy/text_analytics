Been a few days of trying this absolutely unique product in the market at the moment and i must say i’m very impressed. I love how this is an oil serum but not very oily in feel. It’s watery, it’s thin, very very light weight and it just beautifully absorbs right into skin within first few seconds of application, leaving skin glowing from within and the best part, you don’t even feel it sitting on your skin. The Glow it leaves is so Natural, nothing over the top and thats exactly what i love about it. Its amazing for all skin types but most importantly i feel people with oily combo skin could enjoy a nice healthy, ethereal glow without having to worry about their faces looking like an oil slick. Moreover, since it applies and absorbs so quickly and seemlesly, I’ve enjoyed dabbing and pressing it on top of my makeup on the high points of my face for a subtle luminous finish and absolutely loved the look. Universal Glow for All Skins!
