I really do love this product! It’s perfect for a no-make up make up look and I’ve found that it creates a really stunning dewy-but-not-wet glowing from within complexion. While I’d say it is not an absolute must-have in my routine, it is such a nice product. I’ve tried a few other “glowy skincare base“ products from other reputable brands (Glossier, Barbara Sturm, Versed, etc), and this one is my far my favorite! My fav glowy skincare base product
