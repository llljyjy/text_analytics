This serum is surprising. It’s extremely light yet it leaves my skin dewy for a long time. Not overly shiny either, just nice and supple. I have only been using it for a week, twice a day, so I am excited to see long term results as well, but so far, I’m happy. It absorbs quickly, I can wear it alone or underneath makeup, or to sleep in, it feels luxurious. It’s becoming a new go to.As always, Merit standards are high. A multi use serum
