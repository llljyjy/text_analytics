I love this so far ! The texture is a more liquid then i would of thought,  but i dont really mind that. When I apply the serum, i dont see the glow right away because of the matte finish, but when you follow up with the face cream, thats when the glow of the serum comes thru ! My skin felt healthier within 5 days of use. Loves it ! Cant wait to see how my face improves by the end of the bottle. Effective !
