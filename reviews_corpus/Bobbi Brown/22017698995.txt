I got a consultation from a Bobbi Brown and mentioned that I thought I had pretty dry skin. Tinted moisturizers would often look flat and dull and would eventually start to seemingly “separate“.  She tried several of their standard moisturizing products which didn’t quite “wow“ me. The consultant told me it seemed like my skin was absorbing all the moisture in the products right away. So she brought this extra repair product out. Normally I would have thought she was just trying to sell me on the more expensive moisturizer but my skin (and make-up) NEVER looked as good as it did after she applied this stuff. Highly recommend if you’ve been struggling with dry skin! Works well as a primer and moisturizer. Haven’t had any breakouts or issues yet in the 2 weeks I’ve been using it. The packaging is super high quality and definitely luxurious (as it should be for that price!). Comes in a frosted glass jar. It’s refillable and refills come with a lower price tag than the original product which is definitely a plus especially considering the high price tag. This product has made me a life long user. Highly recommended for those suffering from dry skin and haven’t had any success finding the right product yet! The Holy Grail for Dry Skin!
