What I like about this product is that it has a consistency of a moisturizer. It also does what it says it would do - it helps my foundation to go on smoother and leaves my skin feeling hydrated afterwards. But honestly, I think any moisturizer can do this. Also, I don’t think this is a good product for the summer as it’s a bit too think for my liking. It also doesn’t help the longevity of my foundation. At this price point, I expect this product to do a little bit more. It's alright
