I was gifted this product from Bobbi Brown and here is my review. This face primer reminds me of a light weight moisturizer. It applies nicely to skin and sinks in without leaving a cast or residue. However, while my foundation (I use one from the brand) applied nicely over the primer, it didn’t make much of a difference regarding how long the foundation lasted. It’s a nice moisturizer
