I have dry skin. In the winter times, dry patches are all over my face and itâ€™s really bothering my makeup. This cream is so thick, it does a great job as a moisture and a makeup primer. My concealer goes smoothly on top of it and it helps my makeup lasting longer. I had a mini before and fell in love with it immediately. It is a great product for winter times! Winter must haves
