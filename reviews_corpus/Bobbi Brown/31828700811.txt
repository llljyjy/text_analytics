Got this for half off during the Ulta sale and it’s a good moisturizer/ primer. Even underneath my makeup and powders my skin felt supple and hydrated and looked dewy. Didn’t peel with other products. I’d compare it to the Dewy Skin Cream by Tatcha. I like that it’s got some yummy skin loving ingredients in it! One star off because of the price point Serious Hydration
