This lightweight, lightly scented (a must!) moisturizer is perfect. A little goes a long way while soothing and softening skin.. I love the scent and the texture of this moisturizer, You only need a tiny amount. I find that I use it more often as a night cream, rather than a base under my make-up. Perfect
