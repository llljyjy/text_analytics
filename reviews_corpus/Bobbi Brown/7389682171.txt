Love how this is a moisturizer and primer in one! I have super dry skin right now so the moisturizer aspect of it was not hydrating enough for me but I think in the summer time it will be perfect. I do like the fresh, light citrusy scent and how glowy this makes my skin look immediately! It makes a great base as itâ€™s slightly tacky bio your makeup sticks well. Great hybrid moisturizer/primer!
