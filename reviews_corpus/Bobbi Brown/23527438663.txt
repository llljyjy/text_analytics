This is truly an amazing product. I love the blend of vitamins as well as the addition of hyaluronic acid. It is super comfortable and works great as a facial primer for makeup. I love that it doesnâ€™t feel greasy or sit on my skin but rather works well to provide that deeper moisture. It is a fantastic base and I love it, Fantastic Facial Primer
