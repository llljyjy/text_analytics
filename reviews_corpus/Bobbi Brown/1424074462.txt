This is such a treat for my skin - it’s hydrating, nourishing, comforting and elevates my makeup application to next level.  It’s rich and creamy and feels so luxe.. something in the scent of it makes me think of lemon chiffon - it has a lovely fresh uplifting scent that’s not overpowering just lovely.  It makes my skin look better immediately and I’ve been loving pairing it with a tinted spf on days when I don’t want to wear full foundation - it looks gorgeous.  I love that it’s two in one - think this is a win for dry skin & mature skin too.. I love this as my daytime moisturizer primer in one! Love it for my dry skin! So luxe!!
