Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Cream has been in my skincare/makeup routine for many years, I cannot live without. This one simple product makes my makeup routine so much simpler & easier and yet always makes perfect base for any makeup on top. I love how smooth my base looks after using this as a base, either cushion or foundation. Never been greasy looking, always looking hydrated & well prepped. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasnâ€™t tried it yet! Perfect base every time!
