Yes make up primer has been so popular for years and now I know why! It is so hydrating but also gives your skin a perfect base before make up because it is a little bit tacky but not grossly sticky or anything so your make up just stays really well on it. It also makes my skin so glowy and plump and just so supple. It also did not break me out at all! I love to use it on my clients when they do their make up because everyone loves it and it makes your make up last all night or all day! Love!!!!
