I tried this when it was out at the store 4 trying on makeup. I never would have given it a look. I used it to take off the samples I was trying on and I fell in love. I’m 55 and have dry skin now so I need moisture in all my products this is great. No smell that I remember and it’s light but very oily. It’s too expensive but until I can find a dupe I’m loving this! FOR OLDER DRY SKIN…
