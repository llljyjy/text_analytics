I received a sample of this eye cream and I disliked it instantly.  It smells chemically and like expired sunscreen.  I usually use samples 2 or 3 times, if there is enough, but I tossed this in the trash after the first use.  Also, it kind of is making my undereyes burn a bit and I am not impressed with the level of moisturization.  Do not recommend Smells like expired sunscreen
