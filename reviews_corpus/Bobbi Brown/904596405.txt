Tub - o - petroleum and silicone! Those are the top ingredients, not shea butter or oils or anything costly, clean, dermatologist recommended for under eye or luxurious. I’m not in the market for a burn cream. If that’s what you want, I still wouldn’t recommend this product because of the slight scent of funky melon. Whatever it is, it is off putting. I got out my old, barely scented formulation of this that I use in winter to compare and this one feels a little greasier on application. It also feels a little slimy out of the jar. I can’t comment on effectiveness or what the old formulation contained - but I far preferred it if for nothing other than the buttery texture and lack of scent. I will hesitate to purchase Bobbi moisturizing products going forward unless I try them in store (this new jar came as a gift with purchase) and I’ve used them off and on for over a decade. Shame they didn’t conduct better market research before ruining iconic products. Many customers seem miffed about the sudden reformulations. …Petroleum?! I’m disappointed, Bobbi. petroleum and silicone slime - preferred old one
