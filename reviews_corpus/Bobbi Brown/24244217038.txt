I am really enjoying this primer and get what the hype is about. It really is a great base. It moisturizes, smooths skin, and minimizes pores. I found only a small amount is needed. Makeup applies beautifully over top. The only thing I would change about it is the scent. Though it is light and dissipates would prefer fragrance free. Awesome primer
