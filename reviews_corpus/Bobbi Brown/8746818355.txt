I’ve been using this for a few weeks and by far one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used.  The creamiest and most nourishing during application my skin thanks me every time. Not to mention it doubles as a primer which makes my makeup look flawless! I’m in love it’s definitely worth the price tag. I will continue to buy! nan
