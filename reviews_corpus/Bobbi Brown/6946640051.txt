I have always wanted to try the Bobbi Brown Face Base. It has a cult following and it’s supposed to be amazing under heavy foundation and dry skin. Let me tell you, this primer lives up to the hype! I can’t believe how good it makes my skin feel and it makes makeup application super easy! Now I don’t know how I’m going to be able to love without it. You only need a drop to prime your whole face, so the jar should last several months. Honestly, you need this in your life if you wear makeup daily. Lives up to the hype
