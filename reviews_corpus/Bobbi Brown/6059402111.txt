This moisturizer face base is pretty awesome to have on hand. It smells so good and it’s extremely moisturizing and makes my makeup look flawless with a dewy look. You only need a dime-size amount on your finger to spread over your face. I have dry sensitive skin and didn’t have any reactions to it. I highly recommend this product for daily use with or without makeup. great with or without makeup
