I have heard a ton of things about this base and I finally got to try it. It smells heavenly. It’s a very smooth and buttery texture. Very thick. It didn’t moisturize as much as I wanted to do I use another moisturizer first and then use this one on. Top of it. It gives an amazing glow !! AmaZing primer not a great moisturizer
