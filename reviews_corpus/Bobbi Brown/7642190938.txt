I have been using this cream/primer for years. It gives moisture without making my skin greasy, works great with makeup and even fills in the pores a little. The jar goes a long way too. My skin is dry, so I don’t have an issue of getting oily throughout the day, so I can’t tell if it helps the makeup to last longer, but if I have dry patches on my face, this base smoothes everything out and my makeup looks better. The only downside is the smell, the base has a citrusy smell and usually fragranced products irritate my skin so I don’t use this base as often as I’d like. I wish they made a scent-free version, I’d be using it a lot more often. Love the product, but the scent is too much
