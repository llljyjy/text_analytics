As far as makeup primers go, this one is pretty light weight, easy to apply, and slightly more moisturizing than a normal primer. It definitely makes a difference once I apply makeup, my makeup seems to go on smoother and stay in tact longer. There is enough product to last a while, but Iâ€™m still not sure that the price tag is worth it for a primer. nan
