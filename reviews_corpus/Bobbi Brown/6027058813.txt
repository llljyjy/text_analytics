This moisturizer/face base is an absolute life-saver during these cold, crisp days. It is thick but non comedogenic. Feels very hydrating but not greasy at all,  perfect for my combination skin. An amazing skin prep before makeup! I especially love how foundation layers on it, makes the skin look very smooth. Can also use it alone as a day or night time moisturizer. Smells decadent and the packaging is very luxurious. LOVE LOVE LOVE
