I really needed a moisturizer because in the winter my skin tends to get super dry. I now use this product day and night! It is a great moisturizer without making your skin too oily, which is why I think it works so well as a primer too. Overall really great and handy product. Glad I was gifted it Great moisturizer without oiliness
