I have been wanting to try the famous face base for a while after hearing so many good things about it. Especially that it works well with oily skin. And I can confirm after using it; everything you hear is true! The consistency of this moisturizer primer is super silky and feels amazing on the skin as you apply it. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, which I thought especially impressive due to how thick it is. It does have a scent to it, but upon application that goes away. I prefer this for a “pre-base” moisturizer over a primer, as I do like my primers mattifying in certain areas of my face. But my makeup performed with no issues where I hadn’t used the mattifier, and sat really beautifully on top. A brilliant face prep-step
