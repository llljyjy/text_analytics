I was sent this complimentary and was so excited as I love trying new primers and not only is this a primer, it’s a moisturizer as well! It has a nice, creamy texture and a very sweet/citrus scent. I haven’t had much luck with priming moisturizers in the past but this one worked perfectly. It made my skin feel hydrated and my makeup went on smoothly with no pilling or flaking. I am absolutely loving this! Amazing Product and Beautiful Citrus Scent!
