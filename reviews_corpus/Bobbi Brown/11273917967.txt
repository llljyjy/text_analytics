My new holy grail, this stuff is seriously Amazing, especially during winter! Feels very hydrating but not greasy, I have more of a dry skin, but I used it on several clients and omg it performs so good! I love how foundation layers on it, makes the skin look very smooth. You can also use it alone not just under makeup. Also smells super nice and the packaging is very luxurious. Holy grail
