It’s been a while since I’ve tried a Bobbi Brown product so I was excited to try the iconic Vitamin Enriched Face Base Priming Moisturizer. I feel that this is a holy grail product for many and I see why. I have oily combination skin and this still gives me balanced hydration prior to makeup application. I skip other moisturizers when applying this before foundation and I see that my foundation doesn’t skip and applies evenly. I also have used this on no makeup days and find it light enough for morning use. My skin absorbs this well too and it is not sticky. I also enjoy the citrus grapefruit scent which is not overpowering.  I would say this is a splurge product but I would recommend it if you are looking to treat yourself! nan
