Iâ€™m so excited to have found the jumbo sized bottle! They used to carry it at Nordstrom but quickly sold out. This is my favorite pre-makeup moisturizer. Smells citrus fresh, feels incredibly hydrating and absorbs into my skin very well. A little goes a long way. Best used for people without oily skin. Grab it before it's gone!
