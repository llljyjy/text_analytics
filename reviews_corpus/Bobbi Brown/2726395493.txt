Dare I say it’s better than Tatcha The water cream. This is good for me for daytime use. Smooth on just a little before skin tint and my skin glows not in a shiny oily way at all! Wow. It’s hydrating but not over the top for my combination skin. Pleased with results during spring. Not certain about hot humid summer days…will see. But currently, it’s a love. Tzone controlled. No high shine/ oily skin. Actually received compliments from friends on how my skin looked! Brighter and smooth. Love how my skin tint applies and looks after this face cream! I also recommend the hydrating eye cream! Smooth and glowing skin
