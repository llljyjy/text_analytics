I have a combination skin and I love how thick and creamy it feels on my skin. It’s perfect to use either as a moisturizer or as a primer. Love when skincare products are multifunctional! Has a nice lil scent that is not overpowering.I like to wear it around the house as a moisturizer as it keeps my skin hydrated while blurring away my imperfections.When I apply makeup, I use it as a primer and I love when all the other products just apply evenly.I’m obsessed with its luxe packaging. Definitely, a perfect winter base for makeup. Luxe packaging!
