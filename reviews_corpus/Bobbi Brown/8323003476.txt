I’m always looking for a multi-functional product, and this one is great! It double as a moisturizer and a primer. I love the addition of vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid. It’s very moisturizing and gives a great glow. This is thick enough for use in the winter but not too rich. My makeup goes on really well over it, and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Love!!
