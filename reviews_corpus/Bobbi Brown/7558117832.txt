It is a lovely hydrating cream. I love to use it as a moisturizer and also primer since it gives the required amount of moisture to the skin.  It gets absorbed in the skin very fast, and does not feel sticky. Make sits and spreads well on the skin. The only complaint I have is it is fragranced. If you are sensitive to smell, I would recommend trying out a sample before actually investing in this product. Love it so far with one minor complaint
