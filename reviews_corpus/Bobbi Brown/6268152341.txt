This is the PERFECT winter base for makeup. It feels really moisturizing and gives me a super smooth finish for my foundation. I love that itâ€™s not greasy at all and the light scent is really pretty and fresh. Bonus points as always to Bobbi Brown for the pretty packaging! Looks so cute on my beauty shelf. Perfect primer for winter
