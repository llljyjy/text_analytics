This is such a great priming moisturizer. It’s on the thicker side but it melts into the skin and absorbs nicely. It’s very hydrating, but not greasy. My makeup sits so beautifully on top of this base. It has a citrusy scent to it, which I find to be pleasant but if you’re not into scented things it may not be for you. nan
