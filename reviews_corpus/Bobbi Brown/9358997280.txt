I’m so happy I tried this product. I’ve heard a lot of great things about this over the years, and my experience with it did not disappoint. First, the texture is so luxe and creamy. It left my skin feeling super moisturized. Second, after several hours I noticed my makeup was still as smooth as when I first applied it. I could see myself repurchasing this product again in the future. nan
