I was pleasantly impressed with the Vitamin Enriched Face Base for Bobbi Brown. I love the smell! The consistency is a buttery one, but when applied it’s not greasy at all. The product is very hydrating and I like how well it works on my sensitive combination skin. My skin feels hydrated, smooth and nourished. It’s also a great makeup base. I love using it every single morning when I get ready for work. If this cream would have had SPF in it, it would have been perfect. A great hydrator + makeup base
