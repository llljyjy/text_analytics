I will absolutely be purschasing another one of these! Itâ€™s perfect before makeup application, as it serves as both a moisturizer and primer. I struggle with pilling so the more 2 in 1 products I can use - the better. I also love the subtle smell and creamy texture you get from the Shea Butter. Love this product
