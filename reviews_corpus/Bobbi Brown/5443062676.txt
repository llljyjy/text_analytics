I am really liking this primer right now. I’ve heard so many great things about it for years, and thought I needed to try it my self! It really lives up to its name. It is so smoothing and hydrating and leaves my skin looking flawless! I always get the perfect makeup application after using it. I can’t get enough! The perfect moisturizer and primer in one!
