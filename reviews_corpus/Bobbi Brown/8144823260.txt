I was always on the hunt for a good primer that would work for my dry skin. When I tried Bobbi brown vitamin enriched face base I was really impressed. Its a plus that it’s a primer & moisturizer in one. It does have a citrus scent with I love. It it’s a bit thicker than a normal primer but I didn’t feel my skin weigh down. It absorbed quickly leaving my skin smooth as silk and helped minimize appearance of my pores.  My makeup look flawless all day. Im very pleased with results. Best Primer I ever tried
