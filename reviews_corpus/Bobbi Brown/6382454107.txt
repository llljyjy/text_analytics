Ready for flawless makeup??? I’m combo skin and this one is the perfect base for makeup and it doesn’t make me oily/make makeup slide off my face. I feel like it makes my skin look healthy. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t make my makeup look cakey either. It also has a slight scent but it’s nice and not overpowering. Flawless makeup base
