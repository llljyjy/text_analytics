Beautiful texture and smell. I am careful to apply it just before foundation. I have combo skin and it’s not too rich for me. Will always have this. The perfect morning/priming moisturizer. For the last two years I’ve purchased the holiday super size and it’s lasted almost the whole year since I only use it once a day. A high end product that’s truly worth every penny. The Best!
