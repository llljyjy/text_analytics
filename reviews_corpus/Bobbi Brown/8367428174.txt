The Vitamin Enriched Face Base sadly is not for me although it gives a dewy look it accentuates my pores and the flaky skin on my forehead to appear more it also had a heavy feeling when applied it didnâ€™t sit right on my skin. Through out the it made appear really oily which I was not a big fan . nan
