I have read so many great reviews on this moisturizer and I finally tried it.  It’s really beautiful under makeup.  Not greasy, not oily, and doesn’t have any overwhelming perfume scent.  I like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking even-toned. I also use this under my eyes and have been really happy with the performance. Great moisturizer and makeup base
