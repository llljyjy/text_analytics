I really enjoyed using this product because it is a mixture of both a moisturizer as well as a makeup primer. It has a citrus-like scent which is nice, and texture wise it smoothes out my skinâ€™s texture. It holds foundation for quite some time which means it functions just like makeup primer. Nice moisturizing primer
