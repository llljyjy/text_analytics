This is a very rich moisturizer that really hydrates without feeling too heavy. It does great under makeup and really creates such a nice base to work with. I am really enjoying this for the winter months for my dry skin. However I don’t think it would be a top choice for summer or maybe even in an extra humid climate. My only gripe is the essential oils. My skin can be sensitive so I just prefer not to have that in there. However I haven’t experienced any irritation. Over all a nice hydrating base. Nice thick moisturizer
