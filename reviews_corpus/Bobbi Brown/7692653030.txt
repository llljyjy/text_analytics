I’m African American with combination skin. I tend to get dry around my mouth and chin and this is where I experience most creasing. This is a moisturizing primer. My skin feels so soft and plump after applying and my makeup glides on. It has a soft vanilla scent. Very creamy so a little goes a long way. After applying my full face of products and setting spray my face looks air brushed. Like I’ve been to a professional makeup artist. Deeply nourishing, smoothed your skin for a flawless finish. Just amazing. Even after wearing a face mask my makeup looks amazing! Smooth, Flawless Makeup Application
