Bobbi Brown is a brand I just associate with luxury, so I was stoked to try this out. This actually reminds me a bit of the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, but it’s at a lower price point. My preferred way to use it is as a base for my makeup in the evenings when I don’t apply sunscreen (as opposed to mornings when there’s going to be sunscreen between my moisturizer and makeup) and my dry skin absolutely loves the squalane, shea butter, and hyaluronic acid that’s in the formula. Beautifully packaged, great for dry skin
