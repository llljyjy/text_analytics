I gave it 4 stars which is still really good but here is my reasoning behind it. This eye cream is one of the best ones out there, I have tried many from cheaper brands to more high end. This is expensive but lasts me maybe around two months. I feel like it’s worth the investment because it helps those dark circles, it hydrates that under eye area and just makes me look so much better in the mornings lol. I have naturally dark circles (genes) and I am fairly light skin so it shows up like no other when I have no makeup on. This helps diminish the appearance it doesn’t completely make it go away but it generally helps which I haven’t found another eye cream that does that! I also love the creamy texture and a little goes a long way. It’s not super thick but the consistency is like butter when it’s slightly melted. I do not recommend this for the application prior to makeup! It will get patchy and start to peel off at least for me. I only use this in the night and I use a more hydrating eye cream base in the morning. I haven’t experienced any irritation from this and my skin and under eye area are fairly sensitive. Great product it’s worth a shot to try it! Good eye cream for night
