This cream is rich, nourishing, and deeply moisturizing. I love the creamy texture and how effortlessly it melts into my skin. It works well as a moisturizer, keeping my dry skin moisturized, soft, and smooth. It also performs quite well as a primer, making a smooth base for foundation application and helps my foundation go on evenly without accentuating any texture I might have. It’s a pet peeve of mine when my foundation accentuates underlying texture, so this is a major win for me! My only complaint about this product is that the fragrance isn’t my favorite and is stronger than I prefer. nan
