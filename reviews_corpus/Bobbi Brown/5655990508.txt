This is such a great product!! I have hard times with putting too many creams prior applying make up. I never skip the spf and moisturizer but the primer I find it sometimes unnecessary. This product is all I needed as it is all in one. Iâ€™m really happy with the hydration that provides and how smooth makes the make up look. The scent and the creamy feel is everything. If you skip the primer, this is for you!
