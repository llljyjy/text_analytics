Got this as a sample and tried it last night for the third event this week where I had to wear a full face of makeup.  It was simply incredible.  Change of seasons had my previous days makeup itchy and creased by 9pm, but last night, with this primer, my skin was plumped, hydrated, and everything was well in place.  I definitely have dry skin so struggle with sticky primers, but this seems to be a great balance of hydrating and priming for me.  I will only use it when I have full face of makeup, which tbh isnt most days, but Im rebuying now! A must have for a full-face of makeup!
