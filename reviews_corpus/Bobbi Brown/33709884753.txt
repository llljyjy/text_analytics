This product is fabulous for dry skin!! To be honest, if your skin is extremely dry, you do need a little more product than youâ€™d like to admit, but the smell, feel, and texture are absolutely amazing. I use this as a primer before my makeup and my skin does not show as many pores through it and looks more natural. One last note, the bottle is gorgeous,  but the shape will get quite annoying once you use some of it due to it being more difficult to get the product out. Amazing for dry skin- not greasy- just hydrating!
