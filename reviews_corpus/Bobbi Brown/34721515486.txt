Pros: it does feel hydrating and I feel like it did work with my foundation as a primer. The packaging is sleek and classy. The texture of the cream is also a really nice consistency—not too thick but also not too thin. I can also tell that, at the end of the day, my face feels moisturized still, even with using powder and the weather getting colder—both of which often leave me feeling pretty dry. Cons: the smell is pretty strong and it could be irritating for someone with skin sensitivities. I was intrigued by the term “face base,” and wasn’t exactly sure what it was meant to do until I read that it was both a primer and a moisturizer (which was also kind of confusing because I thought primers could already be moisturizing). **However, being over 30yo means that I do put hydrating my skin as one of my priorities and having a primer and vitamin enriched moisturizer in one is definitely something that I appreciate, as it lumps that part of my skin care together without needing MORE items. *I received this item complimentary from the brand in exchange for an honest review.
