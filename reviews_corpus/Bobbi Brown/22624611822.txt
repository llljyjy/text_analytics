Bobbi brown vitamin enriched face base is an amazing primer to be used before applying makeup. Its a blend of Vitamin B C and E and we all know how inevitable are these Vitamins when to comes to skin care. The best part is it is an all in one primer and moisturizer . It saves time and money . Hence I can skip using a moisturizer before prepping my with primer. It is of thick and creamy consistency yet glides on the skin very well. I was apprehensive about using this , as thick and creamy moisturizers make my skin to break out . But I can safely say my skin feels happy about it . It lends a natural glow to the skin without making it feel heavy and greasy. Application of foundation becomes easy as it spreads evenly and doesnt give a dry flaky look. It has a mild citrusy fragrance which could be a cause if concern for someone sensitive to fragrances. But its too mild to be felt . It can be used as a daily moisturizer even without makeup. It does a very good job at keeping skin hydrated all day long . So far I am happy about using this product as it lives upto its claim . I have a combination skin which gets super oily during summers making it difficult for me to use moisturizers . Hence looking forward to using it during summers . Hapoy skin. Happy me.
