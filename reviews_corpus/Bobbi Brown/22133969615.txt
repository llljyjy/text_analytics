From the first seconds I loved it’s fresh scent, it’s not strong - just right so start your make up routine. It’s honestly a hight quality base because it’s more of a moisturizer and antioxidant and your skin actually loves it. Also, I think it’s pretty gentle even for my sensitive skin during the winter months. Try it! More than make up base
