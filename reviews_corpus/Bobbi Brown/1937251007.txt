This eye base has changed everything for me when it comes to concealers! My concealer always looks dry and settles into my hereditary under-eye lines (28 years old). I have tried countless concealers and under eye creams and they all creased or looked dry - literally until this magical bottle came into my makeup collection! At the moment Iâ€™m using a mini and I think it will last months, then I will absolutely purchase the full size! nan
