LOVE this product. I was nervous about buying it because of the reviews talking about the smell, but I am so confused by those cause there is no bad smell. A bit of a floral scent, totally fine and fades if you donâ€™t like it, but I have no idea why so many people say it smells rancid. Literally just a standard floral-ish scent. Have had friends and my sister use it as well and everyone loves it. Anyway, the glow is AMAZING. Looks just like luminous skin, no sparkle. I use it as a highlighter on my cheeks and it is stunning. Your cheeks literally get the kind of glow that you see in like photoshopped magazines. One of my favorite products and I will def buy again! LOVE IT.
