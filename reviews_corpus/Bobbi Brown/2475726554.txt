This is an amazing primer especially for my dry skin! I’ve tried plenty of hydrating primers but this one is definitely a favorite. It adds just the right amount of hydration & sinks into the skin nicely & makeup looks absolutely beautiful on top of it! It does have a bit of a fragrance which I’m not a fan of but it’s not too bad. Definitely recommend trying this! nan
