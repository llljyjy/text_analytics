doesn’t really remove makeup that well and the texture is so hard to work with. the squeeze tube is awful. the hole is so small and you have to squeeze the tube SO hard to get anything out, i struggle with it as a body without physical difficulties. it doesn’t work well enough to make the packaging flaw worth it. meh
