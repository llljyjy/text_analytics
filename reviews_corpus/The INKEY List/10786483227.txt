Balm was too thick to squeeze out normally and burst out the top seam.  In addition, I found that it didnâ€™t really emulsify with water.  Was not an enjoyable experience. I threw it out after about 5 uses which I almost never do.  I was dissapointed but at least it was cheap. (I do recommend Farmacy Green Clean) Too thick, bad packaging,  no joy
