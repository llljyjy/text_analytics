I’m leaving an honest review. I got this to try for 3 weeks and I won’t use it again. My face never breaks out and it broke out a couple times during this trial. I noticed when I put it on it felt like I applied a layer of lotion that couldn’t breath. It made my face sweat which is weird. Not a fan unfortunately :( Not a Fan
