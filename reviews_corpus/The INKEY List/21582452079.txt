I’m writing this because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I had an allergic reaction to this. I’ve tried several other retinols and haven’t had issues, including tretinoin for a time, but this one instantly gave me itchy hives. Too bad since the price is so good and it clearly works for many people! Allergic Reaction
