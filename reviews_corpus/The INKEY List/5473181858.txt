This was like a thick paste when I first got it, and really hard to squeeze out. After about a month, it was easier to get out of the tube but it began to separate. So I would get a paste-like balm and liquid. It was incredibly messy and left my face with a greasy film. It also struggled to break down complex eye looks; like anything with liners and mascara. Not even good for the price
