I’ve gone through at LEAST 4 bottles of this- I believe that should show how much I love this product! It really gives my eczema prone skin the love it deserves while giving it a little exfoliation (not to replace an exfoliate). The oatmeal flour and colloidal oatmeal really help to melt off everything! It does leave my skin a little waxy but that’s why it’s a good double cleanser at an affordable price. Best double cleanse!
