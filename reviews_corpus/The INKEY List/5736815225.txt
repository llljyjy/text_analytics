I have no idea if this is working yet because I’ve only been using it for one week, but I really love that it’s a cheap and easy addition to my skincare routine. It’s essentially unscented, very fast absorbing, and doesn’t leave me feeling sticky. I plan on finishing this bottle and will likely repurchase. nan
