Great product and you can’t beat the price. Formula is a bit grainy when first applying but it goes away the more its worked in. It is not an exfoliant which I love! The only reason for 4 stars is that it leaves a residue but if you’re double cleansing, that’s not a problem. Gentle enough to remove eye makeup and doesn’t burn. If your skin is irritated or damaged skin barrier, this is a great cleanser to use. Love a product that’s great for both dry and sensitive skin. Overall a really great product! One of my favorites for double cleansing!
