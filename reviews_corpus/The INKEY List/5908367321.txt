Although I have combination skin type. As I have gotten older my skin is starting to lean towards combo-dry, so I needed something’s that’s nourishing but not oily. Was initially surprised at how thick the texture felt on my face but then woke up with supple skin in the morning and was also pleasantly surprised how good & supple my skin felt! Also tried it during the day and noticed how my skin was less oily than usual compared to other moisturizer. This is the best for my current skin. Love it! If you apply too much then just spread it down to your neck and hands. The best for dehydrated Combo skin!!!
