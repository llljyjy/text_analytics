I’ve purchased this several times, and it used to be my holy grail moisturizer. It was thick and creamy without being too heavy, and my 35-year-old skin has never looked so plump and healthy. Like many of the recent reviewers, I was also disappointed by the new packaging, but what is worse is it seems like a completely different product. I thought maybe it was just me, but looking at the other reviews, it seems like others are having the same experience. If you’re considering buying, make sure you look at the newest reviews instead of the overall ratings. New formula with the new packaging?
