holy grail product for me personally. i’m a long time acne sufferer (from age 12-27) and this is the only acne cleanser that has helped me keep my breakouts at bay - consistently - without completely drying me out/irritating my skin.i’ve also found this product to be super multifunctional, using it as a cleanser, a mask, and a “deodorizer”. i have pretty oily skin + noticeable pores on my nose. lately i have been putting a small amount on this area in the PM and leaving it on for about 5 minutes before rinsing it off. i of course follow this up with hydrating + moisturizing nighttime products, and WOW have i seen a significant difference in pore clarity.also, i’m aware this isn’t exactly “recommended”, but i’ve also found this cleanser to be gentle enough for the armpit area. the salicylic acid helps to kill odour-causing bacteria that live on the skin! i follow this up with a light lotion and a fragrance free antiperspirant. doing this has kept the skin clean and cared for :) if you struggle with odour/armpit discolouration, maybe give this deodorizing routine a try?while this cleanser doesn’t magically *perfect* my skin, it’s one that works amazingly for my skin’s needs. i feel now that i’m in a good enough place to focus on other skin goals (such as acne scars) and it won’t be an uphill battle against any breakouts :) so helpful for my adult acne
