I’ve been using this for about 2 months, and I have mixed feelings. First of all, it does not feel like it rinses clean, so if you’re looking for that “squeaky clean” feeling, please avoid. I know that’s not the intended outcome, but I was still a little put off by the slightly oily feeling.On the other hand, it does a great job of removing makeup and immediately after I use it, my face does feel softer. I’ve now been cleansing with something else and using this as a quick mask instead, and I like it much better for that application. maybe better as a mask
