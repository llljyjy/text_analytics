I received this product in exchange for my honest review from influencer. I have very acne prone sensitive and oily skin. Since using this product I’ve seen a large improvement in my pore size and excessive oil production. The texture is like a gel consistency and I’ve used it every day in my skin care routine. I definitely would recommend those to somebody with oily skin but if you are already dry I would stay away because it does dry out the skin pretty quickly. like I said my skin is sensitive so I have experience in purging from this product, but my skin tends to go crazy every time I try something new. I will continue to use this daily and see if I can even have more prominent results. so far so good
