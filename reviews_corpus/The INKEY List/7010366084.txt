This works. I’ve had the craziest breakouts for as long as I can remember, and I’ve tried everything. Seriously, every routine that is supposed to help has failed me. No matter the cost, I’ve tried it. I saw this and didn’t have high expectations because of the price. I started using this at night after cleansing with the CeraVe SA cleanser. Nothing else. After 3 days, I noticed that I wasn’t breaking out, and my current breakouts were almost gone. By the end of the first week, I was hooked. I’m not exaggerating, it was weird because I was waiting for the worst to happen. I’m on my second bottle now and I will keep buying it until they stop making it. Even if I do get a blemish here or there, it’s gone in about a day. I have very oily acne -prone skin and this seems to be the key to calming it down. Will use this forever!
