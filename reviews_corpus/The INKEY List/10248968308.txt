I’ve read a lot of reviews about this cleanser and decided to give it a try. I’m pleasantly surprised by how well it works. I use this after a cleansing balm to get the rest of my makeup off. If you put some of the cleanser, not too much, in your hands and rub them together to emulsify, you get a really nice lathery/foaming consistency that feels silky as you rub this on your face. After using this, my skin (combination) feels very clean but not stripped. I was a bit hesitant about my cheeks drying out but I didn’t experience any adverse effects. Good cleanser for the the right price
