The pump was broken, and once I unscrewed the lid to try and fix the situation, there was barely any product. For the price point, I would have expected much more. This was really disappointing because the product itself worked really well with my skin type (dry combination), but it didn’t even last me a month with the small amount of product inside anyways. I won’t be purchasing this again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else either… It’s a no for me
