I love the product but I need to be a little tweaked. Started using this at the beginning of 2022 in the middle for winter here in Wisconsin I have combo skin and in the winter my face gets a little dry so I got this to help!! My skin felt hybridized and after a little bit of time outside I needed to to go back inside and put on more from the cold wind of winter. Now in the summer I see myself doing the some thing as I did in winter but not as often but putting it on in the morning and at night. it is good for my skin but not for those with dry skin. 7/10 would buy again but not for those for dry skin feels like water but not for those with dry skin
