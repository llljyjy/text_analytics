This moisturizer was just okay. I bought it because I layer serums and needed something lightweight to go over them. I had been using TOs NMF for a few years and I wasn’t a huge fan. I was expecting this moisturizer to be mattifying like most water based creams that I have used - but it’s not, it leaves my face looking super greasy. I do like that it spreads well and dries quickly and the price is also good. While I do like that’s it’s “fragrance free” it does smell like the plastic bottle it comes in. I will finish it off but I wouldn’t repurchase. meh just okay..
