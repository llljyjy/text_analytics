I enjoyed trying the Inkey List Omega water cream moisturizer. This was a very lightweight product. I liked it because it wasn’t greasy, and I usually break out with a lot of the lotion or creams I try. It get absorbed in the skin quickly so if you are in a rush to put on your make up and go, it’s perfect. The price is also great! nan
