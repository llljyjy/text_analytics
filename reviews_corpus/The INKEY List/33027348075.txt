I turned 40 and had never used retinol product. I tried this one as I love the Inkey Oat Cleansing balm and it had good reviews. I have been using it for 6 months - I use it almost every night before moisturizing. I love the creamy consistency but I have not noticed changes in my skin tone or texture or fine lines. My skin is well hydrated so that is a plus. It could be that at my age I need rx strength or something stronger perhaps if I used this in my late 20’s or 30’s it would have a different effect. I am almost done with this tube and will look to try something else. Great texture did not do much for my skin
