I like that this moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin so it doesnâ€™t feel too heavy throughout the day and especially not under my mask. That being said, it mixes poorly with my Niacinimide serum and requires a lot of rubbing to not leave a white cast. My skin does overall feel softer than where it was before I used this moisturizer but I definitely think I can find a better alternative. gets the job done
