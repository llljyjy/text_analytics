It’s like…a less thick version of kiehl’s face wash, and not nearly as good. It just feels inexpensive, which it is. Also, it containing hyaluronic acid seems like a gimmick since you just wash it off. Not like it’s really going to do any good. It’s a gimmick that worked on me, but I won’t repurchase. Not worth returning though since it’s only a tenner. mehhhh
