My daughter works at Sephora and she introduced me to double cleansing with this balm as a first step. I follow up with the salicylic acid cleanser. This balm is amazing. Removes all my makeup. Doesnâ€™t sting the eyes. Leaves skin moisturized and soft. I will continue using this product. I normally have oily skin and this leaves it hydrated not oily. nan
