After having my daughter I was eager to get back into using retinol but I didn’t want to spend a small fortune on one bottle and also wanted something gentle.  I am really pleased with this retinol, I’ve never had any irritation from it and my skin looks great.  I’ll certainly keep using this. 10/10, would buy again
