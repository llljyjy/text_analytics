The key is that you squeeze and rub it between your fingers to warm it up before rubbing it on your face and then washing off with a separate cleanser.. I like it. It’s a cheaper alternative to lush’s cleanser like this! I used to use coconut oil before trying either of those products to melt the makeup off ! nan
