I was surprised and delighted by this! I have very oily skin. So much so, that my makeup is often breaking up by dinner time. I’m constantly looking for skincare, makeup, primers, and setting sprays that will prevent my makeup from breaking down. This doesn’t solve the problem on its own, but I absolutely notice a difference on days when I use it. I really wish the packaging was more user friendly. It’s really hard to control the amount of product. A dropper or pump would be much easier to use. Still worth the hassle, especially for the price. Good For Oil Control
