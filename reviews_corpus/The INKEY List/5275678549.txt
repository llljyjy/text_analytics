A lot of the negative reviews here are using the product wrong. This is supposed to be used in a two-step double cleansing system and itâ€™s also meant to be mixed with a bit of water. Squeeze some of the product out into your hands, mix together with a few drops of water (I usually just wet my face first) then massage onto your face and your makeup/sunscreen will remove seamlessly. There is an oily residue left on your face afterwards, but after you go in with your regular gel/cream cleanser after this, there is no residue left and your face should be makeup-free and clean. Love this cleansing balm especially for how affordable it is. It sometimes does separate in the tube for me but whether it comes out as a balm or oil, the product works great to remove makeup/sunscreen. Best affordable cleansing balm
