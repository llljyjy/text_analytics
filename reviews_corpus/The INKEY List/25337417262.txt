Gurl let me tell you: this cream smells horrid. I’d say 95% of my skincare is fragrance-free so I’m used to that plain clinical smell, but this one is rotted. It’s similar to burning plastic and it lingers for a while.Smell aside, it applies smoothly over multiple layers of serums and doesn’t leave a tacky residue. However, it feels a little more oily than a I’d expect from a water cream so that was disappointing.If you can handle the strange smell and have drier skin that can take the extra “dewyness“, then go off. The price is great. The SMELL THOUGH
