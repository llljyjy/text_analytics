I normally have oily skin but have been experiencing dryness, especially on my forehead. This did NOTHING.  It made my skin a little sticky but I didn’t experience any moisturizing or plumping effects. Also, please be careful opening the cap.

I’m still on the search for a good moisturizer or moisturizing treatment. Not Moisturizing Enough & Packaging Problem
