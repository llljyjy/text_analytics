I used to use niacinamide, but it didn’t do much for me. This peptide serum works a lot better because my skin feels like it retains moisture better when I use it under my other moisturizers. The peptide serim has a slightly sticky feel as it begins to absorb but smoothes out as it dries. It’s very light and fragrance free, but I think it smells like a very slight scent of roses, and I know it’s not any of my cleansers or hand soap because they dont smell like roses. It makes my regular moisturizers perform a lot better, and I notice my skin is not as dry as before I used this serum. I use tretinoin and this serum doesnt burn or sting my skin nan
