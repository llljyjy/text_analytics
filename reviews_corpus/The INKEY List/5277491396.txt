It’s not the worst cleansing balm, but it is far from the best. The product seems to separate inside the bottle, because when you squeeze it, there’s an oily liquid that comes out along with the more viscous balm? It doesn’t really give me a clean feeling and it takes a lot of rinsing to get the oily feeling off my skin. There are better options out there. nan
