Didn’t like this at all!! The consistency was AWFUL! It was like trying to cleanse your face with Vaseline. I used this as the first step of my double cleanse routine, afterwards I had to use my second cleanser multiple times to get the sticky / oily feeling off my face! Tried it for a week and it’s a NOPE from me!!
