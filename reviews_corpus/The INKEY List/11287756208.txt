Ahhhh I wanted to enjoy this product because of the reviews and the price point bUT it did not work for me at all. Personally I didn’t enjoy the texture of it but that usually isn’t a huge deal to me. My main problem is that after every time I used this product, my skin would feel stripped, dry, and tight. I used it for around 3-4 weeks and all it did was make my skin feel unnourished after every time I used it. So now I am dealing with a pretty bad breakout because my skin is trying to compensate for the natural oils ripped away from me PLUS from the irritation from the salicylic acid. I don’t want to give it 1 star because I do have high hopes for this brand and believe that this product could work for someone else’s skin really well. Unfortunately, it just didn’t work for me. Not for me!
