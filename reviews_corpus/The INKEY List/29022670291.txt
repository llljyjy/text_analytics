Not the best. You pay for what you get. I really wanted to love this product, as I saw really good reviews and you really can’t beat the price. I have it a shot, tried it out for about 3 months. No difference, not in the slightest! What was super disappointing to me, is not only did it not have a brightening affect, but throughout the day I noticed my eyes getting flakey. I really wish this worked. In the moment it feels nice, and the metal applicator helps with that. But really, this doesn’t do anything. :( Wanted to love this..
