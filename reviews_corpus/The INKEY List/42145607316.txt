I really like this product. Not sure why the other reviews say it doesn’t do anything. I’ve been using 2 weeks and my under eyes have a noticeable difference. They are less dark and puffy. The metal tip is cooking but it makes it so too much product comes out at once. I rather squeeze a small amount onto my fingers and then apply. Really good!
