I have dry skin but I tend to avoid heavy (creamy) moisturizers since I already use a heavy sunscreen. The Peptide moisturizer gave the balance I wanted where it is not too thick in texture.Iâ€™ve bought this 3 times so far mostly because of the previous package because it was something a different that made application easier. From an outside perspective, I do not see why they would change it while keeping the same price but I guess we will never know. Great Product though
