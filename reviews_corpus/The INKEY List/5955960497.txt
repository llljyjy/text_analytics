I bought this as one of my first steps into the world of acids.... Though after finishing the bottle, I’ve not much positive to say about it. I started with every other PM use, then eventually worked up to AM/PM use, and then to even layering with The Ordinary’s Mandelic Acid in the PM -- fearing that my skin wasn’t prepared for any stronger BHAs/AHAs, but in hopes that I could achieve similar results. What resulted was minimally exfoliated skin -- leaving my skin slightly smoother than before I started, but nothing more.... With expectations that it would help with blemishes, blackheads, and texture. I don’t regret purchasing as I believe it was a cautious first step into the big scary world of acids, and summise it would be perfectly suitable for those with sensitive skin who can’t use other AHAs, and those completely new to acids.  I DO recommend... I just don’t be repurchasing. Which is a shame as I enjoyed the price point. Good choice for introduction into acids...
