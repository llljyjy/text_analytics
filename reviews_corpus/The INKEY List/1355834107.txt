I have sensitive skin, and sun damage. I’ve been using this every night in my routine for a few months now, and it’s really making a difference. It doesn’t bother my skin at all. My larger dark spots haven’t changed much, but all my smaller lighter ones, and other imperfections are disappearing and my skin is really looking more even. It’s hard to find tranexamic acid, and the price on this is amazing! It’s also a really nice gel that glides across your skin perfectly. I will definitely continue to purchase. nan
