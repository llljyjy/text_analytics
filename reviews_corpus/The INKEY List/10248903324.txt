Wanted to love this but I found it left my face feeling like there was a layer of the cleansing balm’s oil still on my face that I struggled to get off. At first it was fine but after a while the product separated in the bottle. I do have normal/dry skin that can be sensitive so I will say that this product didn’t irritate my skin at all and did work for me to clean off make up so I do still use it but I’ll probably stick to micellar water ultimately. But the price is really good, so there’s no harm in trying if you wanted to. nan
