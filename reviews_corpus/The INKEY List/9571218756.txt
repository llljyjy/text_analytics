It’s alright. I wanted to try inkey list and I thought a moisturizer would be a good start because it’s clean skin care. To start off, I generally have dry skin but in the summer it is kinda normal. In the winter, it didn’t do much for my skin. I really had to pair it with other serums and products for it to do something. It doesn’t really feel moisturizing to me, but it’s kinda hydrating. And something I don’t like is that it makes my face looking kinda greasy unless I pat, not rub, it into the skin (which makes it looks more like a glow instead). I’ve been using this for about half a year btw. Maybe this would work better on combination skin. For the price, it isn’t bad at all and I will continue using until I find a better alternative. not bad but not for everyone…
