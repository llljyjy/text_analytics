And I don’t use HG status lightly. I have extremely sensitive and dry skin so discovering oil cleansing has been a game-changer. However, finding a product with a texture I liked without a strong fragrance has been difficult. Cue the oat cleansing balm!; soothing, cheap, and effective. It is like a thick oil/balm texture than removes makeup and sunscreen flawlessly with little effort. Two things to note, however; first, this is not going to be a good enough cleanse on its own as it does leave a slight film. You will need a second cleanser (double cleansing method), so then it’s a non-issue. Second, due to the oat powder or something in this, there is a very very very slight grit if you rub very hard. I have sensitive skin and find that it’s not a problem at all including around my eyes. I just wouldn’t recommend scrubbing your skin with all of your might. Even with those slight issues, it’s still my favorite and I would recommend it to anyone. I’m on probably my 5th bottle now because I find that nothing else compares and it’s such an important soothing step in my routine. Please never stop making this. Holy Grail Status
