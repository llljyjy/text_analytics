I really like this for removing make up, it gets it off fast without scrubbing hard on my face. However, it doesn’t leave a fresh feeling like some other cleansers out there. After using and washing my face I still feel like there’s a lot of oil on it. When it sits out and I try and put some on my hand the oil comes out before the product. nan
