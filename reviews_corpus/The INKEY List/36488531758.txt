I’ve been wanting to use a cleansing balm because my other makeup removers haven’t done the job well. This balm is gentle, leaving my skin makeup free quite quickly. It does leave a bit of residue, so I follow up with my usual cleanser and my skincare routine. The smell of oat isn’t too strong, which is an important factor for me. Will definitely repurchase when I finished this product. gentle cleanser, perfect for double cleanse!
