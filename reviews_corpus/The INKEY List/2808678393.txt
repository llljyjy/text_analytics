This is an oil-reducing cleanser and a useful product for acne-prone skin. Although it foams very lightly, it has definitely helped reduce breakouts. I usually use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser in the AM and this one in the PM. It is also really good value for money - like all Inkey List products are! Great cleanser for acne-prone skin
