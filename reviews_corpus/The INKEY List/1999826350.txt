So far I’ve been liking this product fine. I’m not prone to a ton of acne, however I do get breakouts. Thus far I haven’t had any breakouts since starting using it. So take that how you will. Not sure if I by chance haven’t had any or if this stuff has been helping keep it at bay! No real smell. Hasn’t made my skin dry out or anything like that either, so I think it’s pretty gentle for what it is. I’ll happily continue to use it. Breakouts at bay
