I love this cream! It’s almost a hybrid gel, but had just enough thickness to make it a cream. I typically will get cystic acne if u use anything that is heavy in texture, but this cream is the prefect consistency! No scent so it’s perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely love and for the price point you can’t beat it! best lightweight cream ever!
