I love this product, but knocked a star off because I miss the old packaging. I wish I had saved my old tub! This feels like a nice high end peptide lotion (comparable to the drunk elephant imo). It’s what I would call mid-weight. It’s not super light or heavy. It can be a night cream for oilier skin, and a day cream for dryer skin. I use it on my eye area and around my chin where I get dryness from my retin-a. During the summer I also use it as an all over night cream when my winter lotion is too heavy. Makes my skin look more hydrated and plump. Have re-purchased twice and would buy again. Miss the old packaging
