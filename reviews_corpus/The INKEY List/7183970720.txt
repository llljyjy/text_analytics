My holy grail secret weapon! This allows me to use any product I want that I couldn’t use before because of my dry skin.  I mix a drop of this with any foundation and it glides beautifully over my face and stays moisturized all day long.  At the end of the day, I look in the mirror and the foundation still looks so so good, with that healthy, moisturized glow.  I found that it doesn’t work as well if I apply it directly on my face so I mix it in well and this also diffuses the bad scent that everyone is complaining about (the chemical scent only lasts a few seconds and then it’s completely gone).  This fixes it all for us dry-skin gals/guys.  Tip: try it with Armani Luminous Silk (which I could never get to work for me before, btw) - it’s a wow moment !  Just wow. I’m about to purchase an extra backup!
