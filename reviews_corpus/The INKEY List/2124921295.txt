Love this cleanser! Leaves my skin feeling very clean but not stripped. Good for the normal/to dry skin. This is my new go to cleanser. However, one star off because every time I order from this brand the product comes with a safety seal missing or damaged or leaking and that’s extremely off-putting to me….. great cleanser!
