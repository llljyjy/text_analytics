I was on the hunt for a gentle exfoliator that would get the job done and this is it! I haven’t experienced redness nor breakouts; not even “purging“ or things like that from this at all. I like to use it as part of my nightly skincare routine and I wake up with brighter, smoother, skin. I think it ~does~ even out your skintone and ive noticed any dark spots I have on my face, have improved. By the way, I have very sensitive acne-prone skin and this doesnt burn like the Paula’s Choice SA exfoliator. Also, ive been using this three times a week.. for one month! Great for sensitive skin
