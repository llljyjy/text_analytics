Nice product - a little heavier/more dewy than preferred for daytime for my oily skin in the summer.  Doesn’t make me breakout, and works well with SPF and makeup.  I think this will be better for use in the colder months and/or for people with a little less oily skin.  I also feel like I go through this product very quickly, so I’m not sure if the value is fully there, even though it’s a more affordable price point.  If I need to replace after just a few weeks, then it might not be as “affordable“ as it seems. Good Moisturizer
