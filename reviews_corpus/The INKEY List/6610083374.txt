Absolutely obsessed. I was a little skeptical of this product mainly because all of the reviews I’ve seen on all social media platforms were from influencers who were sponsored by inkey list but it definitely lives up to the hype. I have insanely dry skin that makes it so hard to have a flawless foundation base, but I also hate thick moisturizes that pill my makeup. If you’re like me you NEED THIS!!!! It melts into your skin just like water but leaves you with a glowy dewy look that won’t affect the  makeup you layer over it. I love the feeling of putting this on, ugh, everything about this moisturizer is amazing. Highly affordable, my only complaint is I feel like the packaging is a little small hopefully they’ll make a bigger bottle/option soon! Super Hydrating and won’t pill your makeup!!
