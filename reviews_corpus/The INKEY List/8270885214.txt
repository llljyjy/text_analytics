the texture is terrible, it feels like rubbing Vaseline all over your face. Like I think they might be one and the same. and it didnâ€™t even take my makeup off, like at all. at most it managed to smear it. then I felt like i had to wash my face twice afterwards just to get it off. gross and ineffective
