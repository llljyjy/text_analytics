This moisturizer is pretty good, but the old packaging was FAR superior. Please bring back the pump-jar thing. This squeeze tube always puts out way too much product. Like others, until the old packaging comes back, Iâ€™ll probably be looking for something else. The formula is fine, but not worth the money now with the troublesome tube. New packaging is terrible
