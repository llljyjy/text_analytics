I bought this cleanser two-three weeks ago and have been consistent with my skincare routine while using this. I have combination skin, so this cleanser doesnâ€™t dry skin out like previous cleansers have. A little truly goes a long way, it foams nicely. You can almost see a difference after rinsing the product. Within a week of using it, my breakouts on my cheeks appeared smaller, so this will be a product i will keep buying! Working great so far
