I love the Inky List and many of their products have Wowed me. This is not one of them. This cleanser one of the worst cleansers I have ever used. I have very dry and acne prone skin and I felt that this product not only left a greasy/oily film but caused me to breakout. It also did not remove the makeup as I could have liked. Will NOT be repurchasing
