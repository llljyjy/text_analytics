Ive re-purchased this multiple times despite it being a little $$ for the product amount. but it is the best lightweight and hydrating moisturizer for calgary dry weather. wearing under makeup doesnt even feel like i have anything on and it goes on so smoothly. love the product! Best lightweight moisturizer
