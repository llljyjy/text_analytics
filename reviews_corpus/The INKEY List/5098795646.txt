Great product, I was looking for a gentle face wash as I have very sensitive and dry skin. I was considering lots of more expensive options but when I seen the reviews for this one I had to try it considering how great the price is. and I am very happy I did! I love how it feels on my skin, very hydrating and makes my skin nice and soft and clean feeling without being dry or tight. canâ€™t go wrong with the price at all! Will definitely be buying again nan
