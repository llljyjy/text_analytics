I really like this cleanser. I was struggling with body acne and this has helped clear it up a lot. I use it every time I shower. Afterwards, I apply a niacinamide serum to keep excess oil production at bay. I will be repurchasing (if itâ€™s in stock by then lol). Great for clearing and preventing acne!
