I’ve been using this product since the first week of April, and in my case I believe the price is definitely reflected in my results. This eye cream is just okay. I’m not blown away by the results, but to be fair there was definitely some lightening. I love the price and affordability, but I wish this had worked better. I wasn’t fond of the applicator and the sanitary aspect, so a few weeks ago I moved on to squeezing some out on the back of my hand and using my finger to apply it and in my opinion it worked better that way. There is an odd smell to the product, it goes away fast, but it was almost identical to how the food boxes at McDonald’s smell lol. I wasn’t bothered by it, but if you’re sensitive to scents it’s something to keep in mind. As you can see in the photos the eye cream really didn’t change anything other than the tone, so I guess it’s time to find something for fine lines AND brightening haha. (first photo is from April 5th and second from June 20th, taken in same room, similar time of day, and no flash/ altering filters. The only thing I did was scribble out my iris for privacy safety) It’s okay and affordable
