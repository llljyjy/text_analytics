I wouldn’t recommend it personally for a multitude of reasons. I hate the texture of this, it’s very thick and dense? I know it says gel cleanser but my newer cleanser is “jelly” but way smoother and thinner, kinda creamy. I didn’t get to finish it because someone poured it out and I was actually happy to finally get to try a new cleanser. This will last you months on the flip side. My complexion looked dull after washing with this but hydration made up for that. Didn’t really stop acne or anything, nor closed comedones.. they actually looked more prominent? I started using a leave on SA product which helps clogged pores better. Also, I’ve always thought my skin was oily and this made me realize that it probably isn’t..? It’s okay, I wouldn’t buy it again but I love their retinol. It’s a cleanser, nothing more or less
