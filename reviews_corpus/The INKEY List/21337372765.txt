The ingredients are good in this and it doesn’t break me out so that’s nice. It’s kind of moisturizing but honestly I didn’t love this moisturizer. I have combo/oily skin and it felt almost slick and like it didn’t fully settle into my skin. I’ll probably continue to use it bc it doesn’t break me out but I won’t be repurchasing. nan
