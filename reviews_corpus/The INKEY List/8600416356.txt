I do like this product but sometimes it does kinda burn to put on? I have pretty sensitive skin and it only does this sometimes and goes away pretty fast with no issues afterwards. I do think it’s helped with skin barrier issues and it’s possible that when it burns my skin barrier is just irritated. nan
