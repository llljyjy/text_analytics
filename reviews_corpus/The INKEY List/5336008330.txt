This is a decent eye cream. It does hydrate n moisturize the under eye area but does not work for reducing wrinkles, fine lines or dark circles. I have dark circles n dry eye area. It works great for my dryness. It instantly adds moisture n smoothens my eye area. I would recommend if anyone is looking for a good moisturizing eye cream. Good !
