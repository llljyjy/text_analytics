The best!! Great price point, and DOES THE JOB. Melts all of my makeup, and a little bit goes a long way. I bought this in November and I’m still using it, 8 months later. I will never waste any more money on another “popular” make up removing balm. This is TIMELESS for me. Does the job, without the glitz & glam!
