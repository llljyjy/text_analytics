I started using this over a month ago and I don’t see any noticeable changes. Considering I am using it as a preventative rather than a treatment, I would say it does its job. The only thing I don’t like about it is the amount of wasted product. No matter how much you squish, squeeze, and shake, a weird oil always comes out when you squeeze it. No definitive conclusion
