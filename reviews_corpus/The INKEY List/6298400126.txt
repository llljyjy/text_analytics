This is my absolute favorite HG Niacinamide serum for acne! I’ve tried others but I keep coming back to this one. The formula is lightweight, non-sticky, hydrating and really does reduce blemishes. Compared to the ordinary I didn’t experience purging and overall it’s the better option. I always recommend this serum to anyone who wants to try Niacinamide. 10% may be strong but it’s not the least bit irritating. The packaging is not my favorite because it looks messy but I’ve transferred mine into an empty pump bottle My favorite!
