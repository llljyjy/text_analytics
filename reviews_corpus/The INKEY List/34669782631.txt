This cleanser is a game changer. I had used a cleanser from MDacne and had not done research on the ingredients then found out thereâ€™s at least 8 ingredients that harm skin. But the ingredients in this product are safe. I was breaking out so bad from the MDacne product that when I used this cleanser it helped heal my skin. Thank you the Inkey list. Before getting a skincare product know your skin type and the ingredients in the product. This healed my skin for the better:)
