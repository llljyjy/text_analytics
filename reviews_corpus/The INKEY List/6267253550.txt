The texture of this balm is more liquid-y than the regular-sized balm, but it’s still the best makeup and sunscreen remover I have ever tried! I also put it on my face to protect my skin if I’m gonna be in the shower for more than 20 minutes because my skin is prone to drying out and getting red. I also always wash it off my oily areas. With a second cleanse. Sometimes my whole face if I’m going out and need to apply sunscreen and/or makeup. Say Bye to Makeup and Sunscreen!
