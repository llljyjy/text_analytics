I should’ve paid more attention to the ingredients list instead of trusting that the inkey list would just make a good product true to the description. When I got it home and used it it felt like a silicone primer. And that was it, it didn’t hydrate or plump which is what it’s said to do. After a few times of using it I checked the ingredients and found that it is basically silicone and any other ingredients good for your skin come after the preservatives. Which means they’re below the 1% mark and won’t be doing anything. So disappointed
