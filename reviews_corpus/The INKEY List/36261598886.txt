Absolutely love this! My redness goes away with a couple uses and I wasnâ€™t a big fan of benzoyl peroxide for my hormonal acne as it felt harsh but this was a great alternative! I made a mistake of using all over my face a couple of times which caused a rash but when used properly as spot treatment it works great! So effective!
