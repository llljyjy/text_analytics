I bought this product in June 2021 so I donâ€™t think it will show up as a verified purchase. I recently started using this and it is very effective. With the dry cold weather and season change I find that my skin is getting a bit dry. I used this the past few weeks, once per week. I cleanse face, apply peel and wait 10 min. I rinse and apply a serum and moisturizer. This leaves my skin smooth and feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I will be repurchasing. The price point is also really reasonable. nan
