I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited about it but noticed quickly that it causes drying on my very oily skin. For as long as I can remember, my skin has always been oily so as you can imagine, this dryness is new to me! I think the product works with discoloration and uneven skin but I can’t ignore the excessive dryness and dullness of my skin. It’s hard to believe it’s only 1% retinol. I can’t imagine what a higher concentration would do. Sadly, I don’t recommend it based on personal experience. Intensive Treatment
