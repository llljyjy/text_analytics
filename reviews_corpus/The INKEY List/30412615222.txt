Not sure what to expect. From first use, it did make my skin flake so I was a bit shocked. Used it once a week so that my skin can get used to it. Does not give serum, more cream and it does not smooth on the face well enough for me. Almost makes me look ashy. But itâ€™s okay since it does under my face cream. However, skin does look better after three weeks of use. New to Retinol
