I like it but it doesnâ€™t rinse off completely. It leaves an oily residue. Fortunately I only use as.a first cleanser. My double cleanser usually gets off anything left behind by this. Also when I press the tube to get product out, I feel like the oil has separated from what is supposed to be a gel like consistency. It's good but confusing...
