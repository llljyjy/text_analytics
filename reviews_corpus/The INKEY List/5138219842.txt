I saw something interesting about this product from Lab Muffin that I’d thought I share here. Succinct acid in this product is listed as an “inactive Ingredient” while the “active” ingredient is actually salicylic acid. This is why this product works for acne. The inkley list is the only one who came out with a product marketing succinic acid, so if you google “succinic acid” this product from the inkley list is the first and basically only thing that comes up. It’s clever marketing by the inkley list, but they are still a great brand that offers great skincare at an affordable price like the ordinary. They also are usually very transparent about their active ingredients, putting them on the front of the label. I have tried this and it does work as a great spot treatment so that’s why it gets 5 stars still :) nan
