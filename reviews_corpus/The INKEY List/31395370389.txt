I used to struggle with dry and flaky skin on my cheeks and chin. Ever since starting this product a year ago, i haven’t dealt with that issue once! I haven’t experienced any bad side effects. This formula works really well for hydrating skin, evening skin tone and smoothing texture. I apply it after cleanser on damp skin and before all other serums and retinol. This is a holy grail product for me. The entire inkey list brand is so affordable - and actually works! nan
