I was skeptical when I first heard of this product but I was interested in trying polyglutamic acid.   I am really impressed by this product. A little goes a long way. Try mixing it with your moisturizer for an added boost. I havenâ€™t tried mixing it with my foundation yet but I will be repurchasing. Great product
