Good at removing makeup but it does not emulsify at all. When you try and wash it off with warm water you are left so extremely oily. Paired with my usual face wash my skin did look nice and feel nice afterwards. This would be soooo much better if it actually emulsified so that way your follow up cleanser wasn’t just washing this off and could help further clean your skin. This is ok for the size and price, but they need some good emulsifying ingredients to make this light years better. I don’t really like when a CLEANSER is leaving a thick greasy layer in my skin. removes makeup but leaves you greasy like bacon
