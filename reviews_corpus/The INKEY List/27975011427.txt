I tried this serum after starting with a 0.1% serum. I was worried because it has been a hit and miss with The Inkey List, but this didnâ€™t disappoint. This had a smooth creamy texture that went on easily. It was so smooth that I could use it with a gua sha tool. It reduced texture, scarring, and even some hormonal acne. Just make sure to wear sunscreen or to cover your face with a hat the next morning. Perfect Intermediate Retinol Serum
