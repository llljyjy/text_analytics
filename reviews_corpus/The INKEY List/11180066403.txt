I have been using this cleanser in my morning routine for, from what I believe, nearly a year now. This is an extremely gentle cleanser that doesnâ€™t strip your moisture barrier and gives you a nice simple cleanse. I have had consistancy with my skins clarity throughout its every use, and believe this may be a good option for those with dehydrated or sensitive skin. I have also used this product while on trips as a makeup remover when I did not want to bring products in access and it works well as a nice first cleanse. The only factor that makes my review any lesser; as winter is approaching and I am having to use thicker moisturizing products at night, im noticing that using this the morning after isnt really giving me the silky and refreshing cleanse I would like to achieve from it. Perhaps the reason for this is simply that I need to emulsify more product then the simple dime-sized amount I have been using, but for the winter I think it would benefit me to try a more penetrating face-wash. Good for Sensitive Skin, Maybe Too Gentle for Some
