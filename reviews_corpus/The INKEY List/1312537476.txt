I have tried four or five different retinol products previously, now that I’m in my forties and more focused on good skincare. Higher price point products did NOT work as well as this little inexpensive wonder!! My skin is glowing, it purged out a bunch of yuck other retinols didn’t, and I am so thrilled with the results after only a few weeks. I don’t often write reviews, but this Inkey List retinol deserves all the top ratings and recommendations! I started with a smaller size, and even though you don’t have to use very much so it lasts a while, I plan to buy the larger size is multiples to always have on hand!Seriously, try this retinol. With an amazing price point and payoff to boot, you can’t go wrong! Your skin will thank you. I know mine will, well past my current forties, with this added to my skin regimen. Buy this!
