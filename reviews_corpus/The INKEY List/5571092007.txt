Didn’t have the chance to give it a good try since I’m doing treatments on my face that prevent me from trying new products to the full extent. What I did was use it 2 to 3 times a week and stopped a week before my treatment since that was recommended. I didn’t see much of a difference and had no reaction to it either. I think not using it everyday benefits me the most because my skin is very sensitive. I only get whiteheads and some blackheads and it looked somewhat good after use so only time will tell if I’ll actually be able to finish this product. I will possibly come back to update if I’ll be able to try it better. Only reason why I do not recommend is because I did not try it well enough to suggest this. nan
