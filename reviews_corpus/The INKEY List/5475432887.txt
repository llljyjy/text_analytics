Okay this stuff is amazing!!! I wear a lot of eye makeup and it’s always hard to take off no matter what I’m using. Seen this on tiktok and I have no regrets! It took my make up off so easily! I was surprised. It did take a little bit more product but that’s fine. I have combination skin and tend to break out easily but this was soooo hydrating and it definitely calmed my skin down. No breakout in sight since using this. I thought it would leave my skin oily or dry since it has a thick consistency but after wiping my face off it felt so soft. It’s a game changer!!!! My skin has never looked this great. I love that it’s two in one. It takes my make up off and cleanses my skin. Usually that takes about 10-15 minutes but now it’s less than 4 minutes. I know everyone’s skin is different but this has definitely improved the texture on my skin and it’s helped with any acne I had. LOVE IT. It’s now my HOLY GRAIL!!!! AMAZING!
