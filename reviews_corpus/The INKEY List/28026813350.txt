Just went through the return process to try and get the correct packaging advertised but after looking at the reviews I guess this is the new packaging? It doesn’t even feel like other inkey list products I have at all. The printing is off center and there’s pieces of jagged plastic along the seal. I chose to try this product specifically for the packaging to use as a base for mixing other products with. If this is going to be the new packaging then someone dropped the ball on quality control and at Sephora for not updating the website. Garbage packaging
