I’ve used this product for almost a year. I feel my tone appears even and brighter, and notice smoother texture. It doesn’t cause redness or irritation either. My only issue is with the way the product feels when applying it. I find it feels filmy/tacky sometimes especially in winter months (I live in a very dry cold climate) so I have to layer it with a facial oil. Also, if you’re looking for a moment of luxury or self care it doesn’t feel silky and rich. Effective but formula does not feel luxurious
