This isnt the most amazing product, but its certainly one of the better make-up removers I’ve used and the price point is good. This is VERY oily. I don’t wear a lot of makeup so i normally just use it on my eyes to get my mascara off. I do NOT use this as a cleanser. This is the first step in my facial washing process. First, i use this to loosen or get my makeup off and then I use a face wash to actually clean my skin. This isnt the easiest to get off your skin because its so oily. a little goes a long way. I’ve tried a few other makeup removers and this one is still my standard go-to. It has almost no smell and though it is oily, it feels gentle. It's not perfect, but it's good.
