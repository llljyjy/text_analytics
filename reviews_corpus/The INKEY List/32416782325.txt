The Inkey List has been one of the pioneers of affordable, “no nonsense“ skincare for a while, for very good reason. I find them to be a lot more accessible as well due to them breaking down the exact uses of the product on the bottle as well. The packaging is also crisp, clear and concise as well. I received the Azeliac acid 10% serum which I used as my active every other night for my facial redness.I started applying the serum on the 29th of August. The serum is very lightweight and sinks in easily, it is also unscented for those who have sensitivities to fragrance. I noticed some purging about a week in which is fairly standard when using a brand new skincare but now, in October, my skin is noticeably less red! I avoided changing my diet and rest of my skincare too much so I could firmly say it was from the serum and I am very pleasantly surprised. I really recommend it if you have issues with rosacea.Attached is my person before and after. nan
