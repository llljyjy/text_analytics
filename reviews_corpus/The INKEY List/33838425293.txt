I’ve only been using this for maybe a month. I’m 43 and I’m starting to get fine lines around my eyes so thought I’d add this to my skincare routine to see if it helps. I’m using it before my regular nighttime eye balm. It goes on well and doesn’t leave a sticky or tacky feel to my under eyes, so I feel like it’s soaking in. I don’t think it’s possible to really see a difference with the lines, but I like it so far. For the price it’s definitely worth trying out. nan
