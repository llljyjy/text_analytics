This is a MUST have product for me. My skin is very sensitive, and dry. I feel like this hydrates and makes my skin plump. I’ve probably bought 13+ of these bottles now. I can’t live with out it as well as the bakuchiol retinol moisturizer. I have trouble finding skincare that I can wear under my makeup without making my makeup separating through the day and this wears so nicely. 10/10 in my opinion Can't live without it
