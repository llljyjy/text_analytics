I’ve used this for two nights in a row. I’ve been having serious breakouts recently when usually my skin is pretty good. After only using this twice my redness has gone down tremendously and my breakouts have shrunk and aren’t nearly as painful. I have one really under the skin and it was so painful, it’s still a little painful but it doesn’t hurt nearly as bad. love!
