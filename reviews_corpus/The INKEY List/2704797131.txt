This niacin amide does exactly what it says it will. I’ve been using it consistently in the evenings for about two years now and with a combo of BHA and a good moisturizer my skin has almost changed from oily to normal. There’s no frills, but if you’re looking for something simple and cheap to help control excess oil, this is the product for ya. Reliable product
