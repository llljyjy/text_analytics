I am 31 and have worked at Sephora for 6 years and have dealt with acne since I was a teenager, so trust me when I tell you that I have tried everything under the sun. This product works well for me and others that I have recommended it to. My skin is very sensitive and I had no adverse reactions after a test patch. The product has no obnoxious fragrance which is super important for me. I use it day and night after I cleanse my skin and apply my toner around the area that needs to be treated, and although it is NOT a magical product that zaps bumps immediately, it significantly decreased the size of 2 cystic blemishes that I had on my jaw and chin area with two (2) uses. Those ingrown bumps usually last several days, into weeks and once gone leave a brown scar. Using this problem seemingly bypassed that time consuming hassle. I was so pleasantly surprised!!! I used less than a rice grain amount on any area that needs the help and did not touch my face at all. No picking, rubbing, scratching, with my hands at any point. Consistency is key with skincare so don’t give up if you don’t see a change in a day or two, the product needs time to work. Bottom line is that it does work. worth a try
