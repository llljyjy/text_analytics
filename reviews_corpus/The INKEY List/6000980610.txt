No joke this is the first cleanser Iâ€™ve ever been able to use in the winter without a massive dry skin reaction. My skin is so dry in the winter that it burns an entire day after washing it normally. But I can use this and just apply some serum, moisturizer and Vaseline and my skin is actually soft. Crazy good for sensitive skin
