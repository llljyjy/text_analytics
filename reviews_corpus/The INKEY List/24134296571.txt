I love this serum so much! It has a nice watery consistency that spreads very nicely across my face. Nothing that I layer on top of it makes my skin greasy especially because I have oily skin. It makes my face feel very hydrated and very cool after use. I recommend this product many many times and I will many many times in the future! Love it!
