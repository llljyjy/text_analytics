This is hands down one of the best products I have ever put on my face. My skin is literally glowing, and the overall texture has completely changed - it is SO soft. I have combination skin, so this does more for the dryer areas than the oily spots. Specifically, I noticed that my skin is a bit too oily when I wear this under makeup, so on days where I plan to wear makeup I will only use after removing makeup at the end of the day. But overall my skin has never looked so good, it is so worth it! My new holy grail skincare product!
