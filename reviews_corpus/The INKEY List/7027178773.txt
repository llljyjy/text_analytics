Really never noticed a big difference after using this (tried it for two months) it still feels nice on the skin , feels moisturizing & lightweight if you don’t like heavier eye creams; not a “bad” choice for the price of the product but I definitely prefer other eye creams over this one. Not bad, Not amazing
