A couple tips from a Sephora employee. This serum is a holy grail for my dry skin!   The best way to apply it is onto wet/damp skin, ideally after cleansing, then let it sink in and seal it in with a moisturizer. If you skip those steps it can actually make you even drier.The reason is that this serum mainly contains humectants (hyaluronic acid + glycerin) which are ingredients that grab onto water molecules. If there’s not enough water around then the humectants can actually suck the water out of your skin instead. And without any barrier on top it’ll all just evaporate away. So make sure you pair it with water and a good moisturizer! Tip - Apply to damp skin under moisturizer
