This product does a great job of breaking down eye makeup and foundation, even with a small-sized amount. Similar to other reviews though, I’ve noticed the product separates super easily in the container and tends to leave a film after washing (so a second cleanser/wash is definitely needed). I also wear contacts and noticed it leaves a cloudy look and I have to rinse my contacts off afterwards. Otherwise, it’s a great value and amount of product for the price it is. nan
