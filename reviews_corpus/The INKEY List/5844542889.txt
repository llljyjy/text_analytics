This is my first balm I’ve used and I’d recommend this product for someone else trying a balm for the first time as well. It’s affordable and you get a lot. I think it’s a good base to figure out what you do or don’t like about a balm. I also like the company and like supporting them. However, I have combo skin but perhaps more on the drier side and that I need to for sure double cleanse with an oil control cleanser to get the residue off my face. The consistency is not always consistent either, sometimes it’s gritty and sometimes it’s watery which I don’t like a whole lot. I don’t hate the product but will be trying out other balms first before I buy this again. works but heavy
