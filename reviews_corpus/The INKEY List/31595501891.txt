Squalene oil has been the skincare ingredient that I didn’t know my hopelessly dry and sensitive skin needed! It is amazing. It is a lighter oil compared to others and it actually does sink into my skin fast enough that I can use it in the morning and evening. If I’m using it for daytime, I just mix a little bit with my moisturizer. For nighttime, I used a separate dropper jar that was empty to mix this with moringa oil and I apply that concoction in a heavier layer as my last step to lock in everything, even tretinoin. It has almost completely eliminated my dry patches even now in the dead of winter. If I hadn’t mixed them, I would use squalene first and moringa last since moringa is quite a bit heavier. It also doesn’t have a smell that I’ve been able to notice. The reason for 4 stars is the amount (1oz) for the price and the awful packaging. It’s a regular flip top lid and while I understand that cheap packaging keep prices low and it’s supposedly recyclable, it’s very hard to control the amount you dispense and it’s too easy to waste. Plus, oil gets all over the lid so it’s messy and not so travel friendly. If The Ordinary can use glass dropper bottles and still keep prices lower than Inkey, I’m sure it’s doable somehow. Oils really need to be sold in dropper bottles. Luckily I had a bottle with product that I couldn’t use so I washed it out and reused it but I shouldn’t have had to do that. Oh well! Squalene is magic
