This may be my new favorite cleansing balm! I feel like it really removes all the excess oil and makeup from the day while also being super gentle and non stripping. The only thing that I dislike about it is that sometimes you have to be careful when opening it due to the fact that it can separate a little and be a little messy. Shaking it up a little bit before opening it tends to help though. Great daily cleansing balm, gentle yet effective!
