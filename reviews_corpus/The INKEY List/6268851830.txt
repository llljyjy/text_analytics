Works really well! I put it on when I feel a pimple forming during my night skincare routine. The next morning the pimple becomes significantly smaller and I can put a pimple patch to extract the pus. It also has a cooling effect on my skin. The only downside is the skin becomes incredibly dry after use. nan
