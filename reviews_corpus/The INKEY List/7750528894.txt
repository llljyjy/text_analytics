Decided to grab a tube on a whim while looking for a hydrating eye cream. I have large eyes and naturally slightly sunken sockets, when I haven’t had enough sleep puffiness can be an issue. For the last 8 days I’ve been dabbing this on my eyes before I even leave my bedroom in the morning and by the time my tea water is ready my eyes are visibly less puffy and I look “awake”.  If you need a little something to open your tried eyes, id try this. wake me up anytime!
