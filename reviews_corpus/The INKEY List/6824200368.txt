LOVE. Please note, Iâ€™m very picky with my cleansers. For reference I have oily, and very sensitive skin. This did not irritate or break me out. The best part, my face felt fresh and clean afterwards, NOT stripped. Which is SO important to me. I would absolutely recommend this cleanser. The cleaning power is just perfect, and exceeds expectations. 110% you need it, now
