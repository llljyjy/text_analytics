At first, I hated this product. It was oily, I felt like the residue was left on my skin. I do not recommend it for removing makeup, however, it as a regular double cleanse (for sunscreen and old skincare). However, through a couple of uses, I began to love this product, it made my skin feel soft and clean. Be sure to use a regular cleanser after this one. Good daily double cleanser
