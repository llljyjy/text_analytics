This moisturizer was just alright. I felt like it did not really absorb into my skin and rather sat on top. I did not really notice any changes in my skin when using it. I also think that the packaging could be a little better. I liked that it was unscented as most scented moisturizers tend to irritate my skin. Overall you get what you pay for but this is good if you are just looking for something in a lower price range. Mediocre
