I have been afraid of clay mask since they are always give my skin a freak.However, when I first use this product, I notice the improvement on my skin right away. It appears with less oil and sebum. My face was always full of oil every morning after waking up. Using this mask makes it better. This is the first time I wake up without any oil on my face and thatâ€™s great. Totally love it.However, there is also downside when using this one. It would give me a tingle for few minutes when I apply it. After few minutes, it would disappear. I hate that feeling, but I love the effects it gives me afterward. Hope they could improve it soon. Best clay mask ever!!
