I am a 44 year old woman and have Mild Acne, Mature skin with a few fine lines. I started using this a few weeks ago and have certainly seen some great results. Iâ€™ve used other Retinol mostly oily based and were very harsh and over dried my skin. This 1% In key a list Retinol is more like a cream based serum. I have noticed a difference in a few other of my fine lines as well as less acne and smoother skin. Its very affordable I recommend it. Great product, fast results and affordable.
