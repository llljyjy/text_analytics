i use this product when following a 2 step cleansing regimen, i like that it is gentle on my skin and removes any makeup i’ve worn during the daytime, after using this cleanser i follow up with la roche posay hydrating face wash and my skin does feel clean/soft/hydrated it’s a lovely combination using the 2 cleansers favorite makeup remover!
