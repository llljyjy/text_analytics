One of the best I have used and it’s at an amazing price point. I struggle with acne and have used plenty of acne treatments thought out the years. This one helps reduce blemishes that i see are about to pop up, as well as already formed pimples. Doesn’t dry your skin out, can be used daily in my experience great bang for your buck!
