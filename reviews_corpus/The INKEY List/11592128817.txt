Such a great product for anyone with dry skin who wants to cleanse skin without worrying about drying out their skin and damaging their moisture barrier. I love to use a cleanser after using this cleansing balm so it doesnâ€™t leave any oily residue but I really feel like this product keeps my skin healthy and hydrated. Totally worth it for this price point! LOVE
