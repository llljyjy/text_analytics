I love this moisturizer, but this new packaging is literally the worst. Luckily I still have the pump from my last one and I just used this to refill it. Also, it was half empty. It was factory sealed so I know it wasnâ€™t used, but it was half air. Even when putting it into the older container it was clear it only filled it about half (both claim to be 1.7oz). Because of the stiffness of the tube and it already being mostly air, I could never imagine actually having to squeeze it out of there each time I used it. Love it - hate the new packaging
