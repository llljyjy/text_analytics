Totally worth the price. I don’t see much of a difference in my face when I use this (but it is moisturizing, just not as much as I like for the face even with moisturizer etcetc), but one day I slathered it on my neck, whole chest, and hands. LITERALLY my whole chest was glistening and moisturized. Totally getting this for the rest of my life to use on my neck and chest. I swear by it! I wish they had a bigger bottle though because now I’m using it in my body instead. I do not have sensitive skin so I had no issues. Eh for the face, Wow for the body!
