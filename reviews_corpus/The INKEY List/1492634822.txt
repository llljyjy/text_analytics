I went through a phase where I tried a bunch of INKEY products because of the low price point. I’ve used a lot of clay masks; this isn’t terrible but also there’s nothing really unique about it. I didn’t see any improvements to the oiliness of my skin or to my breakouts (which was my primary reason for trying INKEY products). Not terrible, but I don’t see a reason to buy this again. nan
