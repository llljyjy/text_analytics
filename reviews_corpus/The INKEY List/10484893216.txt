I bought this after seeing it be used on tiktok and I am so glad I did. I have dry skin that get oily without intense moisture. Typical HA wasn’t working well for me. Then I found this product and paired it with the inky list water cream. I use the polyglutamic acid and water cream after an active like aha or lactic acid and the combination of these three products have given me glass skin. I am convinced though that the polyglutamic acid is the game changer for me. My skin is thriving because of this product. I can’t recommend it enough for people with my skin type! Plus I find it to be affordable! See photos attached for how awesome this product has made my skin look! glass skin game changer
