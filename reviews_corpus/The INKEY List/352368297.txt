There’s something about this product that I absolutely love. Can’t put my finger on it but I use it in the morning, along with the Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen Booster and the moment it hits my skin, my skin looks happier, more radiant and youthful. The Q10 has a great consistency. I’ve used a lot of products over the years but this is something different that really works and is more than reasonably priced. It also lasts me about 3 months, which is great! Good things do come in small packages! nan
