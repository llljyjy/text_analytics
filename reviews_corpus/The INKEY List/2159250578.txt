First Inkey purchase after Sephora employee tried to deter me from buying The Ordinary in favour of “clean beauty.“ I’m a bit dubious of greenwashing attempts, and this container is so small that whatever gains are made in eco-friendly production are lost by the need to repurchase constantly. It didn’t blow my mind; it’s heavier and silkier than The Ordinary’s HLA, which can be tacky at times, but I think I prefer The Ordinary’s, simply because it creates a thinner layer on the skin. Won’t be repurchasing. nan
