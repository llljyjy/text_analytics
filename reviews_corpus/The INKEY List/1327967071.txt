I got the mini size, con is that the lid is a twisty rather than an easy open snap. Pure oil came out, not a balm. Doesnâ€™t rinse off with water. I prefer something like precleanse from dermalogica instead, which rinses off completely with water. You get what you pay for. I can make it work for a little bit, not repurchasing again though. Better quality options out there, feels cheap.
