I use a few drops of oil to massage my face daily at bed time. I started with rosehip oil only a few days ago when I ran out of almond oil. I like the way this oil behaves and how much less I need to give myself a 10 minute massage. It is moisturizing for sure. I have dry cheeks with tiny pitted scars from adolescent acne. Waiting to see what it would do to those!  I’m not sure that I would use this during summer but it’s so far been perfect for the winter weather! Subtle moisturization!
