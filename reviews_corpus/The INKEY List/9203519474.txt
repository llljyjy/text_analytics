i recently got this in a sephora store on vacation, and back home i only have sephora in kohl’s near me. it felt super drying on my skin and created a sticky barrier between my skin and moisturizer, not allowing any of it to absorb. i feel like this would do great on oily or combo skin but if you have dry sensitive skin, don’t buy!!! do not use on dry skin!!
