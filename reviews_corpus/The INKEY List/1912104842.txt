This cream is super lightweight and didn’t make my oily skin feel even oilier. It is super easy to blend into the skin and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling. When apply it before I go to bed and I wake up in the morning, it actually feels moisturized. I also don’t have sensitive skin, any skin allergies, or super oily skin so I feel like that is another important point to add as well. I  definitely recommend this cream because it lives up to its name of being a lightweight moisturizer and it is just that for my skin. I feel like this could also work well for those who have sensitive skin or allergies because of how gentle it feels on my skin alone. Very gentle and hydrating moisturizer
