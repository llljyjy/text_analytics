I’ve repurchased this cleanser 5 times. The price is so low compared to other similar face washes, it really is worth at least a try. I have combo, acne prone skin and after using this face wash for a long time now, I’m breaking out less and I feel like my pores are finally clear! I use this with my PMD every morning. my HG face wash.
