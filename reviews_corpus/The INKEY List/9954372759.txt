I’ve had melasma for the past eight years and have tried almost everything to manage it. My skin is sensitive, so if I use something too harsh, it makes it worse. The only thing that reliably worked was Permea laser, but that costs $500 a session. I’ve used Lytera, Casper’s, CE Ferulic, and so many other creams. I’ve found this to be much more effective, and at a fraction of the price. It’s been great for me. Way more effective than expensive alternatives
