This is a great serum. I panicked a little when I realized I was getting some faint eleven lines, so I picked up this product. I’d previously had a bad reaction to tretinoin, so I was worried about trying retinol. This serum is SO gentle though. I did have some light breakouts the first couple of weeks I started using it, but once my skin finished purging I had amazing effects. My elevens and forehead lines have really softened, and my overall skin texture is much more even. The downsides: first the bottle is really small. I see they now have one that’s twice the size, but it appears to be limited edition. Second, it takes a while to absorb. I let all my serum soak in before applying the next one, and out of all my serums this one takes by far the longest. It also leaves my skin a bit tacky. I apply my moisturizer after it which helps with that, but if that feeling bothers you just keep that in mind. Great cost-effective serum
