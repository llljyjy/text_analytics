This serum has a weird smell when you first put it on but it disappears quickly.  Other than that, I love it!  I use it after serums but before moisturizer.   I could also see it being a good primer because it leaves a really smooth finish.  I have also started adding a tiny bit into my foundation.   It makes my skin look really dewy and nice. Smells weird but worth it
