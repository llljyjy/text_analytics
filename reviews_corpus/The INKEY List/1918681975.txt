On my 2nd bottle . Are use this as more of a preventative treatment. I tend to break out during that time of the month and this is when this comes in to rescue. I would recommend this product. I would use a moisturizing cleanser as well followed by moisturizer because it can be drying on your skin.If you would like more details on how I use this , you can check out my video at Melly Be on YouTube.
