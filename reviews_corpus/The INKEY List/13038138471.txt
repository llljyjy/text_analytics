I wanted to try this because it is so hyped by many on social media so I got the mini one and I’m glad I did. It is quite thick for my personal preference and on my oily skin and matte makeup looks it really doesn’t do that much and stays in place. I end up having to use a lot of product (more than my previous product I used) to get the job done. It is also in my personal experience not very good at taking off eye makeup, so I had to use a different type of cleanser for that. I also cannot get over the smell, it reminds me of playdough and is not pleasant. Overall this is best for someone just needing a very simple, budget-friendly first cleanse to take off sunscreen and MAYBE very light makeup, but that’s about it. Too hyped but good for the price
