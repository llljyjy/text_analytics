To be honest, I buy a lot of different facial cleansers and rarely like any of them. In the winter my skin looks dull between drying out in the cold weather and over-moisturizing at night to compensate. Last time, a worker recommended an Ole Henriksen brightening cleanser and I wasn’t impressed. This time I searched for my own cleanser and I just couldn’t bring myself to pay $30 for another cleanser I didn’t love. I found this line and this cleanser was only $10!I am SO impressed with it. After one use, my skin actually looks brighter. The smell is a little medicinal, but after a few washes, I don’t even notice it anymore. I love the way my skin feels when I rinse this off -- slippery and smooth and firm! Another plus side I’ve noticed is that my skin absorbs all my other skin care products SO much better after using this. I have a feeling this will be my go to cleanser from now on! Amazing!
