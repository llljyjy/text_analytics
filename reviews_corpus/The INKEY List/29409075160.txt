My favorite cleansing balm! Fragrance-free, gentle, economical. Iâ€™ve repurchased this so many times. I love that I can use it to take off eye makeup without burning my eyes or blurring my vision. Sometimes the formula separates and gets liquidy, but no matter the consistency it comes out of the tube it always does a great job. Love it
