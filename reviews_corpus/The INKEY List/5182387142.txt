I often have hormonal acne and so when I got this, I was hoping it would either keep it at bay or remove the existing one. It didn’t do any of it and made me breakout more into big pimples :( I stopped using it a week after the breakout seeing that it didn’t help with acne at all. As a face cleanser, it doesn’t foam up, has an ok smell, cleanses all right, doesn’t dry up the skin too much after use. I didn’t find it too impressive for me to buy again.
