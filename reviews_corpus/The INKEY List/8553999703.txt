I bought this cleanser just to try, its very affordable and I enjoy the serums from this brand. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this cleanser, even though it has no added scent the smell that has naturally occurred is very off putting for me, I also felt that it left a layer of some sort on my skin and my skin didnâ€™t feel or look cleansed after works. it's a mehh cleanser
