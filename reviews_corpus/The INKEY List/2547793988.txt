I was a bit surprised by this product! It’s something I didn’t know I even needed but so happy to have found it. I have slight hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and this has seemed to mellow it out with just a few uses! In addition to the redness it seems to help with discoloration from facial acne scars so I’m loving that! It doesn’t dry my skin out at all and the texture is light and comforting to wear at night. reduced hyperpigmentation in just 1 use!
