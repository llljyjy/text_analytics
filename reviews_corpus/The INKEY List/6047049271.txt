I received this product free from Influenster for my review. This product definitely helped with a breakout I had recently but I felt it dried out my skin so I’m not totally sold on it. I think as others have said it’s too high of a percentage. But I’m happy it helped with nt breakout. I think this product could be good if your skin cooperates well with the ingredients and amount in it. nan
