As someone with hyperpigmentation around my mouth and neck this cleanser saved my skin!! I’ve recently experienced really dry skin during the winter months (I live in FL but my skin still gets dry) but this year it was the worse I’ve ever seen. My skin was starting to make me insecure for the first time in a long time so I decided to pick this cleanser up over the oat cleanser and I’m so glad I did. I paired it with the laniege hydrating milk toner, cosrx aha7 power liquid, theinkeylist hyaluronic acid, and vaseline to slug my skin for the past two weeks, and wow. I promise you your skin will thank you!! I’m so thankful for this amazing affordable magic cleanser. SLUGGING WITH THIS CLEANSER SAVED MY SKIN
