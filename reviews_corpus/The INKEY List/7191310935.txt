I was a little skeptical about trying Inkey List Products but I’m SO glad I did. I’ve been looking for a day and night moisturizer for my skin (Oily/Combo/Large Pores/ Acne Prone) and this moisturizer literally just melts into my skin and doesn’t leave it greasy, sticky or nasty feeling as the day or night goes on. I’m not someone who was very fond of cream moisturizers because of my oily skin but this is so lightweight, my absolute holy grail moisturizer! Great for the price, but I do wish they would make larger sizes! YES FOR OILY SKIN
