I noticed that this did help my skin TEXTURE but as far as redness - I think maybe it was a bit too harsh for my skin type. I did read later on that others have had a “purge” which I also experienced with breakouts but the sensitivity, burning, and skin tightness never fully stopped. It’s something I’d like to continue using but haven’t experienced enough help with redness to go out of my way to repurchase. Too harsh.
