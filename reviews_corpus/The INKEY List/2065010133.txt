I am a fan of this! Let me start by saying I was horrible with skin care routine. I have oily and acne prone skin. My pores were huge and I had dark spots.I was a little skeptical with it being at a low price and assumed it was going to be viral like The Ordinary. But I am shockingly surprised with the Inkey List. It does take some time, like all other acne products, to see the difference in your skin. But don’t get discouraged!I start with the salicylic acid cleanser, the PHA toner and then I use the serum in the morning and night followed by my preferred moisturizer not sold by The Inkey List. In a week I have noticed my pores have gone down significantly. My skin is smoother and my dark spots have faded pretty quickly.Don’t hesitate to buy this! This is a must have. A must buy! Don’t let the low price fool you.
