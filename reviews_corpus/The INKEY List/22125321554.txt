When I first received this my first thought was, “This is not gonna last long!” To my surprise though it lasted me a year and a half! Don’t be intimidated by the small size though, if you’re familiar with the Ordinary products it essentially has the same amount of product. This feels really sticky and gooey to use, but after you use it with a heavy moisturizer it leaves your skin moisturized for a looonnngg time!  Disclaimer: My skin is different from yours. What works on me might not work on you. Try the product if you want, but keep in mind results may vary for everyone. Small but Mighty!
