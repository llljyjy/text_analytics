Love this product for double cleansing. At first I was not a fan, as the product was very difficult to get out of the tube the first several times I used it. Now I have no issues with getting product out (I just leave on side of shower, maybe the steam/heat helps?) It breaks down stubborn eyeshadow and mascara and price is very reasonable. Worth trying!!
