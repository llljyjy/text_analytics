I love the ingredients but I am not into the smell or consistency. Feels very grippy on the skin. I do like a little bit of a nice scent and get away with it because my skin doesn’t mind. This one does not have that. I rarely reach for this cream and probably won’t rebuy for myself personally but for someone else I still think the ingredients and price are good. not my favourite.
