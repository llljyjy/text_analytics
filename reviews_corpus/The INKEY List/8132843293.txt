This is the Inkey List Retinol anti aging serum. Purchased it because I wanted to see how well it would help for with uneven texture and dullness, but it became my favorite. The results were amazing and for me the price for it is pretty affordable. They offer two different size bottles and both are affordable in pricing. It’s actually for all skin types too so I say test it out if y’all want. It’s my favorite for my night time routine! Left my skin with an even texture!
