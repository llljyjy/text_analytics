I am liking this product so far. My only complaint is that it seems to soak into my skin a little too fast & it’s not as hydrating as I hoped. But I do have dry skin so I am picky in that aspect. As far as firming and plumping, I totally notice a difference. I’ve always used a peptide serum in my routine so I am easily able to spot results with them. I am just tired of spending a fortune on them. For the price, I’m very happy with this product. Does the Job!
