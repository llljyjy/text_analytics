I have been using this for almost exactly 2 months. I was liking it okay, other than the stinging and hardboiled egg scent. I have not had one single zit for that time, the longest stretch of my whole life, but I think that’s more related to using zinc pyrithione soap for perioral dermatitis at the same time (a complete miracle product). I have to discontinue this moisturizer now because even after more than plenty of application, my skin is visibly dry, with the white skin dust and everything, as if I’m not wearing any moisturizer. My skin just guzzles it and is still parched. I have to really load up on my second layer, Versed sunscreen to rely on it as the moisturizer, and it’s not very helpful at that either-- going to take the plunge for First Aid Beauty intense hydration and see how that works. Inkey peptide has also offered no plumping, and forehead lines are accentuated. I think climate is important here... I’m in a high, ultra-dry, wildfire-smoke climate. I think if I lived in Florida and was drowning in humidity, this product could be excellent. Not for dry skin/climates, great for acne/humidity
