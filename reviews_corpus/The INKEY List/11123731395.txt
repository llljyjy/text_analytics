I have mixed feelings about this INKEY List Omega Water Cream Moisturizer. I like that it’s oil-free, lightweight, and has clean ingredients. When I’m putting it on it doesn’t feel like it’s doing much since it’s so light (not creamy), but somehow it leaves my skin moisturized all day and it doesn’t make my skin oily. This product is fine in the Summer, but I don’t feel that it provides enough moisturizer for colder months. I probably wouldn’t but this again, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a super lightweight and clean facial moisturizer. nan
