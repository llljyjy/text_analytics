So let me start, I normally don’t write reviews, but this time, I had to. Girl, I’m so upset, this was my first TIME using this products cause I heard good things about it on tiktok. The main reason I used this, was because I got 2 small pimples near my nose, and so to get rid of them, I used this. After using this, NOW I GOT MORE PIMPLES ON MY FOREHEAD. isn’t this supposed to get rid/reduce acne ??????  If you don’t have acne, but u get small pimples because of stress/period, don’t get this. I know every skin is different. ugh……
