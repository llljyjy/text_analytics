First of all, let me verify that you should ONLY this product if your skin has many imperfections (such as dark spots, scars, marks...). Because this serum has retinol (the active ingredient which helps visibly lighten marks and discoloration while visibly reducing the depth of scars and evening skin texture). It means it would peel off your skin extremely and turns all your face into redness. But after that hard time (2 weeks give or take), you will notice a little change in your skin (dark spot fading away and skin tone lightened a little bit). Once again, I ONLY recommend this retinol serum to you in that case you want to “peel off” your seriously problem skin.Otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend it for someone has fairly perfect skin. Because you should bear in your mind that Retinol is not for everyone. It’s a Love-Hate product, not a holy-grail.Last but not least, if you wanna use it, ALWAYS use sunscreen during your day time. That’s really important because Retinol would multiply the sensitivity of your skin to UV and make your skin looks worse. Does it's job, but not for everyone
