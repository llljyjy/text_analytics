A word of advice: cut the tube open before you throw it away. I got my second tube and figured I’d cut open my first one and see what I could get out as my final wash before opening the new one. To my surprise, there were AT LEAST 10 more washes in there!!Otherwise, I use this as the first step in a double cleanse, which works very well. It completely removes makeup and sunscreen. After following up with an additional gentle cleanser, my face feels clean and hydrated, never greasy or over-dried. For the quality and the price point, you can’t beat it. Great Product & Cut Before You Toss
