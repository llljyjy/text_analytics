I bought this after reading that this acid could hydrate better than HA, and at the time, my skin was seeming a bit dry using HA and moisturizer. I’ve been dealing with horrible skin (dryness, acne breakouts everywhere, hyperpigmentation) for a few months now, and I’ve been using this product the whole time. I didn’t always have such bad skin using it though. Then, when I ran out of it a few weeks ago, my skin cleared up. A lot. I used it for so long, and I didn’t think that could be a contributing factor, but now I’m led to believe that it perhaps played a part, as well as stress and terrible sleep. Finally, there is such little product in the package. I’ve bought like 3-4 of these vs one serum from The Ordinary that would require the same frequency and quantity each application. Won’t be buying again and I’ll return to my HA. Not a lot of product, and I think it broke me out
