I thought I’d try this because it’s so affordable. The product I received feels separated. Part of it goes on thick like Vaseline, and then while I’m squeezing the thick part out, a thin drizzle of oil leaks everywhere. It doesn’t melt and spread easily so I feel like I’m pulling at my skin unnecessarily when I cleanse with this. Somehow, I still always have raccoon eyes afterward and have to go in with another makeup removed. As others have mentioned, this leaves a very oily residue that is hard to wash off after. There are way better cleansing balms out there. Doesn’t “melt”, product separates
