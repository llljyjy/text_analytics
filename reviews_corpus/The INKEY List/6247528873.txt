Skin isnâ€™t irritated, and I do notice a difference in hormonal acne. Feels like a less-harsh version of ProActiv, but a lot less expensive and rough on my skin. Took a little while to see results on a patch of acne I had on my forehead, but after a week of consistent use, I noticed a change for the better. Will continue to buy. Less harsh than alternatives for a better price
