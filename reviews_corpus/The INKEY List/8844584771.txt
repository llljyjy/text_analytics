I have never taken the time to write a review before but this product has been a staple for me for years now, so I need to talk about it.Starting off, I used to struggle with infrequent acne here and there. It was usually not bad but just a couple pimples, still enough to leave me wondering why I was getting them. I have oil-y skin that gets dry in the winters here. This product does not contribute to making my skin any more or any less oil-y, and does not dry it out. (Though should not be used daily, more like every other day).But since I have used this consistently, for years now, I RARELY get any type of pimples anymore. I never thought I would experience the majority of my days pimple free, but I do and I believe it is largely due to consistent use of this product. I also take a lot of other measures to ensure my skin is healthy (diet, clean pillowcases, hormones in check, etc), but the fact that this product does not break me out, is gentle, and seems to do what it says it will do, at the PRICE THAT IT IS!!, I canâ€™t be more happy with it. One bottle lasts me about 5 months (only need a little bit of product as it lathers well). I will continue buying this and I hope the Inkey List does not change the product ever. nan
