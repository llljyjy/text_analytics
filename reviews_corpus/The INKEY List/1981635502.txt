I received this product for free to test out. I have been focusing on my skin lately and have been trying to clear my old acne spots. I have mainly focused on using chemical peels but was interested in trying a moisturizer type product that I could leave overnight.  While I don’t have super terrible skin I have noticed an improvement in my acne scars. I will definitely continue using it and see if extended use yielded even better results. It’s super moisturizing.
