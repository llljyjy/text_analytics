I am a guy that does not wear makeup but does reapply lots of sunscreen throughout the day. I discovered a double cleanse was best for my skincare routine. I have mostly dry skin and I do not prefer highly fragrant products. This cleansing balm is sooooo soothing to my skin and just really removes all that SPF and dirt from the day before I go in with my cream cleanser. The product feels very luxury but at a price point thatâ€™s hard to beat. I have already ordered my second bottle as I like to be a little heavy handed with this product double cleanse must-have
