So I get the hype. It’s a really, really gentle cleanser. There’s a natural oat smell to it but no true fragrance. It seems to remove light makeup (I only wear tinted spf and powder so keep that in mind) and also removes face stick spf that I wear at the beach well. Sometimes I use it alone or use it as step one or two of a double cleanse. YouTube hype sent me here haha
