I am a convert from Clinique TTDO. This balm is fantastic, especially for the price. The texture does get a bit liquid which I know some people don’t like, but it doesn’t change the way it works at all. Great for removing makeup and a first cleanse. I can’t justify buying a more expensive balm anymore when this is such a great option. nan
