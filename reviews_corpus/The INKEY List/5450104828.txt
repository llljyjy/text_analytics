Okay so I’m on my second full sized bottle of this.I’ve tried a lot of “melting balms“ and micelles water etc. so I can do a double cleanse. This has been my favourite hands down, I ran out and was using another soap in replacement and I needed it. I finally got to a Sephora and got it. It doesn’t irritate my skin, and I like the “non“ fragrance smell. The texture is perfect and my second step is the hylaronic acid cleanser. I have dry skin so the oat cleansing balm makes my face clean & hydrated :) My favourite step 1 of my two step clean!
