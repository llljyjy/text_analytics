I really liked this at first I used this once every 5 days at night after I washed my face and after having no skin irritation I bumped up my use to every 3 days. I always breakout during my time of the month and I feel like the marks have healed and diminished much faster after a few weeks of using this. I also have a scar under my right eye from a dog attack when I was younger that has improved Iâ€™m excited to see if it completely goes away in a few more weeks. Scar Improvement!
