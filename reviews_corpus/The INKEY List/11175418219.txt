I’ve had eczema my whole life so I was thrilled to be able to try this product. I had no irritation and didn’t feel dry at all while using this product. The texture did get a bit smoother. I had no issue switching out this product with my staple moisturizer so I can see myself continuing to use this product in the future. I believe I would need a longer time to see the long term effect of urea but so far I have had good impressions. Great price, not irritating
