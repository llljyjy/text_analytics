I know you’re suppose to give skin products at least a month but I used it 2 days and both days I kept on getting pimples not purging, pimples. I tried it alone one night and as a 1st cleanse the next night because I thought I had used product wrong and both times I broke out. I know it was this product because it’s the only new thing I added to my skin routine. It helped with dry patches made my skin soft. But I wasn’t willing to try it longer because My skin is just recovering fromBad acne and I didn’t want to take a chance. I have sensitive combo acne prone skin. nan
