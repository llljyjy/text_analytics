I really recommend this product for people with sensitive and dry skin as it doesnâ€™t irritate my eczema prone skin at all and is very moisturizing. My face dries up really quickly so this cleanser has really helped with it not flaking up overnight while still being effective in getting rid of all the buildup on my face throughout the day. nan
