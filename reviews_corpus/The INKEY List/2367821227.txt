This product is a no for me. It’s so hard to squeeze out of the tube and it’s ineffective. I barely wear any makeup at all, just light mascara and no face makeup and this can’t remove it. Even going into my 2nd cleanse, it felt like I hadn’t done a first! The biggest no for me is the blurry, foggy eyes and how it never feels like it rinses off. I love this brand and use many other products but this one is a no for me. This is a hard no
