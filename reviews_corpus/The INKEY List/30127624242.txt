Gentle cleanser, leaves my skin feeling clean yet healthy. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dry or over clean. After a few uses my skin felt softer, smoother and looked healthier. After about a month my skin looked a little brighter. I was hesitant about purchasing because some reviews mentioned a strong scent. The smell of this product is a little odd… like a wet forest almost but after you rinse it off there is no scent and honestly I’ll take a nature scent over something that is heavily perfumed and dyed. Great gentle cleanser
