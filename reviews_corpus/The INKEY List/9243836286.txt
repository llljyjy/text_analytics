Tried this after seeing the viral TikTok on mixing polyglutamic acid with foundation. I can attest that this serum softens and almost blurs out fine lines with how plumping moisturizing it is! I have oily/combo, sensitive skin thatâ€™s prone to acne and bouts of rosacea when stressed. My skin often feels tight and dehydrated, so this serum is a must-have for skin like mine! nan
