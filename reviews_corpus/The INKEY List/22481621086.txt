This moisturizer has a  minimalist look in terms of packaging (which I like), but what I love is the fast absorption of the  product once you apply it on your face. Itâ€™s not sticky at all and it helps hydrate my skin especially the areas near my hairline (I noticed my skin is more dry nowadays). I use it in the morning and evening after applying my serums, which is as directed and have been liking it so far.Oh by the way, this product is vegan and also suitable for eczema or psoriasis-prone skin. It might just take longer than 3 months of consistent use depending on the skin concerns. I recommend this if you need hydration for your skin. Fast absorbing
