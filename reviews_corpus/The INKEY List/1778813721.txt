I received The INKEY List Omega Water Cream Moisturizer from PinchMe in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of this moisturizer. It looks like a cream but spreads like a liquid. The scent is unpleasant to me. I donâ€™t feel like this is moisturizing enough for my skin. I would recommend this as a light moisturizer in the summer for those who do not have dry skin. nan
