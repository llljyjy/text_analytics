I love this product! A little goes a long way with this cleanser and I love how it feels on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling really clean and have noticed a big improvement in my breakouts and my pores are cleaner than ever! Definitely feels like I spent more than $10. 100% worth a try! Amazing cleanser!
