I received this product complimentary. After using this product for the past 3 weeks, 1-2 times a week, I don’t really notice any differences that it makes on my skin yet. It broke me out even more than before. I have acne-prone, extra sensitive skin. I used a dime size of the serum, it doesn’t seem to work as well on my skin as the other’s, but that’s alright. However, my skin seems to look more glowing and  more dewy. Not sure if I noticed any differences
