This has changed my skincare game completely. I have combo/oily skin and struggle occasionally with clogged pores. This stuff is a must; it gets all the debris out that my Clarisonic may have missed and really leaves my skin feeling super clean and fresh. Stings a little but that is normal. I use it every other night (use retinol in between) and it is amazeballs. Will never live without this product.
