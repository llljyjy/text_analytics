Great moisturizer that’s I’ve been repurchasing over and over again.. until they changed the packaging. This new packaging is so cheap and the tube is like 3/4 full. Unfortunately I’ll be looking for a new moisturizer. I was able to find 1 more old packaging one at a Sephora going out of business but no more left :( New packaging is not good
