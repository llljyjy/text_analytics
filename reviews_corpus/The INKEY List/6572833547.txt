This product is amazing! I’ve become skeptical about eye creams the last few years but this has proven me wrong. And it’s so cheap! I originally bought this for my boyfriend, he’s a runner so he’s constantly in the sun and he started developing these harsh crows feet around his eyes. I got him to start using this every night and the lines have softened soo much. We’re both amazed. I swap it around in my routine too, I truly feel like it awakens my under eyes and somehow softens my dark circles. It’s definitely worth a try. Must try!
