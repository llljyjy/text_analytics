I have combination skin and get acne bumps around my cheeks/chin and I’ve already noticed it going down within days of using this! And it hasn’t dried out my skin either, which is always a struggle for me with salicylic acid treatments. It also helps because I use their hyaluronic acid (lightly) afterwards at night. YES
