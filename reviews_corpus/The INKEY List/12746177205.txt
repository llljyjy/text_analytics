I used this for 3 weeks and probably won’t keep using it consistently. I don’t break out much and honestly my skin looks a bit worse for wear, if different at all. Green shirt is the before pic. Pros: made my skin a bit smoother feeling; cleansed my skin Cons: when I first used(and if I missed a day) it broke me out HORRIBLY; hard to rinse off; no reduction in appearance of blackheads/pores Mixed results
