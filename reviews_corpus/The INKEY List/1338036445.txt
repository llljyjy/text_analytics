It does the job in removing makeup but I don’t think it does it pleasantly. My tube of this constantly kept separating so every now and then instead of balm squeezing out, it’s this tide of oil. It doesn’t emulsify and rinse off cleanly. I know it claims to be moisturizing and not leave your skin feeling stripped but it leaves a waxy film in the face that feels gross which only goes away once I use a regular face cleanser. Do not get this in your eyes - it will leave a film on your eyeballs. nan
