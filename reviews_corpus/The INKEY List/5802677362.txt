I’m huge face mask person, so I’m really tough on reviewing face mask. This one I would say is pretty decent. I will say it did seem to dry out the oils in my face. However, there are many other mask that do the same thing with other benefits and around the same price point. So it just depends on what your looking for. This is solid brand for basic but effective skin care products… so I would still probably recommend this mask. I just personally probably will not continue to purchase. Okay
