I really like this moisturizer. Initially, I disliked the smell (I assume it’s the natural smell of bakuchiol), but I’ve come to really love it. It’s a super lightweight moisturizer - I use it almost as a thick serum, with either a thicker moisturizer or sunscreen over top for more hydration since I have dry skin. Does it work for anti aging? No idea. It’s certainly not a magic bullet. But it’s an affordable, very lightweight moisturizer that works in my routine and *may* have some anti-aging benefits, so I enjoy continuing to use it. nan
