I bought this product to use as a makeup remover. The instructions stated to apply the cleanser after wetting your face and in my opinion wetting your face before applying this cleanser makes it not work. When I use it without wetting my face it does an okay job at removing my makeup but I donâ€™t think I will be repurchasing this item. I have used better cleansing balms than this one. Not a fave
