I wouldn’t use this product alone because it leaves my face feeling greasy af (expected with an oil cleanser, I assume), but it is the PERFECT first step in a double cleanse! I use the Cerave moisturizing cleanser after, and my face feels squeaky clean. I really started breaking out less after using this combination too! But I’m not an expert, so I don’t really know what I’m talking about lol. Not an expert but this product is BOMB
