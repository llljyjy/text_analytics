I wanted to love this product because I had never tried mandelic acid before and have a lot of post acne marks . However every timeI tried using this it stung my skin. I am acne prone and sensitive so it’s a def no go for me. If you’re normal or more oily and not too sensitive then this could be a win for you thou! Not for my sensitive skin
