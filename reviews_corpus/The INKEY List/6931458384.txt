I couldn’t place it at first, but the scent reminds me of beef broth and someone else commented beef jerky which made me laugh. It’s subtle though, really not a factor in my opinion on the quality of the product. I’ve been using this 2-3x / week at night and have had no adverse reactions. It’s working quite well! I spent a solid month battling on-going breakouts resulting in a bunch of new dark spots and this is absolutely helping to fade them. Subtle beef scent but works great
