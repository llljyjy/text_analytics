I use this every day and the more in the morning after I wash my face apply my toner I take this and the antioxidant and I mix it together I put it on my face I am breaking out a bit but my skin is still getting used to it but my skin feels better than it has and I don’t know how long my only thing is make sure you don’t overdo it or it will look really greasy not glowing nan
