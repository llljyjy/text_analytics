I have sensitive/combination skin. i have very sensitive and break out from time to time .I got this cleanser close to 2 months ago and It cleared up my cystic acne pretty well. I use it after taking off my makeup using Simple-skin so kind Micellar Water. Then I mix this cleanser with a little bit of Simple-skin so kind cleanser. Then I follow up with a toner and other products from this line combined with ordinary line, and my skin is doing great. Works well
