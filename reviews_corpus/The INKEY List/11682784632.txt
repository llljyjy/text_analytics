Fine lines have become much less noticeable on my 71 yr old face. Add collagen booster to my hyaluronic acid serum and my skin drinks it right up. Just a few drops are needed to cover my face & neck. I’ve been using for about 3-4 mos & I can see progress is being made. I use several other serums, and retinol, of course. Consistency is key   along with letting each treatment absorb 30 to 60 seconds. Patience isn’t one of my strong points and waiting for each to absorb was a bit of a struggle but it truly does pay off. Do reccomend, believe you’ll be pleased with the results. Price is great too! nan
