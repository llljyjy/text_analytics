I picked this product up on a whim hoping it would be comparable to the Tatcha water cream, and boy was I blown away! This cream is incredible, lightweight, super hydrating and affordable. I also appreciate that this is in a tube and not a jar, so it’s more sanitary! I haven’t been disappointed yet with a product from The Inkey List Holy Grail!
