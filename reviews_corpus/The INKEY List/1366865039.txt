Did not like this product at all. The texture was super thick when squeezing out. And it was oddly grainy in an inconsistent way. I really wanted to love this product but it would irritate my eyes and leave a greasy residue after rinsing. (I spent extra time trying to emulsify the product before completely rinsing off). Definitely did not enjoy this product at all. Didnâ€™t work for me
