I used this cleansing balm for over a year and it worked well at removing my makeup, including waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It rinses fairly well but I do feel like I needed to be extra thorough in my second cleanse to remove all of it.  I love how affordable this is and it was great for my sensitive skin. I recently switched to a different brand and I probably won’t come back to the oat cleaning balm for a few reasons. The packaging is not good and the formula seems to separate or melt in the bottle sometimes. I think a tub would be better because it’s so thick. It can be either be really difficult to squeeze out or it will be melted. Because it can be so thick (most of the time), it can feel like quite heavy on the face. Overall it’s a great place to start if you need an affordable cleansing balm. It’s gentle and effective but just not the best one out there for me. It might be for you! :) nan
