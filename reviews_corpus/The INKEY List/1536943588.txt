I read all the reviews before purchasing this and unfortunately, I had used it for about a month on and off and overall didn’t see any results with my uneven skin tone. I found this product very sticky and every time I used it I would break out. Great price point, but unfortunately I decided to return as I don’t normally keep products that give me acne. I’m in my late 40s, have combination skin that leans toward very dry. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin after using for 5-6 weeks. I really wanted to love this, but it did nothing for my uneven skin tone. This product was a miss for me!
