I have combination acne-prone skin, wear makeup often, and this cleanser cleanses my skin so well. No breakouts, no tight feeling, just fresh clean hydrated skin. This cleanser has a lightweight gel cream formula that feels nice on the skin. Cons: kinda smells waxy and doesn’t lather but that doesn’t bother me too much. Cleanses well without tight skin feeling
