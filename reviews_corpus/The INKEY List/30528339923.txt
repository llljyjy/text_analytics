I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have redness on my nose and cheeks so I’m happy that I received this product since it helps improve redness on skin. I used it for a few weeks and there’s a difference in my skin. I started seeing less redness. I will most likely purchase this after my current bottle is finished. I recommend trying this if you have a similar skin problem to me. nan
