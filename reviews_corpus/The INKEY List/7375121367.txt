I have lost count of how many of these I have purchased, but itâ€™s a lot. I have dry, acne prone skin and could never find a cleanser that was gentle enough while also clearing up my acne. I use this 2x a day, and follow with the Inky List hyaluronic acid in the morning and then do a more hydrating treatment overnight. I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this really does not irritate it half as much as other cleansers have. I will continue to purchase this, I just wish it had a pump! Saved my skin, never trying anything else
