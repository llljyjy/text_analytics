I don’t usually write reviews, but I was really disappointed with this product. I’ve used other products from the Inkey List and loved them, so I had really high hopes for this. Sadly, it didn’t quite live up to my expectations. I’ve used it for about 6 months, but I recently realized that it wasn’t working for me. I used it to remove my makeup before using a cleanser, and I found that it left a greasy film on my skin. Occasionally, it felt gritty/grainy when I was using it, which makes it a little irritating. I also got it to help with acne but over time it’s made it worse, and it feels like it almost clogs my pores. It’s also separated; sometimes the balm itself comes out of the tube and other times it’s just a liquid. I store it in a dry place, so I’m slightly confused as to how that happened. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend it. I was really disappointed
