I have super oily skin and this felt heavy and just sat there. I don’t think it absorbed at all. It was also difficult to spread, I had to use quite a bit to cover my entire face. I love mandelic acid and was excited to see it combined with retinol but this formulation needs a little work before I would want to repurchase it. It’s not a bad product, it’s gentle and I tolerated it well - no bad reactions. It just wasn’t great for my skin needs. I think this might work better for someone with dry skin. It’s at least worth a try for the price point. It's ok, but I'm not repurchasing.
