Okay so I use this product as my first cleanse in a double cleanse and it’s good- not amazing and not horrible just good. The texture is weird to me, but only satisfying in a way. It doesn’t emulsify as much as I want it too. The price tho-*chefs kiss*!! If you want an affordable balm this is the one! Also my skin feels softer after using it! It’s definitely “mid”!! It’s good I guess-
