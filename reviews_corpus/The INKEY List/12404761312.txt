I hate this new packaging. I’ve been using this forever and was obsessed until they changed the packaging. In the old packaging, this product would last me 2-3 months. In the new packaging, I might get 4 weeks of use out of it. It claims to be the same amount of product, but there’s no way this is true. I’m going to have to switch to a new moisturizer because regardless of the price, it’s a pain to replace this so often. I swear the tube is half full of air. bring back the old packaging!!!
