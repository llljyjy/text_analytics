Really good cheaper alternative to the Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser. Similar consistency, texture, and lather that leaves my sensitive skin feeling clean without any dehydration and gently evens out skin tone. Highly recommend especially if youâ€™re a fan of the Indie Lee one, or gel cleansers in general. Great for sensitive skin with uneven tone
