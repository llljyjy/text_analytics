Agree w other reviews, it definitely helps with skin brightening! The texture is nice and doesn’t pill for me. Also, I have super sensitive skin and this alpha arbutin formula is so far the only one that hasn’t irritated my skin, which already makes it a winner in my books. Super happy with the results I’m seeing! I feel like it makes my skin look extra glowy the next morning. Non-irritating formula for sensitive skin!
