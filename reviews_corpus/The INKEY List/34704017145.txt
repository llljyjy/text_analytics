I love this so much for acne around my mouth and forehead. I use it in the morning before sunscreen. It does contain sulfur so ofc it smells like rotten eggs, but it’s great for the skin and you get used to it. First pic is July 5, second pic is from the 8th! I’ve been using this since 2020, a little goes a long way as I am buying a new one today! I love this so much. I have oily, very sensitive, acne prone skin! nan
