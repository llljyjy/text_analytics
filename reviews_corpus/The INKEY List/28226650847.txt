I actually really enjoy this face wash. Iâ€™ve purchased it now 5 or 6 times and it definitely keeps acne at bay. Especially when I got pregnant. I use the youth to the people moisturizer and it has worked very well. I never write reviews so I must like this! Side note: I tend to have acne prone skin especially when the seasons change or hormones. Oily/combo skin type nan
