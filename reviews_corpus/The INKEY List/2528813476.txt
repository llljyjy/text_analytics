It’s just fine, it’s not a holy grail and it’s not terrible. It gets the job done of removing all my makeup. BUT it is gentle on the skin and doesn’t clog pores or cause any new breakouts. So, I do appreciate that about it. Probably won’t repurchase if I’m being completely honest. I just don’t completely love it, there’s nothing wrong with the actual product. It’s alright, does the job.
