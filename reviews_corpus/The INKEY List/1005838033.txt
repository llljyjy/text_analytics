Made the mistake of buying a full AND travel size. Like all the other low reviews (that I sadly overlooked when deciding to purchase this), it is so thick I had to use all my body weight to get it out of the tube - for real tho. And then oddly, at times it would come pouring out like water. Rancid oil water. I highly encourage you to spend a few bucks more for a product that provides a more luxurious and effective cleansing experience. Worst product Iâ€™ve ever purchased at Sephora. Da worstttt
