This is amazing in a little bottle I need to get a bigger one. I love how this feels the texture is a little sticky but once I put moisturizer on it dissipates. I use glow recipePink juice moisturizer and it doesnâ€™t irritate my acne prone sensitive dry skin. It has been helping keep my skin more hydrated since I stated my tretinoin journey. ooof get it!
