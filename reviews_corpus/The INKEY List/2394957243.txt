Bought this for my teenage son for blackheads on his nose. The texture is nice and he actually uses it everyday! He describes his skin as normal (must be real nice) and he just asked me to order another. Docked one star because he blew through it pretty quickly, but I think we’ll stick with it because of the packaging. He probably wouldn’t use a dropper. I have noticed a clearance in his blackheads after I told him he had to use it everyday. He also washes with a salicylic acid cleanser. No moisturizer at night and spf during the day (if I remind him). Teen boy approved!
