I received this for free from Influenster and The INKEY List in exchange for my honest review. I have struggled with dry skin for years now. I usually feel a tightness to my skin, itchiness, and just general facial discomfort because my skin is dry and can flake. The 10% urea moisturizer from The INKEY List has helped my skin to feel hydrated, soft, smooth, and supple again. Iâ€™m absolutely in love and fully plan to make it a staple in my routine. A new must-have skincare item!
