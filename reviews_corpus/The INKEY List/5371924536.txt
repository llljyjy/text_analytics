I’ve been using this for months and I haven’t noticed any improvements in my hyperpigmentation or my skin. I noticed the tiniest bit of a glow a few weeks in but nothing since then. I’m glad I didn’t have a negative reaction to it as my skin is sensitive, oily and acne prone and I liked that it seemed to work well with the products from my morning and night routine. However, I probably won’t be repurchasing it when it’s done as I’ve had better results with other Vitamin C serums. Just overall underwhelming. Just okay
