Previously used Neutrogena wipes to remove my makeup, but switched to this because I’ve always heard double cleansing is better. I’ve used micellar water which made my eyelids red and puffy. This removes my makeup so well (I use concealer and tons of mascara) and makes my skin super smooth. I am so glad I switched. :) Love!
