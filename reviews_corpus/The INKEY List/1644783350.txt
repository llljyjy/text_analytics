Not a fan of this at all. I have a few issues with this, the main issue is it has a very gritty texture and feels abrasive and harsh on my face like a physical exfoliator. It also leaves a pretty intense residue on my face, of course I always follow up with another cleanser after using a cleansing oil or balm, but this one leaves a lot more residue than others Iâ€™ve tried. Lastly, the formula is basically half balm half oil and it comes out all separated and messy. nan
