This cleanser is really nice! It’s definitely more for treating active acne and acne scars than it is for generally clogged pores, so I would recommend adding something else to your routine to treat that as well if that’s something you’re struggling with. I’m familiar with benzoyl peroxide and was using a cream version of it before, but I prefer the cleanser because benzoyl peroxide is a really strong exfoliant and can bleach your clothing if you’re not careful, and I have bleached a couple of tee shirts in the past from using it but since a cleanser is something you fully rinse off anyway I haven’t experienced that issue while using this product. It greatly improved my acne and scarring so overall I definitely recommend this product! Love It!
