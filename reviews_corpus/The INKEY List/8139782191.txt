So I normally use the Salicylic Cleanser by Inkey, however in a rush I accidentally grabbed this one at the store and didn’t bother looking at the container before I poured it in my hands. Me being lazy I decided to try it out and see how it works for my very hormonal skin. Safe to say this is now my go to cleanser. It’s hydrating, feels like a gel, and leaves my face feeling like a fresh canvas. As someone who struggles a lot with acne finding a basic cleanser is a challenge and I really lucked out with my oopsie! I now rotate this with my salicystic cleanser depending how my face feels and have had great results. Best (accidental) purchase ever!!
