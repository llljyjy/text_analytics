I’ve always used The Ordinaty Squaline Cleanser as my first cleanse to break down my makeup. I loved it but wanted to try something new and this oat cleansing balm was much cheaper per ounce. I’ve tried it twice to give it a fair shot and was very hopeful because I like many of the inkey list products. This oat cleansing balm is gritty (hurts to rub on my eyes and sensitive skin), hard to squeeze out of the bottle (too thick for such a tiny nozzle), and did not break down my eye makeup well (especially my mascara which isn’t even water proof). After double cleansing I still had makeup left around my eyes. I’ve never written a review on here and have never returned a sephora product but I will be returning this tomorrow. I’m so disappointed. If you’re debating between this and The Ordinary, definitely go with The Ordinary! Terrible Compared to The Ordinary Squaline Cleanse
