Usually, it takes months to notice if a product is working, but not this one! Within one week, I could see a noticeable difference in my acne-caused hyperpigmentation. Within two weeks, it was undeniable how fast it was fading my scars! After several months of use, my acne scars are basically gone and my skin is the glowiest/brightest that it has ever looked. I’ve used many different products - high end to low end - and I’ve never used a product that worked so fast and so well. I’ve referred this product to many friends who now swear by it as well. I use in the morning after a clarifying serum and before spf moiturizer. Game changer! Faded acne scars in weeks!
