I bought this cleanser because I had gone to Sephora to get my usual Squalane Cleanser from The Ordinary but was unaware that JC Penny Sephoras don’t carry that brand. The ladies working there recommended The Inkey List’s Oat Cleansing Balm in place of The Ordinary and I honestly think it’s a great cleanser. My only issue is that it did leave a layer of residue on my face that was hard to rinse off with just water, but it came off easily with a wet wash cloth. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and did not wake up with any comedogenic acne and my skin was still smooth and hydrated in the morning. Do I think this product is better than The Ordinary’s Squalane Cleanser? No. But I do think it’s a great alternative for whenever I’m unable to find my usual cleanser. Great product! Leaves my face smooth and hydrated
