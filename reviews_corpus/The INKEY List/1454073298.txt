I have been using a great vitamin C for years and suddenly I got a very dark brown spot on one cheek. I even booked an appointment with my dermatologist to use laser on it. A YT dermatologist recommended Tranexamic acid, but most recommendations were very expensive and I decided to try this one since it was cheap and had good reviews. After a few days, I started to see a big difference and I reschedule my appointment with the dermatologist because I think I might not even need it! I think it works way better than the Vitamin C that I was using. Totally worth it It worked better than Vitamin C
