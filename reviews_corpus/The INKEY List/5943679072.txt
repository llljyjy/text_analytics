Such a great cleanser for this who suffer from sebaceous filaments!! Itâ€™s been such a game changer since the pores on my nose are large and I get a lot of sebaceous filaments. I have dry skin tho so I have to be careful on not using it too much on my forehead or cheeks. But apart from that 10/10!!! nan
