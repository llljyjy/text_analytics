I was so excited for this! I am oily, acne prone and have been dry due to using retinoids/winter and was looking for something hydrating but doesn’t make me look like I’m greasy. It feels moisturizing enough but unfortunately, it feels greasy and oily/sticky. I also can’t stand the smell, its like old playdoh or something ew lol Smelly
