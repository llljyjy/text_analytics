This is not a cleansing balm. It is a gentler type of “apricot scrub.” There are buffing beads in it and had I realised what this product actually is, I would not have purchased it. I used it as directed and it failed to remove all of my makeup. As a tretinoin user, buffing beads are not something I want to put on my face, ever. Do not waste your money! No good
