Tbh I don’t feel like this did anything at all for any blemish I applied it to… everything seemed to take the normal amount of time it always takes to heal and it didn’t seem to act as a preventative treatment against acne or bumps either… so why exactly did I pay $8.99 for this?? I mean, luckily it is a more affordable product so I didn’t waste too much on it, but I still would rather not be wasting money on a product that does absolutely nothing for me… Very mediocre, didn’t notice any difference at all
