This is fine. It gets the job done well enough but it separates easily, so when I squeeze the tube a bunch of straight oil comes out and then the thicker part of the cleanser is difficult to squeeze out. I wouldn’t mind the separation except that the tube is too stiff so it is not easy to massage it and mix everything together again. Otherwise this cleanser is completely unmemorable. I’ll use it up but I won’t be repurchasing. Just OK
