I would only recommend using this product as part of a double cleanse routine. It melted my makeup off great, but definitely felt waxy afterwards. After using my other regular cleanser though, I couldn’t feel the residue anymore. It works well in my skincare routine, but I don’t think this would work well for everyone. nan
