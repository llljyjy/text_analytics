I’ve gone through 2 bottles of this and will continue to buy it because I see a difference more than other products I’ve used, and I appreciate that this is a clean item. However, I wish they made a higher % of salicylic acid. My esthetician sold me a 10% that worked a bit better than this but was 3x the price. For all you oily folks out there I recommend trying this. And for those who menstruate, use 2x a day the week leading up to your period when you a more prone to oily skin. Great everyday product!
