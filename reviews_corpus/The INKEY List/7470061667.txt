My holy grail for double cleansing!! I use this first to melt my makeup off and then I add a bit of water to lather it before I rinse it off with water and process with my 2nd cleanser. My holy grail cleanser to go with this is the cera ve one!! After using both products my skin feels so clean but not stripped. I see a bunch of comments complaining about the product separating but it takes like 2 seconds to tap the bottom of the bottle onto your palm to bring the product down to the bottom before squeezing lol. If you’re not into double cleansing then this product isn’t for you though! holy grail!!
