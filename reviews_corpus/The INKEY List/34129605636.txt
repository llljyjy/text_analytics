To the reviews that are saying its to oily, you’re probably not using the double cleanse method. It’s a great cleanser. Usually will double cleanse if I wear sunscreen/makeup in the day. Has a really nice smell & is bigger then I thought it would be. With the price, it definitely intrigues me to repurchase this product if it were to become an empty! Watch out for other reviews
