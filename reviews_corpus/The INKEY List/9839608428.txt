I got this on a whim while at sephora cus i had realized i had ran out of makeup remover. i’ve heard many positive reviews on tiktok so I wanted to try it and assumed I would love it. To be honest, it’s okay you kinda get what you pay for . i kinda have to rub hard and go in a second time just to remove mascara with this while with other cleansing balms I remove it effortlessly. Some love this product and swear by it, but it just wasn’t for me. nan
