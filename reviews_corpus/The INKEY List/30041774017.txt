This product has helped me fade hyperpigmentation way faster than it would’ve naturally. I did see some reviews and wondered if it would work for me; it did. I introduced this into my routine slowly so my skin wouldn’t get sensitive (started with every other night then progressed to every night). I saw a huge difference after I started using this product consistently. Definitely worth a try Works but you gotta be patient and consistent
