After using this product for about 3 weeks, I have noticed my makeup stays on longer and my skin is less oily throughout the long work days. But it did not dry out my skin. It goes on smooth and is light weight! It can be used in combination with other serums and creams. It doesnâ€™t have a strong smell like some other oil control serums do. I would recommend this product for someone with oily to combination skin. nan
