I am on my 3rd tube of this, it is a light pink, slightly shimmery cream. You squeeze a small amount out into the metal applicator, this feels great to swipe on lids, upper lids and particularly under the eye. This isnâ€™t incredibly hydrating but it absorbs quickly, definitely depuffs, feels cool and gives a subtle brightening effect. I have found that it improves application of concealer, I get a smoother application of my thicker more pigmented products. On my 3rd tube!
