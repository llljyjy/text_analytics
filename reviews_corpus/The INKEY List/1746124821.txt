Was waiting for this to show up on Sephora for a while, as the ingredients sounded promising and I really like Inkey products. Unfortunately, this missed the mark for me. It isn’t moisturizing on its own and I need to layer toner and serum for my skin to not feel dry. It also has a LOT of mica, which I wasn’t expecting. I don’t feel comfortable wearing it to bed because the mica makes it feel more like a makeup product than a skincare product. I’ve also experienced breakouts recently which is unusual for me, though I can’t definitively connect them to this product. I have about half the tube left but will probably finish it up on my hands or chest, and will not repurchase. nan
