I forgot usual cleanser at home on recent trip. I purchased the first mini cleanser I came across. The size and pricepoint was perfect just in case I didn’t like it, or no mroom in carry on bag. I wasn’t expecting much. I have oily skin w/ huge, congested pores on nose. I immediately noticed cleaner, smoother,softer skin without feeling stripped. It didn’t have much of an effect on my congested pores but to be fair, neither has any other product Ive tried. I would recommend this product  to those with oily or.combo skin. Pleasantly surprised!!!
