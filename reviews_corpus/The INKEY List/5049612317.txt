I switched from the ordinary’s hyaluronic acid to this on a whim and loved it. It didn’t pill like the ordinary sometimes did (which I know can sometimes just be a bad combo of moisturizer and serum) but i found this really helped repair my moisture barrier with consistent use and pairing it with a solid moisturizer. Will continue to repurchase Easy on the wallet and great on my skin
