I bought this moisturizer for the bottle and the reviews. The bottle was not even half full and I contacted the brand and they informed me that it is the new packaging. I am so aggravated since I spent $15 for a tube that wasn’t even half way full. The company reached out to me and told me that it is normal for it to not be half full…the old packaging at least “hid” the fact it wasn’t full. As far as the moisturizer goes- I don’t think it’s anything special. Cerave cream works just about the same. (Also my photo was of my husbands hands they were gross lol) nan
