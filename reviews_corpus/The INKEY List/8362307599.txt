Besides what the other reviews say, I actually enjoy this moisturizer as a backup pick. My skin feels moisturized and it’s lasts me 5-6 months for the money. My skin type is a bit on the combination side so this product helps, but can be a little too heavy for my oily areas. This moisturizer has helped with my moisture barrier when it’s had a rough patch, I’d recommend it. If it doesn’t work for some skin types, it was a waste of a lot of money in the end. Enjoyed it
