Love this oil, especially to combine with a toner and moisturizer after exfoliating, or using a chemical peel. This really gives any stubborn dry skin a kick and it`s not overwhelming for my skin as in it does not feel greasy at all even when combining with a moisturizer. This product has also lasted a long time, a little goes a long way. Best of all, this product does not cause me any break outs. Love, Highly Recommend
