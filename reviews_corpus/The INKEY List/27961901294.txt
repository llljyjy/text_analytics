I recently purchased this product. This product does clear your skin of blackheads. I have been using this for 2 months now and can see the difference. Although, I do think that the cleanser does not create a lot of foam on my face. Maybe this is typical for other cleansers too. Does anyone else experience a similar situation? Will definitely buy it again!
