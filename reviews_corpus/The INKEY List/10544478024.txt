I have tried many Hyaluronic acids because I felt like for some time it gave me a boost of hydration. The ordinary one was okay and this one feels the same. I prefer Niacinamide because it does the same thing. Personally, this one was too watery and sticky for my preference. Since then, I completely removed the Hyaluronic acid from my routine and went straight to serum. A bit too watery and sticky?
