I was kindly gifted the Omega Water Cream moisturizer in exchange for my honest opinion. I like the simple packaging that the moisturizer comes in. It is really light weight and works well with my current skincare routine. It has 5% niacinamide which is my current favorite ingredient however, my skin needs a little more moisture when it’s cold. I’m sure this will be great for the summertime Lightweight moisturizer
