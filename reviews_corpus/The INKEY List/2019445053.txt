The color reminds me shea butter (which is also part of the ingredient) and the active retinol is okay-safe for my sensitive skin, but not my favorite. The odor is mild strong.I hate how product reminds me old, expired milk. I prefer a different retinol ingredient. Packaging says it takes about 6 months for results to appear. I had to used non-inkeylist products to boost my collagen. I will use the remaining product, but at this age, I need a bit more percentage and/or different retinol. I see mild results. Only recommend for sensitive skin. Good 1st product to try. (my 2nd retinol product) Somewhat satisfy. Odor and appearance discourages
