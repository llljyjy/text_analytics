I’ve been using this cleanser nightly for 3 months now, and I’m really enjoying it! I’m only about a quarter way through the bottle too, so it’s going to last a while. This cleanser is very gentle, and not irritating at all. It didn’t clear my skin completely, but I wasn’t expecting any cleanser to be able to do that. For the price point, I’m happy! Love!
