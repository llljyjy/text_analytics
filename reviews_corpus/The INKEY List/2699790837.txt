I received this product to try at just the right time . I recently had a very bad breakout and picked at few of the pimples . I now have some scars from the ordeal . I have been using this nightly and I do think it helps . Slowly though. Fingers crossed . I do see slight improvement . Hoping with continued use the discoloration of my skin will continue to improve . I didnâ€™t find this to be irritating at all and my skin can be rather sensitive at times . Didnt cause any more breakouts . I love that its affordable . I am certainly becoming a fan of this brand and want to try more products from them . Worth a try
