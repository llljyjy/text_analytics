Oof, no no no. There is no way you could convince me that it actually cleanses the skin. It leaves a slimy, gunky residue no matter how hard you try to rinse it off. I used it as the first step in my double cleanse routine, and I can feel the residue even after Iâ€™ve washed with a cleanser. Glad this was so cheap because it was a total waste of money! slimy, gunky residue
