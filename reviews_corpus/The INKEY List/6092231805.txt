For context, I have combination acne prone skin with a lot of hyperpigmentation. I have been using this cleanser for about 2 months now and overall I feel it is a good basic cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, and I particularly like using this as the second part of my double cleansing routine. So far, no breakouts after using which is always a good sign. It is not super hydrating but doesn’t leave my skin overly dry either. As far as the brightening claims, I am not quite sure; it could be that I need to continue to use this product to see results, though I do see a bit of a “natural“ glow due to the light exfoliation which does help my skin to appear a bit brighter. Instead, I think this cleanser makes a good start for a routine that includes other brightening and skintone evening products. Overall considering the price and amount of product you get, this cleanser is worth a try. Worth a try
