I’m very happy with this product. This is the first retinol product I’ve used. I picked this one because it’s not super strong & had a ton of great reviews. The price also fits my tight budget. I started slow & used every other or every 3rd night & noticed no redness or irritation. The fine lines starting on my forehead don’t look any different but my skin is much smoother & less bumpy. My red marks from old acne do seem to be fading. The scent reminds me of something familiar that I can’t figure out (oatmeal?), but it’s mild and it doesn’t linger. It is slightly tacky when applying & a lil hard to spread but it seems to sink in ok. I do wish the bottle was bigger & I would love a flip cap instead of twist on. Great Retinol for Beginners
