I’ve been using the Inkey List hyaluronic acid cleanser on my body as I suffer from some chest and back acne. I don’t feel like this dries out my skin like some other cleansers but I also have not been super impressed with the effect it’s had on my acne. Maybe for others it will? Didn't really work for me.
