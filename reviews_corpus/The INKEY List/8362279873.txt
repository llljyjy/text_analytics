This is the 2nd time I’ve purchased this salicylic acid and I really love how this has changed the texture of my skin. I also use the hyaluronic acid afterwards from this same brand. I only started using these because at the sephora in Montebello Rue suggested I get these and they are great. The sephora I went to this time the workers are definitely not as friendly, it is a larger store but I rather have better customer service.Also Rue took the time to help me find the right make-up for my skin color and skin type. She’s awesome! nan
