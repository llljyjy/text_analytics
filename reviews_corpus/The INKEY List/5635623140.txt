I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks and it seems to be a nice, silky moisturizer.  The packaging, however, is terrible.  Pressing down on the pump sort of worked for the first week only. I’ve unscrewed the top looking for a clog, shaken the container, thumped it in various directions, and sometimes the pump works for a squirt or two, but it always stops working.  If I want to use the product, I’ll have to just unscrew the entire top and put my fingers in. Nice moisturizer but terrible packaging
