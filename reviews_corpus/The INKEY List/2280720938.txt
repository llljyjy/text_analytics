I’ve been using this product since July 2022 and my acne has not gotten better. Maybe worse. That’s probably not because of the product and maybe I need to use a retinoid for my acne, but this didn’t work for me. It is a cleanser so it does work in that sense, but it has not helped my acne. Fine Cleanser. Not-so-fine acne fighter.
