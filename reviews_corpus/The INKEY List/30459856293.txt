I got a sample of my this from the Inkey List and fell in love with it. I don’t have acne, but I get hormonal breakouts every month. This cleared them up. No cleanser or skincare product I have ever used has been able to get rid of them. This cleanser was the only change I made in my routine. It’s magic, and the full size tube is huge! It’s an excellent value for the amount of product you get. The sample version lasted me a month, so I can’t imagine how long the full size will last me. inexpensive and works
