I was prepared to feel that this was overrated based on how talked up it was and my first impression. It’s a thick, oily balm that feels nourishing (rather than light and plastic-y like some balms) on the skin. It definitely does feel softening and leave a bit of oiliness behind, which is why my first impression was that it wasn’t different from other oils. However, it quickly grew on me. I love the texture, that it’s fragrance free, and leaves skin feeling soft and much cleaner than other first step cleansers. Enough so that I (as a person with dry skin) have used this alone without a second cleanse before and been fine. When my partner, who has combo skin, was experiencing some sensitivity, this worked super well as a solo cleanser, too. We have now each finished 2 travel sizes and one full size, and will continue to repurchase. It’s gentle, effective for removing all makeup and sunscreen, no fuss and super cost effective for such a great quality product. I don’t love the packaging on the mini size, it’s more rigid than the full size bottle so I definitely had to cut it to get the last of it out, but I appreciate the emphasis on being recyclable. I've already repurchased
