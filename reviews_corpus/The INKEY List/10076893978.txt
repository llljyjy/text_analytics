Before buying it, I was watching reviews about the product, there was some amazing reviews. While using it, the product offers real hydration, it gives a perfect glow, not too much. I have an acne prone skin, and this product doesnâ€™t give an oily finish. It is really soft to apply, but the only things that is less enjoyable, is that it dries really quickly after direct application of the product! nan
