I’ve struggled with blackheads since I was a tween, and nothing has helped draw them out better than this product. It’s lightweight, non-sensitizing, has a very light smell, and isn’t to sticky, It’s also cheap! I’ve been using this product for years now and will continue to swear by this for helping my acne prone, very oily skin. Thank you Inkey List!! BEST for Blackheads and Oily Skin
