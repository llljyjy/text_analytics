I saw someone online recommend using this as a lip plumper, so I totally wanted to try that out. IT DEFINITELY WORKS! I apply twice a day, dab a bit on my lips, do my hair/skincare while I wait for it to dry (takes like 3 mins), then lock it in with La Neige lip mask. I notice my lips are smoother and plumper .. not like an overlined look, just a more poutable look. Lip plumper - works great!
