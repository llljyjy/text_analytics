Believe me when I say I’ve tried just about every retinol product there is.  I’ve spent close to $100 for a product, and while it was great, the Inkey List Retinol was every bit as good.  I wake up with soft, smooth skin, and at age 67, that’s a huge factor! In fact, all of their products have amazed me.  You can’t go wrong with the Inkey List, and price-wise, you get the best bargain ever. The Best there is!
