I use this as a first step for double cleansing. Takes off most makeup but doesn’t work very well on waterproof mascara. When I use with a second cleanser there isn’t any residue on my skin leftover BUT I find it leaves my eyes very blurry after like it’s stuck inside my eyes. It does say don’t use around eye area though lol. not for waterproof mascara
