this product literally destroyed my skin for a solid month lol itâ€™s slowly healing but the amount of damage this did to my skin will take some time to fix. I used to mix this in with my moisturizer because of how strong it is, but it was still super damaging. normally i love the inkey list so idk maybe my skin is just not a fan of vitamin c. damaged my skin :/
