I had such high hopes for this product but I just don’t like it. The tube itself is frustrating to get product out of. The product is also too thick and does not feel nice on my skin, and almost feels like I am tugging on my skin because it doesn’t glide nicely! I prefer oil cleansers because they feel much nicer and seem to work better at getting SPF and makeup off! Prefer Oil Cleansers
