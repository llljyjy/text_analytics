The reviews on this is what made me purchase as my next facial cleanser with hopes that it would be a budget friendly option. When I wear a full face of make up, I start removing g before I even wash my face with make up remover, then cleanse. I did the same thing with this cleanser, and when I looked in the mirror, there were still residual make up stains on my eyelids and around my eye. I took some of my micellar water and it took 2 cotton pads to remove all the make still on my face. My search for an affordable yet effective face cleanser continues nan
