It’s a no from me. I used the SR UFO oil for the longest time and loved it but wanted to change it up a bit so I bought this. I used it a few times and couldn’t get over how sticky and tacky it made my face feel, it felt tight. I tried to put thick oils or heavy moisturizers to try and counteract this tackiness but nothing helped. I also saw no results. I’m giving this a two stars because it’s cool in theory and I love the price but did nothing for my skin. Price ain’t everything I guess, cheap or expensive. nan
