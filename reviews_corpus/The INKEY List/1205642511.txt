Foams nicely with only a tiny amount, more of a squeaky clean feeling than I usually go for.  Gets most makeup off, but I still need a pass with micellar to get all the mascara smudge off. Can’t say I’ve noticed a particular brightening effect, but I’d happily use this as a travel or in shower cleanser. A decent squeaky clean type cleanser
