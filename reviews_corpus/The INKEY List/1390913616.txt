I love INKEY List products and was excited to try this.  I do not have much of hyperpigmentation or dark spots on my face, but a few spots I definitely notice and have had for a long time and can’t seem to get rid of.  Bottom line - if your blemishes are new, this will definitely help rid of them fairly in short time.  If they are old, they will take a long time to get rid of.  But consistency is key, and this treatment is great and a little goes a long way.  And, for this price, you just can’t beat it!  Highly recommend! nan
