Cheap, effective, and gentle cleansing balm. I use this to remove my sunscreen and follow up with a water based cleanser. My skin is very dry and sensitive but I never have to worry this over stripping my skin. The packaging isnâ€™t my favorite since the product does separate and its a bit tricky to shake up and re combine in this bottle, but especially given the excellent price this is a small gripe.
