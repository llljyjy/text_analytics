I initially got this because I wanted to start using a daily antioxidant, and I was hesitant about diving in with an expensive vitamin C because of how easily it can degrade. I figured for the price, it couldn’t hurt to just try it, and I’m so glad I did! I use it everyday and have gone through several replacement bottles since I discovered it. I definitely see this as more of a preventative product rather than one that will provide an amazing immediate result, but it’s a great texture and gives a nice soft hydrated feel when applied.
