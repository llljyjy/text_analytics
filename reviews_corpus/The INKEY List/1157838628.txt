Love this balm! I have sensitive skin and redness. It has kept redness at bay and my skin feels great after cleansing. Using a balm was new for me and it took me a few days to get used to the consistency, so worth it! I love this cleanser and will try more form the brand. New cleanser - will not go back to my old ones!
