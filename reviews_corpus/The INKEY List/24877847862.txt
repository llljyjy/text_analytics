I received a free sample of the INKEY List Mandelic Acid Treatment from PINCHme. I myself have had a good experience with the sample I was given. I suffer from acne, so I have a lot of pigment discoloration and scaring. It does take a bit of time, but my skin looks more even than it did before I started using it. Helps even skin out
