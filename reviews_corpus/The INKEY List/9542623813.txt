I purchased this alongside the HA serum. I’ve been using this cleanser as my second cleanser following the Inkey List’s Oat Cleansing Balm, which is my favorite. I like this, and use it as my go to on days on my wearing foundation. Honestly, it’s a great cleanser, and it does fully clean my face. However, it doesn’t give me the full lather, which I just personally like. nan
