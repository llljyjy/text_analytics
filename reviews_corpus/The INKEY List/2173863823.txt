So finally writing a review of The INKEY List after a few months of use with the following products:- Salicylic Acid Cleanser- Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum- Beta Hydroxy Acid Serum- Polyglutamic Acid SerumAfter using these products in order and eliminating all other products, ultimately all of these were a dud for me. I ended up with more acne that I have ever experienced that just wouldn’t go away. It’s very unfortunate cause (1) The price is great for these, yes a bit on the small side, but I found a little did go a long way. (2) These came highly recommended for acne-prone skin, and I had a couple of blemishes here and there that I wanted to keep away. (3) The ingredient list seemed to be minimal and fragrance free. Added a star because, I do understand this does work for a lot of people and my skin did feel clean and not dried out. However, the amount of acne that appeared on my forehead and chin was shocking. Even changing out my pillow covers frequently (which I do already and use a fragrance free detergent). I had been using The Ordinary products for years and wanted to give these a try since I heard amazing things and the packaging travels well for the amount of traveling I was doing recently for work. I don’t like to waste products so since I am almost done, I will finish them. I’m glad I did try them out though, but I will not be purchasing this brand again unfortunately, Bummer, but sometimes it takes trial and error. Unfortunately just didn't work for my skin at all.
