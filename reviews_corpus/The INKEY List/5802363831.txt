this stuff is awful. like many have said before, the oil and balm don’t mix together, I’ve tried shaking and massaging the tube before using in hopes of mashing all the product together for it to mix, but that’s annoying of course when you can find many cleansing balms that aren’t the hassle. on top of that, this is just the worst to rinse off, you really have to have a heavy hitting cleanser to wash it off. I dreaded coming home and removing my makeup when I was using this, once I actually got a GOOD cleansing balm (shout out to Farmacy), I remembered wow, removing your makeup doesn’t have to be annoying. nooo.
