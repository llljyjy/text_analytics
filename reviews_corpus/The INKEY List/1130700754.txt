I use a dermaroller twice a month, and really need something gentle to help restore the moisture barrier in between treatments. This fit the bill, but only if you don’t use it as instructed. I apply it to damp skin after I use my essence, and then apply my regular biossance moisturizer on top. Maybe of I didn’t have such dry skin or used moisturizing serums on top this would be enough for me, but without a moisturizer on top of this my skin still feels tight. Paired with my moisturizer my skin seems to bounce back much faster after dermarolling I don't use it as recommended...
