Decided to try this product after being sick of makeup wipes. This melted my makeup off in less than 2 minutes, which is much shorter than it would take for me to remove my makeup with wipes. DEFINITELY double cleanse with this product. I follow this up with the inkey list fulvic acid brightening cleanser and it takes the greasy residue off very well. I wet my hands, splash my face with water and then rub the balm onto my face and find that this method works best. Get this if youâ€™re sick of makeup wipes
