I’m not mad at this product given the low price point. I have been using it as instructed and I really don’t notice a big difference. That said, I have dry skin and this didn’t dry me out or leave my skin feeling tight afterwards like other clay masks, so that’s a plus. I won’t be repurchasing though because I just didn’t feel like it did anything for my skin, but as a more dry/combo skin type I think clay masks just might not me for me. NOT GREAT, NOT BAD, JUST OKAY
