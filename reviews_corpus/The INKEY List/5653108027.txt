I have pretty dry skin. I apply this moisturizer in the AM and PM, but it doesn’t keep my skin moisturized in between applications. It hasn’t caused any breakouts and my skin is really sensitive. I love the dispenser it comes in and the price is great. I will be trying another product once it’s done. I need more moisture! If you have dry skin, this is not your moisturizer
