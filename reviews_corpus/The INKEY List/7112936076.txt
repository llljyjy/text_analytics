I really enjoy this cleanser. My previous one was clearly stripping my skin in comparison. My skin has been perceptibly less red and irritated after washing. This has a very light watery consistency. I use an oil cleanser before anyway so I’m not missing anything. The bottle is also a nice shape that’s comfortable to hold. 10/10. Really Recommend
