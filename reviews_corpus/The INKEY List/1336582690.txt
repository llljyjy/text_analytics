I just finished my bottle of this and while I don’t have any big complaints, I won’t be repurchasing as it just isn’t a good fit for me. I thought it would be good for use when working out and under heavier foundation, but the dry parts of my combo skin sucked it up like a sponge, to the point I had to add an additional moisturizer. I figured I would wait for summer, but ended up moving to a much drier climate late spring, so no fault of the product! This still gets 4 stars from me as I think it would be fantastic for those with oily and acne-prone skin, and the first few times I used it on its own, liquid foundation sat nicely on top of it. Bought it thinking it would be more of an inexpensive alternative to Clinique Moisture Surge, but it’s definitely lighter. But again, worth checking out for oily skin for sure! A Great Product, Just Not For Me
