1 star for mild exfoliation due to the Urea on elbows or feet. 1 star for nice texture that hydrates and sinks into skin. 1 star for nice formulation with non-comedogenic ingredients like Squalane, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, and Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour. Docking one star for the expensive price for such a small tube of product and the cheap coconut oil derived highly comedogenic ingredients like Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride and Glyceryl Stearate Se. Docking one star for causing sensitive skin on my face to feel as if it were burning due to Urea and causing my acne-prone skin to breakout. I will use the rest of this on my body, most likely my feet, but I will not repurchase. For the same price, they could add more exfoliating ingredients (AHA/BHA, etc.), and make this into a large, 12oz. pump bottle, and market it as a body lotion, and then I would repurchase. NOT for my Acne-Prone peeps! Good as body lotion?
