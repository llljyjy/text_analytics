Iâ€™ve been using this product for over 3 weeks, I received it for free for my honest review. I have very oily skin and I applied a little bit in the mornings to see how it will hold up all day. I work in a school and in a small town that gets up to 114 degrees F. So my face did get oily by the end of the day even while using this product. But I did notice my face clear up a bit with my pores. I have a lot of pores around my nose area and my make up looks clearer with this product. Like it not love it.
