This Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser by Inky List is is by far one of the best Cleansers I have used. It is specialized for oil control for normal to oily skin types. I liked especially was how this cleanser was able to clean and refresh my face while still being gentle. Previous face cleansers I had used either were too harsh and overly striping or left my face with leftover residue. I began using this product consistently and after a week or so my face began clearing up without the assistance of any other skin care products. I now have clear skin save for the occasional small breakout, a big feat considering I struggled with acne previously.I have received The INKEY List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser free from PINCHMe in exchange for my honest review. Great Product.
