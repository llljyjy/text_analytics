This is a staple in my skincare regimen. I’m happy to have found a product that is both gentle & removes makeup/tinted products without stripping the skin. I’m not sure that it “brightens” my skin as it purports to do,  but it doesn’t dull it, either. It’s a great price point for me & cleanses, which is all that I ask for in a cleanser.
