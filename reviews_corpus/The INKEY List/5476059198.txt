I wanted to try this cleanser out to see if it can replace my more expensive cleanser. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing. It felt to me like I had to use a lot of the product to cleanse my face properly. Also, it being an acid cleanser, I was hoping it would help me decrease the amount of time in-between my AHA/BHA masks, ... but it didn’t really.On the plus side, it didn’t break me out and it’s cheap. just MEH.
