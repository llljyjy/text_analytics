Not only is this product a no for me, itâ€™s an absolutely not! I love a good cleansing balm for the first step in my double cleanse and I am forever looking for more affordable options. I loved that this product is in a squeeze tube rather than digging around in a jar. I had to wash my face THREE times after using this product because of the waxy film it left on my skin. Not to mention it only removed maybe ten percent of my makeup. All around a horrible product. Do not recommend. Ever. Absolutely Horrendous
