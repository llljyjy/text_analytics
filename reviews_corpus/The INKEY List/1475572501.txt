I need to start off by saying that for the price, this brand is an amazing value. I have never disliked anything I’ve tried by Inkey. I really don’t feel like the ingredients are any different than the more expensive counterparts that I have tried. I’m 40, so I have really been trying to incorporate acids and serums into my routine (day and night) before my sunscreen or moisturizer, since I’m not quite ready for laser peels, etc. This one doesn’t smell great, but I actually prefer that to some overwhelming fragrance that does nothing for my skin but add another chemical. I have been using this treatment for about 2 weeks every night before a serum and moisturizer and I really do feel like I’ve had less redness and little bumps that I tend to get on my forehead. I would recommend this product for sure. Great Acid Treatment!
