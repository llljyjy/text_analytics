There is no better cleansing balm or oil (that I’ve tried) out there, particularly for sensitive, redness-prone. Most derms will tell you to wear heavy mineral sunscreen but then say to use a mild, lotion-like cleanse that does nothing to take it off. It is essential to remove mineral sunscreens with an oil or balm, and maybe follow up with a mild double cleanse. This one is perfect for that, with or without the double cleanse.I like that there is no offensive smell or added fragrance. I did notice the second tube seemed a little thicker then the first, but if you shake it and squeeze the tube, it’s fine. It smoothes on easily, and rinses clean with warm water. I don’t detect any film after at all. Finally, you don’t need much. but you also don’t have to feel like you’re rationing it because of the price. It is so affordable. I have also tried the Paula’s  Choice cleansing balm, but it is much smaller and more than twice the price.  I like that one, but don’t love it. When I use the PC to take off mascara, it stings my eyes. The Inkey List takes off my eye make up without any issues. I hope this helps someone out out there decide. nan
