I am so happy to have found this product! I have struggled with acne, all my life, and nothing worked for me... I even broke down and put the dent in my wallet to buy proactiv just because I was so desperate for something to work. I found this product, after hearing about this brand by someone I watch on youtube, and I was amazed with how cheap it was... then I stayed to use it and I fell in love and almost cried when I saw the difference it started to make. This cleanser and the omega water cream lotion (from the same brand) is absolutely amazing together. Finally!
