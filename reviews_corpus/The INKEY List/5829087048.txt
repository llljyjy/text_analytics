I’ve been using this 2-3 times a week, and it’s not really impressing me. I haven’t noticed a big difference in my skin texture since I’ve started using it. It definitely stings a bit when you put it on, and I wouldn’t recommend it for sensitive skin. The price is great, but the bottle was also surprisingly small. nan
