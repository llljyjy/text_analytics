This has worked great for my skin! Really helps remove dirt and makeup and protects against irritation. I usually use this on a dry face, emulsify with water, then add a little Bioderma Sensibio cleanser to get everything off. My skin became incredibly dry and irritated last year, and this has really helped bring it back to life. Only taking away one star for the packaging.. itâ€™s super thick, and the squeeze bottle makes it hard to get out, especially as it becomes more empty. Worth it for the price tho! Effective and gentle cleansing balm!
