Love this lightweight moisturizer! This works really well as a base for SPF during the day and helps reduce whitecast and reduce any dryness from retinols the night before. I’ve even used this under another moisturizer before bed for additional hydration and it works really well. Also, it’s a great value and works just as well, if not better than other lightweight moisturizers I’ve used. This has also been helpful when I have acne and don’t want to use a lot of moisturizers on my face because it’s so lightweight. I would definitely recommend this! nan
