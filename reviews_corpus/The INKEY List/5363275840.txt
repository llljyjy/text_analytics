I have combo skin during summer. I’m simple and not picky about products as I don’t have sensitive skin or other skin issues. I found that this cleanser did it’s job with cleansing that white stuff that fills your pores after you neglect skin care for a couple of weeks. I didn’t have any bumps or breakouts before using this. After using this one time, I did develop 2 pimples...one on cheek and one near my chin. I won’t be quick to say this cleanser caused it 100% as it’s that time of the month for me. But I found this cleanser to clean really well. I used it with my Flawless Hydro Vibrating Facial Cleanser tool. The price is decent for me. It's good for the price
