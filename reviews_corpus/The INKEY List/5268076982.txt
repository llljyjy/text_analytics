I’ve used up two bottles of these, and there are better ones out there. It’s cheap and get’s the job done. It’s also great for people who have dry skin or may be sensitive. However, it’s a finicky product. If you live in a humid or hot climate, the product can be gloopy and melts a bit. With the packaging, I find that if I open it and I’m not careful, straight-up cleansing oil will drip out. This should come in a tub instead. Another reason I’m not a complete fan is because it can leave a slight residue on the skin. You would need to double cleanse with another cleanser. It’s good for what it is, but if I ran out, I would go to a different cleansing balm. nan
