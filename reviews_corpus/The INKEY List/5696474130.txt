I like this but do find I need to go in with micellar water to ensure all of the makeup is off. I use it as the first step in my double cleansing routine, then I go in with micellar water and the cera ve hydrating cleandser and my skin is always clean without being stripped. I donâ€™t think I would reccommend this as a stand-alone product. If I wanted to skip micellar water I would choose a different cleansing balm but this one is at such a good price point I do think it is a good start with cleansing bams! Good Basic Cleansing Balm
