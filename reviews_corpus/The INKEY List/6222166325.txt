This product pills like crazy if you use any other moisturizer or oils on top. However, it’s just not moisturizing enough by itself to keep my skin from drying out overnight. In fact, it isn’t moisturizing enough to keep my skin from feeling dry about 10 minutes after application. If you have normal (not dry) skin, this might work great as a moisture barrier for you, but for my dry skin it’s not even close to enough. nan
