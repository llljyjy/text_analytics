I got The Inkey List’s Mandelic Acid Treatment as a free sample to help with the dark spots/acne scars on my face. It seems to be working very slowly as I only use it every 3-4 days as I’m new to AHA. Fair warning that I developed a whitehead on the spot I am using it on but it’s not bad so I will continue to use it and see how it goes. I did use it on my back acne which instantly helped. nan
