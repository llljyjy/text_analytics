This is a fantastic cleansing balm! I read some of the negative reviews, but I believe since the product isn’t clearly labeled an “oil cleanser” in the name, many people are using it the same way they’d use a regular water based cleanser. It’s a great first step of a double cleanse! This oil cleanser is perfect for removing makeup and sunscreen. My skin is dry and sensitive and it’s literally A DREAM!! My skin feels sooooo smooth and soft after with zero irritation at all. I got the mini to try out and definitely want to get the larger size as well! I think if you approach this product as a first cleanse (oil based) you’ll really enjoy the results!! :) Great cleansing balm!
