So after watching many YouTube videos about this product I was sold! I needed a makeup/sunscreen remover for everyday use. Used it Day 1 with my Fenty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint and it removed it all easily no problem. It was very moisturizing minus the oat beads you can feel if you put it on your dry face. Tip: Wet your face first before applying even if you’re using it to remove makeup/sunscreen. But I had a huge issue using this for my mineral tinted sunscreen. It took me so long to get it off my face. I had to use an expired balm I had saved in case this one didn’t work. My expired balm did the job! In like 5 secs it came off. I don’t think this balm should be labeled as a makeup remover at all. The Fenty eaze drop foundation is very lightweight but if I use anything heavier then that it’s a mission to get it off my face with this. It’s a no go for heavy makeup, anything waterproof also, and it’s horrible at removing mineral sunscreens. I really wanted to love this since it’s so reasonable priced and the company has awesome products but this is not one of them. Wasn’t what I expected….
