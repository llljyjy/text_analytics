So far I’m enjoying using The INKEY List’s Fluvic Acid Brightening Cleanser.  I have super sensitive skin and haven’t experienced any issues at all.  My face feels clean but not dried out or tight after washing and I do see an improvement in my hyperpigmentation areas.  I also love the price and will continue to use this in conjunction with my other skincare products. nan
