After trying a number of more expensive alternatives (Elemis, Drunk Elephant), I decided to give this a try based on a number of reviews and it’s far friendlier price point and I wasn’t disappointed. It removes makeup, rinses clean and isn’t perfume-y (it smells lightly of oatmeal, which makes sense, considering the name). However, I do have on complaint. it is impossible to get out of the tube! It’s too thick to be squeezed out without risk of popping the tube like a balloon. I finally had to cut the top off and close it with a binder clip. LOL. Otherwise, this is a great product. nan
