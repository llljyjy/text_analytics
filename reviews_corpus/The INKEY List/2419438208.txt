I’ve been using this treatment for about two weeks now and I feel like it’s really helping to fade my post acne marks. I just tap it into the affected areas on my face during my nighttime routine after I cleanse and moisturize my face and my skin seems to tolerate it pretty well. I’ve also noticed that it smoothed out the bumpy texture of my skin in these areas. I like that it contains a low concentration of retinol so you can use it in conjunction with your retinol treatment without worrying about using too much. But you have to use it for a while and be consistent before you see any results. Give it time!
