I have super fair, freckled, rosacea-prone, Irish/Scottish skin....thanks, Grandma. Since entering my thirties I have found that my skin (once hardly problematic at all) is now super sensitive, dry, red, and tight.  I fell into an Instagram ad trap for a “preservative-free“ skin care regimen with hundreds of five-star reviews (beware of Bambu Earth) and decided to give it a try. It decimated my skin. I broke out for the first time in my adult life, I got my first-ever cyst, and my face was painful, red, scaley, and covered in a nasty rash. I tried la roche posay’s most gentle cleanser to try and fix it, it actually made it a little worse. Then I tried this stuff, and within two weeks my skin is better than it was before this whole mess started about 6 weeks ago. I will never use anything else. I rub it over my face, then use a microfiber cloth and warm water to gently scrub it off. I never have any residue left over and it takes seconds. Does it separate a little in the tube? Sure, but it costs $11 folks. Let’s bring our expectations down to earth a little. I follow it with the inkey list hyaluronic acid and the rosehip oil from the ordinary, then a sunscreen in the am. I mix in the ordinary’s retinol and vitamin C serum on days that I am not irritated as well. Three cheers for companies who don’t unnecessarily jack up the price of their skincare products! From reading the reviews, the bad ones are mainly from people who don’t like the presentation of the product, not how the product works. All I really care about is that I don’t look angry, sunburnt, and peeling all the time anymore. Give this stuff to me in a horse trough, I don’t care. This cleanser saved my skin
