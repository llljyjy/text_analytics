Works in some way. I have noticed the skin around my eyes is smoother. Less texture. Might be helpful with fine lines, but I’m 29 so I don’t have many fine lines anyways and hence not one comment about the product’s performance for that. I like that its more affordable than other eye creams, easy to work with, you don’t need much. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I barely use a teeny tiny amount every night. Its fragrance free, which is awesome. If you want to buy an eye cream, definitely try this one out. At least if it doesn’t work, you won’t have spent too much. Improved skin texture around eyes
