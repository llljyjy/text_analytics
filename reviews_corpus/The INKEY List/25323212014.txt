so short answer... no. now long answer, it’s thick and super heavy, it feels like a mask (you know when a clay mask starts drying on your face? something like that.) and it doesn’t feel moisturizing at all. there’s kind of a strong smell, so if you’re not a fan of how the FAB ultra repair cream smells, you’re not gonna like that one either. nan
