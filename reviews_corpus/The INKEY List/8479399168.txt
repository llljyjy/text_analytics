I really wish this moisturizer worked for my skin, the packaging and product are really high quality for the price. I have oily, acne prone skin and this broke me out unfortunately :( I passed it on to my mom, who has a similar skin type to me but with some fine lines that just come with age, and she really enjoys it. Im recommending it on her behalf! Nice moisturizer, but not for my skin type
