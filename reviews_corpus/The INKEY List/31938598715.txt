I have been using this as my cleanser for like 2 months now and it has worsened my breakouts. I have pretty unpicky/unsensitive skin but had been breaking out a lot so I decided to get this cleanser to help. It definitely has destroyed my skin barrier and over exfoliated my skin, I didn’t even use it as a daily cleanser and it still made me breakout worse than I ever had. I always did my full skincare routine with it (hyaluronic acid serum, simple moisturizer) and waited long enough for my skin to adjust to something new. I’m not a fan, I think it may be too strong. I do like the bottle/amount/bang for your buck though so I’ll give it a 2 star. Needless to say I’m going back to my staple DERMA E cleanser. too strong
