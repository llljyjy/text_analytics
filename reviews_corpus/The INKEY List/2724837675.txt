I LOVE balms and oils, it’s what I usually use to remove makeup as my first cleanse. I have dry skin, not acne prone but I do have larger pores. I was so excited for this product, I thought the oat would be soothing and I love gentle cleansers. However! This product separates, you NEED to shake it vigorously to work the oil and balm together. Also, it leaves such a thick residue on your face.  It also does not take all of my makeup off, and I wear very light makeup. Would NOT recommend, unless it’s to your enemy. I have huge breakouts right now which is very unusual for me.  xleansers Wanted to love it but broke me out so bad
