I have tried so many eye brightening and de-puffing products over the years, and this is one of the few that actually works for me. My under-eye area is quite dry, but also prone to puffiness, redness, and dark circles. I used various under-eye caffeine products (including The Ordinary) for years before I developed a sensitivity to it and I couldn’t anymore. Since then I’ve been trying out different brands and products. I use this once a day as part of my morning skincare routine. I love the metal applicator - it does a lot for the puffiness that I experience first thing in the morning and it feels amazing. My eye area looks visibly more awake after using it. I also love that the formula itself is moisturizing and doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes whatsoever. It makes a great hydrating base for concealer, but I often use it on its own and don’t feel insecure about it whatsoever. Highly recommend for my dry and sensitive girlies, especially for the price! Brightening, De-Puffing, and Moisturizing!!
