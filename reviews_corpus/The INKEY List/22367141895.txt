I had been on the search for a glowy, hydrating moisturizer for my dehydrated skin and this was honestly it! It starts off like you’re putting water on your face but as you work it into your skin it is SO hydrating! Unfortunately, my acne prone skin did not like it and it caused a few breakouts. I won’t be using it again for that reason obviously but you should definitely try it and see how your skin reacts to it :) Great hydrating moisturizer, but caused breakouts
