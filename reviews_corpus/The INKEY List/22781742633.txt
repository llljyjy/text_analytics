I use the salicylic acid cleanser and then follow with this serum in the mornings. I bought this after using the Ordinary niacinamide serum because I wanted to see if this one was any better. Unfortunately it isn’t. The packaging of this serum is terrible and my pores aren’t minimized as they are with the Ordinary one. My skin still gets oily as well. I think this could be good for someone who isn’t as oily as I am and who doesn’t have such large pores. nan
