I tried this a few weeks ago on my rosacea. The formula is a bit thicker than a moisturizer, goes on smooth and absorbs onto my skin easily. The bitter almond has not made my skin any more sensitive than usual. I tried it every night with my usual skin care and my skin is a few shades lighter in reddness. nan
