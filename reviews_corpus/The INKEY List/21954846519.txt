I wish I took before pictures to compare the results. Obviously, products work differently for different people but wow this treatment is amazing. I had a massive breakout across my chin and 4 days later I can see a huge difference (I used it 3 times a day). It isn’t completely gone yet but I would recommend it to anyone. I do find it a little bit drying but it isn’t too bad and have seen some comments on the smell which isn’t great but it’s bearable and well worth it for the results! Love it!
