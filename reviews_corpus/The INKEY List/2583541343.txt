This item works well to get sunscreen off and does not strip my skin. I find I have to use a second cleanser to remove residue, water just doesnâ€™t cut it to remove all the product. It still feels nice and works well as the first cleanser in my double cleanse routine. I have dry, sensitive skin. The price point and size is also very good! I would repurchase. Good first cleanser.
