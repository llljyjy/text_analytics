I like this moisturizer, its a light weight cream, so its not a heavy feeling on my skin.  however what I do not like at all is the tube this cream comes in and trying to get the cream out of the tube is a challenge and I have to squeeze the tube a lot then it comes out in clumps so its hard to get just a little on my finger.  would much prefer a jar with a pump and not a tube, and I am wondering how much cream will be waisted because i cant get it all out to use it all.   But the price is Right, very reasonable compared to a lot of products out there and still good quality ingredients.  havent used it very long, only a few weeks, so results I cant tell yet. Nice moisturizer.
