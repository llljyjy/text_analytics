I received a sample from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.Ok, so I have two separate accounts with this one. I gave it to my dad to try because he got excited about the anti wrinkle claim. His skin is much less sensitive than mine but I did warn him about purging and man, his purging was very severe around his chin. He gave up after two weeks. I have much more sensitive skin so I was quite nervous but I’ve been using a pea sized amount on my face (focusing on my cheeks) about 1-2 week and so far so good! My skin is so smooth even though there’s slight peeling. No purging. Just make sure to sandwich method it and patch test! nan
