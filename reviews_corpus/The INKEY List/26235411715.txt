THE BEST for sensitive skin. Removes makeup, sunscreen, and even waterproof eyeliner and mascara. It also gets off leftover lash glue. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this formula has never caused a rash. Better yet, it doesnâ€™t cause acne either. My only complaint is the packaging. Towards the end of its life, it gets hard to use. However, that would never stop me from repurchasing. Great product at a great price! The best for sensitive, acne-prone skin
