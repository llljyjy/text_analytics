Love love love this product. I don’t give many five star reviews, but this one deserves it. I have been using transexamic acid on my under eye sun spots for the last year and there is a noticeable improvement (I reviewed photos from spring 2021 to now). The product is a little bit sticky, but it applies great and you don’t need very much. I even use it on my cheeks now where there is acne scarring and I feel like it is helping there too. Love! Has made a difference w/sun spots!
