I have tried so many moisturizers....this one doesn’t really do anything that makes me favor it. It feels very hydrating, but also heavy. After reading up on it, urea seems to be a polarizing ingredient. It is a humectant but a lot of products have something that has the same effect. I prefer hyaluronic acid as a humectant. Overall this didn’t improve anything to warrant the continuation. I could see it maybe for the New England winter when my skin gets dry, but I have other moisturizers I like a lot more. I’ll probably pass this on to a friend. Not for me
