I have super dry skin and living in the Midwest my skin gets even worse in the winter. While this product works well, I have to use an oil underneath because the moisturizer isn’t enough on its own. Maybe it will be my summer moisturizer. Also the pump is terrible. It worked for about a week and now it doesn’t so I have to unscrew it to get the product out. for the price is fine
