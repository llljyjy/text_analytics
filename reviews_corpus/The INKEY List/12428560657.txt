I bought this for the sole purpose of getting rid of the millia around my eye. I’ve never had millia before and I looked up products to get rid of it and this product was recommended a lot on tik tok. Honestly didn’t think it would do anything but for $12 i didn’t think it would hurt. I was consistent with it and noticed like 2 weeks in that my millia literally got smoother and the smaller spots are gone. Sooo good for the price GOOD FOR MILLIA
