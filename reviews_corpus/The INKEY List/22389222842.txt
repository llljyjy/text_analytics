I do think this cream has slightly helped with puffiness, but beware that this is more like a serum than a cream. I have dry under eyes and this doesn’t bring enough hydration for my concealer to sit on top of. I’ll continue using this but I’ll add a thicker cream on top. Good, but I need more hydration
