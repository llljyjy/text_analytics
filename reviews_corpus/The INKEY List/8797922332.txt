I struggled with rosacea and dry, flaky skin for years. Never did I think my answer would come in a cleanser. This product has improved my texture and inflammation so much that I have finally been able to add gentle exfoliation, (azelaic acid.) This is my third time rebuying and hope to never go back to where I was before. nan
