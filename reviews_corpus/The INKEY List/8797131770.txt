I like the texture, which is not greasy and easy to absorb. I’ve been using this product for a week now and every time I apply it it makes my face tingle. Immediately after application my face is red and warm to touch. This is not supposed to be an irritating product so I genuinely do not understand what is going on. I read all the reviews and none of them mentioned a bad reaction, so I suppose I’m one of the few who do not tolerate this serum well, which is strange since I’ve put on my face acids and retinols and other antioxidants and I rarely experience anything like this. So, if your face tingles from this product too - don’t worry, you are not alone! Makes my face tingle
