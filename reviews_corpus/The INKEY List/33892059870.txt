there’s not too much to say about this product - i bought it because i wanted an antioxidant to incorporate into my AM routine (to boost my SPF, more than anything), and it does the trick without any irritation. it has a relatively low concentration of actives, but it’s gentle and feels hydrating. appreciate the packaging being a squeeze bottle instead of a dropper to prevent oxidation. good enough for now! nan
