I couldn’t even use this for a full 3 weeks it was making me break out so bad! It does make your skin less oily, but each day I used it it just added more pimples to my face. I cannot use a product that puts my skin into a worse condition than when I started. And I’m in my 30s so pimples are NOT the norm for me. Clogs pores, causes breakouts
