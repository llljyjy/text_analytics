Doesn’t remove makeup … legit just feels like you’re rubbing lotion butter on your face that burns your eyes. I’d say if you don’t really wear makeup and are looking only for a cleaner sure moisture… I’d imagine it would be very hydrating with how it felt on my skin. I could feel the softness of the product on after I rinsed it off despite my makeup still staying in place… nan
