I’m so disappointed with this one. One, I wanted this because of the jar/pump packaging. After I placed my order, the image here was changed to the tube but I hoped that I would still get the original packaging. I did not. And two, the actual moisturizer isn’t very moisturizing. I think if you have oily skin this MAY work, but if you have any sort of dryness, this will emphasize that. I used this at night and ended up having to use an overnight hydrating mask. When I used this during the day, I had to layer another moisturizer on top (thank god for Cerave tbh). I’m keeping because it may come in handy when it gets hotter and more humid here, but I’m overall disappointed. Disappointed
