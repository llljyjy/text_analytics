I think this cleanser does a very good job as the first step to my double cleanse. When I first used it, I did not read the instructions, so I used it like I do my other oil based cleansers and applied it to dry skin, then rinsed. And that is how I’ve continued to use it as well. I’m actually surprised that you’re supposed to apply it to damp skin. I think that is the reason people are not having luck with this cleanser. it removed my makeup very well too, and feels very gentle, even around my eyes, and moisturizing. Use it on dry skin.
