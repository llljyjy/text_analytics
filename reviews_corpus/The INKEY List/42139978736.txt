I have started double cleansing, and use this product before my other face wash. I really love how well the product removes makeup and sunscreen and I have already noticed a difference with clearer skin. The consistency is a little odd, obviously it doesnâ€™t really lather well, and you do have to be careful when washing any eye makeup off. Overall it is a great product, especially for the price. It is gentle, moisturizing and a great step in my routine. Wonderful, Gentle Cleanser
