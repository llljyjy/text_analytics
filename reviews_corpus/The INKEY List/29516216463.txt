I put this on after I shower and it helps my skin retain moisture so well! It’s light and comfortable without being sticky. I’m prone to hormonal acne and this product is so gentle and has worked wonders in repairing my skin’s moisture barrier. Works great under moisturizer/sunscreen and makeup. On my 4th bottle
