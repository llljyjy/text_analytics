This is the only thing I’ve been using on a 7 month-old scar on the back of my hand and it has noticeably faded! The first picture is before, from February 2022, and the second is after 4 months of use (not every night, I’m forgetful). *The photos are taken on the same device, at the same time of day and in the same lighting conditions* At this price point, it really can’t hurt! Buy it!! It’s cheap and it works!!
