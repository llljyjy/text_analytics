Kinda did nothing. I used this every day for about a month and didn’t notice a single change. My acne didn’t appear to be improving or healing faster at all. It’s cheap and there were no negative effects - it didn’t wreck my skin or anything, so it might be worth a try to see if it helps you, but I wasn’t impressed. Also, I know it says you can use this morning and night but I would definitely say it’s more of an evening product. It’s green, which blends somewhat but still isn’t great for daytime and the smell isn’t awesome (not terrible or anything - not likely to bother you, just wouldn’t want to smell like this out). Meh
