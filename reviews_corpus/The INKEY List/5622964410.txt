I think it Inkey wanted to do some sort of business change and switched to making underground apocalyptic bunkers that have secret passageways and multiple hidden entries, they could. I’ve had this tube for almost a year and I’ve yet to finish it. I use it twice a day, and I use about as much as a girthy Nerd candy piece each time. I’m pretty sure this tube is going to last me til I retire and then some. Inkey must have cracked the code on neverending tubes through wormholes or something. Besides that… I work nights and have for years. I also have two kids under 3 years old. Needless to say my eyes have a tendency to look pretty lifeless and dark. However…implementing massive amounts of caffeine both in my diet and my eye cream has been a blessing. I can say with confidence that my eye puffiness has been significantly reduced, and because of that, my eyes are more open and lively. I love that it’s also super affordable. Double yeehaws there nan
