Disappointing. First of all I didn’t see any effect whatsoever  after a month of using it, and on top of that when this serum dries out it leaves white flaky residue on the skin! It’s just gross! I didn’t even notice it at first until my husband pointed it out. It tends to leave these white flakes around hairline the most, dunno what’s wrong with, at first I thought maybe it conflicted with some of my other skincare products, so I mixed some things up to see if it’d help but no. So disappointed! nan
