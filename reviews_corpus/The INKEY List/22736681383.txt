I’ve used this product for about a week now and I will say that it works but not my favorite. It removed my sunscreen/makeup with ease so I would recommend it for a price effective cleansing balm. My only issues are the smell. Reminds me of Playdough and I feel like an oil film is left on my skin which is unpleasant. Overall a good product but I won’t be repurchasing. Good product but not my favorite
