I bought this after reading reviews of what it does as a lip plumper. I’ve been using it morning & night on my lips, letting it dry, then applying a lip balm. I love my results but I wouldn’t go as far to say that it is better than lip filler. I would say it has helped my lips reach their natural full potential. I’ve gained some volume. My lips are now super soft & line free. I no longer need a lip scrub at all. I am absolutely buying more & continuing use. I have also been adding this to my skincare routine. I’m not sure if this is doing much there because I’m using many great products & achieving beautiful results. It’s hard to say which are doing the most good. On another note, if you are writing detailed reviews of your experience with products, THANK YOU! Your reviews are helpful, no matter how many hateful trolls click not helpful for no reason. A Lip Treatment!
