For its price, I think its a good alternative to cleansing oil. It wonâ€™t remove heavy makeup or eye makeup, but it works if you just want to remove sunscreen or light makeup. It has a Vaseline texture, but it melts decent once you add water to it. It leaves face feel moist and soft but a little oily, so I always use a gentle second cleanse after this.One tube is huge and last forever, so definitely much cheaper than cleansing oil. decent as 1st cleanse
