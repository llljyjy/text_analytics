Good moisturizer, I always use a serum before so that may help for those who say it’s not moisturizing enough. A little goes a long way too. Is does have a slight shimmer to it, but not noticeable on the skin. I’ve started a vitamin c serum and this moisturizer to help with discoloration so I’m waiting to see if it works! good moisturizer
