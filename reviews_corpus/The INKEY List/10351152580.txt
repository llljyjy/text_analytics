I love using this as a gentle exfoliating cleanse before makeup as it gets rid of all dead skin or peeling if you have dry skin and leaves your skin super soft when washed off, it can also be left on for 10 minutes as a hydrating mask. Also great as a gentle face makeup remover in the evening on days where i feel like my skin is super dry before cleansing with a gentle cleanser. BUT i will say it is horrible at removing eye makeup of any kind so iâ€™ll recommend using a seperate product to remove eye makeup. Amazing for dry skin!
