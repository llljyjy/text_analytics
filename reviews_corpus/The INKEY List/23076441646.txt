This is one of the only things I’ve found that actually works on my hormonal acne noticeably, and quickly. If I put it on a pimple when I feel it just starting, it never actually comes to a head. If I put it on a little later, it’s gone in a few days. For those horrible, painful, under-the-skin types, it helps it come to a head quickly so I can lance it and get rid of the pain. Now, this IS a sulfur cream, so if you aren’t familiar, it’s not the best smelling stuff. It smells like an open sewer on a warm day, and there’s no masking that fragrance. But it works, and the smell doesn’t linger, so I’m ok with that. Just don’t sniff the tube and wash your hands after you apply it. The green tint seems more like a marketing gimmick to me, since if you apply it thickly enough that the tint is noticeable, it oxidizes to a weird sickly brownish olive color that just made my pimple look diseased. For the price? Can’t beat it. I only wish it was available in drug stores and I didn’t have to go to a specialty store for it, or order it online. Will definitely always keep a tube on hand though. Sulfur + salycilic acid = bye bye zits
