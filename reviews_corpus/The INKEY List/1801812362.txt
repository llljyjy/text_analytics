Poorly formulated - this balm separates between the oil components, leaving a mix of oily and chunky textures. This would be forgivable if it was a great cleanser, but it is not. It did not rinse off easily and left a thick layer on my skin that i had to use a face cloth to get off. Poorly formulated
