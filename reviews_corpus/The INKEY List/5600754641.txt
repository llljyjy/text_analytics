Very very thick. Doesnâ€™t melt down to as thin a consistency that I like so felt I had to keep using more and more each use and emulsify as nicely as others so did not remove makeup very well. Felt residue on skin afterwards. Too bad. Was excited about the amount of product for the great price. nan
