This smells weird and makes my face feel dirtier than before I used it. This did a terrible job taking off any of my makeup (I used a wipe after to see and the wipe was full of foundation and blush). It also has a weird, greasy consistency and comes out of the bottle super liquidy unless you shake it a bunch. I hate the smell, I hate how it feels on my skin, and it doesn’t do anything. Drugstore cleansers have done better! Saw this on Tiktok, hate it so much I’m returning
