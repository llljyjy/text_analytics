I been wanting to try out a cleansing balm for the longest time and I think I found the one! It took my makeup off so easily and wasnâ€™t harsh on my skin. It took off most of my mascara but I did go back and use a cotton round and micellar water to take of the remaining mascara. Other than that I absolutely love this product and 10/10 recommend.
