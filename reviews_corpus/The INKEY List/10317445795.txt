This is the first product I’ve tried from this brand and unfortunately I was disappointed. I used this consistently at night for a week and a couple times in the morning. I have strange textured “chicken skin” under my eyes and this worsened it. It also caused small and painful red bumps to appear where I applied the cream. They were similar to pimples, but did not come to a head. I guess it was a reaction to the product. They took about 2-3 days of use to form. Although this hydrated my skin, the other unpleasant effects I experienced make this one a no for me. Skip this one
