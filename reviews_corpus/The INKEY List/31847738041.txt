This has to be my favorite eye cream ever. Usually when I wear eye creams, my skin starts to “burn” and then I end up removing it. But this one is different, I feel almost relieved when I put this on. I also feel like it brightens up my under eyes whenever I use this product. I love that it’s Clean & affordable! I do hope this comes in a bigger size and a different packaging…because the product comes out too easily. & since it’s so small, I try to save as much product as I can. A MUST HAVE!
