It’s a very nice and effective moisturizer that doesn’t feel heavy and has practically no scent. I’d use this all the time, if it weren’t for the fact that it gives me acne. If I noticed it had coconut oil before purchasing, I wouldn’t have gotten it. (Coconut oil tends to be a problem for acne prone skin.)Since I can’t use it on my face, I won’t be repurchasing, but I’ve been using what’s left as a light hand cream. I actually really like what it does for my hands at least! very nice, but not good for acne
