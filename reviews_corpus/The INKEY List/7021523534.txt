I have a few thoughts about this product. 1. The smell is absolutely awful but it goes away quickly. 2. I have noticed a slight difference in my skin. This product seems to lock in moisture pretty well but not 5 star worth. 3. What I genuinely enjoy about this serum is missing it with my foundations. I have VERY dry skin and I generally prefer low coverage, dewy face makeup. Doing a 70% foundation + 30% polyglutamic acid mix gives me the result both my skin and I like. Overall, the product is good, especially for the price. I wish the smell wasnâ€™t so vile at first though. better for makeup than skincare probably
