I hoped this cream would have a better consistency and texture than the Ordinary’s Vitamin C Suspension, but it’s super drying and heavy. It doesn’t really seep into my skin, it just sits on top. Not sure if it’s the Vitamin C that messes with the texture, but I was not impressed. It hardly resembles a cream. This bottle is also a lot smaller than I expected. Disappointed again by Vitamin C
