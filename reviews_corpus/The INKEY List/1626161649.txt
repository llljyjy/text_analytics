I’ve been pleased with the brightening effects of this moisturizer.  I use it as my evening moisturizer but follow it up with a leave-on sleep mask so I’ve had no issues with it not being moisturizing enough.  Within a few weeks of use, I noticed red spots had calmed down and looked much less evident making my complexion look more even.  I’m in my late 50s and am just looking for something to assist with existing skin lightening treatments.  This has filled the bill for me.  I looked into the ingredient “symbright” and it’s apparently sourced from the herb, clary and is proven to lighten skin over the long term.  I also tend to have sensitive skin and experienced absolutely no irritation.  I definitely recommend it to those seeking to calm redness and encourage skin brightening.
