Details: This is a moisturizer formulated to be a lightweight, water based gel designed for use by all skin types. This moisturizer contains omega fatty acids that help to create healthy skin by providing long lasting hydration, supports the creation of a healthy skin barrier & control oil. Key ingredients include: 0.2% ceramide complex, 5% niacinamide, & 3% betaine. This is vegan, cruelty & gluten-free, with no added fragrance. My experience: For reference, I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin with some redness & sensitivity. This is an opaque white, gel water cream moisturizer with a creamy smooth texture. This has no fragrance or smell that my sensitive nose can detect. I’ve been using this for over a month & my oily skin LOVES it! Some moisturizers are too rich for my oily skin especially living in Florida’s hot & humid weather. This is not one of them. This water gel cream is perfect for hydrating my skin! It plumps my skin, moisturizes, & preps my skin for further skincare/makeup steps without making it sticky, greasy, or oily. It layers well with other products & doesn’t cause piling. Can be used for am/pm. I’m sad I’m almost out of this bottle because it has been working well for my skin. Overall: I am LOVING this omega water cream moisturizer. My oily skin is left looking plump, feeling & looking moisturized without being greasy or sticky. It layers well with other skincare/makeup products & doesn’t cause piling.
