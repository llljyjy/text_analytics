Good at removing makeup, does the job, easy to wash out. My only problem with it is the fact that the oily stuff in the balm separates from it and whenever I try to squeeze out some product the oily stuff comes out first and it kinda grosses me out (it’s very liquidy compared to the balm). Anyway, for the price it’s an alright cleansing balm. But there are better alternatives out there. Okay
