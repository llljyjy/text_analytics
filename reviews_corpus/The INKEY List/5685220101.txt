I don’t leave reviews but I had to for this one! Such a simple product but it’s the ONE. So far loving this product, it definitely delivers on holding up to 4 times for moisture. I’ve been using it day and night and it’s giving me a plump effect. At night I love how my skin looks and feels moisturized. In the morning my makeup sits very nicely and this helps my sunscreen sit will too. I use as instructed, I put eye cream, Inkey list Q10 + collagen + HA before, numbuzin #3 day and night THEN POLYGLUTAMIC acid, moisturizer and sunscreen. I’ve only needed to use concealer for the 3 weeks I have been using it. Love this product, super plumping
