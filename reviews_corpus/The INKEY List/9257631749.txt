I would pass on this product on the model it gives “instant“ results. i had hope thinking the light reflecting shimmer could at least give the illusion of brighter eyes but i saw no improvement. the cream also broke out my under eye area slightly im guessing because of the shimmer particles. i do give it two stars for its hydrating properties nan
