this is a decent eye cream (hydrating and not too sensitizing) but after a few weeks the cream started to separate inside the tube, so whenever I squeezed some out i would get a thin watery liquid and some thicker cream and it just doesnt feel the same. It worked alright for the first few weeks but isnt life changing or anything, it was worth a shot because of the excellent price point but its just not a nice user experience. Decent but separates within the tube :/
