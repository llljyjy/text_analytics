I bought this because it was advised this was a dupe for the DE Protini.. it is 100% not. I did not see a difference, and I felt it made my skin dull. This was not my favorite moisturizer, and I donâ€™t see how this can be compared to Protini. The Pacifica Dreamy Youth is a much better purchase for the same price point, and it outshined Inkey list 100%. nothing great..
