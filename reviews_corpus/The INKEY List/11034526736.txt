About a week into using this product, the outer corner of my eyes had developed dry patches. I stopped using the product and it cleared up in a couple days. I now use this product on a need-basis and have not seen the dry patches. It instantly refreshes my natural dark circles and slightly reduces puffiness. The product itself is extremely cool and smooth to the touch. I think itâ€™s worth it for the price. nan
