I have been using the Mandelic Acid Treatment to help fade my post-acne marks and hyperpigmentation.  The mandelic acid treatment works after more than a month and I can see the difference in the redness and marks from being visible. Right now the acne marks are less noticeable. I use this during the night on only the spots where I want to be treated. The marks were first a bright red color and now it’s a very mild pink almost faded to my natural skin color. I’m very pleased with the product and has worked for what it is intended for. Fades Post Acne Marks
