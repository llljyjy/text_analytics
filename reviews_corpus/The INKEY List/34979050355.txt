I don’t know why so many people hate it. I think it’s perfect for normal to oily skin. It’s a lightweight gel like texture. When you first put it on it may leave a glowing or dewy residue but give it a few min and it will sink into the skin. It doesn’t leave my skin oily nor  look oily on me since it sinks in well instead of resting on top my face. Very moisturizing and hydrating. good moisturizer
