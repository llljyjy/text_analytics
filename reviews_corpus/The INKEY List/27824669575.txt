I received this product for free from Influenster and The Inkey List in exchange for my honest review. On me, I didn’t notice any improvement to the oiliness of my T-zone. It was still oily and maybe looked even oilier. However, the look of my skin overall seems improved. My complexion has been clear. My pores are less visible. This patch of lingering red spots from a previous breakout has cleared up. Besides still being oily, this product worked great to improve my complexion. I had no problems applying makeup over it along with my other products. I didn’t encounter any irritation either. I would probably buy another tube when this one is gone. Ok
