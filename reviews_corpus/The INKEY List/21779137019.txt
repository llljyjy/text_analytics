Oh man. This hyaluronic acid is hands down the best in the market. My skin has never felt more plump and hydrated. It’s a pretty tiny bottle but for the price and the results I wouldn’t mind repurchasing it a thousand times over. Hope they come up with a bigger size. If your skin is dry and quenched, you definitely need this. It’s the first step of my skin care routine after cleansing. My sensitive skin loooooooves this product. HOLY GRAAAIIILLLLLL
