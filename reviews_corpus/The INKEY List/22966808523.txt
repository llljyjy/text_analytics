I rarely put reviews but this was seriously a game changer. When I suddenly got skin bumps that were not quite hormonal acne, but more like clogged whiteheads or fungal acne it was very hard to get rid of the stubborn spots, however, when I started using this the blemishes started going away. It is gentle enough for beginners to acid toners (like me) and was fine to use often throughout a week (and my skin is acne prone, dry, AND sensitive). I finished the whole bottle and it has been a while since my last use of it but my skin has been smooth and without the small fungal acne since. If youâ€™re thinking about trying it, I would definitely recommend!! INCREDIBLE
