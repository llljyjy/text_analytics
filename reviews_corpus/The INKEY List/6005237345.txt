Absolutely incredible.. I think my pictures speak for itself. My skin care routine is pretty basic but i noticed a huge difference when I incorporated this into my routine. Iâ€™ve used it for about 2 months now 1-2 times a week, I do pair it with the succinic acid if I have an active breakout or on my acne prone spots (jawline). Honestly blown away. I developed inflammatory acne out of no where and this has taken away so much left over inflammatory scarring. life changing
