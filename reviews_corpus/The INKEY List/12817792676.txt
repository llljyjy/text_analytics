I like this because it does remove makeup nicely and it’s a great price, but it has two downsides: it is very greasy and it tends to separate. The balm I start using when I open a container is thicker than the balm I’m using at the end of the container. I think if you have dry or sensitive skin this will work best for you. As for me I think I will try a different cleansing balm next time. Good but greasy and prone to separation
