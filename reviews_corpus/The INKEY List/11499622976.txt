Applied for two days and it was great but after I applied it on the third day I felt a burning sensation (not too bad so I ignored it) on the skin of my under eye. The morning after I applied the cream again, and again I felt the burning, applied my concealer and noticed tiny bumps all over my under eye. My under eye is so rough and bumpy, this cream is just some sparkly gold eyeshadow to make your under eye look brighter. 100% do not recommend for sensitive skin. Not for sensitive skin! Gave me under eye bumps!
