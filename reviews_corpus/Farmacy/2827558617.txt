I use the Farmacy Honey Halo moisturizer so I was excited to try out this mask however it leaves my skin feeling drier. I can’t imagine the warming sensation to be good for those with sensitive skin. It also stings which is concerning to me. I can’t leave it on for more than 3 minutes before I have to wash it off. I have dry sensitive skin. Drying & Stings
