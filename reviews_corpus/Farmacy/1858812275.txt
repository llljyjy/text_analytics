I like that Farmacy listed the percentage of vitamin C on the serum.  It is gentle on skin and absorbs into skin easily. On application I notice it brightens my skin. The scent might not be for everyone but Iâ€™m ok with scent. Overall it is the first of its kind being waterless which was intriguing to me. I received this product complimentary from Farmacy. nan
