This product SINGLE HANDEDLY saved my skin during my weird summer to fall transition skin. I started to get a few break outs, which is rare for me, but really dry skin at the same time. My dryness wouldn’t allow me to apply any product without my skin screaming at me. But not this one. Truly the consistency of ‘I can’t believe it’s butter’ and I couldn’t be happier with the results. But the jumbo without trying the product before and I truly do not regret it. SAVED my irritated summer-fall transition skin
