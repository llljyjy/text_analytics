A wonderful product! I received it complimentary from Farmacy Beauty.This cleanly formulated serum brightens your skin as it fights hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.  Texture is a little oily but it doesnâ€™t leave greasy residue. This can sensitize your skin a little bit - but nothing major, easily corrected with a rich moisturizer. I noticed my skin evened out and pigmentation lightened up after about 9 days of use.  Love hygienic dispenser. Highly recommend this product Great to even skin out
