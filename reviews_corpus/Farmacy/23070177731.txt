I am already such a HUGE Farmacy fan (Deep Sweep is my must-have toner) so I was super excited that Farmacy was venturing into retinol. I love that all of Farmacy’s products are made using upcycled ingredients, and also that they contain tons of antioxidants. I’ve only been using this serum for a few weeks now, but I can already see a reduction in my fine lines, and I’m loving the glow and extra bounciness of my skin!
