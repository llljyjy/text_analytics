Tbh, this wasn’t really all that. I was super excited with farmacy coming out with a retinol product. First impressions: it’s got a weird smell to it, I get alot of skincare products with retinol tend to smell. This this smell was almost overwhelming. It definitely is a more gentler retinol which I do enjoy. I’ve only used it for a few days so I haven’t seen any results. * gifted by Farmacy * nan
