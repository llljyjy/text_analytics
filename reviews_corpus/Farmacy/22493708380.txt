This was gifted to me by Farmacy in exchange for a review. I love the combination of retinol and retinal - makes for such a great anti aging powerhouse serum. Ingredients like allantoin, ceramides and panthenol can also help to make sure that irritation is minimized, although I didn’t experience any. The pump is great to keep oxygen out and make sure the retinoids remain stable. Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it’s pretty pricey and I think you can find effective formulas for cheaper if needed. Really nice combination of retinoids
