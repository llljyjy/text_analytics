Farmacy makes some of my favorite skin care so I was beyond excited when I saw they came out with a retinol serum. I use this on my forehead because that’s my problem area with wrinkles and as soon as I apply it I love how it makes my skin feel. I can feel it tighten up. I haven’t had any irritation luckily and I love how there’s no burning or smell from this product. Brownie points for the adorable packaging lol nan
