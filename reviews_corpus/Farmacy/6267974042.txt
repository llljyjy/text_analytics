This is the most moisturizing eye cream Iâ€™ve tried. It has a very rich consistency. It applies very nicely and leaves my undereyes looking plump. I was very tempted to use it as a face cream since I have super dry skin, and I did! It feels amazing haha. It does feel slightly tacky.  Makeup goes on smooth on top of it. I think this will be best for someone who has really dry undereyes. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Lovely eye cream!
