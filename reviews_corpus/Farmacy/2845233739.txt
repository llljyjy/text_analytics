So excited to see a new product launch from Farmacy! One of my favorite cleaner beauty lines.The cream itself looks much thicker then it is in the jar, but it actually  feels light and creamy on the skin. I like there is no noticeable scent, usually I am neutral on scents in products but for an eye cream where the skin is thinner and more delicate I like to go completely fragrance & natural scent free. The eye cream itself is very hydrating! Hours later I still feel like it is doing it’s magic. I’m not seeing any immediate brightening but that could be a long term effect that you would see with longer use. It’s priced at $45, I think it’s a little pricy for the size of the product (.5 oz/15 ml) but I do think it’s a good product.This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty Hydrating!
