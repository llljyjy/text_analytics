Oooh the texture is so silky and light. It looks thick in the jar but it doesn’t feel super rich and thick. It absorbs pretty quickly because it’s not overly dense. I don’t just rub it in, I like to pat it around the entire eye area. This is extra fantastic feeling in the morning if you leave it in the fridge. Feels like it helps depuff faster when it’s chilled. I am not 100% certain but I think it really is brightening but I don’t know if it’s the color of the cream or the formula. Either way it helps make me look alive in the morning:) Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Love perfect amount of moisture it provides too. Works quickly
