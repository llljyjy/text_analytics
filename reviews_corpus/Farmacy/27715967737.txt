Gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion. I’m already a fan of the Farmacy products I’ve tried thus far and this lovely eye cream was surprisingly a win for me as well. From the gorgeous packaging to the thick, luxe texture this eye cream is a stunner! Infused with hydrating honey and vitamin C, this eye cream is designed to brighten, depuff, reduce the appearance of dark circles and soften fine lines and wrinkles with consistent use. I absolutely adore the way this decadent cream feels on the skin and how nicely it absorbs after application. It definitely help give my eyes a brighter, more youthful appearance and providing a fabulous hydrating and smoothing effect under the eyes. I love that it’s cruelty free and packed with natural ingredients that are safe for the skin while still providing effective results. Hydrating Eye Cream
