I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and have been using the Vitamin C Serum. I struggle with hyperpigmentation and acne scars and have been looking for a product to help. After a couple of days I noticed a difference and my acne scars appeared lighter and have seen a more even skin complexion.  I have fairly sensitive skin and most vitamin c serums cause irritation but I did not have any of that using this product. The only thing is that I’m not the biggest fan of the texture as it is quite thin and can be a bit oily so I’ve just been using it at night. Overall a great serum with great results! nan
