I used a sample of this product and have to comment on the many reviewers who are talking about the scent. It literally smells like raw honey and dissipates immediately when you pat it on your skin. If you are thrown off by these extreme reviews, don’t be!! It smells natural like manuka or farm honey, nothing like spoiled milk or what other commenters have compared it to. Try it at the store to see for yourself. Due to the fact that I only used a foil packet sample I can’t speak much about the effects (I was also trying other new products at the time) but it seems like a good product. If you're worried about the scent
