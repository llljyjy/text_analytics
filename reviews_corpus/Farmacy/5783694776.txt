Love the feel and texture of this formula, after a few days of use I could feel my skin texture around my cheeks a lot smoother. I’d recommend using a thicker moisturizer in conjunction, I did have slight dryness around my nose. While the formula is great, it is a little pricey for the amount of product you’re getting. nan
