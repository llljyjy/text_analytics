This product was way too strong and I don’t have sensitive skin. It broke me out and didn’t do anything for my skin. I know it was the cause of my breakouts because it was the only new thing I introduced to my routing and when I went back to my usual toner, my skin went back to normal. I usually love farmacy products but this one is a fail for me. too strong
