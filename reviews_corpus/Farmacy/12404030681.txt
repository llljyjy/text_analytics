This was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. I have a lot of acne scars from years of picking at my face, but I have noticed that this helps soften the skin a little and help with healing. I cannot guarantee that it takes away all acne scars, but it does help lighten them. Itâ€™s a great product. I use mostly at night and notice reduced redness and discoloration in the morning. I was pretty amazed by the results. I use this well with the honeymoon glow and the honey drop moisturizer after washing with clean bee. I feel confident in the products and worth the value. The product lasts because a little goes a long way. Really helps with discoloration
