i love vitamin c’s so when i saw this waterless formula i was intrigued!! it has a clear watery texture that is quite runny, not like other vitamin c’s. the texture is super interesting, not watery, but not creamy either. almost feels like a dry oil. i just started using this, so im not used to this texture, nor am i a fan of it. absorbs easily on the skin and doesn’t leave face oily despite the texture. nan
