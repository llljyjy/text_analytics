I’ve been using vitamin C as a staple in my skincare routine. However this 10% waterless vitamin C serum is the best I’ve used so far! It’s not watered down like some of the others I’ve used. It’s not to thick nor watery. Just the perfect consistency for me. It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft. Beyond that, in a few days I could see my skin brighter which I didn’t understand because I was using Vitamin C before this brand and my face was even brighter with this! Absolutely love it! This was gifted to me by Farmacy beauty. Absolutely in love!!!
