I’ve only used it a couple days now, but my skin is so sensitive that it would’ve noticed a change by now. This is a great product. Luxury packaging, love that. It’s very moisturizing, a little goes a long way. Smells like fresh honey, and makes my skin glow! I think this is the top moisturizer for its price category. So good!
