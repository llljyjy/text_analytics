I like this mask but yet to see the “pore refining” benefits. I’ve only used it for a week and it for sure has helped me with a few bumps and reducing the amount of oils in my face but other than that, an okay moisturizer / sleeping mask. I don’t think this will be “moisturizing” enough for someone with a drier skin type! Hope to see the pore refining benefits soon. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Good sleeping mask
