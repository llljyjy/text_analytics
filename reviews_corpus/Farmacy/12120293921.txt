I have been enjoying “Wake Up Honey“ eye cream from Farmacy! I think the jar is too small, the size is a weird half size (halfway between deluxe sample and full size). I like the texture and I like using it! But I must be honest, I didn’t see a big difference in brightness or puffiness. I was gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion. Like, not love
