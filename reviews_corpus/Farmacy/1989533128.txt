I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty, and it’s my first time trying retinol. My skin didn’t have any bad reaction to this one and it felt gentle enough. It absorbed easily into the skin and actually felt hydrating thanks to the fruit oils. My skin looked smoother and radiant when I woke up the next day. nan
