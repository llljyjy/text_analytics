absolutely LOVE this product! i had been using a bar of soap to take my makeup off for the longest time (was definitely not the best). i tried micellar water, but it just wasnâ€™t working that well for me as i would have to scrub pretty harshly to get off some stubborn mascara. after reading all the great reviews on this cleansing balm, i finally decided to splurge and i wish i had bought it sooner. the most stubborn mascara comes off with just one swipe of this stuff. and a little goes a long way which makes the price seem a bit more reasonable. i will definitely be repurchasing this. love it
