Itâ€™s a great product overall, but I have a few specific skin issues that this does not address. The price point is not worth it. I have used moisturizers that are effective and are less expensive. Finding the right amount to use can be a bit tricky at first. It has a sticky residue upon application. This not a permanent product for my beauty routine, but it is a good moisturizer. nan
