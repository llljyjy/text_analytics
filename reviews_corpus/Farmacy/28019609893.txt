Another hit from Farmacy. I’m no stranger to retinol and have been using it for a few years now, and I like Farmacy’s take. It comes in a nice and hygienic pump bottle. The texture is beautiful, melts into the skin easily. I didn’t experience any irritation and my skin felt hydrated enough afterwards I just needed a moisturizer and didn’t need to top up with another serum. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty nan
