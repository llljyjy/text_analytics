First off, this toner is seriously sensitive skin friendly. I also feel because I mention that first some might think it’s not as strong, but it IS.Sometimes it’s hard to find a product that isn’t irritating but does the job.. and this is it! Swipe over cleansed skin with a cotton round once a day and it’s wonderfully smoothing and clears pores. 10/10
