I received this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. I already love their honey halo cream so I was excited to try this out. Of course it didn’t disappoint as it was also moisturizing. It didn’t have a scent which I was surprised at because their honey halo does. Packaging is on theme and cute as always. The fact that it has vitamin c is two thumbs up. nan
