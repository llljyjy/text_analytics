This cream is another hit from Farmacy. I have been a fan of Farmacy products for the past couple of years and love that they have such great clean beauty products. This eye cream is very hydrating and feels so great under my dry under eyes. This cream really creates a glow under my eyes with the hydration that it provides. I havenâ€™t seen too much of an affect on my fine lines or undereye bags but I do see that this creates a brightness. Overall I think the short term results of using this cream have been smoothing of my dryness and creating brightness. I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review.
