This item was gifted to me by Farmacy. I’ve used my share of retinols and am always a bit weary of them. There’s nothing to worry about here - this is lightweight, hydrating and non-irritating. After about 10 days of using it, I will say my skin feels smoother and hydrated. Looking forward to using this more to see if it helps with my fine lines. Nice Retinol Product!
