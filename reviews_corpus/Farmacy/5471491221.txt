Wow!!! I FINALLY FOUND A MOISTURIZER THAT WORKS! Every moisturizer I have tried either sat on top of my skin or wasn’t moisturizing enough. It feels like velvet. It has a perfect subtle scent. It comes with a spatula so you don’t have to dip your fingers in the product.The packaging feels lux and is recyclable. My skin is plump and glowy. Quick tip, try to use a serum before applying your moisturizer. It will help a lot! I FINALLY FOUND YOU!!
