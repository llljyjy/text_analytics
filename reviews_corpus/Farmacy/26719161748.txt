Such a great face wash. I have a sensitive/dry skin combo and I just love the feel and freshness of this cleanser. Smells great, doesn’t overwhelm the face nor strip away too much of the face’s natural oils (just enough to get the job done). A bit pricey for me, but I think it’s worth the investment and has become a part of my routine. Give it a try if you have sensitive/dry skin!
