The texture of the eye cream is on point.  Have been using this in both the morning and evening.  Does help with the brightening of under my eye, but unfortunately did not help my puffiness at all.  Was hopeful that it would reduce it a bit, but did not seem to do much of anything in that department.   Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
