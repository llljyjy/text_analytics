This balm is amazing! It is so worth the hype. Leaves you skin feeling so clean and hydrated after using it and doesn’t leave that gross greasy feeling on your skin after using it either. It makes my skin feel so clean like I don’t even need to do a double cleanse! I have tried so many makeup removing balms and I would definitely recommend this one over all the rest. My go-to for sure. love this stuff!
