I received this overnight mask gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I absolutely LOVE it!! It has a beautiful gel cream texture that’s still pretty thick when you apply it. You only need a little bit, so it’s such a great value. The color is beautiful and the packaging is so high quality. Niacinamide is one of my favorite ingredients for evening out my skin tone and helping with blemishes while not drying out my skin. I also love that it contains panthenol and glycerin and quite a few beneficial extracts and oils. This one is definitely a keeper!! nan
