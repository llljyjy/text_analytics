I’ve been looking for a thick, genuinely moisturizing lip balm that’s not like $30 or something, and so far this is my favorite. It’s heavy enough that it really lasts after I put it on when I go to bed at night and my lips feel good when I wake up in the morning. It doesn’t have any weird smell or taste like a lot of balms do. Given how soft it is it’s definitely one I would be careful about carrying around with me because it would absolutely melt if it got too warm, but I just leave it next to my bed. I took one star off because it’s a pretty small size, however given the price compared to a lot of good lip balms I don’t mind too much. Great but kind of small
