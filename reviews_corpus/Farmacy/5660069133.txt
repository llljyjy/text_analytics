I have dry skin, and I live in the northeast, and it’s currently winter time. Not only this, but I also do not have a thyroid, which despite being on medication, this definitely exacerbates dry skin. But this moisturizer is fantastic! It feels almost soothing when I apply it, but it definitely sinks in and does not leave me with a greasy or a heavy feeling. Makeup does well with it too so I can apply it day or night, or both if I choose. I also love the fact that it comes with a spatula which stays on the magnetized lid so I don’t lose it. They thought of everything and I really appreciate that. I hate dipping my hands into a jar of moisturizer, so I think this was so smart of them to include for us and I wish more brands would do this. I can’t speak for those with oily skin, but I do think that anyone with dry or normal skin would love this moisturizer. It does have a bit of a natural scent to it, which I wouldn’t exactly say is pleasant, but it’s very light, and fades away in a few minutes. For me, it’s not something that would deter me from using this great product. I will definitely repurchase, and will probably grab the value size next time! Oh, and my elbows were getting a little scaly, and one application at night before bed cleared that up for me. great moisturizer!
