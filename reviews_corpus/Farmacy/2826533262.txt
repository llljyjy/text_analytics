Extremely nourishing! I initially applied too much but i really only need a tiny amount to moisturize my undereye. For some reason, i was surprised how it gave some brightening effect like its a primer. The packaging is too cute as well! Really wanna try more from Farmacy. This eye cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Did not disappoint!
