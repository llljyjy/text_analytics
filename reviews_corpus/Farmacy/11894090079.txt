[complimentary from Farmacy Beauty] I’m pretty picky about my vitamin c as I’ve had bad experiences with them being irritating, gritty, or super sticky. This one from Farmacy is interesting & so far passes the test! The term “waterless“ threw me off a bit & I wasn’t sure what to expect in terms of texture/consistency. I would say it performs similarly to a dry oil - goes on feeling a bit greasy but dries down sufficiently. So far no irritation or breakouts, TBD on how well it tackles dark spots! nan
