Farmacy doesn’t fail my skin. I’ve tried several products from the Farmacy line and this included, it works for me. I gradually introduced this to my skincare routine as I don’t usually use retinol. I felt a slightly noticeable difference when I wake up in the morning. My skin felt softer and more supple. Will continue using this and hope to see more visible improvement in fine lines as well. I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty but my opinion is my own. nan
