Complimentary from Farmacy beauty. Almost never really tried any product like this so this one was a first time and it didn’t disappoint. The product has a very oily consistency and absorbs well I to the skin and works well with other products. I suffer from hyperpigmentation around my jaw area and I’ve been seeing some changes..  not a lot but it’s getting there. 10/10
