I received this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. I recently got to try their face cream which I love to use at night so now that they have an eye cream I was excited. The cream has the same packaging as always but was smaller. This was to be expected though as eye creams usually are. The texture was creamy and to my surprise had no smell to it. The color was also darker which is great to tint the undereye and make it appear brighter. I only wish it had a spatula with it so I didnâ€™t have to dip my fingers in it but I can also survive without one. nan
