Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I’m a total newbie to retinols and this seemed like a good option for me as a beginner! The ingredients sounded gentle enough including the ceramides being added in (my skin is dry normally). This hasn’t given my any irritation or sensitive reactions yet and I’ve just started using it. I honestly haven’t seen much results yet as it’s a bit early, but I’m really glad it’s gentle enough for my sensitive skin! I’ll keep using it slowly, hoping to reduce my hyperpigmentation with it. So far it’s good and no purging yet. Very gentle!
