I don’t normally leave reviews for products but this was a must! I purchased this during the spring sale after one of my favorite YouTubers mentioned it in a video. This is my first product from Farmacy and WOW. I’m obsessed. It definitely has a unique texture - slightly more oily than you typical “serum” however not greasy like a true oil. I’m 25 with oily and acne prone skin and this has just completely changed my skin in the best way! Will be repurchasing again and again FOR SURE. New Holy Grail Vitamin C!
