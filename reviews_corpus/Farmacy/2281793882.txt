This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for review purposes. I usually use Vitamin C serums with 15% Vitamin C so this is a little less than what I’m used to. With that being said, the texture of this product is so unique. Because it’s called a serum, I immediately think it’s going to be quite lightweight, but it honestly feels more like an oil than a serum to me. I was worried that it wouldn’t sink in nicely, but it will if you give it a little time. It’s very hydrating and gentle. It’s been slowly helping with some of my hyperpigmentation from acne. nan
