I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review of the Wake Up Honey Eye Cream with Brightening Vitamin C. I’ve been using this eye cream for a little while now and I really enjoy it so far! The texture is definitely rich feeling, but doesn’t feel too thick. It’s the perfect consistency for me and it adds a lot of moisture to my usually dry under eye area without feeling heavy or greasy. There’s literally no scent at all, which was surprising to me, but not necessarily disappointing. I rarely have dark, puffy eyes, but I did notice this added an instant, slight brightness to my eye area that was pleasant. Overall, I really enjoyed this eye cream and would try it again! Perfect amount of hydration
