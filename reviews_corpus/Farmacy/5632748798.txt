I was recently gifted by Farmacy Beauty and got to try out the Niacinamide Night Mask. I’ve been using this product for about a week and since I’ve been using, I’ve already noticed that I have a clearer skin. I’m a huge fan of niacinamide for keeping and love that it’s in this night cream. For anyone who may not be a fan of retinols, this may be an excellent alternative since it definitely helps minimizing pores. Also my skin feels super soft. I’m excited to keep using this to see even more benefits over time. This is definitely going to be a staple in my night time routine! New Night Routine Must Have
