This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This is hands down one of the most unique vitamin C serums that I’ve tried! The texture is so hard to describe, I’d say it’s almost like a mix between a gel and an oil. Don’t let the oil part of that scare you though because it sinks in super fast and just leaves a healthy, dewy glow! I feel like every brand is coming out with a vitamin C that they all start to blend together; however, this feels truly unique! It’s definitely an absolute must try! You need this!!
