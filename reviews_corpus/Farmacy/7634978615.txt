Love this moisturizer. I have been trying to find a good heavy night time moisturizer and this is it. I did not like the Skinfix and I used to use Olay, but even the fragrance free irritated my eyes. I use a lot of actives/serums so I’m really just looking for something to seal everything in. This has a heavy cream consistency but goes on the skin very light! It’s crazy. It’s also a nice way to include propolis in my routine.  You could use this day and night and it gives a nice glow without being greasy. Definitely would be good as skin prep under makeup. You only need a little bit so this jar will last you. Again moisturizing but light enough for summer. Think it is good for all skin types. Highly recommend, not hyped up at all. If it is as good in winter as summer then I will stop trying new products. nan
