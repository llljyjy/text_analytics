*gifted by Farmacy Beauty* I was so excited to receive this serum as other Farmacy products are staples in my routines. This serum has an interesting texture. It’s a thicker oily serum that absorbs very quickly. The scent is interesting. It smells very similar to another very popular and more expensive Vitamin C serum.  Like hot dogs as many describe it lol. It absorbs quickly and can be used under makeup! I’ve noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin and my dark spots seem to be fading a bit. I enjoy this and would repurchase! nan
