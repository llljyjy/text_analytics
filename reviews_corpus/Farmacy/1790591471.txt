This serum really does feel as weightless as I expected it to with “waterless” in the title! The texture was really thin and smooth and the serum itself is clear and spreads easily on the skin. I feel some vitamin C serums can be drying but this one was very moisturizing. Looking forward to more results with continued use but loving it so far - so easy to pump and apply! I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own. Weightless serum!
