i’ve been wanting to add retinol to my skincare routine and this seemed like the perfect product to do it with. i’m easing it into my routine by using it once a week. so far, it hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. i’m more so looking forward to the long term benefits, but even now, i feel like my skin looks brighter and healthier after using this.disclaimer: i received this complimentary from farmacy beauty. nan
