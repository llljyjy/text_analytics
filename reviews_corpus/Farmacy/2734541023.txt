I can’t love this enough!!  I saw «warning» in the other reviews and was fearful it would = irritating.  That was so far off!  The warmth is only for a moment when 1st applied and along with the subtle sweet honey scent is very soothing.  I use this in combination with the honey halo and my skin has never felt so soft and hydrated. love love love
