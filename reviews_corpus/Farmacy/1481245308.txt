I have to say.  I resisted this for a long time.  I just didn’t think the product could live up to the hype.  I was wrong.  This is great.  I typically use an oil cleanser and thought that this one wouldn’t be any better.  Its however great.  It melts easily under my fingers and cleans away without leaving a greasy residue on my skin.  My only semi complaint is that the scent on the original isn’t my jam.  I’m excited to try the other limited edition versions that may appeal more to my sense of smell. Lived up to the hype
