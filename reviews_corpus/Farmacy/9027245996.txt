An incredibly UNIQUE serum! I haven’t used anything like this before. It comes out of the tube like a gel but feels like a dry oil going onto the skin. After a few moments of patting it in, it sinks into the skin with no residue at all. It leaves my skin feeling plump and soft as if I just put on a lotion. I absolutely love using this in my routine! I have sensitive, combo, acne-prone skin and this doesn’t irritate or break me out. I have a lot of acne scarring + redness, and I feel like my skin is a lot less red and splotchy in the morning now. I can’t wait to see the long-term effects of this serum. This may just be my favorite Vit C serum of all time. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. A Beautiful And Unique Vit C
