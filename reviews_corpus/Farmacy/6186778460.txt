I adore a good vitamin c, as it really brightens and makes me look alive. I lovvvvee the texture of this vitamin c the most, it’s light and not greasy or tacky. Goes on very well under my spf. I also can be sensitive to vitamin c as well, as this is L-ascorbic acid I was skeptical. However, it did not cause irritation or itchy skin. Since this is waterless, it maintains its potency which is really nice because vitamin c’s can go bad so quickly. Love the packaging absolutely no air or sun to diminish the product. Another major love from Farmacy Beauty!! Stable and effective with the best texture
