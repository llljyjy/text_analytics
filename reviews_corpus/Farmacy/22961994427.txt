Great product, exfoliates well without making me overly sensitive. Cleans out my blackheads and makes a visible difference. A little goes a long way! I gave one star off because when using it once every two days, I experiences dryness and irritation. I researched some more, and saw that dry/sensitive skin should do around once (at the most twice) every week, contrary to their packaging which says that it can be used up to daily. I donâ€™t see that being good advice anyhow. Great product, iffy directions! Great, but be careful!
