I am really enjoying this retinol! The texture is soft and silky and it doesn’t dry out my skin too much. My skin looks clear and refreshed in the morning after use. I appreciate that this product does not pill and can be easily combined with other products during your nighttime skin routine. It also doesn’t have a strong scent like some other retinol products. I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. nan
