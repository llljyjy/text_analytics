Emulsified well and removed my makeup, however not impressed with it dues to the amount of product I had to use for my whole face and it left my eyes cloudy after washing off my mascara with it. I’ll continue to use this product until it’s gone but it’s unfortunate I have to use micellar water in my eyes and can’t use this for my whole face. Probably not worth the money for how quickly I’ll use it, and a hassle to avoid getting it near my eyes. nan
