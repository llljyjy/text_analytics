10% Niacinamide Night MaskI have been using this overnight mask for a couple of nights nows. First, my skin took some time to accept that cream, but I have seen visible results! It comes with a tiny applicator with a nice touch, but it’s a small handle. It absorbs into the skin fast and leaves my face feeling fresh, plump, and moisturized the next morning. I didn’t hae a smell, though, that I miss littles. I was gifted by pharmacy beauty. amazing product like it
