This cleansing balm was NOT IT. It took so much product to remove my makeup thoroughly before my face wash, and I am not a heavy makeup wearer (tinted moisturizer, blush, NON-waterproof mascara). I donâ€™t think a balm is the right consistency to thoroughly remove makeup. It also felt so oily and filmy and took forever to wash off. I even had to use micellar water before this, which resulted in a three-step cleanse overall! So unnecessary. I recommend using a cleansing oil, like Caudalie. Waxy and filmy, doesn't remove even light makeup
