Gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my review. I’m going to start with my con because it may seem silly, but it makes a difference to me—I hate the smell. Someone said it smelled like the water left after boiling  hot dogs and I couldn’t have said it better myself. For me, skincare is my way to de stress, so I like it to be an experience. This smell definitely takes away from that for me. Again, I realize it’s silly, but it’s just my preference. All that being said, I really like the consistency. It’s very much a liquid that absorbs quickly and gives a glowy finish. My skin does look more radiant without any irritation—although I’m already a daily vitamin c user. Overall, the formula and performance is good, but I can think of other serums that perform just as well without such an unpleasant smell. So for me, this is not a serum I would repurchase. nan
