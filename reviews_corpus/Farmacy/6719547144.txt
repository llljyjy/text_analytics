This moisturizer has a rich, buttery texture that glides right on. It is a nice thick moisturizer perfect for your PM skin routine but can also be worn under make up during the day. The finish offers a dewy complexion - not too oily or matte. There is a subtle honey fragrance which is really lovely. I have sensitive skin but the fragrance is very organic and the product is perfect for sensitive skin.I can feel the moisturizer working all night long and am very happy with itâ€™s results. Very good value/price point. Recommended! Rich, subtle fragrance, perfect for sensitive skin
