Farmcy Beauty gifted me their 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum to try.. It is hydrating and gentle on skin.. It doesn’t have any smell.. Im using it every other day without irritation.. It makes my skin soft and plumper.. I didn’t see changes on my fine lines yet, maybe it takes time to see results on fine lines and wrinkles.. I have some recent pimple marks that fading just very little.. I mean in 2 weeks using this product the appearance improvement of recent pimple marks is very little.. Well I think that will still be fine than being harsh and cause irritation.. It's hydrating!
