I absolutely love this balm. It’s soft and pliable as it warms up in your hands and a little goes a long way. It has a soft scent but it isn’t cloying. I typically use it on a dry face first then wet my hands for an add emulsifying effect and it works nicely to break down everything, including long lasting liners and mascara. holy grail status
