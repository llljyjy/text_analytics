I turned 30 this year and have noticed a few dark spots creeping up on my cheeks. Sadly, I have VERY sensitive skin especially on my cheeks. I’ve tried other Farmacy products and really enjoyed them so I wanted to try this. I used for about 3 weeks but my skin just could not tolerate it. Didn’t notice any difference in dark spots either, sadly. I’ve tried a few dark spot treatments but so far the only one I’ve been able to tolerate is the Cetaphil Vitamin C serum. Been using for about 2 weeks with little/no irritation and it does seem like the dark spots are actually fading a bit! highly recommend that one (approx $18 at Target) over this one. If you don’t have sensitive skin it may work better for you but, it was a NO for my skin. no-go for my sensitive skin
