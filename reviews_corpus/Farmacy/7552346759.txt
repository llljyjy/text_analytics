I’m obsessed!!! Currently on my 3rd bottle, will probably repurchase for the rest of my life. I have extremely sensitive skin, a lot of toners are too harsh or cause me to break out in a rash - this stuff on the other hand is like a miracle liquid. I struggle with acne and rosacea, and while I don’t see a difference in the redness on my face, I do see a difference in my pores/texture. I wish this came in a jumbo size!! nan
