I received the Farmacy 10% Niacinamide Night Mask complimentary from the brand in exchange for an honest review. For reference, I have dry, slightly-sensitive skin and a healing skin barrier. I wanted to love this product, I really did… but unfortunately, I don’t think this was for me. The packaging is beautiful. The texture is PHENOMENAL. It’s thick and juicy, in true night-mask fashion; it’s a beautiful blue and on the back of my hand, it felt like a hug. But when I put it on my face after layers of moisturizer, it stung. I was really hoping that this would help heal my skin barrier but it seemed to only irritate it more.  I used this 5 times, and every morning after, I woke up with irritation and stubborn breakouts.  Personally, my skin reacts well to *lower* percentages of niacinamide; I have a feeling this was just too strong for me.  IT’S A GOOD PRODUCT, and I imagine that this would be very well-suited to someone with an uncompromised, healthy skin barrier, but that’s just not me, unfortunately. :( good for *some* skin, NOT all skin :/
