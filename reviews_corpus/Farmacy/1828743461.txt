I’m very picky with skincare, especially cleansing balms/oils. But this product alone will remove all waterproof eye makeup, foundation and dead skin cells. I always double cleanse even if the product claims it’s not required. It’s not cheap, but it does the work and it’s not heavily scented. It melts very well unlike some other ones that tend to clump up. You also don’t need much to cover entire face+neck. Highly recommend. 10/10 NEW HG item to add
