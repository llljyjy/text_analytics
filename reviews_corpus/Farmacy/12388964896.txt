I take my skin care very seriously. I try to always buy clean products with no alcohol and this toner had everything that I desired. I first started using deep sweep about 2 years ago and I absolutely love it. For me, using this toner every other day does wonders for my skin. I’m not sure if I’ve noticed a difference with my pores ( I struggle with black heads on my nose ) but it definitely removes any left Over makeup or dirt and it leaves your skin feeling extremely clean! After this toner  ( in the pm before bed ) I follow up with a moisturizer and then in the AM my skin looks/feels amazing. nan
