I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I like this eye cream it’s very moisturizing and creamy. Love the texture. But as far as reducing dark circles, not quite. I mean genetically I have very pale skin and you can see my veins underneath which makes it seem like I have darker circles than I actually do so I’m not sure if I’m not seeing a difference because maybe I don’t have circles on the surface level of my skin. Who knows. But I have severely dry skin and this cream definitely sets my under eyes up for a perfect make up base throughout the day and that does make me happy. It’s nice… but
