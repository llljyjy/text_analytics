This serum was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I am loving this so far! I have dry sensitive skin and I’m always nervous about trying new retinol but I’ve been using this for a few weeks and it hasn’t irritated my skin at all. It hasn’t dried my skin out or broke me out. I have felt a difference in texture and it’s made my skin soft and I’m excited to see more results. The ingredients are also great in this since I’m always mindful with what I put on my face. nan
