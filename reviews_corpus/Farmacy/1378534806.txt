Finally found my perfect moisturizer! I’ve been on the hunt ever since the First Aid Beauty 5 in 1 face cream was discontinued. My skin isn’t bothered by anything in this cream and it has the perfect amount of moisture. My skin is left feeling calm, healthy, moisturized and even ready for makeup. nan
