I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This is a really wonderful gentle retinol that I think would be good for most beginning their retinol journey. It is lightweight, hydrating, and fast-absorbing. I have resilient combination skin and have been applying this a lot with no issues in terms of sensitivity. It has a really mild scent and is a great everyday retinol. Gentle and Effective
