There are a few things I like about this product. It’s quite moisturizing, which as someone with dry skin I appreciate. It has also helped with some minor discoloration on my forehead. Unfortunately, those two pluses don’t outweigh the minuses: it has an oily/sticky feeling that never completely disappears, and it makes any foundation that goes on over it look awful. nan
