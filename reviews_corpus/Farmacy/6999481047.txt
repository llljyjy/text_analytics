On my second full size jar of this and itâ€™s a winner. I have been fighting very dry skin over the summer and this seems to be the best answer to it without irritation. I do have a the fall seasonal eczema trying to pop up right now and this is helping to keep my skin as hydrated as possible. 10/10 Hydrate without irritation
