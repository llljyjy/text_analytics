I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my review.  I honestly love this eye cream!  First, the design of the tub is so cute and the ingredients are wonderfully natural.  The cream contains vitamin C, a proprietary honey blend, cranberry peptides, and encapsulated caffeine.  I didn’t notice any scent at all.  The consistency of the cream is very silky and it absorbs so well into my skin without any residue or greasiness.  I love the feel of it and how my undereye area immediately felt nourished, less puffy and brighter.  I am so excited to see continued results over time! I’m in love!
