The loveliest, gentlest makeup removing product. I love watching my mascara melt away after just lightly working it into my lashes. The scent is very fresh, not overpowering. It makes my skin feel lovely. I rinse off with lukewarm water. Sometimes I follow up with a cleanse. But you donâ€™t really need to. nan
