I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I use this product in place of my nighttime moisturizer to get the full effects of the 10% niacinamide. It’s a rich gel moisturizer that feels great on the skin. I love that they include a spatula, but I wish it was magnetic like the Honey Halo spatula. I would recommend this product if you’re looking for an easy way to incorporate niacinamide into your routine. nan
