Had a bit of a hard time with this cleanser at first because I was rinsing it off with warm water. Cold or lukewarm water is a must for rinse! Is as amazingly effective as the original formula. Switched to this one because i had eye sensitivity with the original formula and this one has really solved that problem. Absolutely recommend. rinse with cold water!
