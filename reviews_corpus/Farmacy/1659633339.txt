I’m in my 30’s now and looking for preventative skincare. I totally trust the Farmacy brand, so I was excited to try their 1% retinol serum. Since it’s my first time using a retinol product, I’m easing into it, only using it one night per week. So far, I haven’t experienced any irritation at all. I love that it has ceramides to rehydrate skin and raspberry seed oil to restore moisture. These ingredients are amazing together. I’m going to slowly increase how often I use it per week - looking forward to seeing some amazing results. Gifted by Farmacy beauty. nan
