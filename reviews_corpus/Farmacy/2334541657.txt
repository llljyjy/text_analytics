This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. However, all opinions are my own. I have been wanting to try out the Farmacy’s product for a while now especially since they have been getting relatively big on social media. I can say that I truly love the texture of this product. It goes on smoothly and melts into my skin effortlessly. I also love the packaging and how the metal spatula connects to the top of the jar. Very innovative. I love when brands do things like that. Anyway, I really like this product and can’t wait to try out some more of what they have in the near future. First, I just need to use all of my other products that I have. nan
