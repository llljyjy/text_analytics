Gifted by Farmacy. I have loved every product I’ve tried from the Farmacy brand, a few of their products are even every day staples (honeymoon glow, clean bee cleanser, Honey potion mask...) so I was excited to try their newest serum. Typically I have non reactionary experiences to skincare products. The first time I used this I didn’t give it a second thought. Pumped a couple times into my hands and applied to face. The texture is a very runny, dry oil. It applied as you would expect an oil to apply, it applied easily and evenly. The problem I had was that as it absorbed it started to burn my face. I had red splotches and itchy burning running across everywhere I just applied the serum.I took some allergy medicine and it all calmed down. Anyway though, I did continue to try this because I wanted to see if it was my skin/the product that was the issue. After a couple of applications my skin doesn’t respond that way anymore. It goes on smoothly and it makes my skin look more radiant. I haven’t noticed a change in dark spots or elasticity but it’s only been two weeks.Overall, vitamin c serum isn’t a skincare product I go out of my way to have in my normal skincare routine. So I don’t think this product is necessarily one you need to add in if you don’t typically use one. Patch test first - seriously
