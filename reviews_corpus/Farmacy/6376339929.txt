I go the Farmacy Healthy Skin Starter Kit complimentary from Farmacy. The package includes a big toner (50ml),  a small 12ml cleansing balm, a 10ml night serume, and 30ml moisturizer. it’s good but I don’t quite like the scent.  Especially the moisturizer smells like honey but strong. I like the toner, night serum and cleansing balm. The moisturizer is a bit heavier than what I used to use. good but don't like the scent.
