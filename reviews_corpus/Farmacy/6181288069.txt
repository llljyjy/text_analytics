I received this as a sample and fully intend to buy the full product when empty. It applies beautifully and leaves the skin plump and hydrated while adding a glow from within type appearance. Your skin just looks healthy after use. It has a really subtle honey scent that isn’t overpowering. Those who had a ’rancid’ smell 100% had a bad batch. To avoid pilling, apply early on in your routine and only use a small amount. The more you use, the more pilling that happens. I absolutely love this serum. Favorite Hyaluronic Acid Product
