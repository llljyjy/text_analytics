Does exactly what a good foaming Cleanser should do. Give you that really “clean“ feeling but doesn’t strip your face of moisture and you skin is so soft after using. I have paired it with the honey mask, honey halo cream and honey grail oil and it all works so good together . Truly a god send for dry skin! GOAT Foaming Cleanser
