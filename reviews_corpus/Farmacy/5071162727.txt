I have some dark spots from post-acne so I know vitamin C is great for those. Since this is a “waterless” serum it has a rather oily consistency. It’s not oil per se but it feels slick and oily and it has a slightly unpleasant scent so I always wash my hands after use. The smell isn’t horrible at all - it smells a little like Tiger Balm, for all my Asian women who know what this is.  A little product really goes a long way.The whole bottle is only 1 fl oz though, which is such a tinyyyy amount for the hefty price of $50 and the decent sized bottle - not sure why they would waste so much plastic just to hold 1 fl oz.
