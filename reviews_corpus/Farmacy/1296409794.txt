I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I have been trying every single vitamin C serum under the sun to combat some sun damage on my skin. This one is different I can tell the formulation was stronger upon application. Because this is the first time I felt vitamin C tingle. I’ve been using it every day for the last five days and I can tell that one of my dark spots is light lighting up. I’m a runner and I try to prevent sun damage on my face. It’s something even if you use the best sunscreen and wear a hat if you spend a lot of time outside sun damage is going to happen no matter what. I’ve even tried laser facials which were very expensive and they didn’t make  a difference. I will continue using this even if it only lightens it up a little bit it’s still doing much better than the lasers ever did. The funny part is the Very Cherry serum  didn’t help at all but this one is definitely much better than that one. I was gifted this item but don’t let that influence you at all I honestly came into this thinking this serum wouldn’t work. I paid a lot for Cherry line (the serum and eye cream) and wasn’t impressed so I didn’t have high expectations for this one. I am so happy that I was wrong. I have several high-end vitamin C serum’s that I have tried over the last year and this by far is the most potent one. Better than the Very Cherry Serum
