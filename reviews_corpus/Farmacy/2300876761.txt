I was in the market for a new vitamin C serum and so I was really excited to try this one! This was great quality, not sticky, and layered so well with my other products. I like that I also didn’t feel like I needed to use a lot as a little went a long way. I haven’t seen results with this yet as I have always used a vit c serum, but so far this is a great option! This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own! Love!
