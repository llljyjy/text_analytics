This is not spectacular, but it does do what it advertises! It is definitely gentle enough to be used daily, and it makes my face a bit smoother and softer after use. My acne has been helped with this too! I still have a bit of congestion, but itâ€™s a bit better. I give 5 stars not due to it blowing me out of the water, but it doing what it says at a decent price point. Lasts a long time, and my dry/dehydrated skin handles this well :) Gentle!
