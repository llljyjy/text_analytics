my maturing, combo/dry sensitive skin is loving this. i usually use a gel moisturizer but with the cold air of winter, i needed something thicker. this is amazing, it soothes and smooths my skin and makes my skin feel so hydrated and soft. the smell is really subtle to my nose. I’ve found a little goes a long way so don’t over apply, also makes the price point more not as bad considering how little you need. i’m hoping the travel size i purchased will last through the winter. i recommend this to dry/combo/normal skin types.  will definitely repurchase. loving it
