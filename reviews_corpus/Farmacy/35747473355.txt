This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. This is my review based off my first impressions. The packaging is minimalistic but cute. Packaging matters to me. Itâ€™s a good size bottle. It did not irritate my sensitive skin thank goodness! I do see my self continuing to use this. Overall I like it! First impression
