I am already so in love with this product! It’s not a typical serum consistency. It’s almost more like an oil but it sinks in so nicely and works great with the rest of the products I use. I love how brightening the product is but I will say that it has quite a potent scent that reminds me of barbecue. Still love it regardless! Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. nan
