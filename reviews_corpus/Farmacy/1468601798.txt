A great alternative to the Skinceuticals vitamin c serum. I actually like this one better because it doesn’t make my breakout. It’s lightweight and doesn’t make my makeup pill. I love it! I apply in the morning after my niacinimide serum. I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Great for oily skin!
