I really loved this product. I like how it is waterless so the Vitamin C is more concentrated. I also like the packaging so it can prevent oxidation hopefully which is a big issue that I have with Vitamin C. I’m so impressed with every Farmacy product I try. It’s starting to become one of my favorite skincare brands. I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Love this pure Vitamin C serum
