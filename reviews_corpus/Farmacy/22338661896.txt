I received this complimentary from Farmacy and I really love it! The Retinol with Vitamin A is the best part. I wish it was a larger size because I love it that much. I only need a small amount and this serum absorbs good and is not greasy. My skin is dry and this serum has really helped my skin tone with hydration. I put this serum mostly around my mouth where my fine lines are starting to form when I smile. I do use it all over my face also but I add extra by my mouth. I use my moisturizer after I use this and sunscreen. I am a big fan of this product and I took it with me when I traveled this weekend. I even saw my dullness disappear after one week of using this serum. Creamy
