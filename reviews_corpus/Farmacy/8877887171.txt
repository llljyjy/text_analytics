* gifted by Farmacy Beauty *I actually really like this serum! After almost a week’s use, my skin feels brighter, plumper, and looks more hydrated. I have severe acne scarring so I might need to use it for longer to see it work (but again it’s pretty severe). My only con is that the smell is kinda weird, not terrible and it definitely goes away but it did throw me off. nan
