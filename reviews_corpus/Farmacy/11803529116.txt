Melts away your makeup?  Not mine.  After using this, I still have half my eye makeup on and my mascara is smeared for that raccoon look.  No matter how much gentle massaging and rinsing I do, the result is the same.  Frankly I’m better off using a simple makeup remover wipe; my face feels much more clean afterward, and better hydrated.Consistency is like very thick petroleum jelly.  You would think that with such a greasy feel the face would feel hydrated afterward; not so.  Scent is indeed very “green,“ almost grassy, and inoffensive.  After several uses the jury has come back with a resounding Guilty of wasting my money on a simple yet not particularly effective cleanser.  My bad.  This has soured me of trying anything else from the brand. Smells Green, Doesn't Clean
