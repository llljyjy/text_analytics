For those of you who like a more scientific explanation: this contains retinal (also called retinaldehyde) and retinol. Retinal is one conversion into the active form and retinol is two conversions. Note: you cannot purchase the active form, also called retinoic acid, in the US.Per Farmacy’s information, the retinol is encapsulated, meaning that this truly does offer a slow release of these ingredients into your skin. You’re getting fast activity via the retinal and a slow release through the night as the encapsulation breaks apart and then the retinol converts. The opaque pump system also protects the ingredients from light and air - important especially with the retinal.In short: very nifty idea!I believe it works in practice as well. I didn’t experience discomfort in using this, nor did I see any reactions. I think it’s wise that they have this in a creamy base as I suspect that may improve comfort of the product.Overall, this is a very exciting release! Gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
