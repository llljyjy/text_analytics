I received this gifted by Farmacy Beauty and i am a huge fan. So it does have an oily feel to it but it’s a much softer feel than a traditional oil. It works so well and I usually put a less oily moisturizer on top to balance out before I apply makeup and it’s an amazing base. This stuff makes my face feel sooo soft and really brightens!
