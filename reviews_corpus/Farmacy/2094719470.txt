Vitamin C is a must in my am skin routine. I’ve tried many different brands and I love other products by Farmacy but this vitamin c is not it. I’ve given it a couple of chances now and even tried pairing with different products. To start off it smells like hot dogs, I don’t really get hung up on smells but this one lingers for a while & i can smell myself. The product itself is oily (feels a little like silicone) & for some reason the product feels hot on my hands & face. I am combo skin so I try to use lighter products; Looking at the serum it makes me think it’s lightweight but it actually just kind of sits on my skin & therefore leaves me looking like a glazed donut (which would be ok maybe in winter but its now summer pretty much in Ca). I guess I will be going back to my Mad Hippie vitamin c. Farmacy, this is not it
