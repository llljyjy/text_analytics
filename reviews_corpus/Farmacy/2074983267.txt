Ok, wow. I am blown away by this night mask. My skin is fairly dry, moderate redness and I get occasional pimples. I also have larger pores in some areas of my face. I noticed a difference immediately! My skin is smoother, dry patches are gone, pores are smaller and the overall look of my skin is WAY better. I have used other niacinamide products before, and saw a little bit of a difference, but nothing like this. I use it as directed, on top of my usual nighttime routine. I don’t find it to be greasy like others have mentioned but I don’t slather it on. I need to make this stuff last. I should also mention that I did not receive this for free, I paid for it myself. Immediately Yes
