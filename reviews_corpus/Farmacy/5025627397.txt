Best thing so gentle! I struggled for a while to find a product that could actually remove my makeup in one wash, false lash application and all. This. Is. It. This stuff is a God sent and it doesn’t break me out at all. I have sensitive to normal skin and let me tell you, not one bad reaction to it. It doesn’t leave your face feeling stripped either because of the balm melting factor. So good. best best product!
