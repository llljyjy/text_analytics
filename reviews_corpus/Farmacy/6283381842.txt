It’s a toner. I have combination skin, with black heads on my nose, and hormonal acne. It really truly didn’t do much. I use toner every night and this was just very lack luster for me. My blackheads didn’t improve and neither did my skins texture. I would suggest the new tatcha toner. It’s an experience. The smell is great, the experience is great, and I think my skin is looking more vibrant and clear. It’s Just A Regular Toner
