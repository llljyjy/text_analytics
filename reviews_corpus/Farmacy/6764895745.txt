This is a brilliant makeup-removing balm. A little goes a long way, and it actually removes EVERYTHING. I’ve tried other products like this (’Ultrabland’ from Lush and the Burt’s Bees cleansing balm) and they’ve never been able to remove all of my waterproof eye makeup. This, however, does. I use this as the first step of my nightly routine on days when I wear makeup before following up with their foaming cleanser. My skin feels soft and smooth every time. One of my favorite products & does its job
