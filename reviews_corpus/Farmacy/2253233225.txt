As someone with sensitive skin, with hyperpigmentation I love to use vitamin c to help with skin brightness and texture. However it can be difficult however to find formulas that donâ€™t cause dry patches, and irritation. I am so excited with how this one performing so far (about a week of use) and have felt like my skins overall appearance is firmer and brighter, and have yet to experience any issues ! The product was gifted by farmacy beauty but I can see myself purchasing it in the future. nan
