I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for an honest review, so here it is — this waterless + oil-free vitamin C serum feels amazing on my (chronically bone-dry) skin. I apply it after cleansing and using a waterless toner (that also has a propanediol base - which is what this product has as its formulation base as well). I love that it is fragrance-free, and loaded with powerful clinically-proven actively like 10% L-ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, alpha-arbutin, and lactic acid - all of which help with skin brightening and cell turnover. It absorbs within less than a minute, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized/softened in contrast to a lot of aloe/water-based serums that can leave your skin feeling tight/elastic. I haven’t used this long enough to speak in regard to the long-term benefits this serum provides, however from looking at the ingredients list alone, I envision noticeably brighter, even, and fresh-looking skin after a month of use. This also works as a perfect base before applying any silicone primers and/or foundations (i.e. no piling). All in all, this is truly an exceptional product that I plan on purchasing after this one runs out. Amazing For Dry Skin
