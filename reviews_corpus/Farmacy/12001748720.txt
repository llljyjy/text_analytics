I’ve repurchased this product easily over 5 times. My favorite makeup removing method gentle on the skin and effective. Always start with DRY hands. I like to scoop 1-2 pea size pieces of product and work it into the skin in circular motions focussing on the eyeshadow/mascara to melt it all down. Once the makeup looks “melted” enough I then rinse with water, again focusing on my eyes to make sure the makeup and cleanser is rinsed off completely otherwise it will bother my eyes a bit. I then I use a facial cleanser to wash my face again because I like to double cleanse after wearing makeup but I’ve done a wipe test and the makeup balm does a great job on its own already. I will mention I tried the goodmolecules balm when I ran out of Farmacy Green clean thinking “hey its just a makeup remover balm it’ll work the same.” trying to save a few dollars and it didn’t remove any of my makeup Only makeup remover I use
