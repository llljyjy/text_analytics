I am a big fan of retinol products but they are definitely not all created the same. That’s why I was very excited about this new retinol serum.  I am so impressed with this retinol and its just another winner for the brand. It’s quite effective at improving texture, tone and overall look of skin without any irritation. I look forward to seeing the anti-aging benefits with continued use. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. A retinol winner!
