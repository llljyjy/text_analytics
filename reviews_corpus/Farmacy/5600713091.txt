If you live Niacinamide you will love this mask! It looks like a gel but actually applies thicker so a smaller amount goes a long way. It’s different from hydrating sleeping masks in that regard. It has no scent from what I can tell which I really appreciate. It’s perfectly gentle enough to use nightly. I see a noticeable difference in my skin after using this a few days in a  row. Also love the color, packaging and cute flexible silicone spatula! Excellent if you love Niacinamide
