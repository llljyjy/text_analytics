To put you into perspective as to why I chose this headline is because I wear a whole face of make-up. I wear two to three coats of Tarte’s Lights, Camera, Splashes WTP mascara.I also used Clinique’s Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm but noticed that it takes a little more elbow grease to remove the mascara at the lash roots. I wanted to try something new. Also, I cannot use the OG Farmacy Cleansing Balm so I gave this one a shot.A little goes a long way! A little amount, close to a dime size, removes & dislodges all of my makeup.  The last roots are mascara-free in little time. But! This is where this product is only 4 stars in my opinion, It’s hard to wash off. I rinse and rinse and it doesn’t come off right away.I use the Original Make-Up Eraser too to make sure that the product is off my skin and that the towel, after that I wash my face, is completely clean.  I forgot to mention that I also use this to remove the sunscreen on my face on make-up free days. It works like a charm.If they update the formula to rinse off better, I would give it another try.  But I think I’ll revert back to my Clinique Take the Day Off Cleaning Balm because even though I do need to work it a little more, I know that rinsing it off will be a breeze. It removes EVERYTHING!!!
