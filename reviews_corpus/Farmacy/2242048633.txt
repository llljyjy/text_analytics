One of the best ways to remove makeup! I use this on my heavier makeup days and it works great, smells wonderful, and washes off easily. I do double cleanse with this, following up my normal cleanser and removing with a damp washcloth, but it never leaves a residue or anything. I love to massage it in, it feels very relaxing and comfortable. Definitely a must have for me, works better than the other cleansing balms Iâ€™ve tried! nan
