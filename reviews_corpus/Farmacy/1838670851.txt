Gifted by Farmacy Beauty to provide my honest review. I have sensitive skin, so it is hard to find a retinol product my skin can tolerate and not make it super red and irritated. It has a light texture that was quickly absorbed into my skin. It does have a light scent put nothing to strong which is tolerable. great for sensative skin
