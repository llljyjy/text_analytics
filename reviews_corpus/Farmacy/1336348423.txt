I’ve been using the Farmacy 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum and I’m in love! This serum has wonderful plastic pump applicator packaging that makes it very easy to dispense. The Farmacy 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum has a great consistency that is lightweight and easily absorbed into the skin. The serum leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. I feel like it helps with the fine lines immediately because of the hydration but it is hard to tell about the lightening of dark spots since it is still quite early in the bottle.I would definitely recommend the Farmacy 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum because it seems to really work and has definitely improved my skin! Great serum!
