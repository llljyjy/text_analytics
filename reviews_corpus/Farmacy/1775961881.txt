I received this eye cream complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I’ve been using the new Wake Up Honey Eye Cream from farmacy and I really like the texture. This eye cream is perfect for my skin at the moment, the cold makes my face extra dry. I really like that this honey eye cream is thick and creamy but it also doesn’t irritate my eyes. So far I’ve noticed it helping hydrate my under eyes. Hydrating and gentle on under eyes
