Not worth the hype. Have to scrub rigorously to get even stubborn waterproof eye makeup off. Also like others have stated, if used anywhere near the eyes, it causes temporary blurriness or “blindness” for up to 15 minutes (For me anyways). Definitely not worth it for the price, there are better options out there! Not Worth The Hype.
