This product is great for skin care beginners. I’m completely new to using retinol skincare products so I’m glad that I am trying one that is practically fool proof. I like the packaging, classic and true to the Farmacy brand aesthetic. The serum itself is a nice consistency. It absorbs easily into the skin and it’s lightweight. I’m not a fan of the way that it smells because of the active ingredients, however there is no added fragrance so it doesn’t linger and it is tolerable. So far I have started incorporating it into my night time skin care routine twice a week. I do notice in the morning there definitely appears to be some improvement in my smile lines and the firmness of my forehead. Hoping the results become even more noticeable with consistent use over time. Overall I would recommend this product. This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty, but the opinions that I shared are entirely my own. Great for retinol beginners
