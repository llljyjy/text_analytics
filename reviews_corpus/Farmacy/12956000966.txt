I’ve repurchased this product a few times. I’ll continued to purchase it int he future. It lives up to what it claims to do. It hydrates the skin well. I recommend this for normal, dry, mature, or  textured skin. If you do purchase this make sure you keep the lid on. When the lid is off for a long period of time the product gets thicker and is a bit harder to scoop out. A must-have!
