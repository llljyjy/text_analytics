I received this serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. First of all, I enjoy a lot of Farmacy products and this did not disappoint. This serum is creamy and contains no fragrance. It’s very easy to layer. It has a unique retinol and retinaldehyde blend which makes it a bit hard to compare strengths. I’ve been using this MWF with no irritation. Since I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, I can’t really tell you know much it helped with acne or PIE/PIH but I did go from one retinal to this and did not purge. nan
