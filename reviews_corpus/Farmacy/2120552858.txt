I’ve heard rave reviews about this moisturizer so I wanted to try it for myself. I’ve been looking for a nighttime moisturizer that’s a little thicker and more hydrating. While I did find this to be hydrating, I can’t justify using it. After one application, I had a huge, painful zit on my jawline and another started forming on my cheek. I gave it some time just in case it was a fluke, but it didn’t get any better. If you’re acne prone I would try to get a sample first so you don’t waste your money! Acne prone folks, stay away!
