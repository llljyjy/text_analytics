I really liked this serum mainly for the ingredients as I am breastfeeding and using only safe products.  This serum is safe.  The first time I used it I was scared because it heats up the skin, I thought it might be an allergic reaction but it was nothing.  It is normal for you to feel a feeling of heat on your face when using.  Its scent is very soft, my skin feels more hydrated and brightening. Safe!
