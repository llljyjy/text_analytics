I received these products complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I love these products! Everything smells so nice and not overpowering.  The green clean makeup removing cleansing balm is so nice and fun to cleanse my face with it removes the makeup really well.  I like that I can just wash it off with a washcloth afterward. The Toner feels really refreshing and like it’s doing a good job. The resurfacing night serum I had a hard time getting out of the container maybe it is just me or the sample size I dunno. But it was hard to get it out. The honey halo moisturizer smells so heavenly and soaks into my skin and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy like other moisturizers. The only thing is the cleansing balm and moisturizer both come in jars which are nice, but I wish they had a little spatula or something to get the stuff out with. When I use my finger the product gets stuck under my fingernails. I can feel good about using these products because they are clean and not full of junk you don’t need in your skincare routine. nan
