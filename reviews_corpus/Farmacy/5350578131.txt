I want to love this product. I was looking for something a little less heavy than the keihls daily moisturizer, and something ideally oil free to help with pores. However for those people with sensitive skin, this is sadly not a holy grail product. I tried using the Neutrogena hydro boost years ago, and gave up on it after my skin redness and dryness wasn’t helped. So I was weary when I bought this but saw all the rave reviews. It felt great going on, between the hyaluronic acid and added fragrances, I noticed that my face felt pretty dry within 30 minutes. I tried putting it on again in the AM, dampening my face before hand, and noticed my lips tingle and my face turn splotchy and red. So simply, I’m allergic to something that is common in gel moisturizers. Will be returning this and looking out for a fragrance free moisturizer. Hope it works for some people but writing this to give a different perspective. Great texture/absorption - NOT for sensitive skin
