Where do I start? I’ve been someone who has struggled to find skincare that actually works and makes my super textured skin look smooth and good under make up.  I actually got this in a subscription box, and I was skeptical at first. I used it at night and during the day. At first, I’d wake up with the typical dry area on my face and I almost gave up. But something told me to stick with it because it’s luxurious and the smell is so lovely. Fast forward to about a month of using this- my skin was hydrated and look amazing when I would wake up. I made the mistake of not re-purchasing after I finished my second jar. My skin is not very happy at the moment, but I have my beloved Honey Halo back in my life. I cannot wait for my skin to get back to where it was. I use it with a very low grade retinol and a face oil. What a combination!! My skin has never looked better when I was using this, and I’m turning 37 in a few months. Holy grail skincare
