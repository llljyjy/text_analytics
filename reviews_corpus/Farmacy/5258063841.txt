This was gifted to me by Farmacy beauty. This is just an ok texture for me. It’s very oily and has the same hot dog ish smell that the drunk elephant vitamin c serum has. I know that comes with the territory with real vitamin c serums but I just don’t love the texture or smell as much as other formula I have. I can’t speak to the results as I’m still testing it out but it’s been gentle so far with no breakouts. Very oily
