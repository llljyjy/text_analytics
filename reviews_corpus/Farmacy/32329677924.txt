I’m new to using retinol and this is a good product to start with! I’ve only used it once a week and plan to build my tolerance. Be sure to use it at night so that you don’t get exposed to the sun with the serum on. I didn’t experience any breakouts and I have sensitive skin. Overall, it goes on very smoothly and has a hint of fruity smell to hide the strong chemical smells. This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own. Good Start to Retinol
