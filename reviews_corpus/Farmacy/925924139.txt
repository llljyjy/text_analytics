I have been using this product for 1 year.  This was my first hyaluronic acid serum that I tried and I liked the results it had on my skin(the glow).  It can feel a bit sticky but that isn’t a problem for me.  The only con is the smell and that is the reason I do not use this product on a daily basis.  If they create a fragrance free version I would increase the usage.  I tend to use this with my Trader Joe’s version(my holy grail product)to cut down the smell. nan
