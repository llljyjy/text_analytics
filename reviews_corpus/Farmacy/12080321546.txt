Farmacy gifted me this smoothing leave-on night mask with 10% Niacinamide that’s claims to visibly improve skin texture, refine pores, and support the skin’s moisture barrier. I must say after using it at night, I can feel my skin very hydrated, soft, and bright! I used it at night as the last step on my routine and  my skin is even-looking in the morning after 2 weeks of use! I would definitely recommend. Love this cream!
