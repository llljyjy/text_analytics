I’ve been using this sunscreen for a little over two years, and have been super disappointed in the new formula. The previous formula was wonderful. It was creamy, went on smooth, blended well, left no white cast, and worked well as a base for make up. The new formula does none of those things. It’s a weird whipped consistency, difficult to blend into the skin, and leaves a white cast for several minutes. It also pills if you try to put anything on top of it, even if it’s just concealer on a beauty blender. I will not be repurchasing. Disappointing New Formula
