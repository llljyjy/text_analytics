I got this moisturizer in a fab fit fun box and fell in love!  I tried other lotions but ended up going back to this one as a day time moisturizer.  It smells great and feels hydrating but not too heavy.  Gives my skill a little zing and I love it.  The magnetic lit with spatula is genius!  Highly recommend. nan
