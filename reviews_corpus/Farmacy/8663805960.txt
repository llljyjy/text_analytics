Incredible. I’m about to purchase the jumbo size. I’m currently on tretinoin/retinol, & my skin is dry, peeling it’s been tough BUT this moisturizer really has made a difference. It’s lightweight but still is very hydrating! There is basically no scent. I just love this brand every product I’ve tried i love! I have combination, acne prone & extreme sensitive skin… perfect for winter time!
