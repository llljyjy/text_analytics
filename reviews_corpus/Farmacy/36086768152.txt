I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty their Vitamin C Serum and it’s not for me. I’ll probably give it to a friend to try to see if they like it. The texture was nice but when I put it on my face it made me feel dry and sticky. It also did not smell good, I disliked the way it smelt. But could have potential for someone else. Gifted by Farmacy
