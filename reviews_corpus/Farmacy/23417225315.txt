I received the 10% Waterless Vitamin C serum gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This lightweight serum feels a bit oily but sinks into my skin fairly quickly. I haven’t been using it for too long so I can’t say much about how well it lightens dark spots but the ingredients in this are great for hyperpigmentation. One thing I don’t like about this serum is how it smells. It doesn’t smell like hot dog water but there is a distinct smell that doesn’t go away within minutes of application nan
