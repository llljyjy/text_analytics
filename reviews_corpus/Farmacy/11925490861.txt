Farmacy is my new obsession! I was excited to try out their eye cream after trying their new moisturizer. The eye cream is soft and silky in texture. There isnâ€™t a strong scent to it. It does a great job hydrating your under eye area. I noticed a slight change in my skin texture in that I saw less creasing of concealer under my eye. I was gifted this eye cream by Farmacy Beauty.
