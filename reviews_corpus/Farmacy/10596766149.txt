I thought this wouldn’t be any better than using coconut oil to remove makeup, but I was so wrong. This cleansing balm is AMAZING !! Unlike coconut oil, I don’t need to use another facial cleanser to remove any lingering residue. It doesn’t leave my face feeling dry or stripped either. It has no scent really, although the Peaches N Clean version smells divine (unfortunately was sold out when I went so I got this version) Amazing and much better than coconut oil !
