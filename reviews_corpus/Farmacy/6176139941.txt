I absolutely love Vitamin C serum’s and this was is an amazing addition to my collection! I really did notice a brightening effect after just a few uses. I really like the scent it’s not too overpowering. It feels like more of an oil texture that a typical serum. It’s pretty light weight and sinks right into my skin. Can’t wait to keep using it and see longer term results! This was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty all thoughts and opinions are my own. Amazing serum
