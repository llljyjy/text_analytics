First impression from texture and scent - wow this is potent! It smelled like professional skincare and texture was a surprise to me as it seemed oily but did not feel oily after touching the skin. I used it over toned or damp skin as it seem to go smoother that way and it dried out super fast. Works so well under makeup and makes a great base for it. My skin looked brighter and more even after a few days of using it. I truly enjoy this serum as it appears to be of a high quality product. Packaging is very pleasant and cute too. First time using it my skin felt plumped and moisturized. Only needed little bit to cover my face and neck. Highly Potent
