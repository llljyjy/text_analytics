A dime size amount is enough to remove all eye makeup because a little goes a long way. It’s gentle on the eyes, and does not cause breakouts on the T-zone. I always use a cleanser afterwards to remove the residue. It’s so gentle and I never have to scrub very hard to remove makeup. I also never lose my natural lashes while using this. I will never use makeup wipes again. You feel so clean and fresh after using this! The smell is also soothing.One thing, you do need to follow up with a moisturizer and eye cream afterwards because it leaves a tight, clean feeling. Amazing product! Must have!
