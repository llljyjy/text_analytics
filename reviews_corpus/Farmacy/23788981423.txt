I have sensitive combination skin and retinol does not suits me but I took the chance of trying this and it did not cause any irritation and also does not smell bad like other retinol products, it is very lightweight and get absorbed completely, I am using this with my daily moisturizer, gifted by Farmacy good for sensitive skin
