This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. I have heard so many great things about Farmacy Beauty. When I had the opportunity to test a waterless vitamin c serum, I was so excited!There are so many reasons to love this product! 10% vitamin C:   Why is Vitamin C important in your skincare routine?- It is a powerful antioxidant that protects against free radicals- Helps reduce hyperpigmentation - Helps brighten skin - Reduces dark spots - Reduces sun damage- Boosts collagen production and reduces wrinkles Waterless formula: Waterless products are trending now and for good reason. There are benefits to using a waterless formula. - a waterless formula allows for a higher concentration of nutrients and vitamins rather than one that is diluted- Better penetration of ingredients - Less need for preservatives Serum- a serum based vitamin c product is preferable to a cream.  A cream moisturizes and hydrates the superficial layers of the skin whereas a serum penetrates deeper to target and repair skin concerns. I love this waterless vitamin C serum! I have used many vitamin C products before and they tend to irritate my skin. This product does not irritate my skin at all! The texture feels more of a thin oil without feeling oily or greasy. The best word to describe the texture is “satin-y”. After applying this to cleansed skin, my face feels hydrated. It takes a minute to fully absorb and once absorbed it leaves my face feeling satiny smooth. I notice my complexion looking brighter and more radiant. Very hydrating
