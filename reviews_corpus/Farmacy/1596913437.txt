Was previously using Tacha dewy skin cream for a number of months because I found it hydrating and didn’t find it increased breakouts… tried this on a whim because the Tacha moisturizer is a) expensive and b) not super remarkable so I’m always kind of on the hunt for the best moisturizer for my skin (I seem to switch every year or so). I’m SO glad I took a chance on this because it’s lovely. Wayyyy more affordable per oz than Tacha (you can get 3.4oz vs 1.7oz for approx the same cost). It’s very hydrating, doesn’t break me out, and in fact might actually be preventing new breakouts. I use this in conjunction with Sunday Riley Luna and Good Genes (alternating nights) and it’s been perfect. My skin is looking super healthy, hydrated, clear, and fine-lines are softer. Best moisturizer I’ve tried in… honestly ever. Well worth the $$$! Heaven for Acne-Prone Skin
