This is a fantastic moisturizer - on my third container. Iâ€™m at the end of a course of Accutane, so I am dry and sensitive, and this stuff is amazing for it. No exaggeration when I say this has been saving my skin this winter. BUT...the shape of the jar, while cute, is a hassle when you are trying to get the last of it out. Please change the jar!! Love The Product, Hate The Jar
