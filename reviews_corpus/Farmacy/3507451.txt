I was gifted by farmacy beauty  me this 10% waterless Vitamin C serum.  This serum is lightweight and is easily absorbed by the skin,  I used it morning and night after cleansing and toning my skin.  It contains 10% L ascorbic acid, which is the most potent form of vitamin C.  it serves to brighten the skin and lightens dark spots over a short time.  It does not sting your face.  But be sure to use SFP during the day to protect your skin nan
