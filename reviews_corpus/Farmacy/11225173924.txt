i turned 30 years and began a journey to really take my skincare up a notch. after spending hundreds of dollars and going through dozens of moisturizers, i finally discovered this magical product. where has it been my whole life? the moisturizer is thick and dreamy, it melts into the skin, and it nourishes from within. i seal it with an oil at night, but if it’s morning, it’s good enough to last for the whole day. i’ve always had tiny little bumps under my skin when i use a thick moisturizer, but this has been the exception. between this and snail mucin, i have cut down on so many unnecessary steps in my skincare routine. it is perfection. on my third jar currently and i am just so grateful for its existence. LOVE LOVE LOVE. my holy grail moisturizer
