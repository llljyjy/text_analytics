This niacinamide night mask complimentary from Farmacy Beauty is a slightly sticky gel like formula. It comes with a spatula which helps with application. I apply a thin layer and leave it overnight. I use it after toner and moisturizer. A little goes a long way with this product so you donâ€™t need to apply it like a mask. I definitely noticed a difference in my skin in the morning. I now use it regularly and have felt an improvement on my nose and cheeks where I usually get blackheads and large pores. Smooth glowy skin overnight
