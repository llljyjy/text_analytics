This is such a good serum. It really does give you a glow the next morning! I read lots of complaints that it has a smell, but the acids that actually work do tend to smell a bit and this is nowhere near the worst offender. It’s pretty strong for me, I can’t use it every night but I don’t think you’re supposed to, so it’s great! Will be repurchasing. Fabulous
