Thank you Farmacy beauty for gifted me your Healthy Skin Starter Kit in exchange for my honest review. This is my first time trying the Farmacy beauty brand. This kit has a very good travel size that will last you weeks. I tried the kit for more than a week, and I love how it improves my skin concern. I have another to-go brand yet again. All the product does have scents but itâ€™s subtle and very pleasant scents. The cleansing balm has a light green balm that melts into your skin and removes your makeup and even sunscreen which is sometimes hard to clean out completely. The clear toner helps clean pores control all my excess oil especially on the T-zone area, and prep your skin for the next step of your skincare routine. The light yellow lotion-like serum help exfoliate and resurface my skin, it removes my dead skin and helps improve my skin tone. The thick light yellow moisturizer cream gives extra hydration to my dry skin and makes it look refreshed and moist. I recommend this kit if you want to try all the best seller products from Farmacy Beauty without breaking the bank. Love it!
