In 2022 I started my latest skincare journey focused around the absolute essential: a retinoid. It took months to see even the slightest change in my hormonal adult acne. At the 4-month mark with unimpressive results, I decided to add in vitamin c to my morning routine. After 2 months of daily use of the Farmacy vitamin C serum, I can say without question, my complexion has finally evened out. I think this is primarily due to the lightening or complete erasure of dark spots/scars left over from breakouts. I’m fairly certain the vitamin C is responsible for this, as the last 2 months are when I’ve experienced the most dramatic change in my complexion (my before+after pics are insane). Further, because of the retinoid, I have peeling and redness on occasion (due to dehydration, heat, etc.), and while this serum sometimes stings upon application, its worth the end result. My suggestion is to stick with this product for a month or two before making a final decision. In combo with a retinoid, it has been a total game changer for me. nan
