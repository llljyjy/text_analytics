I really liked this serum, it went on easily and soaked into my skin fairly quickly. I have somewhat sensitive skin but had no issues, but always do a skin test before using anything really. The scent is a bit odd, but not overpowering at all. My skin looked nice and felt smooth, no greasiness or anything. It also worked well underneath foundation which is a plus! I love this brand and havenâ€™t been disappointed in a product thus far. I love it!
