I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and I find that this mask is not easy to make work. I can’t use it on the bottom half of my face around my chin and jawline as it makes me break out, and if I use it on my forehead I have to use a good moisturizer beforehand or else it burns and leaves my skin red and splotchy. I’ve been consistently using the mask on my upper face after applying the Farmacy Honey Halo moisturizer and I find that the combo has improved the texture and firmness of my skin on my forehead. So it works, but it’s tricky. nan
