The Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream is a great light weight cream. You only need a small amount to apply under the eyes and it’s easy to disperse. It absorbs completely into the skin so there is no greasy feeling on the skin. Even though it’s a light weight cream, it’s very hydrating. My under eyes felt moisturized and less puffy. nan
