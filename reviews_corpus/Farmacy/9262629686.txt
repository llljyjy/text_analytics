Wow! Farmacy knocked it out of the ballpark once again! Such beautiful texture. Look at it. Just look at that beauty!A little goes a long way with this rich eye cream. It’s not something I’d use in my nighttime routine though brand suggests it can be used day and night. Caffeine doesn’t really cut it overnight. However, Wake Up Honey does an excellent job at moisturizing my undereye area and gives a subtle brightening effect. It’s a rather sticky consistency so I’d recommend you let it completely soak in and dry before applying any other product over it.No scent to speak of, not honey, not orange/lemon, no coffee. I think it’s priced fairly and competitively. Made in USA. Love it and will repurchase.Received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. Beautiful
