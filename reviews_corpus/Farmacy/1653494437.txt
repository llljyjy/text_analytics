I literally have never written a review for a product before but I had to for this one…. LOVE IT!I have extremely oily skin that causes a lot of transfer with my makeup, specifically my mascara to my under eyes. For this reason I switched to waterproof mascara. I used to use wipes but my mascara would never come off. With this product, my mascara comes right off! The balmy texture was weird to get used to at first, but it is very worth it for my clean face afterwards. No need to wash with another product after! I can’t say enough about this. Lifesaver with waterproof mascara
