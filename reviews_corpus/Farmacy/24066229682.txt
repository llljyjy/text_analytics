This serum is extremely potent! At first, it goes on silky and a bit greasy, but it sinks into the skin after about 2 full minutes, leaving the skin matte and no longer shiny looking. It really penetrated my skin by sinking in like that! I can tell it is very potent and will maximize the diffusion of dark spots. The ONLY thing I cannot get over is the scent. It has no added fragrance, and it stinks so bad. Smells like castor oil! Product came complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Extremely Potent
