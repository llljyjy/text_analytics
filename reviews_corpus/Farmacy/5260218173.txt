Farmacy kindly gifted me their new:1% VITAMIN A RETINOL SERUM in exchange for my honest review. I have extremely Sensitive Skin, so this was the perfect Retinol for me! I have held off from trying them for awhile, because I’ve had terrible reactions in the past.However, I just had another birthday pass, it’s become a night time routine to help Firm and Target fine lines and wrinkles. I’m so happy that I gave this one a try! -This new Serum contains two retinoids! - Fast Acting Retinal provided my skin with instant Wrinkle Targeting action. - Encapsulated Retinol gradually released overnight results. -Ceramide NP prevents any moisture loss and replenished my skin’s natural barrier. -Upcycled Kalahari melon and raspberry seed oils restored moisture and minimized my skin from being irritated like many other Retinol formulas that I’ve used in the past. -My Results: I applied this Serum right after cleansing my face. I started out slow, but ended up seeing best results with my skin type using it twice a week. As with using any Retinol, I used SPF daily to avoid any Sun damage or burning.-This Serum is Paraben Free, Formaldehyde Doner Free, Free from Synthetic Fragrances, Phthalate Free, Mineral Oil Free and Cruelty Free! Perfect For Sensitive Skin!
