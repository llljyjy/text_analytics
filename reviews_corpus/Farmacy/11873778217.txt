For those reviews stating it’s greasy/sticky—It’s a MASK. It’s not supposed to fully absorb lol. Night masks are intended to provide benefits throughout the night until the next morning when you wash your face. With that being said, the Niacinamide in this really helped with my skintone and appearance of my pores. I think if you’re gonna buy any night mask, this is the best one to go for. You don’t even have to use it every single night to see results. Align Your Expectations Accordingly
