I picked up this product after a Sephora specialist recommended it as a replacement for the Volition Strawberry C serum that Sephora no longer carries. I have been using this product every second day in my morning routine for about a month now. I use a few other Farmacy products, so I figured I’d give it a shot. It’s been a great new edition to my skincare routine and it seems to be doing wonders for my face - my skin looks brighter, more smooth, dark spots are fading, and hasn’t made me break out like other vitamin C products have in the past. The only thing I dislike about it is the strong smell it does carry for me - this could be because it’s a 10% formula that I’ve never had before, or (if any) fragrance doesn’t mix well with the product, but I get quite the bacon smell from it for about 10 minutes after applied. If you can get over that like I have though, this product has been awesome for my combination skin and is worth the try! A Great New Morning Addition
