I have super super super dry skin and had to return my laniege waterbank gel cream cause it broke me out more! But this people, is quite amazing creamy texture moisturizes my skin amazingly love love love this is my new moisturizer doesnâ€™t break me out either and nice for sensitive skin I was iffy but omg the best holy grail product you will ever try I love this so much the only downfall is the thickness on ur skin right when u put it on otherwise Heaven in a bottle! IN LOVE IN LOVE BEST MOISTURIZER!!!
