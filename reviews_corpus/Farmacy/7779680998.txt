I just finished using the full bottle and it lasted me several months! I bought it because I find it difficult to get Paula’s Choice toner here in Canada. Pro derms and influencers on social media are raving about it so I did some intensive research and I found this product. It does the job and its gentle on the skin. Repurchasing it! :) Comparable to Paula’s Choice BHA Toner
