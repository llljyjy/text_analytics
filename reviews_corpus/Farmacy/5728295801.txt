I love Farmacy as a brand. Their green clean balm and cleanser and staples in my skincare routine so was excited to see they came out with this new vitamin c serum which is received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I did previously use their very cherry bright serum and was not a fan at all but this serum is really different. The texture of this is very unique, almost like a serum mixed with a skin oil type of feel. Due to this, I think it would be best used at night than in the morning as I’m not sure how well it would later with sunscreen and makeup on top. The smell is very light but a typical vitamin see with l ascorbic acid smell. I think the price is also really good for a vitamin c product especially since it’s actually l ascorbic acid. It does sting a little but when I put it on over some active pimples so beware of that. Overall I’m liking the serum and feel like my skin is looking brighter with a more even texture when I wake up! I’ve tried a lot of vitamin c serums at Sephora and I think they one might be my favorite so far Interesting texture!
