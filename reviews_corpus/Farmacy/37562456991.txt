This product was ok at first but after a week of using it I started breaking out, at first I wasnâ€™t sure what product was causing the breakout but I had a feeling it was this toner so I decided to only use it in certain areas like my nose and part of my cheeks, and I was right my face started clearing up, but the areas I was using it in started breaking out more, I had a lot of little red bumps and it also made my face feel dirty. This was my first time using a Farmacy product and I really wanted to love it.:( Caused Breakout
