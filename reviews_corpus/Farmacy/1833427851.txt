This night mask is rated 100/100 from Yuka, meaning no unsafe chemicals such as endocrine disruptors.  Niacinamide pairs perfectly with a retinol skincare regime.  I use this at night after my retinol to help increase hydration and enhance the smoothing effect of retinol.  This also helps protect my skin barrier which is super important for anyone who uses AHA/BHA or retinol. nan
