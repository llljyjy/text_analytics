I like this cleansing balm specifically because it doesn’t feel like you just smeared bacon grease all over your face and cant get it off. Other cleansing balms tend to leave a pesky film over my skin even after washing it off with cleanser. I tried this one and have been hooped ever since. It gets make up off so well and it washes away no problem. yes ma’am!
