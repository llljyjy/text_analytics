I rarely write reviews, only when the product is either extremely good or an utter disappointment. This case is the latter. I had high hopes for this moisturizer. It is supposed to be moisturizing but not greasy, good for sensetive skin, and itâ€™s not that cheap. Instead, it does nothing for my skin. It is not moisturizing, has a very strong smell, and IT PEELS OFF. I of course not but it again. Disappointing
