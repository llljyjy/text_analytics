I bought it to help lessen the steps in my makeup removal routine, but i find i still have to go in with a ton of my cleanser after using the balm anyways. I double cleanse but the balm leaves a bit of a greasy, uncleaned feeling for my liking. so i just wont be finishing this bottle. Might just not be suitable for my oily prone skin. melts away some makeup
