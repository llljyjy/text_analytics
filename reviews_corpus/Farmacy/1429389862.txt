This is one of the best Vitamin C that I’ve tried so far. Goes on smooth and little goes a long way. I didn’t have any sensitivities with this one. The only thing that I don’t like is the smell. It kinda smell like a burnt wood. Other than that great product!Gifted by Farmacy Beauty - my opinion is honest great product with not the best smell
