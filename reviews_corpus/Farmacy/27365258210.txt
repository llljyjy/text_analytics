Got this in a holiday set that came with a bunch of farmacy minis, and found this product did basically nothing. It didn’t hydrate my skin, if anything it did the complete opposite and was a little drying. I have combo skin and used the product both during a period of time when my skin was oily and during a period of time when my skin was dry, and found that it did nothing for me both times. It could possibly have to do with the process of applying and taking off the mask, as I found it to be pretty difficult to take off. My skin always felt very tight after using the mask, and I found absolutely no glow to it. It did nothing for moisture loss either, as when my moisture barrier had issues, it made my skin feel the exact same. I will say that I didn’t find it created any issues with acne, as I never really developed any acne because of this mask, but never the less, I don’t think it’s a good mask either. There are better masks and moisturizers out there that can do absolutely better, for an even better price. Doesn’t do anything :(
