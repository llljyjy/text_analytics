Loving this retinol serum! I’m fairly new to adding this ingredient to my skincare routine and felt this is a great option to start off with. It absorbs very quickly which. I love because it doesn’t make me feel like im piling up products or end up with a sticky face.  It feels gentle and leaves a smooth hydrated feeling before adding my moisturizer . I love this brand and also amazing that they’re cruelty free ! I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but opinions are based on my honest experience. Loving it with my skin routine
