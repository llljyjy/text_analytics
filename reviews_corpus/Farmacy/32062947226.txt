what a great release from Farmacy! I was so excited to finally get my hands on this waterless vitamin C and I was not disappointed. I have been using this serum for a few days and I’m so pleased with how bright my skin has been looking. My acne spots are still there but they’re definitely turning pink and actually fading. I’m so excited to keep on using this serum. Gifted by Farmacy. Really promising results!
