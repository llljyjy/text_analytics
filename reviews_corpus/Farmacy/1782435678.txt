Literal miracle product. I have rosacea and read that niacinamide can help calm redness. I’ve tried The Ordinary niacinamide serum, but I think the addition of zinc doesn’t work for my skin. This mask is just niacinamide though. On FIRST USE, it calmed my redness immediately. Still have a few bumps from the rosacea, of course. But the redness is gone!! The texture is a bit greasy, but I don’t mind that because my skin is so dry. No scent which is also a plus. Don’t think, just buy. Miracle product for rosacea!
