I was able to try Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream and I’m highly satisfied with this formula. The packaging is super cute and eye catching. I have seen my dark circles get better after using day and night. It’s super hydrating and looking forward to seeing my fine lines diminish while helping with morning undereye puffiness. I love how it helps prep skin for my makeup application. I would highly recommend this product to everyone! I was gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion. Gives results
