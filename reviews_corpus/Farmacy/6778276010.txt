Before this had any reviews I snagged it because it sounded like it was a dream for my skin.  I was not disappointed.  Niacinamide isn’t what I usually go for but they really sold me with the description.  I’ve had coworkers asking what my skincare routine is, my mom looked at me in the morning and told me my skin was glowing.  The texture is to die for, it feels like a jelly cloud soaked in hydration.  No scent which I appreciate, and it is so rich you can just feel it sinking into your skin in the most luxurious way.  I have never left a review before but I’m so obsessed with it that I just had to leave a review.  If this was a $100 product I would still buy it without hesitation I swear by this night mask
