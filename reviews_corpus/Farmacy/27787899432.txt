I have heavy dark circles and puffy under-eye so I was very excited to try this eye cream. I am a very big fan of farmacy products so I knew this product would not fail me. The texture of the cream is quite thick but it does a great job in de-puffing and hydrating my under-eye. I haven’t been using this product for long so I do not see much difference regarding my dark circles but I’m sure it will work since the cream has vitamin C in it. This eye cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
