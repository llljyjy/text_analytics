i have sensitive/combo/acne prone skin with some occasional eczema flare ups. My friends and I joke that every possible skin problem someone could have, I’ve got. For the past year I have gone through many products at sephora trying to find some impossible product that works for all of my skin issues. I have tried laneige water bank cream (which worked for the summer months only, then it wasn’t hydrating enough), skin fix barrier repair lotion (the middle one between cream/gel bc I thought the cream would be too thick/gel too thin and while i loved the consistency, the lotion wasn’t hydrating enough), the youth to the people superfood moisturizer that so many people claimed was their holy grail but i had to use so much product to feel sufficiently hydrated and even then found it drying (and don’t even get me started on their face wash, it cleared my acne but made my eczema flare up so badly because it was so drying), i also tried cerave pm, cerave salicylic acid, cerave hydrating moisturizer (dark blue pump, and their cream in the container, la roche posay toleraine riche moisturizer, their effeclair duo for acne, as well as their cicaplast baume, the purple tatcha, etc etc so as you can see i’ve done my time. This is the FIRST moisturizer that hasn’t made me flare up with acne or eczema, isn’t too hydrating to make my face oily but isn’t too dry that it makes me crave more lotion. This also doesn’t make my skin burn like many other face products do. If anyone has made it through reading this whole review, thank you and please give this one a try if you have problematic skin because it’s truly the one product i’ll have to keep repurchasing even though it’s more expensive. My only recommendations for you are: laneige in the summer if your face gets greasy like mine, this one in the fall/winter/springish and if you need extra hydration then laneige makes a really great waterbank overnight mask to go overtop of your moisturizer. Truly saved my skin. my holy grail
