The worst cleansing balm/oil I have ever used. IT DOES NOT RINSE OFF! It leaves a thick oily residue on your skin. Also, that residue is extremely hard to remove, I couldnâ€™t get all of it off using my micellar water. Right after cleansing, I noticed there were small bumps all over my face, which I have never gotten before.How are people giving this good reviews?? STAY AWAY
