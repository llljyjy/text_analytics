Gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for My honest review. The Farmacy Beauty Wake Up Honey Eye Cream with Brightening Vitamin C Eye Cream is a light-weight, brightening eye cream, that I would recommend for normal, dry, combination and oily skin types. The silky eye cream wears great under makeup and pairs well with other skincare products. The Eye Cream reduces the appearance of dark circles, visibly depuffs puffy eyes, providing lasting hydration and smoothes the look of fine lines and wrinkles with vitamin C and hydrating honey. I really enjoy this silky smooth, vitamin c, Wake Up Honey Eye Cream. The cream brightens My under eyes, I love the silky smooth texture, it’s aesthetically pleasing and I can’t wait to see more benefits over time. Silky Smooth Eye Cream
