Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Vitamin c is my holy grail. It’s changed my skincare game. I’m loving this vitamin c serum. It goes perfectly under makeup. No piling. I love the texture of it. It’s different. There is a slight warmth while applying the product. Not too bad. But I love how my skin feels after application. I absolutely love Farmacy products and use them everyday!! nan
