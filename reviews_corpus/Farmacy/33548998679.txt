The DEEP SWEEP toner Exfoliates + deep cleans pores with a 2% BHA (salicylic acid) + papaya enzymes. The papaya enzymes gently exfoliate and deep clean to minimize the look of pores, revealing a healthy-looking complexion.I love this toner and think of it as a great gentle exfoliant. I personally use it as an exfoliant in my routine. It’s reminiscent of Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (which I also love), but the FARMACY’s toner adds the Papaya Enzyme along with an amazingly refreshing scent.   Please note that though this product has a fresh scent to it, there is no synthetic fragrance added. Think Paula’s Choice with Added Papaya and Scent
