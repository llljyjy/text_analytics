Great daily moisturizer. Not sticky or oily, very smooth application, pleasant and fresh smell. I have a hard time with finding a moisturizer that doesnâ€™t break me out and this one does the trick. The only thing I wish were different is the packaging - the jar is a bit awkward because it has a lip so I have to fiddle around with it when I get to the end of the jar but not going to knock off a point for that.
