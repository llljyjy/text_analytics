I was really excited to try this product, it seems to have a cult following. I received this as a sample and was underwhelmed. I’ve used many cleansing balms and this really was lackluster in my opinion. I personally prefer Tatcha’s product, it’s not a balm like this more of an oil cleanser but works really well. I would not purchase this. Subpar cleansing balm
