I have an unhealthy obsession with the honey grail face oil by farmacy so I thought I’d give this a go for a cleanser. I don’t wear much face makeup so I thought this would be great for me as it’s a gentle cleanser and I don’t need much makeup removing power. BUT wow this is really effective. It takes mascara and eye liner off so easily and quickly with just one pump and minimal lather. I had previously tried the whipped green cleanser by this brand and found I had to double cleanse to get my eye makeup completely gone, but this takes my eyeliner and mascara off muuuuch easier. It’s very very gentle though and has such a lovely scent, almost green tea with honey (similar to the oil). My skin feels very clean and I think it settles any irritation or acne I have. nan
