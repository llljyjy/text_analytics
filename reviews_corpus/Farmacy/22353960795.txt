This vitamin c serum has beautiful packaging and I love how lightweight this is on the skin. I think it’s great for all skin types. I have combination skin that is sometimes sensitive to products and this did not irritate my skin. It absorbed into the skin quickly and doesn’t feel tacky at all on the face. nan
