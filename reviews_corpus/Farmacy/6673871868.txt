Absolutely love this serum - I, for one, don’t mind the scent at all. It goes on so nicely and gives a really dewy glow. I typically find most Vit C serums to be a bit too harsh, but have had no negative reactions to this. I have noticed a marked difference in some hyperpigmentation around my mouth and on my cheeks. Pairs really well under my moisturizer, sunscreen, & make-up. The pump is definitely airless and even after a few weeks, I have not noticed any discoloration of the product noting that it’s going bad. I highly recommend this and would repurchase again in the future! New Holy Grail Vit C!
