I dunno where this stuff has been all my life and why I haven’t come to use this sooner but it is the BEST moisturizer I’ve yet to use. I do have dry dry dryyy skin. There are many moisturizers that are great and all while they are on the face but don’t give lasting effects. This is not one of those. Even after washing you’ll notice your face smooth and supple! After my first use I woke  up and noticed my reflection in my microwave door and had to run to look in the mirror and I kid you not, I looked like a glazed donut!! The Sephora rep mentioned for an extra dose to top this moisturizer with an oil in the PM. And I’ve been doing that! One day in and It looks like I just got a facial! Just wish they’d come out with an accompanying eye cream! Until then, I’ll just rub this around my eyes. MAGIC!
