Skin history: minimal breakouts, oily T-zone, dry outer areas, widespread texture, uneven toneI have been using this in conjunction with the Laneige Cream Skin Toner/Moisturizer, and I must say I think I have finally found my holy grail skin care combo. I live in Canada - the harsh cold and dry climate, as well as constant masking had my skin feeling stripped and ‘bleh’. It’s been about 3 weeks that I have integrated this combo into my skincare routine, and I don’t think I will be reaching for a different moisturizer anytime soon! My complexion is brighter and more fresh looking, consistently. Much love! nan
