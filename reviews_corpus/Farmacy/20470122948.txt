This product made my skin feel moisturizer although I cannot say long term if it made any antiaging results. I want to continue to use it for about two months and see if there’s any lasting affects. I can eat I have acne prone skin and it didn’t break me out! This was gifted by far Macy beauty. Light and moisturizing!
