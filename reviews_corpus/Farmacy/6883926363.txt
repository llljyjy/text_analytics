Perfect kit for an intro to Farmacy brand. I personally think it’s worth the money. Just started using the serum so we’ll see how it goes but so far so good!Cleansing balm - LOVED IT! Used it as a pre-cleanse and it really removed all of my makeup (even eye makeup). Didn’t smell too strong and didn’t sting my eyes either. Definitely buying the full size product.Toner - LOVED the toner too! I have combo skin and didn’t think it was too drying. Definitely cleared up some of my pores and helped with my skin texture. Not sure on the oil control though.Moisturizer - SHE THICK!! Mainly use it at night and let me tell you a little goes a long way with this one. Definitely a thicker moisturizer - I think drier skins will love it. But when I wake up the next day, my skin is baby smooth with such a beautiful glow to it! Honey smell is not too strong and surprisingly very pleasant. I have combo-oily skin so I’d mainly use it at night during colder month. Perfect introductory kit!
