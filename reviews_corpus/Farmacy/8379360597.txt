Farmacy never lets me down on their products. I love using sleeping masks and this is AMAZING. I usually repurchase the sleeping mask from Laneige but I think I love this one more than that one. After the first night my redness GONE my face was glowingggg!!! I would say after 3 uses I noticed a difference in certain areas of my face; especially my pigmentation diminished. I used this mask as a replacement of my moisturizer and my last step in my routine. I would definitely recommend to anyone suffering irritation, redness, pigmentation etc. well done Farmacy!!!! My new favourite product!!!
