Love that this is easy to add into your skincare doubting, doesn’t have a scent, absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave my face feeling sticky I’m starting by using it once a week and now I’m going to bump it to 2 times a week The directions say to start with one to two times a week at first and since I didn’t use any retinol before this I wanted to start off slowly but I’m super excited to see my long term results from this product If it will let me update this review in a month or so I can add an update of my final thoughts on this product but so far so good Excited to see if this helps out with my deeper wrinkles on my forehead and just overall making my skin look firmer.  This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and excited to see if this product works for me with more use than just the few times I have applied it on so far (since I have only had this for a couple weeks)First photo is my before and the second is after a couple uses but hard to see with my sunburn & tan I got this weekend Excited to see results from further use
