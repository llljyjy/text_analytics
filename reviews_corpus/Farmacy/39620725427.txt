I absolutely love this! I was originally just going to get this on a whim because it looked so cute and fun to use, but I’ve found it helps with my redness and calming my skin after a long day. It has a sticky texture so if you’re a sensory person I’d be weary, but overall it’s helped so much with calming that redness and evening my skin tone! So cute!!!
