i’ve re-purchased this product twice and i love the moisture it provides my combo skin. the more normal-dry parts of my face (cheeks) get the moisture they need while my oily t-zone is able to retain the moisture better. the smell is pleasant and reminds me of cocoa butter which is a personal favorite of mine. 10/10 product that’s worth the splurge for the winter months. Great Moisturizer for Combo skin during the winter
