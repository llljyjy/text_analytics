I am slowly making the shift to green beauty products and I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. Often times, facial washes make my skin dry and tight, but this one leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and ready for a layer of moisturizer. I am on my 3rd bottle now since 2019 and I maybe buy this product twice a year - a little goes a long way! I use less than half a pump. When I first started using this product, I had to adjust to it. Something about it would make my eyes very sensitive, and sting slightly - an interesting effervescence, not unlike what a minty cleanser might do... except this isn’t minty. Hard to explain. I have since adjusted to that, and otherwise have had no sensitivities to this product. The smell is mild and earthy with notes of honey. It’s become a staple in my beauty routine and I love it! 3 years, and I still love this face wash!
