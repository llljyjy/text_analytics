My new nighttime skincare routine obsession!! It’s my new favorite overnight treatment. Even after the first use, I noticed a difference in the appearance of my pores and my skin was incredibly soft. It’s hydrating and just feels nice on. A little goes a long way! No need to cake it on. I would recommend sleeping with your hair tied back to avoid it sticking to the product. This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty, but I would repurchase in a heartbeat. A nighttime must have!!
