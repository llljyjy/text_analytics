Not sure I like the consistency, it feels oily when you put it on and takes long to absorb into the skin. I was worried about the oilyness clogging pores and causing breakouts but it actually didn’t. If you have super oily skin I wouldn’t recommend but overall it works well and is good for sensitive skin. oily but good
