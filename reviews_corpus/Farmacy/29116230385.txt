Loving this cream. I havenâ€™t used retinol and was really scared to damage my skin, but this cream is very gentle on my skin and did not irritate it. Love the texture and the lightness of the cream. I only use it a few times a week and that seems to be enough, just do not forget sunscreen. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty Must have
