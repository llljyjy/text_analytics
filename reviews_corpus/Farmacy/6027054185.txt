I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Let’s start with my favorite things about this product: it didn’t give me milia, it feels hydrating, I feel like it’s brightening my under eyes, and I love the clean ingredients. I think it makes a great day time eye cream and would recommend it on one condition; if you don’t mind the packaging where you have to dip your finger into a jar. Personally I prefer an eye cream with a pump because I think this packaging can get messy, and I tend to get more product than I need. Great product, packaging could be better
