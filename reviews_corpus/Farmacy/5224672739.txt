I have eczema on my eyelids and I’m my under eye. This healed them! Very quickly. I have been consistently using this and the dryness isn’t coming back! This does not have a nice wood cap. It is bronzey plastic. I don’t love this as much for lips or hands as it’s a bit greasy but it actually wears well under makeup! I use this for my eye area during the day just in a smaller amount and it isn’t weird with makeup. I have BERY dry skin and use no powders. Eye savior
