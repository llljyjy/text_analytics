(Received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty to review.  All opinions my own.) I have combo skin that needs a lot of hydration in the winter and have a fair amount of hyperpigmentation/PIH.  I have been using this for two weeks and have really been enjoying it.  It has a thick, rich texture that soaks in easily and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin while being really moisturizing. I like that it feels soothing, and it has made my skin feel really soft in the mornings. You don’t need that much, so I can see it lasting a while. The light blue color is really pretty and I love the tiny spatula that comes with it. I am suffering from a pretty bad break out recently, so it’s hard to tell if it’s been helping with my pigmentation, but it definitely has made my skin feel calmer & softer every night when I apply it. As far as sleep masks go it’s very hydrating & has a thicker gel formula that I really enjoy. Sometimes I like to pair this with Honey Halo, which is an even richer cream, after it soaks in but most nights I’m OK just using this alone.  Overall, I definitely see myself continuing to use this and waiting to see how it affects my pigmentation long-term.  The way it makes my skin barrier feel healthier is reason enough for me to use :) Super Supple Skin Barrier!
