I received this as a sample with another purchase, and while I do think it does a great job (I use waterproof mascara that is notoriously difficult to fully remove-and this got it all!) it left an oily film over my eyes no matter how much I rinsed them with water and eye drops. For the price point I don’t think I’d purchase due to that, but it definitely removes makeup very well. Film Over Eyes
