I’m a total convert from makeup removing wipes now. Breaks down even the waterproof stuff and a little bit goes a long way. Rinse with warm water and feels completely clean. I still follow with my face wash and the rest of my skincare, but this doesn’t feel sticky at all. Hands down the best makeup remover.
