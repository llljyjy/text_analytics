Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! My skin type is combo with a super oily T-zone, but my face tends to get very dry and dehydrated in the wintertime. This moisturizer is one of the best ways I keep my skin hydrated in a cold winter climate! At first it feels like it would be too heavy and thick for my skin, but after application it goes on as smooth as butter (but in a pleasant way!) and melts right into my skin. Could not recommend this more! nan
