Farmacy Beauty gifted me their newest launch & I just new it would be good & I wasn’t wrong!  It’s smooth & firming on my skin.. you can detect a slight raspberry scent & while I wasn’t irritated by this product I could kind of feel the effective retinal, if that makes sense... knowing what its supposed to be doing when it has a little strength to it.  Looking forward to seeing longer term results! Yay retinal!
