I’ve used this product for a few months and I find that is just okay. I bought this because I was looking for a moisturizer that would hydrate my dry skin. This product feels like it just sits on top of my skin. It doesn’t feel like it seals in moisture as sometimes my skin would still feel dry after applying. Although this product was just okay on my skin I do love the packaging and the magnetic spoon this comes with. This spoon is perfect for preventing bacteria on your fingers from entering the jar since you can use the spoon for more product instead of your fingers. Just ok
