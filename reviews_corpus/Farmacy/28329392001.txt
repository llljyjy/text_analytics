** DISCLAIMER: I have a *VERY* sensible skin !! **It is a very loved products in the Sephora community, and I understand why. It really does melt the makeup [in a very satisfying way]. Tho, it leave my skin a bit irritated & red near the eyes, nose and mouth area. After doing a normal cleanse following the makeup removal, I do feel my skin drier than it would be using other brand/method of makeup removal.I did buy that product on sale, following a makeup guru recommendation.  I respect people who love this makeup remover, but I do not plan on buying this ever product again :) There s cheaper and more natural alternatives that does the job equally [if not better] for my personal usage.My pros; I found the colour of the balm very gorgeous!Good shopping all ! Does what it says, but not suited for my skin.
