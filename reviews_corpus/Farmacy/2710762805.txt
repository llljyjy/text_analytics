at first i like this and then it starts to feel greasy as i massage it in? sometimes it will make me break out in a sweat after applying for some reason. it does hydrate my face fine as well but i’m not sure if the mediocre hydration is worth enduring the weird texture and that sweating reaction. i would still recommend it as a winter moisturizer for dry skin. it’s too much in the summer for me not sure if i like it or not?
