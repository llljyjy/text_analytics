I bought this because I have been wanting to double cleanse at night to help with break outs. I have never tried the original scented one or any other cleansing balm. I personally love this product. I use it every night to remove makeup or to just make my skin feel really clean. I read other reviews about it being hard to remove and did not really find that a problem. I use a small amount of the balm and then the youth to the people kale cleanser and have had no issues! I also think double cleansing with this product has really helped my random small breakouts. I cannot use products with fragrance so this balm is perfect for me. I also have sensitive skin and this hasnâ€™t irritated me at all. nan
