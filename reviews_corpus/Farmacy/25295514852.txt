I don’t understand why brands have to make their skincare products smell THIS strong.  The smell of this is just so overpowering and it really ruins the experience for me.  It’s like rubbing lemon Pledge on your face!  It’s a shame too because I actually loved the texture and finish.  But the citrus fragrance overload makes it too unpleasant to use in my opinion, and it would be extremely irritating for anyone who is sensitive to fragrance or to citrus specifically (which is not that uncommon!)
