I love this stuff. It smells great and removes my makeup up beautifully. I will note that right now I just use primer, foundation, concealer, setting powder, and sometimes lipstick/gloss. So my makeup is very basic. I’m not sure how it might preform if you use more product. Also, I love how my skin feels after I use it. My skin doesn’t feel stripped when I wash after and that stripped feeling a lot of stuff gives me actually seems to make my skin oilier so I’m pretty happy with this. Smells Great, Removes Well
