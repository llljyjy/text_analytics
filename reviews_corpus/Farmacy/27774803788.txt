This Farmacy wake up honey eye cream is very hydrating and relaxing for my eyes. It has vitamin C that helps brightens the under eye. It feels soft and easy to apply. This is the best I have used so far and I really like it. It doesnâ€™t have any smell too. I received this as a complimentary from farmacy for my honest opinion. Love this Farmacy wakeup honey eye cream
