I really love this moisturizer. I have oily/ normal skin and while this seems thick in the pot it spreads so evenly and softly on the skin, soaks up fast and leaves my skin feeling incredible. Using this moisturizer after a face mask feels sooooo nice. It has a light smell of honey but not in the sweet way but the smell of beeswax candles! Only 4 stars purely because of the cost but will definitely repurchase nan
