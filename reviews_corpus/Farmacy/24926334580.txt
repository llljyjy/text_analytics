I tried this for the first time and was shocked at how well it removed my makeup. My friend told me that “I’d never looked so clean.” Kinda insulting but raccoon eyes used to be a constant in my life. I used to use the clinique one which worked, but it was hard to fully wash off. This is the best cleansing balm I’ve tried. Honestly, it’s magical. Magical Makeup Remover!!!
