I love the light creamy texture of this under eye cream! It also shot a very easy so it locks in moisture and doesn’t cause any issue for makeup application! It’s not oily at all which I love. I haven’t seen a huge difference in under eye circles but mine are hereditary and I wasn’t expecting a miracle. But the vitamin c didn’t cause any irritation and it’s nice and hydrating! I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. Great night and day eye cream!
