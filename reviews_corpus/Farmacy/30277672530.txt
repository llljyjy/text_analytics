I received this vitamin c complimentary from Farmacy for my honest review. While I really wanted to love this vitamin C m, immediately upon applying it to my face I had 2 issues with it. First, the smell. It smelled like bacon. Unfortunately I’m sensitive to smells and this one was a no for me. Granted, I know someone else who tried it and didn’t notice that smell so maybe it was just mine. Second, the feel of it was oily despite being oil free. I don’t like oily feeling face, however, once applied and the rest of your skincare is on, it does not feel oily. nan
