I cannot imagine anyone writing a bad review for this product. It’s the first and only product I’ve used until the end of the container and am now ordering more. It’s fresh and clean. My skin feels amazing after washing. I have tried every single thing on the planet as I have a unique combo of oily skin with rosacea and it’s felt almost impossible to find anything gentle that doesn’t either make my skin break out from not actually cleansing deeply enough or flare up because it’s cleansing too deeply. This is the perfect in between for me. My Fave
