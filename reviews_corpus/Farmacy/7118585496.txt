this balm is my holy grail i think! i bought one a few years ago after finding that most drugstore balms were just irritating my lips more. the farmacy balm SAVED my gross and seriously chapped lips. it lasted me 6 months with daily use (i finished the tube!) and then went try similar balms which were alright but not nearly as moisturizing and lightweight as farmacy’s. i only apply 2-3 times a day and on days i don’t apply this balm my lips feel tight. the price doesn’t bug me because this balm does everything my lips need ! halfway thru my 2nd!
