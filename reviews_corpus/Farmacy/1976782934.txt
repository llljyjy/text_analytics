overall nice vitamin C serum! super interesting texture - it feels more oil based when applied but doesn’t leave the skin feeling greasy. i follow up with an HA and moisturizer and it’s all been absorbed, but I do question if the texture prevents other ingredients from penetrating. i like the product and was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but would probably lean more towards a different consistency / gel or serum interesting texture - good serum
