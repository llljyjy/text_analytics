This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty at the prefect time for me because I have been struggling with hyperpigmentation in my skin and was looking for a niacinamide product to help fade it. This sleeping mask is quite potent but lightweight, and it was enjoyable to use. I have noticed slight brightening of my hyperpigmentation, so I will continue to use this product! Hydrating, helps brighten hyperpigmentation
