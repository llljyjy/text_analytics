Farmacy’s new night mask has been my favorite step of my nighttime routine. Swipe for dreamy texture. Recently, my skin has been loving niacinamide. This sinks in so nicely at night and doesn’t pill. I wake up with hydrated smooth skin the next morning. I’ll continue to use this and share more thoughts soon. I recommend this for my oily skin gals!*Gifted by Farmacy Beauty For my oily skin gals
