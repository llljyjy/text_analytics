This cream gifted to me by Farmacy is great for texture, specially if you want your skin to feel instantly smooth. I personally feel immediate improvement on my skin once I apply it. It feels very lush. The texture is gel-like and doesnâ€™t feel greasy or heavy but still feels hydrating. It has no scent to it either which is always a plus. My skin absorbs this cream so nicely over night and looks smoother and more plump in the morning. I absolutely love it. Perfect for texture
