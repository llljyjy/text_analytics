The product itself is magical. I love it. It feels luxurious, it’s a clean formula so it doesn’t upset my sensitive skin, and it works very well as a makeup remover. However, after two purchases I have decided to stop purchasing because my container is growing mold inside of it?? Dipping in the pot with the applicator introduces some unwanted stuff in there I guess. I’m not sure how this could be fixed but I do really love this stuff. mold..
