Iâ€™ve been using this moisturizer for over a year now, and I can safely say this is one of my favorite moisturizer. The consistency is amazing. It absorbs very quickly on your skin and it makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated. This is my go-to moisturizer for the cold winter months in Canada. I would highly recommend for anyone with dry,  sensitive skin. The price is a little high but you get what you pay for. I give this review a 5 star. Love Love LOVE!!
