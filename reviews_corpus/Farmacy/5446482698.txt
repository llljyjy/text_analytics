This is the best make up remover Iâ€™ve tried so far. First of all, it gets rid of make up effectively, including mascara without having to tug your eyelashes. Secondly, it feels so good on the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized after use. So many make up removers are irritating or leave you feeling dry or irritated. This is the best. Definitely would repurchase. The best make up remover
