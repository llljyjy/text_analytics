I am a fan of Farmacy Beauty’s products. The Wake Up Honey Eye Cream is great to hydrate my eye area especially int he winter when my skin gets more dry. The texture is great. I use it in the morning. It’s a good base for makeup so it looks more radiant. I can’t say that I’ve seen a drastic reduction of puffiness. I received this product complimentary from the brand. nan
