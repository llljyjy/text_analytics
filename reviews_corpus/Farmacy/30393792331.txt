This Wake Up Honey Eye Cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. It comes in a very nice container and I liked its texture as well - it’s rich and smooth, perfect for my dry under eye area and is suitable for this cold weather. I was expecting for it to smell like honey but it doesn’t have any noticeable scent in my opinion. Nice Eye Cream
