this toner has done wonders for my pores! after using this for a few weeks, my pores are visibly clearer and smaller and my skin is smoother than before. this was my first bha toner, so i was worried about my skin drying out or potential burning sensations, but i didn’t experience any of that. (to be fair tho, my skin isn’t very sensitive.) i have combo/oily skin and i definitely feel like it helps control the oil - i currently only use it at night but may switch to twice a day as we get into the humid summer months. love this and def will repurchase. nan
