This vitamin c is so nice! I’m always hesitant to use vitamin c because it tends to irritate me due to my sensitive skin, but this is super gentle. I also love that it’s vegan with clean ingredients! I need to use it a bit longer but I feel like the texture of my skin feels amazing so far!  This was gifted by Farmacy beauty for a review but all views are my own. Great for sensitive skin
