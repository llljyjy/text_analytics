I have been searching for a facial cleanser that can be massaged onto a dry face and just wiped off with a warm washcloth (like Ponds only better, and it should be because you can buy 3 jars of Ponds and still have money left over for the price of this) I never imagined myself paying this much for a cleanser but after receiving a sample with another Sephora purchase, I was so totally in love I had to have it. It comes with a spatula tucked into an inside lid under the actual lid so you donâ€™t have to put your fingers into the pot. It is not a cream, but a soft solid that becomes a balm and melts into your hands as you prepare to put it on your face. I massage it in all over my face first then close my eyes to take my eye make up off, exactly the instructions on the jar. Voila! This does not leave your face oily or greasy. It has a mild clean fresh smell, almost fruity. Worth the splurge. So in love with this product!
