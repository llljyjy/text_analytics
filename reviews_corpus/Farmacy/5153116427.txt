This stuff is incredible.  I use this as step 1 in a double cleanse.  This is so buttery soft, I actually look forward to using this each night.  It just melts right into your skin.  The balm I was using prior did not get as soft and smooth as this one, and this removes all foundation and eye makeup perfectly. So so good
