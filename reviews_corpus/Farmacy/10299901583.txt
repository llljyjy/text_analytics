Absolutely loving this 1% vitamin A retinol gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I initially was layering it with moisturizer as I thought the 1% would be a little too harsh on the skin but I recently used it without the moisturizer and it just feels great. I love the fact that it’s gentle and comes more of a serum/lotion form instead of a thick cream. So far it’s working great! nan
