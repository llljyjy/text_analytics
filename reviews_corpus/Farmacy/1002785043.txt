I got this as a sample months and months ago from Sephora and it forever sat on my bathroom counter without a second glance. But when my normal face wash ran out one night, I finally decided to try this sample and OMG! The balm itself has a light, fruity fragrance but nothing overpowering. You warm it in your hands and gently massage your make up away. It comes with this cute little spatula so you don’t stick your fingers in the actual product and contaminate it. The balm has this soft, velvety texture to it and truly washes away all of my stubborn eye make up after a long day working in healthcare! It’s incredible! It’s also made of clean ingredients and the container is environmentally safe, made of recycled materials. I kick myself for not using the sample sooner bc the second I did, I bought the full-sized item 10 mins later. I have combination skin and it made my skin feel so smooth, calm and squeaky clean while moisturized. I use the double cleanse method with this being the first cleanse product but I’m absolutely OBSESSED with this stuff! Love love love! I only wish I could give this product 10 stars! Truly amazing. Ten Star Cleanser!
