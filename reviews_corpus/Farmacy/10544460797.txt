got this in exchange for BI points. i have normal to dry skin so, i usually use the tatcha dewy skin cream at night since it’s very hydrating and helps with water loss. when i tried this product, it instantly started to pill on my face i also noticed that it’s way too thick for normal to dry skin types and that it would just sit on my face instead of absorbing into my skin. it may work if your on the oilier side. sorry but this is a PASS for me. tatcha dewy skin cream > this product
