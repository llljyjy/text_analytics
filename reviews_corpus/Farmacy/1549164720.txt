Worked amazingly (requires decent amount of “sink in” time if applying AM before makeup). I have combo skin and this was hydrating and nourishing. It also soothed my sensitized skin after excessive acid and retinol use. HOWEVER - the smell was so gross. Like spoiled honey and urine. Maybe the sample I got was rancid? Fix the smell and it’s a 5/5 for me. Rank Smell but Good Juice
