I really like this cleansing balm. I don’t wear heavy makeup but I do wear lots of sunscreen and some makeup on top. This makes my skin feel really smooth and cleans and I don’t even have to use a cloth to wipe it off, rinsing with water is enough. It doesn’t leave an oily and shiny film like other balms. I follow this up with the La Roche Posay hydrating cleanser after and my skin feels amazing. Leaves my skin super soft. I definitely recommend this balm. Love it.
