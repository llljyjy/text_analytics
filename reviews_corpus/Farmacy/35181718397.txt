I bought this after seeing it on tiktok and thought I wouldn’t love it. I’ve always used makeup wipes... but holy moly is it good. it takes off all my makeup with ease and doesn’t burn my eyes. I do use a makeup eraser with some water to swipe off the last of my mascara under my eyes, but you could easily just use a washcloth. I will definitely buy this again and again. it's so good
