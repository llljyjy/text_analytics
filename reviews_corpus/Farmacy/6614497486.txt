You don’t understand how much I love this stuff. It’s so hydrating and feels so luxurious on my skin. A little goes a long way. I’ve tried other moisturizers from Glow Recipe and First Aid Beauty and this one is my favorite by far. Might be a little overly moisturizing for oily skin especially during summer, but it works really well for my skin. The smell is also lovely and not bothersome. holy grail moisturizer
