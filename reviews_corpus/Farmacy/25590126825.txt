The smell is amazing. The texture is great. You only need a little to use and it foams up really well. The only thing is that it made me break out. I have acne-prone and sensitive skin, so I thought it was just me. But then my husband also tried it and his skin is usually flawless and it made him breakout also. Sorry to say, I will not use again. nan
