I really enjoyed Farmacy’s Wake Up Honey eye cream! I don’t use eye creams often (I know!), because they tend to actually irritate my eyes. I enjoyed the texture of this because it wasn’t super thick, so I could enjoy it using it during the day for winter. It has a nice fresh scent, and I did feel like it helped brighten my eye area a bit. The package is also super cute; a honey comb applicator would have been extra cute in addition! This product was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. nan
