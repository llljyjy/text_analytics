I already use their 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum and I love it. Same goes with this product !! I have some acne scars and this has help lighten marks. The vitamin A is a lot of help when it comes to moisturizing the skin I think it’s great that they added this. Usually I can’t put retinol back to back, but with this one I can put a light layer every night and my skin is fine. Perfect for those introducing retinol to their skin. Love how supple and hydrated my skin looks the next morning. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty It’s a hydrating retinol love
