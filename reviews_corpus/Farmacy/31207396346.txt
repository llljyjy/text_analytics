I received the Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream complimentary from Farmacy to exchange my honest review.The eye cream has a silky yogurt like texture, it’s yellow and has no strong scent.The eye cream spreads around the eyes nicely, but takes a little while to absorb.It instantly brightens the dark circle gently. I don’t see any help on reducing wrinkles and fine lines and puffiness, but it does hydrate the skin.It’s very gentle, no irritation to eyes at all. nan
