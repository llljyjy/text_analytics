I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, and wow! What a surprising formula. I have tried vitamin C serums in the past that are almost water-like. This one is feels like a hybrid between a serum and an oil. It is thick, but quickly sinks into the skin. I have just started using it, and cannot wait to see what results it gives!
