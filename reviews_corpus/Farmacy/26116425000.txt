I REALLY didn’t want to like this because the price point is quite high BUT I was shocked at how great it is. My skin was reacting poorly to something & had red little bumps forming. This helped it out in one use. I use it at night because I needed a heavier night moisturizer and it feels SO good. It’s calming, the scent is not heavy at all, and it layers well with other skin care. I havent used it under makeup so I can’t speak on that. But unfortunately I WILL be purchasing again…. rip my bank account. regret trying it because of how good it is
