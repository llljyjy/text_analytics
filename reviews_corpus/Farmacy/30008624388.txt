I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty to test out and review. Ive been using it for about a week or so now and so far I’m really liking this product! It’s a very serumy, lightweight product. It feels very hydrating on the skin as well. I am pretty new to using retinol and have been pleasantly surprised so far that this one has not irritated or bothered my skin at all. In fact, my skin has been looking extra glowy since using this. I’m definitely planning to keep this in my routine and hopefully start to see some reductions in my skin texture and fine lines. A very gentle and hydrating retinol!
