I have loved the other Farmacy Cleansing Balm Green Clean for years.  I thought this would be the same, just without the lime scent.  I was wrong.  This formula doesn’t wash away as well and leaves a layer on your skin.  I always double cleanse but still want my first cleanse to do a good job.  I have even started to notice more black heads as I switched to this one.  I’m going back to the Green Clean and will just live with the lime scent. Doesn't rinse cleanly away
