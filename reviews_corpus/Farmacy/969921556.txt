I received this Vitamin C serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for my review. I’ve only been using it for a little over a week, so I can’t speak to the long term benefits yet, but so far I’m really impressed with the formula! I LOVE that it’s waterless! It is a thick formula, really unlike anything I’ve tried before. But it smooths over the skin easily, and absorbs well.  It might be my imagination but I swear, even after a week my skin looks more radiant! It’s a great formula and I’m really excited to see how I’m feeling after a couple months of use! Unlike any other I’ve tried!
