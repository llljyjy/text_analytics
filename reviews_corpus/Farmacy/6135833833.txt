I purchased the mini size to try it out. No regrets. A little goes a long way. I wore a full face of make up, eyebrows, mascara, foundation, etc. I warmed up the product on my fingers and gently massaged my face. My make up melted off. The best part ... NO BURNING OF THE EYES. I rinsed off with water and then washed away with my regular cleanser. This removed everything, sunscreen, sweat, my make up. I wish it was more inexpensive, but it works. Until I find something better, I will finish this up. She's melting .. she's melting .. oh what a balm!
