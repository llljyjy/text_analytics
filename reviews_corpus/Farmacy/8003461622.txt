I never leave reviews because I’m lazy, but this product is a 10/10!! Within a week I started to notice my dark marks lightening up and my complexion appearing brighter. The key to this product is to only use one pump or you could feel like it’s too oily. I love the oil-like texture because it works well with my combination skin. In addition, it absorbs well into my melinated skin. In addition, my product didn’t have a noticeable smell like the other reviewers have mentioned. When using a skin care product always keep in mind it takes at least 6weeks to start seeing results. Nothing is overnight but with patience comes change. BEST VITAMIN C SERUM I HAVE USED!!!
