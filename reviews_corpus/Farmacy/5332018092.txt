Serum was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I wanted to really love this serum, but the texture and the scent it had was pretty off-putting to me. The texture is very oily and it has a pretty weird smell which made me not want to use it all the much. Iâ€™d rather use my other vitamin C serums over this one unfortunately. Not my favorite
