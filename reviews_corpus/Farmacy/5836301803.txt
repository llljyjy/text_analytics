Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Good retinol product for sensitive skin. I tend to prefer milder forms of retinol for my skin, as the results you get are similar when used for a long period of time, and your skin doesn’t go crazy as it does with stronger retinols. I’ve had no trouble with this one so far. nan
