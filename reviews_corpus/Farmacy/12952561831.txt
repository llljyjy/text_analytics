I love love love this toner. I leaves a slight tingle upon application, which is fun. It does everything it says it does. It makes my skin feel incredible. The only reason for the 4 stars is because of the price point. I found that REN Clean’s Ready Steady Glow AHA toner to be almost identical, but I could buy more for less. This isn’t necessarily breaking the bank, but for a student, any dollar counts. Incredible!
