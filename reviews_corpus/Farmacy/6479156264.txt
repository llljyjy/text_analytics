Love this lip balm, it is moisturizing and doesnâ€™t change the other lip products I put on top of it.  My issue is, is that for the price you go through this too fast.  While I think this lip balm is great, its not that much better than lip balms that are a quarter of the price that you can get at a health food store.  I finished this balm in about a month, or month and a half of daily use, again I do like it, its just that for ten bucks it should last longer. Moisturizing, but not that much product for the $
