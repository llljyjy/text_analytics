This serum is OK as a layering step, but I find that it can be a little thick and “drag” on my stick, and even after other skincare steps, it can leave my skin feeling a bit sticky. I would need to try it more to see its longer-term benefits, but I think there are some better vitamin c alternatives on the market.  My product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for review purposes but all opinions are my own. nan
