I bought this as a less expensive version of Algenist liquid collagen and unfortunately am struggling to continue to use it. First off the smell is very off putting to me, and the product pills when I put moisturizer on top no matter how long I wait for it to absorb into my skin. I haven’t used it long enough to see any good long term effects but these 2 issues alone make me feel like I unfortunately wasted my money. Will keep looking for a good collagen serum. Doesn’t smell great and pills
