I love the texture of cleansing balms and this is no exception. The texture is so light and airy plus it smells like lime sherbet to me—which I personally love. It’s not a strong or overwhelming scent. I use this when removing make up but I use a general facial cleanser just in the shower or when I am not specifically removing make up. My skin feels clean and supple after washing with this. I’m interested in trying other products from farmacy after trying this because I love it so much. Highly recommend. 10/10 stars
