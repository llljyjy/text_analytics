I received the Farmacy Honey Halo Ceramide Moisturizer complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer is so nice! It’s super soothing on my skin, and a little goes a long way. The moisture lasts for so long, and I don’t feel oily/shiny at the end of the day. There is also not a strong fragrance so it’s a very clean product and leaves my face glowing. I would definitely get it again. Absolutely Loved
