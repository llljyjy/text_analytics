I love retinol in my skin care so I was excited to try this 1% Vitamin A Retinol serum that I was kindly gifted by Farmacy Beauty. It firms your skin and fights wrinkles after just one use and  improves your skin’s texture with continued use. It includes Kalahari melon and raspberry seed oil to help retain moisture and encapsulated retinol for a gradual release that won’t irritate your skin.  I’ve started using this once a week at night and will be building up my use in the next few weeks. Love retinol!
