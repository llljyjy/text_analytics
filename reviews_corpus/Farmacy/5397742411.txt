Farmacy Beauty is one of my all time favorite skincare brands, and each new launch of theirs makes me fall even more in love with the brand! This 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum is a game changer for my acne prone skin that struggles with hyperpigmentation. It doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and it actually feels nourishing - which is unheard of for a retinol. I love that it’s made with melon and raspberry seed oils to soothe and moisturize the skin.
