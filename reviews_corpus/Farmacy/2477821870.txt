My dry, sensitive skin thirsts for this! For years, I’ve used a more expensive face cream from the Fresh Black Tea line. I went to re-purchase and it was no longer available so I set out for a replacement. After trying many other high end creams that didn’t work for my super dry cheeks and smile lines, I decided to give the honey halo a try and wow! I can’t believe how effective it is and for the price. My skin soaks this up and provides all day hydration. My smile lines are much more moisturized and less noticeable and my skin doesn’t feel tight all day as it does with most other creams and moisturizers I’ve tried. The texture is incredible. Smooth and creamy like a whipped buttercream, but not greasy. It doesn’t make me look shiny at all. In fact, I have lasting hydration without an oily appearance. Even if you have oily skin, this may work for you because I found that even my forehead (which tends to get greasy throughout the day) doesn’t with this moisturizer. The jar is aesthetically pleasing and I really appreciate the magnetic top for the spatula. I guess you don’t have to splurge for amazing skin care! I’m back to repurchase the jumbo. This is a new regular in my everyday, dry skin care routine! All day hydration for extremely dry skin
