I bought the mini about a week ago and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It leaves the skin hydrated and glowing. However, I have noticed that when my face is warm from going to the gym, or running around cleaning the house, or just from the summer weather it becomes a second layer of sweat in a sense. The buttery formula melts into your skin when you initially put it on but then when warm in melts even further. This product is 100% one I intend to use in the winter when the weather is cooler and I wonâ€™t be sweating as much. Overall a great product but melts a little too much in the summer. Great moisturizer but not for the summer
