i absolutely love this product. Using waterproof mascara has been damaging my lashes because of improper removal. So i decided to try the house brand makeup remover and struggled… this product on the other hand, is incredible at removing all my makeup, all of it. it’s also has truly no fragrance, it doesn’t burn or dry my super sensitive eyes.you’ll definitely need to wash your face after using this product, but that’s a given when using balms.i also love how this product doesn’t stain my cotton rounds, the makeup comes right off that too. will remove ALL your makeup
