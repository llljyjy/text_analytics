I like the thickness of this eye cream because I don’t have to use much product and it seems to last a good amount of time. I like how well it absorbs into my skin while not breaking me out or leaving any sheen or film around my eyes. I haven’t noticed an overall brightening yet,  but I’m hoping after some time to see more of a positive difference and effects. I do like the overall moisturizing ability and the healthiness it makes my under eyes and am happy to see how it continues to affect me as I use it.
