This serum is unique in that it’s “waterless”- it’s not a new feature in skincare- but one that’s growing out there in the market. This doesn’t mean that water isn’t present, but rather that it’s not being added as an ingredient (if that makes sense). Propanediol takes place as the first ingredient that helps retain me moisture to the skin.The serum itself also utilizes brightening ingredients like vitamin c and arbutin to help give that skin a nice glow + promote an even skin tone.The texture is thicker than usual serums. So be prepared for that.Overall, I find this formulae very innovative and a possible repurchase for me to refill even though this was gifted to me by Farmacy. Innovative Formula
