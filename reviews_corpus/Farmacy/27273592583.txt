This was gifted by Farmacy. This serum had a pleasant texture though it is oil based that didn’t leave any sticky residue behind. It is 10% vitamin C, I had no irritation issues or sensitivity. It’s a good starter or beginner vitamin c serum. The included ferulic acid is a huge plus too! This serum left a nice glow to the skin. nan
