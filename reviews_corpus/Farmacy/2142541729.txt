Gifted by Farmacy Beauty, but opinions are my own. This is excellent vitamin c serum because it’s lightweight and doesn’t pill under makeup or when I use it with other products! The texture is something to get used to: it kinda looks/feels like those clear silicone-based hair serums that were popular in the early 2000s. It feels lightweight on the skin, but does provide a decent amount of emollience/slip, so this could be too glowy for some, depending on what products you use with it. nan
