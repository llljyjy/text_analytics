I received this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for a review, but these are my honest opinions.I was pleasantly surprised by this formula - the waterless vehicle (propanediol and pentylene glycol) feels a bit like a dry oil, which I was worried wouldn’t layer well with my moisturizer and sunscreen. However, it sinks in surprisingly quickly without any interference. This formula does have the classic L-ascorbic acid sausage water scent, though it is not overwhelming nor does it linger once I have layered on the rest of my products. I’ve only been using this for about 10 days or so, so I can’t speak to its long-term benefits, but I’m excited to have this in my routine. feels like a dry oil & layers well
