I really like this serum! It’s a 1% formula and does a really good job at targeting skin texture. I have really bad texture around my chin, inner cheeks, and forehead. Already after a few days, my texture was visibly improved and my skin wasn’t having any reactions at all (like no redness or irritation). It looked brighter and tighter too. I always make sure to put on a thick overnight moisturizing mask and sunscreen in the morning. Really love this! Gifted by farmacy beauty. Love!
