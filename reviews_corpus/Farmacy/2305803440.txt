This sunscreen used to be my absolute favorite, not any longer. I am so bummed that the packaging redesign seems to have come with a formula change. It is now chalky, drying, and leaves a white cast. My favorite moisturizing, easy-to-apply sunscreen is gone. If Farmacy could undo the formula change I would be the happiest girl! Bad formula change
