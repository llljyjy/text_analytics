I would say this serum has no smell, goes on clean, is not sticky and absorbs well. I can’t speak to the long term effects as it’s hard to tell when I’ve only used it for a week. I will say I’m a retinol newbie and after using it for a week, 3x/week, I observed no irritation or redness. gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
