This serum is amazing! It feels very smooth and almost cool when you apply it and absorbs pretty quickly. It also doesn’t take much! One little pump easily does my whole face and neck. A lot of people have commented on the smell and not liking it, but I think it smells really fresh and real. It reminds me of a handful of thyme or walking into a green house. I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks and it has smoothed my skin and also helped with some lingering maskne. Highly recommend! nan
