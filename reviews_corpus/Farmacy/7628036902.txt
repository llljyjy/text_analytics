This was my first time trying a vitamin c serum and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it! It literally feels like it wakes up your skin and refreshes it instantly. Itâ€™s not a heavy or oily serum so you can use it morning or night! This is a staple in my skincare routine from now on! New fan of vitamin c serums!
