I received this serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty but my opinions are my own! Love that it’s a waterless and oil free Vit c serum! It has a minimal inci list and is very gentle. However, I was not a big fan of the texture. It seemed somehow greasy/silicone-y despite it being oil free. Once it sunk into my skin it felt better but still left a bit of a filmy residue. The serum is fragrance free but has a reminiscent smell of rubber or mineral oil. I will continue to patch test, but so far I’m on the fence about this serum. On The Fence
