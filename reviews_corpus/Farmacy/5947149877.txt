This retinol that was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Iâ€™ve used other retinols before and it leaves my skin dry and sometimes burns while applying it. After testing this product for a week I have no irritation and my skin looks brighter after use.  Product goes on so smooth and feels refreshing. I will work up to using a retinol 4x a week but make sure to wear sunscreen the next day to avoid any sunburns. nan
