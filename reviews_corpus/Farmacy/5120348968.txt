I have 50+ menopausal, slightly sensitive, dry skin. I added this to my pm routine (after tret). Upon opening the glass jar, I did not detect any scent. I used a very tiny amount and it does not dry down sticky, but felt soft and about 30 minutes later still felt great. I was surprised at how very smooth this gel like mask applied and how moisturizing it is. I Woke up with no irritation, and soft, happy skin.  I currently use PC Niacinamide, treatment, which has HA.  I receive the same results with regards to pores so I am prob going to switch to get that combo of Niacinamide and moisturizer. I recommend this if you have dry skin.  I have no experience with oily skin, but I would think this might be a little much.  I have tried a few other Farmacy products, that I would not buy again, but this one is going to be a staple in my winter routine. I did receive this as a sample from Sephora, but that did not influence my review. nan
