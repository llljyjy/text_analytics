I tried the Farmacy Wake Up Honey eye cream and I was pretty pleased with it. I didn’t notice any instant improvement but over the week, it did seem to lighten my under eyes. There wasn’t much of a scent at all. I was expecting some honey scent or something but it was pretty neutral. The texture was very nice and didn’t irritate my eyes or pill under makeup. Great texture!
