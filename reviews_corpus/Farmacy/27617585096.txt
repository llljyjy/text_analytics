If I could give this higher than 5 stars I would. I am absolutely in love with this product. It’s so gentle yet tough on breaking down sunscreen and makeup. This solid balm starts off as an oil and then once water is added, turns into a beautiful milky texture. I have highly sensitive and acne prone skin, this product didn’t cause any irritation or breakouts. Amazing product for a first cleanse in your PM routine. Glorious
