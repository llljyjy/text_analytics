I received this complimentary from Farmacy. I am a Vitamin C fanatic! I was super excited to see that Farmacy now makes one as that are one of my fave brands of all time. The texture of this serum is a little weird but in a good way! A little goes a long way so be sure to only use one pump. This spreads kind of dry on the face but absorbs really well! I love how it makes my skin look brighter and more supple all at the dame time. Great serum! I will continue to use this for continued results. nan
