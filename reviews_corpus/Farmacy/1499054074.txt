I absolutely adore this product. Goes on light but feels really good on the skin and works well with my other creams. I do notice my under eyes look more “alive” after two weeks of continuous use. A little goes a long way. My only wish for all eye creams is that they ditch the jar. Tubes are easier to apply. We love!
