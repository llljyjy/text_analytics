I’m a lucky few that doesn’t break out from concentrated niacinamide. I enjoy the texture personally— it has a slippy texture to it, and feels nice when applied in a thin layer after doing my other skin care. I can see where this could get excessively sticky if too much is applied, or if used with other heavier creams. I think it definitely helps with my skin barrier, and my husband who has dry, dehydrated skin enjoys it when I he applies it after washing his face at night. I think it’s worth a try! If you have texture issues l, try it in store and see if it’s something you like or not— definitely a little goes a long way! A nice night mask alternative
