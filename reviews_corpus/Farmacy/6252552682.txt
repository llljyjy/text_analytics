This might be the most underrated face moisturizer out there. It is beautiful and clean. I have hyper sensitive skin. Not sensitive, hypersensitive. I have rosacea and I’m allergic to a lot of ingredients. This lotion is buttery smooth, thick and leaves your skin plump and hydrated. You need very LITTLE because it’s so thick and concentrated. I think people who don’t like it are using too much because it sinks right into your skin and is BEAUTIFUL under makeup. I use this as my primer now. I have dry skin and this makes my makeup look glowy. I seriously have never loved a product more and it’s clean ingredients! I know everyone’s skin is different, but if you’re looking for a good face moisturizer give this one a try! I’ve been using this for almost 2 years now and my skin looks the best it ever has. holy grail face moisturizer!
