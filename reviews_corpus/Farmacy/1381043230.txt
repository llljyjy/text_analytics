I’m truly blown away by this product…over the past few years, I’ve had a substantial patch of hyperpigmentation spread across the center of my forehead. I finally looked into trying something to minimize it, and a lovely Customer Service Rep at Sephora recommended this brand to me. It’s been merely 3 weeks of use thus far, yet I’ve already noticed significant brightening/lightening on the dark spots! I don’t necessarily expect the patch to completely disappear (would be a miracle if it does!), but if it can continue to lighten even more over time and I can use it as maintenance, I’ll be thrilled. I’m already ecstatic by the results I currently have, and am especially pleased considering what a reasonable price point this product is set at compared to some lower-rated competitors. nan
