I got a sample of the product (thank god!) and boy was it bad. Right off the bat, the SMELL. Good god. It melted like any makeup removing balm, which was good. BUT. It didn’t remove the makeup (which wasn’t that heavy) and left an icky, oily residue. I even tested it with a white flushable wipe and I was disheartened to see a significant amount of makeup come off. For this price, you can get the Clinique Take The Day Off balm (which is $1 more but you get an extra 25ml) which works wayyyyy better.Save your money, points, and nostrils. Don’t get this. Never again
