I used the origins ginseng energy boosting gel moisturizer for years, but found that it dried up throughout the day making my skin feel tight, and balled up with certain sunscreen products. It wasn’t a big deal but I tried this moisturizer and both problems were fixed AND it helps calm my skin’s redness and irritation. I use this in conjunction with the Korea’s wild rose foaming cleanser and my skin feels plump and happy, and looks hydrated all day. For Acne Prone Gel Moisturizer lovers
