Thanks to Farmacy, I was gifted their new Wake Up Honey Vitamin C Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review. As always, Farmacy products are fabulous, and their new Wake Up Honey Eye Cream with Vitamin C is no different. It comes in this cute little proportionate twist jar that fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. It’s light, absorbs quickly, and requires very little effort to soak into the skin, which I find especially important in a great eye cream. After applying, I notice much more bright, radiant skin around the eyes, which causes my entire complexion to look for young, vibrant, and awake. My eye area is also more firm, less puffy, and those tiny beginnings of aging fine lines are diminishing, which I’m SO glad. I’m really loving this new Farmacy Eye Cream! 5 A Great Eye Cream!
