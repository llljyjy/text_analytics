Vitamin c serums are staple in my morning routine so I was looking forward to testing this serum gifted by Farmacy Beauty, the texture in gel like but once applied it feels like an oil serum that takes a while to settle into your skin. If you’re in a hurry to get through the routine and love to layer skincare this might not be the product for you. I love minimal routines and mostly use this over a mist and follow up with a sunscreen. So far so good, the texture and scent weren’t my favorites but I’m hoping the results will push me to change my mind. A lovely formula!
