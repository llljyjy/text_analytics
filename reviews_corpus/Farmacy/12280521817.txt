An amazing toner to add to your routine! I use this toner first after washing my face, then the PORES serum by SEPHORA, the gel moisturizer by Farmacy, and then Farmacyâ€™s cherry eye cream -and the eye cream is just an extra step for me!- this pairs flawlessly with my routine to help rid any textures on my face, and help in the healing process of any blemishes I have!Loving this product so far: no smell, absorbs well, leaves my face feeling clean! Amazing when paired in a routine!
