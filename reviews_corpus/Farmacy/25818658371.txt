Wanted to love it, but I just can’t. I wear very light face makeup, so most of the makeup I wear is on my eyes. It goes on amazing and smells even better, but it leaves me with raccoon eyes. I literally only put liquid eyeliner on the outside of my upper lid, that’s it. I bought this to help remove my eye makeup and I still find myself having to wipe with a rag afterwards - which is what I was trying to AVOID. not the worst product but will not be buying again. mehh
