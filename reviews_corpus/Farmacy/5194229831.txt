Received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I have tried retinol serums in the past and I was not very impressed with them. Farmacyâ€™s new vitamin a retinol serum seems to be proving wrong with minimal results so far. I started using it about a week now two times within the week and my is reacting to it quite nicely. Not overly drying as some others do, not much irritation. I will continue to use for better results. Firmer looking skin
