I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This serum works great for my skin. My face is showing some fine lines and wrinkles and this serum really helps to reduce the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles and to provide my skin with a smoother texture. The pump lid makes it easy to get the right amount for application. After using this serum each night for a few days, I already saw results. My fine lines and wrinkles are less visible, and my skin feels softer, hydrated, firmer and looks brighter. I use the serum at night right before bed on clean skin. I use a small amount and tap it into my skin. I love that the serum is silky smooth and absorbs fast. It has a nice lightweight texture and does not leave a sticky feeling. My skin feels hydrated and soft and is looking smooth and radiant when waking up in the morning. This retinol serum is gentle enough for my skin to use daily. I have not experienced any bad skin reactions like peeling of the skin or dryness of the skin, and I make sure to use sunscreen during the day. I canâ€™t wait for the long-term results. I highly recommend this retinol serum! Makes skin silky soft and smooth
