I got two samples with my order. I used one sample on my face before sleeping. I woke up with such soft and smooth skin! I didnâ€™t notice anything with my pores. The dry and rough acne scars I had were smooth and evened out. I loved it so much I squeezed the second sample into a sample jar and am only using it on rough scars all over my body. It smells like a thick moisturizer with a faint whiff of blueberries. The texture is of a thick moisturizer. Nice lavender/light blue color.While I do love the formula and cream, the full-size product is wayyyy too expensive for me to buy. If there are Farmacy samples in the future I will absolutely pick them & recommend others pick them. But will I buy any Farmacy product? No, nor will I recommend it based off the price alone. Saw difference in smoothing scars overnight!
