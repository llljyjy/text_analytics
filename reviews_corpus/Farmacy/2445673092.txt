As I type this review, I have a layer of this mask on. It’s just so pleasant. I’ve used quite a few overnight masks before and this one has such a nice balance -- some I’ve tried feel nonexistent after five minutes and others make my face stick to my pillow no longer how many hours before bed I put it on. Because it’s winter and my skin likes to be problematic, my skin barrier has been going through it. I’ve used this two to three times a week for the last couple of weeks and it’s been a saving grace. My skin looks and feels hydrated and not dry and sullen, and it’s give me some life back in my face especially if I’ve been admittedly a bit lazy with my skincare routine in the dead of winter. I’m not sure about refining my pores or improving my skin’s texture yet, but in terms of hydrating and skin barrier restoration? This has been doing an incredible job. Green Clean is still my favorite Farmacy product, but this has officially pushed everything else down to become my second. nan
