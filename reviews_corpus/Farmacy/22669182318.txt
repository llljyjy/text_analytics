I really like the smell when opening this cleansing balm. It removed all makeup very well without irritating my skin. After rinsing with lukewarm water, it does not leave my skin too dry, and I can feel my face is very fresh and clean. I am using this one for night skincare routine. Really recommend for everyone. Very excellent cleansing balm I've ever tried
