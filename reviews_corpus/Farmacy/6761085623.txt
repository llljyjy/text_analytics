I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for review purposes. The consistency is liquid therefore it is easily absorbed by my skin.  I didnâ€™t feel any tingling feeling like other vitamin c serum. It also has a lightweight consistency so you can layer your other skincare products next to it. I have yet to test whether it can brighten my dark spot, but I can tell it did brighten up my complexion. lightweight feel
