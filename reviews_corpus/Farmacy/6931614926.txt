I was recommended this moisturizer by several people. I use Tretinoin and this product is packed with ceramides, so I thought this would be an amazing compliment to my skincare routine. This moisturizer has a lovely texture and is super thick. It smells faintly of honey, which I don’t really like, but the smell fades fast upon application so it isn’t really an issue. It’s a bit hard to spread and it takes a bit to absorb into the skin. It does leave me feeling a bit greasy, which is okay since I used it at night and in combo with tret, but I can see it being a problem for others. My main concern is that this absolutely wrecked my skin. It broke me out almost immediately upon using it. I even stopped using all other products and used only this moisturizer for two weeks to test my theory - and I was right. This product was not kind to my skin at all. Not kind to my skin
