LOVE LOVE THIS! Unfortunately, I have discontinued using since it contains 2 types of Xylitol.  A piece of gum with Xylitol can kill a cat or small dog.  I have a house full of pets so I wonâ€™t be willing to take the chance.  A shame because this is a great brand and all of the other ingredients are top ingredients. Wonderful! Unless you have pets Xylitol is poison
