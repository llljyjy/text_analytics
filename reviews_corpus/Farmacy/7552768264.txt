I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Anyone who knows me, knows I’m absolutely hooked on Farmacy skincare! The first skincare product that I got my wonderful fiance to consistently use was the Daily greens moisturizer, so Farmacy is very special to me.This mask was such an exciting launch for so many reasons!First of all, I LOVE night masks! They’re such a simple way to deliver huge benefits at the snap of a finger. Also, niacinamide is one of my favorite skincare ingredients! It’s done so much for my pores and texture plus it’s super gentle and safe for all skin types! Niacinamide also does an amazing job at helping strengthen your skin barrier. After using this mask, I woke up to find my skin was softer, smoother, and looked all around healthier. My pores weren’t as noticeable and I didn’t have any redness or irritation!I definitely recommend this product, it’s one I’ll continue to purchase without a second thought. nan
