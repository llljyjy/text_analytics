This was recommended to me by an employee at Sephora several years ago and I still use it. I have combination oily skin and this doesnâ€™t cause breakouts. I used the size of a almond but depending on how much eyeshadow on my eyes, sometimes I may need a little more. This is used on dry skin and rinsed off followed by a mild face wash after. Highly recommend. Removes Make-up With Clean Ingredients
