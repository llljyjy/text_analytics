I spent some points on a sample of this, and it was so nice that I came back for the full size. it does a great job of gently dissolving makeup and sunscreen. nice light fruity scent. plus it comes with a scoop so you donâ€™t have to put your fingers into the balm itself. all around great cleansing balm! a winner!
