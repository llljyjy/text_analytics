Completely broke me out, I normally do not write reviews but always read them. I do not have sensitive skin, it is typically normal, I use yttp green tea facial cleanser or the truth juice daily cleanser .I wanted to try something new and the smell is great as well as the consistency and packaging.I wanted to like it because the smell and I love the Farmacy cleansing balm but once I switched to the truth juice my skin has not broken out and has looked 10x better. I do like it to shave my legs though until I run out. sadly broke me out
