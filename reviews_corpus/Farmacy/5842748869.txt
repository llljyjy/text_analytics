I love this product! It is great at taking off makeup, it feels nice to use and it leaves your skin feeling hydrated and clean! It does have a scent to it, so if you hate fragrance, be warned. However, it is still a wonderful product, especially if you have dry skin. Personally, my skin was peeling often because of the acne medication that I use, but ever since I started using this product every night, the peeling completely stopped! One of my favorite products of all time!
