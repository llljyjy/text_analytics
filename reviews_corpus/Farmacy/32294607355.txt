Used this for several months. Itâ€™s a nice Vitamin C serum but def not worth getting again. The bottle leaked at the top, would sting my skin (some nights more than others) and the last time I used it, it left my skin super dried out. This was not my first time using a vitamin C serum, and I have not had a reaction like that to one before. Again, was nice but not worth buying again, especially for my skin. Not For Me
