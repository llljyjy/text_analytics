This new Vitamin C serum gifted by Farmacy has been great for my sensitive skin! I love that this product has the brightening aspects of a vitamin c serum but is still gentle on the skin! I Aveo adding vitamin c into my skin care routine but I find that a lot of serums are to highly concentrated for my sensitive skin. I love that this serum was really made for all skin type sin mind! I have been using it for a bout a week and have already seen a bit of a difference in the overall brightness of my skin. I am excited to continue using and seeing the long term results! Super gentle and a great option for sensitive skin
