I have been using this product for a little over a week and all I can say is that it is the best vitamin c serum that I have used! Consistency? It definitely has a much more oily consistency compared to most other vitamin c serums, but I think it’s quick absorbency makes up for it. It also allows the rest of my skincare to layer very well.Is it Sensitive/Acne-Prone Skin Friendly? Surprisingly yes! 10% is a relatively high concentration, but my skin did not sting or burn upon application. It also did not cause any breakouts. Definitely should be using SPF during the day though—as you should be while using any vitamin c product. Pricing? It is the most expensive vitamin c serum I’ve purchased to date, but I think that it is completely worth it. The results are quick! Of course my hyperpigmentation did not disappear in just a week, but my skin is plump and glowing. How effective vitamin c is depends significantly on the quality of the product itself and I think that this is a very high quality product. I would repurchase despite the price. Give it a shot if you’re in the market for a new vitamin c serum :) nan
