It took me a few tries to actually make this work (I think I was applying too much) because it would feel like it wouldn’t absorb into my skin, but I applied less after applying my retinol and it works amazing that way! My skin has never been better I really see less dark spots and my pores seem smaller. I’m glad I didn’t give up on it and returned it! Worth every penny! nan
