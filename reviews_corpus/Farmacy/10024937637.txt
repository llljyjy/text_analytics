I was obsessed with original GC which always worked great for me!! However, I have very sensitive/acne prone skin so I was super excited about a fragrance free cleansing balm. This product did not work well at all for me. It just leaves a thick waxy layer of cleansing balm on my face. I will definitely be going back to the original cleansing balm. If looking for a cleansing balm I recommend the one with fragrance. disappointed
