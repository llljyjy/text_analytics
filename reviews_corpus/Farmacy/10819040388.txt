I have oily, acne prone and sensitive skin. Most sunscreens tend to be sit very heavy on my skin or break me out.This one blends to the skin effortlessly, no white-cast, doesn’t break me out. I left it on for 6 hours today, came home, my face still doesn’t look oily at all!! I’m absolutely in love with the formula. So glad I discover this.I read some reviews here saying the old formula was better for hydration but I think this new formula is so so perfect for oily skin. You can always use a good moisturizer underneath if you have drier skin type!! PERFECT FOR OILY + SENSITIVE SKIN !!!
