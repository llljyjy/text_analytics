Yess to this 1% vitamin A retinol serum!! Everybody needs a retinol in their routine to firm, target fine lines and wrinkles, and improve texture while nourishing the skin with minimal irritation. I’ve used some retinols that are so harsh on my skin OR  the opposite and they are so weak they don’t do anything at all! This is an excellent formula! Just strong enough without the irritation! Just make sure you build up to regular usage! Start off with couple times a week every other night and build up over time! Gifted by farmacy beauty Lovely!
