So lovely. I’m a skincare junkie and I’ve only had this a few days but I can confidently say WOW I love this stuff. I got it in the Farmacy skincare selection and it’s gonna last me a long time. The texture is very much like butter but not oily at all. I’ve been using it to top off a very pore-oriented skincare routine that’s heavy on the acids and retinol etc. (including the Farmacy BHA toner and Honeymoon Glow AHA resurfacing serum, plus some The Ordinary serums and Tatcha.. I switch around), and I wake up with my face feeling SO glowy and nice. It really seems to neutralize things. I used to have PCOS-induced cystic acne & relatively sensitive skin, and I’d feel comfortable using this even during a breakout. I’d consider it a heavy cream but it simultaneously feels light as air, and smells very mildly like honeycomb (big yum, not overpowering at all). As far as I can tell, I’ll be buying this stuff as long as it’s available. Highly recommend. HEAVENLY non-oily butter cloud?!
