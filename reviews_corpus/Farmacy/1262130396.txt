My skin used to be fairly oily, but as I’ve gotten older, it has become very dry. This dryness is mostly on my cheeks and the perimeter of my face. I was so surprised that this moisturizer far surpassed the Augustinus Bader Rich Cream that I had tried. When I used the Bader, my face still felt very dry in the mornings, almost as if I hadn’t used anything the night before. With the Honey Halo, my skin felt smooth and moisturized in the morning. If you’re looking for a great cream, look no further. I never usually write reviews, but I have been so impressed by this product. For me, this is better than Bader's Rich Cream
