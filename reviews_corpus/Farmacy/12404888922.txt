I’ve been struggling with acne around my lips for about a year now, and no product has helped fade the dark spots that have been left behind. However, the before and after pictures of my lips are around 2 weeks apart and look at how much of a difference this product has made! I highly highly recommend it!! It is an absolute game changer and I feel so much more confident in the way I look and don’t know what I would do without this product. I use this product every morning and every night but make sure that when you use it in the morning, you follow with a sunscreen and that when you use it at night to wait 10 minutes and then apply a good moisturizer. Faded my post acne dark spots to barely visible!!
