I absolutely love this cleanser! It smells fantastic. I have oily skin and wear make up, and this is one of the few cleansers that really does a great job removing make up. My only complaint is that it is hard to squeeze out of the tube. I think it is because it is just too thick. I have used this cleanser for quite some time but I am thinking of switching for this reason. Anyone else experienced this issue or find it annoying? Wish they would change their packaging to accommodate this thicker cleanser. Fabulous! Dispensing not fab.
