Farmacy nailed it with this Vitamin C serum! It was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I haven’t used one like it before. There’s a very subtle fragrance, which is a nice to have and I loved the texture and how smoothly it glided on my not so smooth skin. The packaging is minimal and very travel and vanity friendly. Definitely becoming a staple in my skincare routine. nan
