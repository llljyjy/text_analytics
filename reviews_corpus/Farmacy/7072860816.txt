Absolutely love it. I got the mini size and was pleasantly surprised at the amount you get and the fact that the mini also has glass packaging like the full size. I’m so glad I took the plunge and bought this. My pores are smaller, my skin is more even, and it feels refreshing to apply. It has a “barely there scent” which is great as fragrances don’t usually agree with my reactive skin. 100% recommend. nan
