This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I really loved it.  The packaging is really well designed and the smell is just beyond delicious! It truly smells like honey and feels really good on the skin. Itâ€™s litter thicker than other moisturizers but does a really good job to smoother the skin! I'm a FAN of this moisturizer!
