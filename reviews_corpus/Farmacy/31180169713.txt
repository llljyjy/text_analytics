I received this product complimentary from FARMACY BEAUTY in exchange for my honest review.This eye cream is a perfect match for all of my underwear issues. Formulated with Vitamin C, caffeine, cranberry peptides and a honey blend that all work together to moisturize,brighten dark circles,smooth fine lines and reduce puffiness around the eye area. The cream has a very smooth,velvet like texture that seems to melt right into my skin,making a very nice,smooth surface to apply my concealer on. My eye area has definitely improved with the use of this product,as my dark circles are a bit lighter,the puffiness is less severe and the skin is very hydrated,which I am very pleased about. This is a product that I will definitely continue to use and one that I highly recommend trying. A great multi-use eye treatment!
