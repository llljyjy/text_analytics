First, this smells like honey. I know people are in general not looking for fragrance but I personally am obsessed with the smell of honey so for anyone like me, this is great. Essentially it’s a balm. It feels thicker than something like aquaphor but I found it to work really well under my eyes at night. I like it! Definitely expensive when it’s really just a honey scented balm, but it’s more luxurious feeling and definitely a more sensory experience nan
