Love this product. I was using the Good Genes serum which was extremely underwhelming and I’m so glad I switched to this. I have combo sensitive skin and a dry flaky forehead that makes every foundation look awful after about an hour once it’s settled. Using this 3x a week has completely gotten rid of that problem and has left my skin looking amazing and nourished when paired with their moisturizer. People are complaining about the smell but I don’t care about smells in my skincare or makeup and honestly, it disappears in 30 seconds once it’s applied. Cannot recommend this product enough. nan
