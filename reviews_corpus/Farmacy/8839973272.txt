I am so happy that I got this face moisturizer. I love absolutely everything about this. Starting with the container, it has a magnet in it so you can place your spatula on top and it will stick. Then with the product itself itâ€™s kind of thick and just melts into your skin. It does have a bit of a honey scent that I enjoy. This works great for my combination skin and it makes my skin feel soft. This Honey halo moisturizer was gifted to me from Farmacy Beauty. Such and amazing moisturizer!!!
