I tested this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty: I’ve tried quite a few vitamin c serums in my day and have rarely had luck. They would fade my discoloration but they would give me a lot of blackheads and would stay sticky on my face for hours (a huge pet peeve of mine), but I haven’t noticed those things with this one so far! It feels more like a rich oil than a sticky serum but still delivers the same benefits the Drunk Elephant one that I’ve loved for a long time. My skin looks brighter and more even and it hasn’t broken me out at all! Overall pleased. Really Great Serum
