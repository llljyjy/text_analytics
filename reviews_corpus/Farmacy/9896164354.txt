I’m a huge fan of Night masks. Especially during the colder months. I have to say this is one of the best I have tried. The cream is silky and has one of the most wonderful feeling when I apply it.  My skin is plump and super soft in the morning. I love how moisturizing it is. Niacinamide is one of my favorite skincare ingredients. The active ingredients in the night mask are very nice and I’m very pleased with the product. Highly recommend.*Gifted by Farmacy for review purposes. Best Night Mask
