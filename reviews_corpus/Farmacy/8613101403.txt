This product has been amazing for lightening up stubborn acne scars. I used to pick at my acne and it would leave red spots, so I thought I’d have to laser them off. I’ve been using Farrmacy products for a few years, so I gave this one a try! I like that it does not have a foul smell like other vitamin c serums and that you can use it day and night. This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for the review but all opinions are my own! nan
