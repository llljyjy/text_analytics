Worked pretty well on my skin. I will say though that my sensitive skin did experience a little tingle when I first used this, but my skin is super sensitive. It wasnâ€™t anything too insane but I thought it was important to note. This is also super lightweight on the skin and I look forward to continued use to see what long term effects I can get from it!
