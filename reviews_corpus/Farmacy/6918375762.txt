I love this product. I have tried multiple drugstore options, including physicians formula matcha 3-in-1 balm, verb, and coco kind oat to milk cleanser. The physicians formula smelled too strongly of matcha and burned my eyes/left a film. The verb scent was SO overpowering (eucalyptus scent) I just couldn’t stand it, and same issue with the eyes. And the cocokind was such a thick honey-like texture and I felt didn’t turn into an oil or even a milky texture so it was harder to use. This farmacy one melts like butter, the scent isn’t too overpowering and for those with a sensitivity I think they also have an unscented version, and I have not one had an issue with my eyes burning or a film on my eyes. Though it’s definitely pricier than the drugstore brands, I’ve been using a little and it goes a long way. Definitely worth it especially when you consider the ingredient list. worth the money!! obsessed
