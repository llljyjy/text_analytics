Gifted by Farmacy Beauty, This is a thin lotion like consistency. It has a lot of slip and a little goes a long way. I doesnâ€™t have a scent. Takes a bit to dry down but feels very lightweight. It has not caused irritation yet and so far my skin likes it. I will update my results as retinol usually takes more than a month to see noticeable results! 5 stars because retinol usually irritates my skin at first but this has not! nan
