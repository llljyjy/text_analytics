I received a sample of this with my Sephora points and I was so obsessed. I wanted another option to my Clinique cleansing balm. I love the smell of this product, every time I put it on I feel like I’m an in the spa. It’s great for everyday use but for makeup removal I still have to go with my Clinique take the day off to get everything removed. smells like the spa
