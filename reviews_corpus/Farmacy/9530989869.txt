This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for an authentic review. This is a beautiful product! The texture is smooth and hydrating â€” not gritty like other Retinols. While it will take time to show full results, after a few weeks of using this product my skin feels smoother and I experienced no irritation during use. Great Retinol!
