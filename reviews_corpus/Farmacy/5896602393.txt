Loved the scent and the way this made my face feel, but after a couple of days, I developedcysts under my skin and little whiteheads. New ones each day.  I have the occasional pimple/breakout, but new daily skin issues is not something I’m used to.  The cysts under my skin lasted for months.  I did return this and am thankful for Sephora’s generous return policy. May not work for eveyone
