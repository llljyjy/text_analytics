I have been using this mask regularly as a last step of my night time skin care routine. I apply it and leave on my face, I find my skin more softer and plumper after waking up the next morning. Itâ€™s not too greasy or sticky but it does help in locking in all the moisture. I received this complimentary from farmacy beauty but the review is mine. Hydrating mask
