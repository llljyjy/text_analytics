Absolutely love this moisturizer! I have dry skin and this sinks into my skin and absorbs so well. I stay hydrated all day and have no issues with dry patches. I also mix it my Tretinoin at night to prevent any drying/adverse reactions and it works so very well. Seriously my new staple moisturizer. nan
