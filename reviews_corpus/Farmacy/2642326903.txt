I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. As I’m reaching my 30s I’ve decided to add in some anti-aging ingredients to my skin care routine and was delighted to come across this one from Farmacy. What I really enjoyed about the specific product was that since I have sensitive skin it was very gentle and did not try out my skin. I was able to wear it every 2 to 3 days during the night in addition to my normal moisturizing routine and within about a week was able to see a difference in the fine lines around my mouth Gentle and doesn’t dry out skin
