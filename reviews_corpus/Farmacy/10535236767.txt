I’ve been looking to jumpstart my skin and incorporate more vitamin C into my skincare routine, this seemed to fit the bill. I like how it’s a concentrated formula but so far it hasn’t irritated me at all. I do only use it once a week and I will slowly increase that as my skin gets adjusted to that.
