I got a small pot of this for a beauty rewards to try since I love niacinamide. I have a combination, light-medium skin and found this to be one of the few night masks that don’t clog my pores. That being said, the consistency is veryyyy thick and occlusive. If you are prone to congestion, definitely use sparingly. Using a small amount, I still see improvement in my skin in the morning. My skin appears more plump and firm, however, the improvement is not drastic. Regardless, I bought the full size because I’m interested to see any long-term improvements. Sample —> Full Size
