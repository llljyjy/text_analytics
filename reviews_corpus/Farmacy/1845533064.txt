I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I always love a good Vit C serum and hearing that Farmacy was releasing one really pumped me up! This is an almost oil-based texture for a vit c serum but melts and sinks into the skin quickly. I really like the way this feels on the skin. I am still using it so I can’t say it helps with hyperpigmentation or dark spots yet.. but it does brighten the skin for a nice soft glow too. The smell is a bit off-putting. It’s a chemical scent that is also a scent of an old-school healing salve my mother put on me as a kid. If you know Porter’s Liniment then that’s what this reminds me of. Not quite as strong but it’s there. The scent lasts a few hours on me but I am sensitive to smells and can smell them for a bit. Overall a decent Serum with Vit C. I hope they create with one no scent or a citrus one instead of this chemical one. 4/5 stars for the scent nan
