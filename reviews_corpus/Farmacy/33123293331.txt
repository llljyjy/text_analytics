I loved the green clean. I figured I’d give this a try because it’s nonscented. Mistake. Even when you run it in your fingers, it doesn’t oil up like the green clean. After either product, I would go over it with a warm wash cloth to make sure I got the creases of nose and what not. But this feels like it’s just stuck to your face after washing it off. Don’t like it at all. Stick to green clean. I really recommend sticking to green clean too hard to wash off
