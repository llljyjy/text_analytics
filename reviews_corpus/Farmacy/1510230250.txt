I liked this product at first, but after a few days I found that I was breaking out with clusters of really small whiteheads which was unusual for me. I am acne prone but I don’t usually get whiteheads. Once I switched to another moisturizer, the breakouts went away. So if you’re prone to acne this product might not be for you. I also have oily skin, and something I’ve noticed generally with gel moisturizers is that they can actually make you look more oily than if you were to use a regular moisturizer. Moisturizers with shea butter (rather than oils or water) seem to moisturize a lot better while leaving the skin less oily for people who are acne prone. Avoid if you're acne prone
