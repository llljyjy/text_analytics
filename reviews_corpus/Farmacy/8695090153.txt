(Gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for honest review)I can’t speak to the long term benefits just yet, but this serum is lovely! Pleasantly surprised at the formula to target dark spots & hyperpigmentation. I love alpha Arbutin & the 10% vitamin c blend is a gentle but brings all the action. I’ve experienced no breakouts or sensitivity from this serum & it feels comfortable on my skin. I have been working hard to correct dark spots from hormonal breakouts & also from my picking (laughs in guilty) . It takes time & consistency & using the right products! Found a serum I want to keep on rotation with this one! Love this formula!
