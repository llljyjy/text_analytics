I was given this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This is the first time I’ve heard of a vitamin A retinol. I’m very excited to see with continued use how it transforms my skin! The scent is lovely and the texture feels like a mix between a serum and a lotion. The package is total aesthetic too! Can’t wait to see how it works!
