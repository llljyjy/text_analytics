This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I’ve tried a lot of vitamin c serums and none are quite like this one. The waterless formula is definitely thicker than every other vitamin c I’ve used. I don’t dislike it, it just took some time to get used to. My skin looks brighter and more radiant but I haven’t used it long enough to see a difference on my dark spots. nan
