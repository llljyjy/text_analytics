First of all, this moisturizer is very high quality. It comes in a glass jar with a reusable metal spatula. The moisturizer may look thick at first, but it’s actually very creamy and absorbs quickly into the skin. My skin feels super soft after using it. There is a light honey smell which isn’t overpowering. I love that this is a clean beauty product and highly recommend it!This product was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in return for an honest review. Creamy Moisturizer
