I bought this for myself. I got this because I was looking for something to amp up my evening routine. I like to layer this over Luna oil and sometimes an additional hydrating serum at night. It’s a super easy routine that delivers great results. I’ve been doing this combo every three nights or so, and my skin has never looked better in terms of pore size and evenness of tone. This is big for me because I constantly struggle with large pores, and I have some scars from acne that have faded some over time but still linger. This night mask hasn’t erased the little fine lines I have on my forehead, but doing that would literally require magic. Overall, I would really recommend this. Great night mask for pores and even tone
