I was gifted by Farmacy the Wake Up Honey Eye Cream.  I was skeptical to say the least. But I have to admit I was wrong. This eye cream has vitamin C and honey to reduce those fine lines around your eyes. It also helps reduce those dark circles that appear when youâ€™re tired that can just bring down your total look. This ice cream will make your eyes look reinvigorated even when running on two hours of sleep. The other thing that I love about this eye cream is that it can overtime reduce uneven texture around the eye. Vitamin C and Honey
