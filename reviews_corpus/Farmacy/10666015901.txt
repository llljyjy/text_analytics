I got a sample of this stuff with my last purchase and was able to get a couple of uses out of it. I loved how easily and quickly my makeup came off and it left none behind!! The only complaint I have is that afterwards when washing my face it felt pretty oily and hard to rinse the product completely off unless scrubbing it with soap and water. For me it didn’t bother me to much since I have dry skin and love anything that can leave my skin a little hydrated and dewy. But if your oily, that’s something I would watch for nan
