Gifted by Farmacy. I live in NYC and have the heat going in my apartment all the time and when I step outside, the cold dries out my skin even more. This mask is so hydrating and perfect for the dry winter. It also helps quell some of the irritation from tret! I use every other night and it leaves my tone looking much more balanced. I highly recommend. Hydrating!
