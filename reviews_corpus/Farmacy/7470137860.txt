First the packages is amazing. It is heavy and feels luxurious and the magnetic lid for the spatula is so convenient. As for the mask, I have pretty sensitive skin but found the warming sensation to be gentle and comfortable. After 10 minutes, my skin was very hydrated, glowing and looked smoother. So glad I added this to my skincare collection. lovely mask
