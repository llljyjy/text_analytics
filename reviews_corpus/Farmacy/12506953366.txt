absolutely love farmacy products, I have never had any reaction to any of them. and I have very sensitive, and acne prone skin type, very oily as well. this is by far the best product they have ! love it, but I only give 4 stars because it is way to pricey. I go through a full sized bottle in about 2 months ish haha, so pretty  expensive. I will literally only buy this if it’s in the big value kit, the one they “used“ to sell with a full sized bottle of this and a few minis. love the product but bring the price down lol! or sell the value kit cuz ur asking way to much! come on farmacy ! lol great product, but very expensive :O
