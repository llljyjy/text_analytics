gifted by Farmacy Beauty. This was truly a wonderful retinol. I tend to have dry skin and eczema so it’s very difficult for me to be able to find products that won’t irritate or flare up my skin. I do not have that issue with this not once. I started noticing that my skin was feeling firmer and smoother. It also did not feel sticky and it absorbed very quickly. nan
