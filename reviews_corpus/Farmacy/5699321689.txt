I received the new 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This retinol serum contains two retinols, fast-acting retinal and encapsulated retinol, to work immediately as well as provide deeper absorption into the skin to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This serum feels silky and creamy and has a very light natural scent. It contains ceramides as well as upcycled Kalahari melon and raspberry seed oils to replenish, hydrate and soothe the skin. I have not been using this serum for long enough to notice a dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles but I do enjoy the way it feels on my skin and will continue to use this and feel comfortable recommending it. Silky and creamy texture
