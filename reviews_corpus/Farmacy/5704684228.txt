I think they changed the formula or something because this won’t take off my mascara AT ALL. A huge waste of a product. I’ve used two different mascaras to test it out and it doesn’t work. I’m giving it two stars because I like the like scent and texture but in terms of actually removing makeup…not even close. Didn’t take off my mascara
