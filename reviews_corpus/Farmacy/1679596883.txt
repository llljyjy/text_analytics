This formula is so strange but it works! It feels like an oil but yet doesn’t have any oil in it. I have only been applying this at night as I don’t think it will sit nicely under makeup during the day. I start by pressing it into my skin and then using a gua sha to work it in. I wake up with glowing skin! It works!
