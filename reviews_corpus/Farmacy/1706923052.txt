This serum was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I like this serum on my face at night but I LOVE it on my hands too. My hands need constant washing at work so by the end of the day theyâ€™re extremely dry and look aged. After using this they look so much smoother, less wrinkled and feel so hydrated. On my face, it leaves my skin feeling and looking smoother too. nan
