I am super lazy with taking my makeup off and usually just use wipes because I did not like using micellar water but I went on accurate and was a trying to find something less harsh for my skin that I liked. This was recommended to me by my sister and it’s literally the best it makes my skin feel very clean and smells great (and not too overpowering of a scent). It’s not a huge container but I’ve had this for a couple months now and I’m only about halfway through so it lasts a while! LOVE IT!!!
