This is total garbage. I’m seriously wondering if anyone who wrote a good review has ever used a decent cleanser before! I got this as a sample and threw it in the trash right after the first attempted use. Didn’t cleanse what so ever and left a weird film had to use a different oil cleaner, then a regular cleanser to wash this crap off, along with my makeup. terrible
