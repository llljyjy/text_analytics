The texture of this product is amazing - it’s very smooth and a bit gel like, so it doesn’t feel too thick or heavy on the skin. Yet it’s very hydrating and is able to lock in all the moisture overnight. My skin is a bit on the sensitive side, but this one does not feel irritating at all on my skin. I really like how it makes my skin hydrated, smooth and more balanced overnight. My skin is also acne-prone, and this overnight mask doesn’t break me out (maybe because niacinamide works well for acne-prone skin?). (This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for my honest reviews). works well for my acne-prone combo skin
