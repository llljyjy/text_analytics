This is the first farmacy beatuy product I’ve tried and I love the subtle honey smell because it’s not overpowering or fake. After using it I feel like my skin is hydrated and dewy which I love, my only dislike is the shape of the container because I feel like there’s potential for wasted product. A plus side is that it comes with a spatula for application. This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Good product, needs better packaging
