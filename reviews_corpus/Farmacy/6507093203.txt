As the title says, this is my favourite mask in the entire world. I use it once or twice a week and every morning I wake up and my skin is flawless. I have recommended it to many friends who have all purchased it as well and have had the same experience. I use it in place of moisturizer when I use it and I find it works best after a cleanse and retinol serum (it works great over Hyramâ€™s!). my favourite mask in the whole world
