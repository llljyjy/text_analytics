I don’t usually write reviews, but this cleansing balm is amazing! My makeup literally melts right off, and my face is left feeling smooth even after I wash it off.  I always struggled finding something that removed my mascara well enough without tugging at my eyes, but once I started using this, it’s all I ever use. I would definitely recommend this product!! Melts right off!!
