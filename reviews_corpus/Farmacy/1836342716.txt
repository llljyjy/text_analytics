LOOOOVEThis was my first cleansing balm and I’m in love! It removes makeup so well and emulsifies with water to a nice creamy consistency that is easy to wash away. Perfect first step in a double cleanse. It does seem to get in my eyes pretty easily, it doesn’t burn or anything I just don’t know if it’s great to be putting cleanser on my eyeballs? That’s the only potential negative I’ve found with this product. nan
