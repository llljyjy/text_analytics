I wanted to try “before I met you” balm and Sephora only had this brand among others. It was a lucky day without knowing it. It’s Absolutely amazing. Leaves my skin clean and suple. Last a long time and doesn’t end up smelling bad after days like other products with papaya. It’s part of my daily routine forever. Smells great. Not to expensive to break your bank and it’s worth every penny. Love it ! nan
