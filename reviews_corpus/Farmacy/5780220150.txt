Iâ€™m a fan of Farmacy and love to try there products. I can honestly say not everything is a hit with me personally. This one I really like. Some retinols make me breakout more and this one did not. I like that it has Ceramides and raspberry seed oil. It is a little pricey but worth trying it out. The texture is easy to apply. It can be a new staple retinol.  I do feel like the next morning my skin has a little extra glow. *gifted by Farmacy beauty* Really good retinol
