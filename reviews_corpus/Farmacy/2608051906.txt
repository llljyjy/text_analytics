I had gotten a sample and I ended purchasing the full size. My wallet regrets it slightly but my skin thanks me. After getting off the pill for the first time in almost 14years, my skin reacted badly. I had really bad acne and the scarring came with it. I changed my skincare routine and the mask helped smoothing my skin and with the scars. I am using retinol as well, but the night mask has helped with the hydration and the healing of my skin. it is very thick, so a little goes a long way. Worth it
