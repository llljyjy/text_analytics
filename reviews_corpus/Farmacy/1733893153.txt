This sunscreen dries down fast so you have to work it in quickly to blend it out. If you use a small amount no white cast to very minimal. If you use a lot to fully ensure your face is protected, the white cast is noticeable. If you begin to rub it too much afterwards to blend it out it will flake. I think the oily skin type individual might like this since it has more of a mattifying effect. If you have dry/textured skin like I do, this sunscreen will make it more noticeable. Love the brand but not this
