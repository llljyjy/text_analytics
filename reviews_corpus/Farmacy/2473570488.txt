This formula is actually pretty good, my skin looks brighter and texture feels improved. I know what others are referring to about the smell, but doesn’t bother me as much. The price point is a huge plus. Love that it’s a pump but this needs to be redesigned. Less than two weeks after I started using this is began leaking everywhere. Unless they fix the packaging I won’t be repurchasing. faulty pump is a dealbreaker
