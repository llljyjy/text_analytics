i donâ€™t wear a lot of makeup but this is gentle on the skin when i take off my makeup and some people said it made their eyesight a bit blurry after using it on their eyes but that was not the case with me. My sister who uses makeup more often than me used it and loved it too which made me the younger sister have to buy another one for myself seeing as she kept using it and there was not enough left for me to use after nan
