This serum is perfect for anyone who doesn’t like an oily texture to their serum. It feels like a thin gel moisturizer instead of a thick oily serum. It’s super gentle and dries down quickly. My skin is really sensitive and I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve noticed some hyperpigmentation from old breakouts starting to fade already so I’m really looking forward to long term results. Also love that this is fragrance free and the bottle is super easy to pump, very user friendly. Overall this is a great serum and such a unique texture that I really love. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Great Texture
