Farmacy Beauty 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum has been a new favorite in my morning skincare routine. I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I apply this serum in the morning right before my moisturizer and sunscreen. It has a nice smooth texture which absorbs into the skin. Also gives the skin a healthy glow. Wait a few minutes before applying your next products to avoid pilling. It states this can also be used at night, but I prefer to use only during the day. This vitamin c serum is for brightening dark spots + discoloration. Looking forward to seeing how much it continues to improve my skin texture and tone with continued use. I have already noticed how much smoother my skin has been from the first week usage. Definitely recommend! great vitamin c serum!
