I was very excited to try this waterless vitamin C formula from one of my top brands. I think those with oily skin may not like this too much as it is a bit more of an oily texture, but more of a dry oil. It does absorb but I find it better to let it sit for a few minutes before applying any other products. Itâ€™s a great working vitamin C for brightening and I do like the results of this better than Very Cherry Bright. Gifted by Farmacy. Farmacy got this right!
