This was my first time incorporating a Vitamin C serum into my daily skincare routine, gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I only apply it in the morning since I use Retinol at night. I like how it did not irritate my skin. Looking forward to see more results on longer term, especially the brightening of a few dark spots I have. nan
