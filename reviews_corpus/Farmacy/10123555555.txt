This is like a miracle serum in terms of retinols. I use it combined with the suggested products from Farmacy and it left my skin so smooth and glowy. I swear I saw a difference with just one use. I appreciate that it’s a pump dispenser and easy to work into my routine. This is definitely a new fav but I haven’t tried a Farmacy product that I don’t like. Great Serum.
