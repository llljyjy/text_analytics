I recently purchased this and loved it so much I bought another bottle. The consistency of the serum is medium and bouncy. I’m not sure about people saying it smells bad. I don’t smell anything but a faint scent of honey and it’s faint enough that I can not smell it unless I put a quarter size amount on the back of my hand and hold it up to my nose. I asked my 13 year old daughter to do a smell test for another opinion on the smell. She couldn’t smell anything but a faint smell of honey as well. I suppose if you don’t like the smell of honey it would smell badly to you. This far out performs The Ordinary. I’m not opposed to The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid but this is for us gals who need that extra love in the aging department. I had used a glycolic acid peel mask two days before using this serum for the first time and my skin was thirsty. It was looking rough no matter what I was putting on. Once using this as well as a moisturizer my skin was hydrated and continued to feel hydrated. It was glowing and I saw a noticeable difference in my fine lines and pesky vertical lines on my forehead. They were filled in and not noticeable on the skin. A favorite
