I didn’t want to love this product since it’s a little pricey and I prefer to not have the product in a pot, BUT it really is amazing. My husband is very inconsistent with skincare & this is the only thing he makes an effort to use often because we see such immediate results with the dry areas on his cheeks that his glasses irritate. It has a very faint honey smell & it comes with a magnetic metal scooper that sticks to the top of the pot. One of the few products worth buying the jumbo size! nan
