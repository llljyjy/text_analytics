Leaves my skin moisturized, Dewey, healthy and happy. Works with all my foundations. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues not even with the AHA serum from same brand which Iâ€™m so sensitive too. NO acne or sensitive skin concerns. My skin is left with a beautiful glow, looks healthy &  plumped.  I actually prefer this over my Charlotte tilbury cream . Highly recommended, will be repurchasing. Wish they made an eye cream with the Manuka honey properties to compliment one another. love it!
