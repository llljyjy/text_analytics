This product is great! It’s got a little more thickness/ squish to it than a pure face oil; I think of this more like an oily-serum. I do pair it with another moisturizer overnight, it’s not enough for me on its own, but it definitely provides the extra hydration my very dry skin needs that it doesn’t get from a moisturizer alone. I like it better than a pure oil for on top of other products because it doesn’t cause as much pilling as my oils do, and seems to absorb better. Invaluable Step in my Skincare Routine
