Good retinol for beginners or for people ith sensitive skin. I like that the formula is light and absorbs quickly. I use it every other day and itâ€™s been great especially around my chin and around the mouth area here I tend to get irritation from retinol. This one is so gentle! Plus the bottle is so cute. Gifted by farmacy. Light formula
