I have experienced it pilling off when I apply the rest of my skincare. It is not good with layering, such as applying sunscreen after. I now have painful pimples on my face. I usually do not have sensitive skin but, it did not like this moisturizer. I was excited to use but, very disappointed. I do not think it is non-pore clogging from my experience and I could not find anything on their website about it is it was non-comedogenic or not. Not What I Expectedâ€¦
