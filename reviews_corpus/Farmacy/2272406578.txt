I received this product as a complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This Wake Up Honey eye cream is made in a thicker liquid form, similar like honey. It helps skin absorb the cream fully while maintains light and not cakey. After a few days, my dark circles have improved a lot.  Many other eye creams cause tingling feel on my skin, but not this one. Love it! Lovely eye cream
