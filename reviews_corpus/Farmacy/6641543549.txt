Iâ€™ve been using this for years and it is amazing!! This is a great mask for dry skin but I think all skin types could use it without issue. Very gentle but really works and leaves you smooth and hydrated. The warming sensation is slight but I personally enjoy it. Super luxurious thick texture and it smells heavenly Gentle but powerful. Longtime love. Worth it!
