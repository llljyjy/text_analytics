Although I love loads of farmach products, this one wasn’t one of them — I have sensitive skin, and can break out easily.. I felt that an exfoliant was missing from my routine and gave this a go. It left my skin really red and blotchy.. I also would wake up with extremely greasy skin in the mornings which is really unusual for me. The smell is actually so strong, I had a hard time using it. If you can put up with the smell and can hand a strong exfoliant, you may have luck with this! Irritation station
