Kinda over rated literally- not worth 5 stars. Absolutely love this brand, actually recently switched to only purchasing productts that are clean, planet positive, all the ethical stuff, and farmacy fits the bill perfectly. That being said, I can not give up the voicemail mask from NIOD which I think is a far bbetter choice for everthing this prroduct claims to do using the same method of application. I would say it is also far more moisturizing. So so many of my core products already utilize niacinamide so this one just ended up being really pointless and really did nothing for my skin. Kinda plumped, but I really love the filling good for that over this leave-on overnight mask. So don’t get sucked in by the high rating, may not be for you. Still a great product, just not life-changing 5 stars life-changing. Also used half within 3 weeks so not really a great life span, while my NIOD just keeps on giving. Side note, I thought this would help with my redness, maybe because it was purple I just assumed, but it really didn’t soothe my skin, most other products by farmacy do though- my skin personally just really loves honey based products! Great but not amazing?
