This product was was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. First off, this sleeping did a great job at smoothing my stubborn texture after just ONE night. When I applied this product to my skin it did tingle just a little bit, so keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin! I love the texture of this mask, it feels like a very light weight, water based cream and wasnâ€™t too heavy in areas I am most oily. Overall, I would recommend this product if you are dealing with stubborn texture. Great for stubborn skin texture!
