I’m new to the retinol treatment and really wanted to give it a try! I’ve been using it for a couple weeks and followed all directions on how to start on retinol. So far I’ve noticed a brighter and firmer skin. Also my fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. I will continue to use and can’t wait to see the results in the long run! Definitely worth the hype! I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own! nan
