I needed something to help with dry winter skin but this cleanser broke me out so badly I had to return it. I stopped using it and my skin cleared but when I added it to my AM routine I broke out again with little pimples. My skin still felt a bit dry after using this, so that was interesting seeing how this is a hydrating cleanser. I wanted to love it because the ingredients seemed like a good idea and I love the cleansing balm but Clean Bee wasnâ€™t for my skin type. Not for oily skin
