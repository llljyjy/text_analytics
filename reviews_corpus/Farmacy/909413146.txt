This stuff is amazing to use year round for dry, sensitive, red skin. Sometimes I layer it over an acid (AHA) and it works just great together. My skin always wakes up looking rested and relaxed. And if its an especially rough day for my skin, Iâ€™ll wear it during the day (but never during a humid summer day- too heavy for that). a great night mask for rosacea/sensitive skin
