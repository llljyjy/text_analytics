*complimentary from Farmacy* I love Farmacy products and they work for my skin, so I am always excited about new releases. This vitamin C serum comes in a bottle with an airless pump, which is my favorite type of container. The serum itself is lightweight and absorbs into the skin well. A little goes a long way. After using this serum, my skin is left soft and glowy, and thereâ€™s no stickiness. It sits well under other skincare and makeup Great serum
