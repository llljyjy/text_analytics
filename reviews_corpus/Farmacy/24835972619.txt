I received this product complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review.RETINOL, are you incorporating this into your skincare routine yet? If your around my age, you really should be! Not only does it help with acne and acne scars, this helps skin cell turn over, prevent fine lines, wrinkles, improves skin texture and helps fades hyperpigmentation. It is literally a power house skincare ingredient.I love that this product is a retinol serum. The fact that it is a serum (versus a gel or cream) made it a lot easier to blend into my skin. I had no pilling what so ever which is a huge plus. My skin doesn’t feel irritated or dry the next morning after use. I also really like that this is fragrance free and contains ceramides to help hydrate the skin because retinol can really dry it out if you aren’t moisturizing properly. nan
