I am in love with this product which has been gifted by Farmacy Beauty.This overnight mask is INCREDIBLE!! I’ve always been a huge fan of niacinamide for my skin .It has a unique gel texture that melts into the skin like butter . It feels instantly nourishing and hydrating! Little goes long way and give my dry skin instant hydration and while it feels like an oil, it isn’t greasy or heavy feeling. It just feels me richly and deeply hydrating. In the morning, my skin feels renewed! It makes my skin feel and look so smooth! The texture of my skin is so soft and supple! There’s a really healthy glow and bounce to my skin. I noticed a huge increase in the elasticity of my skin and my skin looks so refined! must have in night time skincare routine
