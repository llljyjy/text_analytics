This was gifted to me by Farmacy in exchange for an honest review. And I, honestly, love it. I hate sticky vitamin C serums and this is not at all, it almost feels like an oil that sinks quickly into the skin. Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I have noticed my skin appearing brighter. Overall, would recommend. nan
