I really wanted to like this balm. :( I’m experiencing the same issues as others who posted here — a waxy residue that no amount of rinsing and rubbing can remove. The feel of the balm itself is luxurious on the skin, but it’s completely overshadowed by the fact that it’s impossible to remove entirely. Even with a second/third round of cleansing, nothing happens. Had potential :(
