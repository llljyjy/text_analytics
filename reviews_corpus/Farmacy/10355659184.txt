this product is great for its job. It takes off makeup easily without any excessive rubbing or irritation. The only draw back I had was that every time I use it all over my face I always breakout. I get super red under the skin pimples every single time, and I finally realize itâ€™s because the product leaves residue that clogs my pores. I double cleanse and it still manages to clog my pores. I will continue to use the product since it is a little too late to return but I will most likely only use it to take off mascara and not on my face. Not good for acne prone skin
