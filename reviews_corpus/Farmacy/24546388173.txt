To be honest, I do not usually use retinol and I have only tried a few products that contain it, so I will give my opinion on how I felt this retinol on my skin, in my opinion it is good for sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin (the other products that I tried irritated my skin) my skin is sensitive and tends to get red and inflamed when a product is very strong, this retinol is gentle and absorbs very well, I have not seen changes since I have been using it for a short time but in my opinion it is Okay!Gifted by Farmacy Beauty Great
