Right before the original mask was discontinued, I bought it, and then bought this one the day it released, and battled them head to head. I had my partner put one mask on each half of my face and he didn’t tell me which was which, and then I picked a favourite side. The new formula ended up making my face feel softer and more hydrated, which I didn’t know was possible considering the old formula was my holy grail mask. I still wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or rosacea due to the fragrance and the warming sensation, but I recommend this to everyone else. I love it! I do wish Farmacy would come out with a fragrance free version of this and the Halo Honey though. I try not to use fragrance on my face as much as possible due to my skin barrier becoming damaged at work and I hate having to set them to the side for weeks at a time. I Love The New Formula!
