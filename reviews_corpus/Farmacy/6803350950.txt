Gifted by Farmacy beauty. This product has a really unique texture. Iâ€™m so accustomed to vitamin c serums being sticky and tacky but this one is not, it almost has a dry oil feeling which is surprisingly enjoyable. The smell is a bit weird. It does smell very similar to the drink elephant vitamin C serum just not quite as strong as that one. Works well! nan
