Farmacy gifted me this serum and I want to tell you my opinion, its smell is neither good nor bad, when I apply it it penetrates the skin very well and after a few days using it you can notice the softer skin it has also helped me with some blemishes I will continue using it to see more results in general I recommend it its ingredients are very good for skin care nan
