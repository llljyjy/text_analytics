as another reviewer shared, this product’s pump leaks! i initially returned my first bottle because i thought it was faulty but this one is doing the same thing. farmacy themselves advised that this would degrade the stability of the vitamin c (besides the fact that it’s also wasting product :-(( ).   hoping they improve the packaging because i really do like this serum! great product, leaky packaging
