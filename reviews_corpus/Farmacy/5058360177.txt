I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, and Niacinamide has become one of my favorite skincare ingredients, so I couldn’t wait to try this out. Plus I needed a good sleep mask to try out. Most sleep masks are too thick and I don’t care for them, but this one soaked in nicely and didn’t leave a sticky or thick feel. My skin has been nice and soft and healthier looking since I started using it, and it’s only been a couple weeks. Definitely worth the price
