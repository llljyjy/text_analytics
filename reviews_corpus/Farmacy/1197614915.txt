This product was gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. This is hands down the most gentle but effective retinol serum I’ve tried to date. The consistency is great as it’s runny enough to spread out and rub in nicely but has enough thickness to it that it feels like it’s really coating my skin with enough to make it feel well covered. I don’t have super sensitive skin but I do find that sometimes I need to ease into a new retinol over the course of a couple weeks but this one didn’t cause any immediate side effects like irritation or dry patches. I have some very fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth that have already started to smooth out. There’s no noticeable scent and it’s not sticky on the skin. I love how it sinks in really quickly and doesn’t leave any residue that I have to worry about getting on my pillow. If retinol normally causes a lot of sensitivity on your skin I would highly recommend this one as it’s very gentle but really works great. Gentle & Effective
