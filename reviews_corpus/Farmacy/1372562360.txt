I can say this item is a very hydration moisturizer. If you have dry skin I do recommend. I have tried the face wash and I love it. Iâ€™m very sensitive and so is my daughter but for what I have notice is that this enhances the moisture in your face. The packaging is my favorite. Very elegant and useful. Love it. I recommend this for dry skin and young teens beginning  their face journey pleasing !
