I really like the light creamy texture of this Farmacy Beauty Wake Up Honey Eye Cream! I have combo skin type that is oily and dry, and this absorbs well and is super moisturizing.  My under eye are looks smoothed out and a little brighter and it enhances makeup.Some under eye creams just dry out my skin with little results. But this is exciting to apply and use. I really love most products by Farmacy Beauty! I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and my opinions are my own! Highly recommend!! A little goes a long way!
