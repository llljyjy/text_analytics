I received this product gifted by farmacy beauty and exchange for my honest review and I’m so happy to tell you this is the best vitamin C serum I’ve ever tried! Not only is the texture of this absolutely lovely on dry skin ( super hydrating and leaves the skin so glowy ) but I started seeing effects almost immediately. My skin is so much brighter and so much more even, plus this js the easiest vitamin C serum I’ve ever applied. Even though I received this bottle free for review I will continue to repurchase this as long as they make it. Most Lovely Vitamin C Serum I’ve Tried!
