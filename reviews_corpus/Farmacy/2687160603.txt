Perfect moisturizer if you’re looking for intense moisture without feeling oily/heavy. I usually put this on overnight (I wouldn’t recommend for under makeup), and feel like it keeps the moisture in my skin. It absorbs almost instantly, and has a very natural smell of honey that dissipates fairly quickly. Highly recommend this product for dry or normal skin, especially during the season where you need hydration. Hydrating Overnight Moisturizer
