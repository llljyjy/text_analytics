I love this stuff. While I don’t see many benefits from it other than calming my super dry skin (potentially my own fault, I don’t use it everyday. Plus, I’m still fairly young so not many problems to “fix”)But I can say that I got this in hopes that it would be good for daily use as I was gifted the “holy grail” serum during a stretch of medical issues that made my previously dry skin seem like an oasis of moisture. And it has not disappointed. The serum is incredible as well but easy to over do. This product is much more forgiving. I can’t see myself buying anything else! nan
