I have dry skin with some minor pimples and somewhat large pores.... this toner is incredible. It doesn’t dry out my skin, it doesn’t cause me to break out. In fact, when I use it, my pimples seem to disappear faster than if I hadn’t used it. Doesn’t smell bad either... would definitely recommend :) GET IT.
