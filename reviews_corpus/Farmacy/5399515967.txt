I was excited to try this product as it had great reviews and highlighted some great natural ingredients. I used this product for around 4 days and loved it at first. It did what it claimed and melted away my makeup quite easily and there were no residue left behind. I love the packaging of the product as they provided a spatula which made it easy to obtain the product without getting it under your fingernails. I also love the consistency of the product and how it felt on my face.After a few days of use,  I noticed that my eye area would burn whenever I applied products after. It made my eye area extremely dry and you can see that the skin is irritated, patchy and red. When my eyes are watery and tears a little, it burned the area of my eye. I did some research online and read the others have also experienced this issue and turns out some of the ingredients used in the product like Citric Acid, Citral and the essential oils can cause contact dermatitis for some. Obviously, this is not the case for everyone but I would recommend testing out a sample size to make sure your skin wonâ€™t get irritated before purchasing! Great product but may cause irritation for some!
