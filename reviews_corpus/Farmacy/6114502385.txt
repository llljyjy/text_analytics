This product is honestly garbage. EVERYTHING ive tried (and ive tried the entire line) from Farmacy is literal garbage and all marketing hype. For starters, dont even THINK about wearing makeup over this. No matter how long it sits, it never absorbs and will cause any makeup to pill. If it never absorbs, than none of the active ingredients can penetrate your skin to work; therefore, completely ineffective product. Second, after about 3 weeks, the smell completely changes to that BBQ/hot dog smell, and small bumps of product start forming in the product. I thought it was just dead skin on my face at first, but nope, the formulation just doesnt stay intact. Third, Farmacy does not do any marketing that says this will essentially be an oil. “waterless” does not have to mean a straight oil serum, ive had plenty of “waterless” products that have a better texture than this. Lastly; obviously pass on this if you dont have extremely dry skin, dont even question trying it if you’re oily at all. This is going back ASAP and i’m repurchasing my tried & true from Biossance. TRASH. Literally just an oil that does NOTHING
