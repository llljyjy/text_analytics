Sephora seems to have stopped carrying my favorite makeup remover (theyâ€™re clearing all of their Boscia inventory), so I decided to try this. It has a fun smell - nostalgic, like a green freeze pop - and application is simple. My first time using it, it removed all makeup except my stubborn eyeliner (I was wearing a cat eye); so I did a second small application. This was a mistake - please do not apply this twice to the eye area. my skin became red and sensitive, and my vision actually went a tad hazy and became more sensitive to light (this went away after putting in eye drops). Now I know that if I ever run into that problem again, just to use my regular cleanser to get the rest off. Be careful around the eyes
