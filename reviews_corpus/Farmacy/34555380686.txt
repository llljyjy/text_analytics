Wake Up Honey Eye Cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for an honest review. Regardless, I was surprised at how small the pot was, but a little has gone a long way. I’ve been using this in the morning and I see a reduction in how puffy my eyes are. I did not notice any improvement to the brightness under my eyes. I’m not puffy, but I still look a bit like a panda. Perhaps with continued use it will improve, but I am on day 10. Overall, I like Wake Up Honey but I do wish the pot were a little larger for the price. Small, Spendy, but Super
