Overall, this product is effective. After a few days of use, I noticed that my pores appeared to be smaller and I had fewer blackheads. The only problem I found with this product was that I noticed my makeup would pill if I implemented this product in my AM routine. At first I wasn’t sure if it was this toner or the sunscreen I was using, but when I stopped using this toner (finished the product) I realized my makeup no longer pilled. This toner is good to use in your night routine. Not 100% sure if it’s worth it considering it pills. If I could, I would rate this product 3.5 stars. Might pill
