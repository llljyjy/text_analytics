I don’t have dark spots, but  I do like products that brighten, and that’s exactly what this serum does! I like the consistency going on, it’s a thicker serum compared to more watery serums. It gives my skin a brightness and a glow that looks so nice, I don’t even need to add foundation if I don’t want to. Just a little concealer, and out the door. I also didn’t feel the need to apply a moisturizer after using the the serum. It does a great job at hydrating my dry skin. It didn’t break out my sensitive skin, so that’s always a plus in my book. Highly recommend trying it if you want brighter skin! This was gifted by Farmacy but my opinion is my own. My skin feels hydrated and looks brighter
