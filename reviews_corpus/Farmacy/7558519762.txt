I received this product complimentary from Farmacy. The texture of this product is really unique, it feels like a water when you pump it out but it feels like an oil on your skin. Off the bat I was immediately off put by the smell - they don’t use any fragrance so it is just the natural scent of the product but I really don’t enjoy it. I personally do not like the feel of oil products on my skin, and I found that this did not absorb very well. It left my skin tingly and itchy feeling. This was a pass for me unfortunately. nan
