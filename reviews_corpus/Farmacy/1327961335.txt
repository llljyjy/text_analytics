I have sensitive skin so it’s important for me to find serums that do what they claim, while not irritating my skin and Farmacy delivers on this.  So far I have only stuck with weekly use and I follow this serum with the Farmacy Niacinamide night mask and although I haven’t been using it long term yet, with short term use I am noticing a nice plumpness to my skin and I’m really happy to report that my skin is tolerating it easily.  It leaves no residue or stickiness, and I’m looking forward to seeing the anti-aging benefits as I keep this in my regimen.  I received this serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. Gentle enough for sensitive skin!
