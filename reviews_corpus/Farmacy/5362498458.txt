Absolutely love this serum! My skin looks much brighter and softer after only a week of using it once a day. My forehead lines are much softer and my face just looks better overall. I see a lot of people are complain about the scent but mine doesn’t really smell like anything. It has a very subtle scent to it, maybe honey, but it’s barely there. I do keep it in my mini fridge though so that may make a difference.I love it so much I went and bought a few more so I stay stocked up. I love trying new skincare products and when I find one that gives me some results, I add it to my favorites. So far, this brand has not let me down. This is my new favorite from them next to their watermelon toner, which is so good! Amazing serum
