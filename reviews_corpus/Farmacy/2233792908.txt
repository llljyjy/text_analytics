Received Honey Halo as part of my Spring Fab Fit Fun box. It has really nice ingredients, is a clean brand, and feels creamy but not heavy on he skin. It does have a significant honey smell at first, but it didn’t bother me and fades as soon as it dries down. After applying this at night, my skin is soft and supple. However, I have been using it for about a week, and every morning I wake up with a couple of whiteheads. I am 47, so acne is rarely a concern. Unfortunately, I found that this is a common complaint by others of this product. Not sure if it is the shea butter or the “vegetable oil“, but I assume one is too heavy for my face. Unfortunately have to discontinue use of this one. Nice feel, but caused breakouts
