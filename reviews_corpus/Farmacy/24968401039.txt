This product was complimentary from Farmacy. This product is the absolute cutest! I think it’s the first product I have (somehow?) with retinol in it. I’m looking forward to seeing how it will help my fine lines, as they are becoming more and more noticeable, especially under my eyes. It says to use it up to 3x per week so I will definitely be using it 3x per week. It comes in a very cute pink and white bottle with a pump. The pump works well and dispenses just a little bit at a time. It absorbs into the skin easily and doesn’t leave a residue hor a tackiness behind. The color is a yellow and there is no scent. Very nice product from Farmacy! Another Great Product from Farmacy!
