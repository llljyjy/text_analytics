ever since my favorite makeup remover was discontinued i decided to give this guy a try. first, it’s travel friendly (no need to worry about any oil spillage in your skincare bag). a little goes a long way! even though this doesn’t remove all the glue from falsies, i’m still giving it five stars because it doesn’t get messy like oils. i also like how this doesn’t have a scent! nan
