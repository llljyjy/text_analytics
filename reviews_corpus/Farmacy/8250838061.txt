I don’t normally write reviews but I just felt that I HAD too for this one. I love this so much more than other hyaluronic acids that’s I’ve tried. I don’t love the price tag but this is by far the best that I’ve tried (others are versed, inkey list, ordinary). This has a creamier consistency and has really helped those fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. The smell is very honey but I really don’t care/notice anymore. Awesome! Fantastic!
