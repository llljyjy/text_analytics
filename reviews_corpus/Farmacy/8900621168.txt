I’ve been trying this out for a while now and honestly I prefer the original Green Clean as opposed to this. It really doesn’t emulsify as well and I feel like it doesn’t really clean as well. I feel like it leaves a slight film on my skin after washing it off. I am looking forward to going back to the OG. it’s okay…
