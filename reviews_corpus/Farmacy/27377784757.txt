It’s perfect and removes makeup flawlessly and magically. I love how it feels so nice on the skin and is great. Only issue is, the application process with the “spoon“ can be a bit annoying to deal with because of the way the actual packaging is designed. I probably should be rating this product based on the product and not the packaging, but perhaps I just prefer liquids/gels I guess, but I do realize that cleansing balms are the best thing ever haha. nan
