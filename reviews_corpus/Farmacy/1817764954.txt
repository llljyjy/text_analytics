First, I love the ingredients of this serum. Farmacy Beauty does have a very peculiar scent to their products. Not a super fan of the scent but the product works great. It does leave the skin very hydrated and glowy. Iâ€™ve oily skin/acne prone skin and does not leave my skin oily or cause more breakouts. Great Serum!
