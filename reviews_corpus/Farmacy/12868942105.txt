I rarely buy products that are this expensive, but Iâ€™m not mad I did because it feels and smells amazing, and my makeup melts instantly. I do believe that there are probably cheaper options out there that would be of similar quality, but I just wanted to try this one because of the hype around it. I guess it just depends on whether you want to bother trying to find another one or if you just go with the popular and easy, but expensive option. Buy it if you don't mind spending 46$ on a product
