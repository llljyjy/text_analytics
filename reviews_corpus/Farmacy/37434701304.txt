I love the Honey Halo line from Farmacy and was very excited to try this honey eye cream. The texture is very creamy and glides easily under the eyes. It’s lighter than I expected but it’s still very hydrating and brightening. I do think it’s a small amount for the price but since you don’t need much it does go a long way.
