I was excited for this product especially since the sale was coming up, but oh my god it is so oily and not at all what I was expecting. I know it’s waterless but I didn’t expect it to feel so greasy, it wouldn’t even soak in. These reviews HAVE to be biased bc of their free product because I cannot believe anyone who says this isn’t oily. VERY GREASY
