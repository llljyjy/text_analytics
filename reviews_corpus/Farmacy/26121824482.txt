I recieved this complimentary from Farmacys Beauty. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing to your skin. It gives your skin the moisture it needs. I have such dry skin during these fall months and this moisturizer brought my dry skin back to life in just a couple days. The texture is a perfect buttery thickness that glides on smoothly on your face. The scent is so relaxing with the honey. Smells so yummy! The perfect moisturizer for day and night. Mixes well with my serums and drys quickly. nan
