I completely panned this product trying to figure out its ideal application technique. No matter what I did, after the product dried, it would begin pilling and creating small balls of waxy gel that would then fall off my face. Insult to injury: After experiencing what felt like the frog life cycle every time that I used this product- continued use left my combo skin over all drier than it was prior to use.*Mine came from BoxyCharm so there may have been formula differences. nan
