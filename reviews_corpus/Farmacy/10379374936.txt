This cleanser works so well for my skin. My skin was getting dry as I was using salicylic acid during summer/fall and I always get so stumped in winter as to why my skin is dry. So important to change our cleansers especially if you have acne prone skin like me. Bought a sample size of this and havenâ€™t tried anything else. 3 months in and my skin is so soft. Never feels dry or stripped of my natural oils but most importantly my skin feels clean. Definitely worth the buy nan
