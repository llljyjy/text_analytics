received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty to try and give my honest opinion.  I have never tried anything like this product.  I have used several vitamin C serums before but this one is very similar to an oil consistency.  Because of this I have only been wearing it in the evenings.  I would normally wear my vitamin c serums in the morning, but this one I just can’t.  I don’t think it is a bad product, I actually really like it, but I did want to mention that it is unlike most serums.  I have been wearing this product for about two weeks and have seen a difference in my skin, it is brighter. nan
