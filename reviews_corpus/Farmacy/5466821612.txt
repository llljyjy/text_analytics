This is a great retinol serum that isn’t irritating for my skin. It hydrates while providing anti-aging benefits for me. I like how lightweight it is. I’ve been using it 3 times a week at night and plan to up my usage to every night once my skin gets acclimated to it. So far my skin looks brighter and my texture looks better.
