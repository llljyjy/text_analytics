Gifted by Farmacy Beauty - I have tried what feels like every vitamin c under the sun and this one is truly unique. I hate the texture of it going onto my skin - it feels like an oil which I really try to avoid because I hate the feeling of them. It does sink into my skin quickly and easily so that takes away how I feel about the texture of it. I use vitamin c in the morning and this hasn’t caused any pilling in my makeup and layers well with my other skincare. A little goes a long way with this product so you definitely can stretch this for how expensive it is. I haven’t been using it long enough to notice a serious difference but my skin does feel lighter and brighter since using this and has not broken out. nan
