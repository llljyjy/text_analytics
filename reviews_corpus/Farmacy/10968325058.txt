I’ve been using this mask for about 2 weeks and I’ve been loving it so far!! I have oily skin and was afraid this would be too thick or sticky. It’s perfect as long as you don’t put too much on. If you put too much it will just take longer to absorb into the skin. I have not experienced any rashes or breakouts with this product. When I wake up my skin is glowing, my pores look smaller and it feels moisturized! Awesome night time mask!
