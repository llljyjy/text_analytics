This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. To start with I like the packaging of the moisturizer. It gives a rich look. Coming to its use I am not a fan of this moisturizer. The consistency is good but I feel the stickiness on my face for a long time and it doent go away. I dont like the smell of the moisturizer , it smells wierd. It makes my skin smooth though that’s a positive. But overall it’s an OK product. nan
