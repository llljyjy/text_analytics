This serum was gifted by Farmacy Beauty! I think this is a great way to introduce retinol into your skincare routine. I wouldn’t consider myself having sensitive skin, but I was afraid to use retinol at first thinking it would be too strong for me. I was able to use this multiple times a week without issue! I love how soft my skin feels the morning after using it. I’m in my late 20s so I don’t really have wrinkles yet to really test the firming and wrinkle fighting properties, but my skin seems to really like the serum so I will keep using it! Remember to use SPF in the morning! Introduce Retinol Into Your Skincare Routine!
