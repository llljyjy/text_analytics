I really love this retinol serum! It doesn’t have a strong scent, it’s very lightweight on my skin, and really helps with the fine lines and wrinkles. I also like how it’s very gentle, absorbed quickly into my skin, and includes clean ingredients. I apply this after cleansing, and before moisturizer during my night time routine, and it works so well on my oily skin. I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty, and I’m truly loving this product! Gentle and hydrating with the best ingredients!!
