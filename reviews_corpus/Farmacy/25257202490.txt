Complimentary from Farmacy beauty. I have been using this eye cream for about a week and I really like it. The consistency is not too thick like others I have used and my skin absorbs it very fast. The puffiness under my eye is less noticeable and I love the package and the color of the cream. It doesnâ€™t have a smell either and my eyes look brighter too nan
