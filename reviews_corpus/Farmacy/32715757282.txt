For people who are unfamiliar with anti-aging products or have been using them for a while but aren’t sure what to try next. Retinol is the ideal place to start, and if you’re new to anti-aging treatments, use a low percentage until you’re more experienced.I have combination acne-prone skin, so I was curious to test out the 1% retinol from Farmacy.I started with twice a week or three times a week, and I’ve moved it to every night after that. It’s safe for my skin without irritation or peeling, and it works well on me. I’m excited to see the results after a few weeks of usage.*gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
