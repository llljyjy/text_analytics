I’ve been trying a lot of different vitamin C serums and this one stands out for 2 reasons. First, it really does noticeably brighten dark spots after the first use. Second, it doesn’t have that weird vitamin C smell the other serums have. It takes a few minutes to absorb, which is expected. Overall it’s an excellent serum at a great price! I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. nan
