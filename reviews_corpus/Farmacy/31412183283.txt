This is the BEST moisturizer my skin has seen. I have acne prone skin, so it has been hard finding the perfect combo for my skin. I am a regular user of Cerave and Skin Medica products and this Honey Halo moisturizer is top tier in comparison. It is definitely heavy enough for a night time moisturizer, and I would not use it during the day if you are going to be very active, as it will make you sweaty. Top Tier!
