The best for keeping acne at bay and glowy skin! I tried the Paula’s choice one and returned it because I didn’t like it like this one and it had a weird greasy film? I’ve repurchased this and will continue to. My skin handles bha very well so I use this everyday and sometimes twice a day. Please never mess with the formula because it’s great. I would love a jumbo size because I use it so much! I haven’t noticed much difference in pores but that’s fine I mainly use it to “deep sweep” my skin lol. best for acne and glow
