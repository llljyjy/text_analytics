This is the eye cream I’ve been searching for! It’s effective at brightening and toning my undereyes but it’s gentle and doesn’t burn my eyes. I love that it’s not too thin, not too thick in its consistency because it absorbs well and doesn’t leave me with those little white bumps thicker lotions can cause. Overall I’m very happy with the performance of this undereye cream! Gifted by Farmacy beauty nan
