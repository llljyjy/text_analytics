My new favorite makeup remover! I used to use the Boscia cool cleansing oil and since Sephora doesnâ€™t carry it anymore I decided to give this a go. I love oil based makeup removers for removing mascara and brows and this one is amazing. The scent is subtle and amazing and the texture is silky and smooth. You need just a little dot to remove a full face of makeup so this tub will last a long time. Definitely recommend it! nan
