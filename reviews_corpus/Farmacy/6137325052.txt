This product was gifted by farmacy for review purposes only. I like the feeling of this product on my skin, it absorbed pretty easily. There was definitely a smell which I would not prefer. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to see any fading of my hyper pigmentation but so far I do like the formulation and texture of this. Nice serum!
