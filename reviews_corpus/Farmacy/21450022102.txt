This works but is too drying to use twice a day! It took my skin about a month to adjust to daily use, I recommend starting with a few times a week. I use this every night and have noticed an improvement in hormonal acne and scarring, as well as texture. I use niacinamide after this and then slather on a basic water based moisturizer and my skin is super happy! One bottle lasts me six months! It works and lasts forever.
