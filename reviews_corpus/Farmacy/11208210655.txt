This mask has a really beautiful, creamy, whipped texture that is super easy to apply to your face. I love that this is formulated with soothing ingredients like Panthenol and Beta-Glucan to strengthen the skin’s moisture barrier. I enjoy Niacinamide as an active ingredient, but Niacinamide is such a common and frequently used ingredient now that I’m not sure how many benefits this will have for anyone who already has Niacinamide somewhere in their routine. In addition, recently I’ve seen a lot of talk from influencer dermatologists about how Niacinamide is proven to be very effective at 5%, and increased percentages can lead to irritation without additional benefit.
