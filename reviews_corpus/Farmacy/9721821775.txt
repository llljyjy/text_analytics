In an exchange for an honest review, this product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. This eye cream is really hydrating without being too heavy, and I really like the way it feels. It definitely has improved the darkness of my under eyes, and I like putting it on in the morning to reduce puffiness. It just feels really nice, I also love the cute packaging, and it works really well under makeup. Iâ€™ve been using it for about 5 days now and I love it! Really hydrating and feels great
