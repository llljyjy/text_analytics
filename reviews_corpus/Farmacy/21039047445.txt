I always have had and will have dark circles, so I was excited to try this eye cream, it definitely helped to reduce the appearance of under eye puffiness and dark circles, it feels very soothing to the skin.  I was afraid of the effects from Vitamin C like causing redness, dry skin or irritation, but gladly I had no adverse effect by using it.Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
