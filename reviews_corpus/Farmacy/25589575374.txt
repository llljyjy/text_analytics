My first positive experience with retinol! Iâ€™ve always had irritation from retinol, until I tried this serum. Super gentle formula, yet effective and made a difference after a few uses. My skin looks and feels very hydrated, firm and the texture finally started to improve (I struggle with little bumps and clogged pores). I use it twice a week and always wear spf during the day and I really like the results so far. Highly recommend to everybody looking to incorporate retinol in their skincare routine.This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. nan
