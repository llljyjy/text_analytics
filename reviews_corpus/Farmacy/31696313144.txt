Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Compared to other eye creams I’ve used, this one is definitely on the thicker side. It feels almost like a balm (but a bit lighter) when applied around my eyes. This feels a little heavy when I apply too much, so I’d be careful about the amount used. It also has no fragrance which is great. Ultimately, if you’re looking for a nourishing eye cream I think this one is great, but I have not used it long enough to see whether or not the vitamin C in this does much. One other thing to keep in mind is that if you like to keep the inner lid on, the exposing side tends to get greasy really easily. nan
