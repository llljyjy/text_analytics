I love the lightweight consistency and how my skin soaks it up. It goes perfect with my hyaluronic acid. My skin feels hydrated and smooth. Itâ€™s so awesome that it is 10% waterless. Has a nice scent. My skin feels good and looks brightened and fresh. Great job with this vitamin c serum. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
