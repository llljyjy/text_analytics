The best toner I’ve ever used. When I’ve forgotten or gotten into a depressive episode when I don’t want to do my skincare routine, this helps get all of those days dirt out after cleansing. I have sensitive skin and will get an allergic reaction with anything containing fragrance, however this fragrance is very light and I have not personally experienced the allergic reaction I face with other toners containing added fragrances. nan
