I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I have very sensitive skin so I am always on the hunt for an effective retinol that won’t irritate my skin. This is a great option! I haven’t tested it long enough to determine any impact on aging but it does do a good job at evening out texture and taking care of blemishes. I didn’t have any dryness or burning which is always a plus when trying a new retinol. I recommend giving this one a try! nan
