Gifted by Farmacy Beauty.  I’ve incorporated this night mask as the last step of my PM skincare routine for the past 10 days.  Having normal to dry skin, I find this night mask extremely nourishing as my skin feels super soft and hydrated in the morning.  Containing ingredients to even skin tone, refine pores, restores, soothes, and recovers dull skin, this night mask has promising results and I’ve noticed mentioned benefits in just 10 days of use.
