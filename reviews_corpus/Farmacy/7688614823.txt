my skin is very sensitive to retinols and chemical exfoliants, despite using tretinoin and bha products for a while now. recently, I decided to cut out all the actives I was using and focus on a hydrating routine. so I was really excited when I received this because it looked like a gentler option to use while I focus on keeping my skin hydrated and glowy, but still wanting to use a retinol. I have found that this product is perfect for just that, and it doesn’t strip or ruin my skin barrier. 10/10 from me! this was gifted by farmacy beauty :) doesn’t strip my barrier
