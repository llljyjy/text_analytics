Nice retinol for beginners! I have sensitive skin and I haven’t noticed any irritation or increased sensitivity while using this product which is great for a retinol! It absorbs nicely into the skin and pairs well with the rest of my routine. So far the results are subtle but I can tell a difference in the radiance of my skin after using this product for two weeks. I’m excited to see the results after using for a longer period.
