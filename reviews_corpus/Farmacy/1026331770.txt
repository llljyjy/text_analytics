I have used Green Clean for years, and accidentally grabbed this one.  Decided to try it out, but does not work for me at all. Totally broke me out like a teenager! I’m 49 and acne hasn’t been an issue until I started using this. Not sure what the ingredient is that’s causing this, but will be going back to the original ASAP. Not nearly as good as Green Clean
