I am in love with this moisturizer. I have combination skin that leads more to the dry side. I’m not a fan of gel type or water based moisturizers. I prefer ones that are like a thick cream. I have used both of the drunk elephant ones because they have the texture that I desire and I honestly found that those did nothing and ran out rather fast. I love how this moisturizer comes with an applicator so that I can choose how much I want to use AND I don’t have to come into contact with the rest of it with my fingers. A little goes a LONG way with this moisturizer. Seriously. I use about the size of a pomegranate seed each time I apply. It fully blends into my face and absorbs beautifully. I’ve noticed an amazing difference in the softness and the plumpness of my face since using this. It has the slightest honey scent as well and it’s very comforting. I love this product and would totally recommended it. this is the one you’ve been looking for!
