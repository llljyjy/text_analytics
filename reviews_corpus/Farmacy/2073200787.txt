I received this product as a sample. I have only used it 2 nights in a row and can confidently say my skin is GLOWING. When I wake up, my face does feel a little “oily“ but I rinse with cold water and my face is refreshed for the day! It glides onto the skin like a dream and has no scent, which is a plus! Considering purchasing the full product of this in the future. Amazing overnight mask!
