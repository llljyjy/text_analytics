It was a complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. The texture of this cream is perfect to use around the eye area. The cream is instantly absorbed and does not feel sticky. The cream has no scent, which for me is a big plus when it comes to something to put on your face.I have been using this for a few days now and the skin under my eyes is very hydrated and shiny but not oily looking. I saw a subtle difference in my dark circles. I believe in a few more days I will see a big difference.I’m really enjoying the results and I’m looking forward to seeing the results later on. nan
