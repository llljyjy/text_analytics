My skin was very dry and I don’t normally have a problem with dry skin. This cream is very rich and creamy and is just what I needed to cream up my face. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for extreme hydration. Not greasy not too light. The scent is rich but not overpowering for my nose. Rich and creamy
