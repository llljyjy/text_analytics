This moisturizer feels nice but it’s also quite heavy. It wasn’t for me. The thickness of it doesn’t feel like it’s just sitting on your skin which is nice. I had a small breakout, little bumps on my face, nothing noticeable, I could feel it when I run my hands over my face. It smells good too but this sadly wasn’t for my skin and I never react to things so it was unfortunate nan
