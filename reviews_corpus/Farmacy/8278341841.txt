I am so obsessed with this moisturizer and the lightweight version of it. I have repurchased both twice and I do not regret it. The price point is a little high but the results are SO worth it. My skin is softer and smoother, when I wake up in the morning it looks hydrated. It has a slight honey smell but nothing overbearing whatsoever. The ingredients are so good for your skin barrier, and if you’re someone like me with skin that breaks out from everything, this is your best friend. I didn’t experience any acne from using and will continue to repurchase for healthy skin. Holy Grail
