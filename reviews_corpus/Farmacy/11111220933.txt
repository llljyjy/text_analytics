I thought I hated that I love it because it’s so expensive but considering it lasted me 5 months using 4times/week it’s not bad at all. This cleansing balm scoops likes a sorbet and does not feel super oily on the skin. The highlight is that it’s really easy to wash off as it doesn’t leave an oily layer like other cleansing balms i’ve tried. Also breaks down makeup so well the process is almost therapeutic to me lol nan
