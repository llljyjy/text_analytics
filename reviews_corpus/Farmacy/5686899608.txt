Purchased this for the first time during the holiday savings event, as I had been using Tata Harper skin products for over a year and felt that they weren’t meeting my goals of hydrated. I used this for the first time with a few other new products like the La Mer Emulsion, Treatment lotion, and Kate Somerville Goat Milk Cleanser and I couldn’t be happier. Within a few hours, I saw significant improvement in skin hydration. I love that this moisturizer doesn’t feel heavy on my face but really does deeply hydrate my skin. I highly recommend this to anyone struggling If you have dry skin, don’t skip buying this!
