This moisturizer is fantastic! I seriously have been on the hunt for a moisturizer for YEARS that worked with my dry acne prone skin that provided enough moisture but didn’t make me feel greasy or break me out. I ordered a travel size of this to try it out and I am blown away! Even with it being the summer this moisturizer does not make me greasy, yet is thick enough where I don’t wake up with flakey skin after using my retinol. I have also been adding more acids to my regimen and this moisturizer has kept my skin from going crazy and getting too irritated. I LOVE it! nan
