Can’t say enough about this product. I tried the mini version at first mainly coz I have oily skin and have bought at-least 2 large tubs since!!!. This cream melts on your skin. The subtle honey fragrance is amazing! Love the feel of the skin once it’s absorbed. I often use it as a night cream and wake up with velvety smooth skin. Overall, FANTASTIC product! Love it! Honey!
