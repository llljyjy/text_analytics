This is the cutest little eye cream! I was super happy to have gotten it gifted by Farmacy Beauty! I like how rich it is, and how gentle on my skin. It comes in an adorable honeycomb shaped package, which is well made and high quality and again, really cute! Iâ€™m not sure I saw it do much for my under eyes, but to be fair I usually struggle with puffiness and not dryness. nan
