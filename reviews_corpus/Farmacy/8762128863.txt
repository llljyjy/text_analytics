I received this vitamin c serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I’ve been using it for a little over a week in the mornings, and so far, I like it. It layers well with the other products in my skincare regimen. Its consistency is super lightweight. I like that it is fast-absorbing and doesn’t just sit on top of my skin like some other serums that I’ve tried. I was surprised that it didn’t feel sticky or oily. Also, I noticed that a little goes a long way - two pumps are more than enough. Overall, I like how this vitamin C serum feels on my skin. I haven’t used it long enough to see a drastic difference in my skin. However, I noticed that my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. I’m giving this vitamin C serum four stars because I want to see a more significant difference in my dark marks and hyperpigmentation. I’ll provide an update as soon as I finish the bottle. So Far So Good
