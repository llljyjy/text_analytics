I absolutely love this product. You don’t need to use a whole lot at all. A little goes a long way!! It melts so nicely in your hand and goes on the skin so smoothly. It really does a nice job of getting all your makeup off. I always cleanse my face after just to make sure I got everything, and there’s barely any makeup left over from using the balm. Highly recommend!! A game changer!
