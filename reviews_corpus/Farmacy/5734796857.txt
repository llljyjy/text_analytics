OMG! I’m not gonna lie or beautify how it felt. It’s truly the unique texture vitamin C serum I’ve ever tried. I tried so many serums in the past but nothing felt like it. OK. At first, the title is ’waterless’. No water? When I pump it out, it looked like a watery texture. When I applied it, it felt like straight oil. as I rub more, it hit up. It was weird but soon realized it’s ’waterless’. It didn’t finish oily. Actually, it looked pretty matte after 10 mins. I am sensitive to some vitamin C serums but my skin didn’t react with this one. I shall see if it really brightens and targets dark spots. (I gained a lot of dark spots after walking my dog in the past year.) I received it complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. WATERLESS!!
