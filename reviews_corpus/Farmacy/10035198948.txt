I like the serum a lot! The consistency isn’t as watery I thought it was going to be, and I definitely have been seeing some improvement on the fine lines on my skin, and I’ve been using it for about 4 days now. My skin js sensitive so it definitely hasn’t been breaking out my skin or anything. I’m very pleased so far*gifted by Farmacy Beauty Pretty effective so far!
