I chose the trial size of this when completing another older and immediately ordered the full size. It takes of every speck of makeup especially my mascara which I usually have to work to remove and end up with raccoon eyes despite my best effort. It smells fabulous and I love how my skin feels after washing. Makeup remover staple!
