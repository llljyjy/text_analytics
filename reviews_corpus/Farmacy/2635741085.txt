This Wake Up Honey eye cream is incredible! My dark circles have gotten worse as of late, probably because I haven’t been getting enough sleep. Since I started using this product last week, I’m noticing that my dark circles are actually diminishing and I feel a lot more confident in my bare face. I can’t believe how much brighter my under eyes look already, so I’m excited to see the long term results! To the touch, it feels as rich as a whipped body butter but once activated with your fingertips and applied, it sheers and spreads, melting right into the skin. It’s moisturizing and soothing without being too heavy under the eyes. The formula is quick drying so you could easily apply makeup overtop if applying it in the AM. Overall, I’m very pleased with this eye cream. I did receive this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, but this did not sway my opinion of the product. It’s another great product from Farmacy and their honey line! SO GOOD.
