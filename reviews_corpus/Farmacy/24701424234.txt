I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty,this starter skin set, in exchange for My honest thoughts.I had not tried their products yet,so this was the perfect opportunity. This set includes their best sellers and I can see why they have that reputation. I absolutely love all 4,but My favorite so far are the award-winning cleansing balm,which melts away even the most stubborn of make-up,and the Honey Halo moisturizer that has left My skin looking hydrated,and glowing. I am sensitive to scents,but these products are not heavily scented at all,thankfully. I will definitely being adding Farmacy to My skincare regimen now. I was Wowed by these products!
