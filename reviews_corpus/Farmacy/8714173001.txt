Just got the product last night and used evenly on clean skin. This morning, my acne scars were not as red and dark and overall complexion looks more even toned! They also included a sample of their recommended ceramide moisturizer with the serum. No irritation or redness when applied on my skin (normal type) Noticeable difference in one use!
