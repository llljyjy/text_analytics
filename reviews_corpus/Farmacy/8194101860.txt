I’m about to purchase this for a third time! I used to only use makeup wipes exclusively until I got a sample of this and have never looked back. Makeup removing balms are just so much gentler for the skin compared to wipes and it has made a significant difference in my skincare routine. And it’s also less wasteful and a little scoop goes a long way. I love the way it smells and it’s not too overpowering! Definitely a staple for me and it’s worth the price for the amount you get. A skincare staple!
