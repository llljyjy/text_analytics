Gifted by farmacy beauty in exchange for my honest review. I use it at night after washing my face a couple times a week and make sure to wear spf the morning after. It does a great job of firming fine lines for me without drying out my skin since it’s hydrating as well. It isn’t super intense, but it’s perfect for me as someone in their mid 20’s for preventative use nan
