There’s too many citrus ingredients in some of the products, specifically the cleansing balm, which can be an irritant for sensitive skin. I’m not sure why companies love to use citrus oils in their products, it’s really unnecessary. I love the Deep Sweep AHA though, it’s a bit drying of course but made my skin look great the morning after one use! Overall it’s worth the money. Amazing toner
