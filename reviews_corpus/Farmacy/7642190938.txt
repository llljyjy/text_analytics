This mask feels light but it sets on the skin almost like an oil, very moisturizing and even sticky. I donâ€™t mind it during the day, but overnight I prefer not to use it as I sleep face down lol. It lasts hours on my skin, all the while being very soothing and moisturizing. I get dry patches on my face occasionally and this mask really helps me with it. The product has no distinct smell and comes with an applicator that works quite well for applying the mask. The product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. Very moisturizing
