Feels great but it does dry out my skin, so facial oils after using this toner is a MUST. ALTHOUGH this toner does a great job removing excess dirt and leftover makeup even after my cleansing routine. My boyfriend who has sensitive and oily skin, also uses this product everyday and feels no tingly sensations. Itâ€™s cleared both our acne blemishes and continues to help us have cleaner and softer looking skin. BUY IT
