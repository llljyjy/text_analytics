The texture is oil based. Unscented in my opinion. Glides easily on to my skin. It doesn’t irritated my skin - I was able to use it for a week. My skin has been acting up so I’m taking a step back from actives. As soon as I pick it back up I’ll make sure to update the review. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty, nan
