What I love about this product is how smoothly it applies compared to other retinols, as well as how it activates overnight and slowly effects the skin. I also like how itâ€™s only a 2-3 times a week use, instead of the usual every night, so the product itself lasts a long time. Definitely a good one for those over 25 who need retinol!
