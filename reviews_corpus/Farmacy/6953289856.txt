I was recently gifted by Farmacy Beauty. The ingredients in this serum really impress me. I love that it contains quite a bit of vitamin C at 10% and also alpha Arbutin which is another great skin tone evening ingredient. This is amazing for targeting dark spots, and protecting against environmental stressors. Vitamin C is a must have for the summer time to repair and protect skin from the sun. This is a lightweight serum that soaks in quickly. I follow up with a gel moisturizer and spf and I’m loving the way my skin looks since I’ve started using this serum! Great for the summer!
