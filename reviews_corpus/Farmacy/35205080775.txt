I’m picky about anything that goes on my skin at this point, as most products I’ve tried will burn my face. Trust me, it can get bad. I’ve had reactions to tons of cleansers meant for sensitive skin, and this was the first cleanser that didn’t burn my face on contact. I love this cleanser already, big fan!! Best Cleanser For My Problem Skin!!
