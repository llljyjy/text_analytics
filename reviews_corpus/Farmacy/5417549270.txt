I have a pretty oily T-zone and had the hardest time finding a good face sunscreen that didn’t feel like it just sat on my skin and clogged my pores until I found this! It’s unscented and very light/blendable over my other skin care products and under my makeup. I wish it were just a tad more afforable compared to it’s size, but I will continue to buy regardless because I love it and it works super well for me. Highly recommend! nan
