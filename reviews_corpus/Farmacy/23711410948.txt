I have used several other Vitamin C serums and this is my favorite. The consistency is perfect - not too watery to where it instantly slides off my skin but also thin enough to quickly absorb. I can tell a noticeable difference in the brightness of my face and the packaging is sleek and easy to use! This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
