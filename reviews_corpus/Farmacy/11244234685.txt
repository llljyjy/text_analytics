I have passed by this cleansing balm for a year and have been skeptical due to balms not being my favorite method of removing makeup. However, I used this last night to take off my mascara and it was absolutely positively glorious, the way it glides over mascara is a gift I will cherish every night. Like butter my hardened mascara with a dash of water flew off, and after looking in the mirror for any left over clumps there was nothing to be found. Don’t sleep on this brand because the honey moisturizer is a knock out too! The only slight downside is for those with sensitive skin to elements like fragrance as this line is moderately perfumed. For my skin it’s not a problem. 9/10 Mascara BE GONE!
