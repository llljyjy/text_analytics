This product melts away a full face of makeup right off! I am a big fan of the cleansing balm, itâ€™s very gentle and easy on the face without lots of rubbing (like makeup remover wipes). I do still use a cleanser after using the balm to wash away any excess but to remove makeup, this balm is great. Never Using Makeup Remover Wipes Again
