The first time I used Farmacy’s Wake Up Honey Eye Cream, it was to clear up mild baggy eyes after a night of insomnia. I didn’t experience instant defuffing when applied initially as I did with my usual cream. This cream de-puffed my under eyes in about fifteen minutes. The cream is so lightweight, nourishing and hydrating. No greasy.oily, nor any residue at all. My orbital area was so smooth and soft. Concealer application was effortless with minimal blending. This is unlike my usual cream which instantly de puffed but made my eye area drier. I had to apply more concealer and blending time. With the Farmacy eye cream, just a few tiny dots of concealer and a few swipes with a brush and done.After a week of using it day and night, my under eye skin is so soft, no shadows, puffiness, and hydrated. I received the cream complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I highly recommend this cream because the tiniest amount is all that is needed for all-day and night hydration, softness and smoothness. Non-greasy,non-irritating,all-day nourishiment
