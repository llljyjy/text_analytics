When I couldn’t get this product, I tried other retinol serums and they just didn’t work for me.  This is a high dose so beginners have to take it easy while their skin gets used to the retinol.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  If you are new to retinol, just follow the directions about slowly integrating into your routine. Best retinol!
