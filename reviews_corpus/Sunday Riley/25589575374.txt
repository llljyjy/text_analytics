I love Sunday Riley products and was super happy to try this one! If you’re struggling with dull, uneven skin tone and dryness - this is the product that you need.  Vitamin C really does wonders on the skin and even after the first use it looks fresh, glowing and vibrant. It’s a little too moisturizing for an oily skin, so I use it at night! Overall, I’ll give it a good 4 stars! nan
