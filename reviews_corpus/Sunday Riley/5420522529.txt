I have been using Afterglow for a week and I love the immediate glow it provides. The yellow hue of this moisturizer instantly gives some radiance to my skin. I have combination skin and so I was a bit worried that it would be too oily for my T-zone but this formula definitely does not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky and sinks in well. I love the balanced hydration that it provides and I also enjoy the texture of this cream as it almost feels like a gel. I would say this is definitely a plus as it is not easy for my combination skin to adapt easily to moisturizers. I have not noticed any changes to my skinâ€™s texture but I look forward to seeing more results with more usage. Immediate radiance, great for combination skin!
