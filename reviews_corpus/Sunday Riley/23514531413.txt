Wow! I love Sunday Riley so I was Super excited to try this new vitamin C cream out! The packaging is stunning and I love that it comes with a little spatula to apply the cream as well. I’ve noticed my skin has a nice glow to it after using this product. I really like the texture and consistency of it, my only complaint is that I don’t necessarily love the smell. It’s just very strong and potent of vitamin c, if that makes sense! I would recommend this product though :) nan
