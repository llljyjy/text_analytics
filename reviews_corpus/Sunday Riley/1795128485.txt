Loving this new B3 serum by Sunday Riley. I tend to have sensitive skin with redness and do suffer from sunspots. After using this new serum for two weeks, I noticed a few things. First of all, the serum was gentle and non-irritating. After application, my skin texture felt smoother and plumped, well nourished and hydrated. I noticed a significant improvement in oil production and overall redness. The formula is very nice, great list of ingredients, and overall a great product. I do wish that this product was affordable to continue to purchase. This sample was complimentary from Sunday Riley Sensitive skin approved
