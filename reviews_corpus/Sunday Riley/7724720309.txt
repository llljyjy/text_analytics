Been using this cream for more than two weeks and my skin feels more glowy and more hydrated. It helped with few dark spots that I noticed been faded. It gets absorbed fast into the skin and leaves my skin so soft and smooth. Highly recommend if you are looking for a new moisturizer to try. Gifted by Sunday Riley but this review is based on my own personal use of this moisturizer. Effective Moisturizer
