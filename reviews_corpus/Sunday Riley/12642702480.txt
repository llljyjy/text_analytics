To be totally honest, I tried this cream for 1 week and I wanted to say that this is the BEST vitamin c moisturizer I have ever tried! Most do not hydrate my dry skin as I need but this keeps my skin so hydrated and seriously plumps it out! I’m seeing some of my weird dark spots starting to lighten already which is crazy good! It soaks in and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth not sticking. After applying I usually use sunscreen.  It seems like it’s an all-in-one, plumping my wrinkles, lightening dark spots, and hydrating so well! good
