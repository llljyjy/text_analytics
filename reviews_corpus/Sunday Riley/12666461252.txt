I’m obsessed with this! I have used the CEO oil and the CEO Glow before, but this is perfect for my combo oily skin! Like the CEO Glow moisturizer, this is a little thicker than your traditional cream. I love that it is a thick gel cream because it gives intense hydration without making your skin feel heavy or shiny. It’s the perfect healthy glow and I don’t look like a mess at the end of the day. Skin radiance and brightness appearance definitely went up! And I would definitely recommend this for people with combo skin! Amazing for Combo Skin—Glow on!
