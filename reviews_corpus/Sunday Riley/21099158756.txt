Giving this 5 stars because honestly deserves it even though I think its outrageously overpriced. this literally smells exactly like strong ginseng, so right away I loved it just for that. I really only tried it once before needing to review, because after I woke up this morning the acne scars on my chin are literally half as dark as when I went to bed last night. an IMMEDIATE difference. This product works! and really really well. Im not sure I would buy this again at the full sized product, but if i ever see it again in a skincare pack (i got a mini) i would snatch that up in a heartbeat. I really love this. expensive but works!
