I am a huge fan of niacinamide so I was extremely excited when I found out Sunday Riley was coming out with a niacinamide serum. I used this product for about two weeks and definitely noticed my skin tone looked more even, specially post acne dark spots. It did help with enlarged pores, too. I will continue to used it, and I recommend it for sure! Gifted by Sunday Riley. New holy grail!
