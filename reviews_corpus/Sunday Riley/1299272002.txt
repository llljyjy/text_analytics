So I finally caved  and purchased this vitamin C serum. The last vitamin C serum I used was the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, it was good but it made me get red rashes on my skin, so I had to stop using it. I love this Sunday Riley Vitamin C serum, so far my skin has not reacted to it, if I just wear this under my moisturizer, it brightens my face instantly and I have received comments about how nice my skin is looking and I have only been using this for a few days! Excited to keep using and seeing how it makes my skin look in the long term. nan
