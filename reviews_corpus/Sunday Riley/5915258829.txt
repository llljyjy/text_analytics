I’ve been using this for about a week and so far here’s what I love: THE SMELL! It smells like a luxurious spa experience right at home. THE FEEL! It really feels extremely moisturizing without feeling heavy on the skin, it sinks in and feels hydrating. THE LOOK! I love the way it makes my skin look, very radiant and glowy, like I just had a facial done. I can’t wait to keep using it to see if there are any long term results. Loving it so far!
