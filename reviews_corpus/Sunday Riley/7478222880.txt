I really wanna like this moisturizer as I’ve really liked other Sunday Riley products, but this one smells wayyy too strong! The smell is not that pleasant, but I can handle that. It’s how strong it is that I find myself not using it. If you’re sensitive to scents and fragrances, stay away from this one! Sunday Riley, please make this product but without the scent, thank you! The smell is a nope!!
