I have so many nice things to say about  this serum. This was my first product by Sunday Riley I’ve ever tried, and I was really excited just opening the packaged how lavish and beautiful the product was. The serum went on my skin so smooth, and left my skin feeling super glowy. I could tell my pores right away were looking less visible. Such a great product and I can’t wait to try more from this line! As luxurious as it looks
