I have gotten a sample of this product using my reward points a while ago. I wanted to love this so badly, my skin doesn’t seem to mind it and I have combo oily skin however I just cannot get past the smell it’s awful. The smell down right ruins it for me, not sure if it has to do with the turmeric but it’s nasty. Horrible smell
