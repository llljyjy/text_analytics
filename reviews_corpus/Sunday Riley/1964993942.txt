I’ve been using this new cream for about a week now and wow is my skin radiant! This gives me that healthy “I got a full night of sleep” look and I look so dewy. The texture is almost pudding-like and you don’t need much to get a great effect. Another winner from Sunday Riley! No irritation or issues either (sometimes vitamin C can be too much for me). Glowing, healthy skin!
