I was so excited to try this but was sorely disappointed. This is truly the worst skincare product I have ever used. It absolutely stinks. People describe it as “earthy” but it’s horrible. You don’t get used to it. It is extremely greasy and doesn’t absorb. I have super dry skin and this was like smearing oily sticky goo on. If this had done something amazing for my skin I could at least give it some credit. But I used almost the whole bottle and never saw any difference. Except the oily ness did make me break out. And I had to wash anything that touched my face because it stunk so bad. You cannot put this on and leave your house. It reeks even from a distance!! actually the worst product I’ve ever used
