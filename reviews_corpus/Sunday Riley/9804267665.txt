First thing is the packaging which is super cute and beautiful and then the smell, it’s amazing and refreshing perfect for morning skincare routine. Love to put it on after serum makes my skin hydrated and glowing. It’s not oily and not sticky at all which I love. I use it as primer too. Totally recommend it. Super hydrating
