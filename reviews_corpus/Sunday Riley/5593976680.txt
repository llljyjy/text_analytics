Bought the full size after trying the sample for a few weeks. For some reason, the sample was wonderful to use and I saw a difference but the full size fell flat. So far I’ve used half the bottle on my combo sensitive skin and it’s done nothing for the stubborn flaky skin on my forehead - no exfoliation at all. Whereas, I’ve used the Farmacy aha/bha exfoliator for a week and I already see a massive difference. Will not be repurchasing or recommending. Did Nothing
