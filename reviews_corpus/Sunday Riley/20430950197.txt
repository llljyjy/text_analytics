I’ve honestly never tried a facial oil before, so I was really intrigued to incorporate it into my skincare routine. I’ve tried Sunday Riley products before so I had high expectations -- and I wasn’t disappointed! This gave me an extra glow and elevated my skin’s appearance with some extra hydration. Absorbs really well and not greasy at all once it settles into the skin. nan
