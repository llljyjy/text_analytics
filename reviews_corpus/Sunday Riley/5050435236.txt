So I this product is 50/50 for me. It does make my skin look noticeably brighter, more hydrated, and have a healthy radiance that is hard to achieve in the winter. The downside is that every time I use it breaks me out. There is a stronger scent but dissipates quickly. The texture is nice and thick, absorbs quickly, but you do feel a slight tingle when you first put it on. Not in a bad or uncomfortable way but you definitely feel something happening so if your skin is sensitive that might be an issue.  Gifted by Sunday Riley 50/50
