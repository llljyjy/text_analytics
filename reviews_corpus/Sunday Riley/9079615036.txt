I received this C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream complimentary from Sunday Riley to try and review. The first thing I noticed was the adorable little scoop that comes with this face cream.  I no longer have to stick my fingers into the jar and get it under my nails!  Then I noticed the scent, it is a light and fresh, natural scent.  The cream itself is light weight and it absorbed really quickly and wears under my makeup beautifully.  I have oily skin, so I was pleasantly surprised that it didnâ€™t have my face looking oily all day. Smells amazing and absorbs quickly
