I’m a huge fan of Sunday Riley and swear by their products. I was thrilled to try this new serum from them and let me tell you it has not disappointed. After using it for a couple of weeks, I’m already noticing some great results to my skin. It’s helped cut down the amount of oil on my face around my t-zone. I’ve noticed that some of my dark spots and redness has begun to fade as well, giving me a more even tone. Plus my face just feels smoother and softer to the touch. This serum gives me a beautiful,  bright, and healthy looking glow. I use it twice a day, and don’t plan on stopping. I will continue to use it in my skincare routine. Another win for Sunday Riley!! Loving my results!
