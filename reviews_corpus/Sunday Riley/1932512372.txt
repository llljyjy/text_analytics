I received this product complimentary from Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review. I have previously loved CEO Serum and was excited to try the cream format. The vitamin C in this is strong and effective just like the serum thanks to the stable form of vitamin C used, THD ascorbate. I noticed that my skin appeared smoother and more uniformly radiant after one week of use, though I had a few patches that were sensitized from the strength of the cream. The cream is fairly strong and so more sensitive skin types may want to limit using other actives and use a high spf sunscreen when using this. nan
