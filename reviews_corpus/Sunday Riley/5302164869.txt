I was gifted by Sunday Riley their new Sunday Riley C.E.O Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream  and it is definitely my new favorite lightweight moisturizer. After just a few uses my skin already feels more hydrated and smoother. I love how it has blue light protecting antioxidants and that the Vitamind C improves dullness and firmness. My skin is glows all day after applying it. I highly recommend to anyone with dry or sensitive skin. nan
