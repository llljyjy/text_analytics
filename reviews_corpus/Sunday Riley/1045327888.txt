To be fair, this face oil could be the best performing face oil on the market.  Iâ€™ll never know because the stench was just too much for me.  I got a sample bottle with one of my Sephora orders and was excited to try it.  Maybe I got an old bottle or a bad batch because this smelled exactly like a bucket of dead fish that had been sitting in the sun all day.  I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but my family used to go fishing at the lake a lot when I was little, and this smells exactly like dead fish on the beach... same scent.  How on earth are people using this?? No idea if this works.... smell gagged me!!
