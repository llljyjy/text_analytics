This Sunday Riley serum has been a new favorite in my collection of skin care. I’ve used ‘the ordinary’ niacinamide for a while & I ran out but this was a great replacement. The packaging looked so cheek and matched the price *giggles* but I honestly loved it. My skin didn’t feel tacky after use and my dark spots continued to minimize with this product. Hydration is key during this winter & my face felt great even before adding moisturizer to my skin . This was gifted by Sunday Riley in return for my honest review Sunday Riley
