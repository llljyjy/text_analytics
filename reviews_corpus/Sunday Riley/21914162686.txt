Sunday Riley is one of my absolute favorite brands for skincare. I now added this C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream to my routine.It is so lightweight! It’s perfect for my oily skin, even on hot, humid days. It brightens my skin and keeps it hydrated with the hyaluronic acid without creating an oily or creamy film. Just supple, glowing skin.The vitamin c is gentle and doesn’t cause me any redness or irritation. I highly recommend it! Supple, glowing skin
