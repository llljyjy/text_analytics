Terrible eye cream. I don’t have sensitive skin at all and my skin is used to abs tolerant of retinol. However, this stuff made my under eyes burn!!! I now have a rash under one eye after using this product 4 times. I would not recommend. It’s overpriced junk and I think most of these reviews are fake. Bad reaction
