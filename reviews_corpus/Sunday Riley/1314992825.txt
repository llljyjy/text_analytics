I’m absolutely in love with this cream and the results are amazing! My skin feels more hydrated, moisturized, my skin texture has improved and my skin is overall more radiant! It absorbs well with a creamy formula that is not greasy. It’s got a high strength vitamin C strength that definitely leaves your skin brighter, more radiant and glowing all while evening out my skin tone. It’s very hydrating which is great and and I love that my skin also feels firmer as well after using this cream! I also love that it’s got antioxidants too as another plus to it. Overall my skin is glowing and I love this and am obsessed! Glowing skin!
