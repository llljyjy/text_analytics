My first Sunday Riley product & it did not disappoint! The pictures are about 3 weeks apart, with the addition of this moisturizer one week ago. My skin is noticeably more hydrated & plump especially around my drier areas (nose & mouth). With that I’ve seen my dark spots fade a lot quicker because I have a bomb exfoliating routine, in addition to hydrating serums & C.E.O Afterglow turned it up a notch. The pictures speak for themselves but I can confidently say my skin looks & feels brighter, plus the texture is significantly improved! I’ve noticed my dry skin’s key to recovery is to hydrate & keeping it simple - this cream is both of those things & I’m very happy!! ALSO, the little spoon is so cute & keeps my the product untouched / extra clean. C.E.O of the glow!
