Niacinamide is my favorite active ingredient. It has many benefits for the skin, including regulating sebum production and reducing pigmentation, among others. This one particular is amazing. Just after a week in can tell the difference in my skin. Oil is less thick and therefore less pimples, skin tone becomes more clear and even. Love it nan
