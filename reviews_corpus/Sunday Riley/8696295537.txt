I really wanted to like this product. For the high price you’re paying, you do get a luxurious experience with it from the packaging to the pump mechanism to the fragrance and to the way it sits on your skin. If you check out the advertisement on Sunday Riley’s YouTube, you’ll see the model has a very nice, soft, glowy effect to her skin and it’s NOT a filter! My skin really did look like that whenever I used this serum. Because of that, I like the product. But after emptying it out and using it as directed (+ with sunscreen), this serum has done nothing for my dark spots. Gonna have shopper’s remorse over this one for the next few weeks just because of how much I paid for it only for it to do nothing for me. Beautiful but Ineffective
