This cream is just perfect for my aging dull skin. It helps to brighten my skin tone and provides my skin with antioxidants and natural collagen. I use a small amount of the cream after cleaning my skin and massage it gently into my skin with my fingertips. It goes on so smoothly and it is absorbed fast. It has such a wonderful nice lightweight texture with a beautiful yellow color. It has a pleasant citrus scent that is not too overpowering. It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated and feels light on my skin with a satin finish. It has no greasy or sticky feeling. My skin is instantly looking more radiant and has a more luminous complexion. This is a wonderful cream that I have added to my daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it! Hydrates my skin with a beautiful radiant glow
