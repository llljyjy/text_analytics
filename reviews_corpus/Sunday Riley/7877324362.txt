I really like this product, I have used 2 sets of sample size. A little bit goes a long way and the product really helps decrease the look of darkness under my eyes. I really like that it is more like a moisturizer than a makeup concealer for under eyes. I absolutely recommend this product and am going to buy the full size. nan
