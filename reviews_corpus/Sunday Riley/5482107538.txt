So far, so good! The bottle is thick glass, which makes it feel for luxurious. The oil itself feels really hydrating on my skin (sensitive/dry with rosacea. I’ve been using it every morning and haven’t broken out. The only warning I would have is the smell… I appreciate that it doesn’t have any added fragrance because I have sensitive skin, but the smell isn’t great. It doesn’t linger or anything once I continue my skincare/makeup routine, but when you first apply it, it kind of smells like earthy dirt. Other than that, it’s a great product! Supergood Superfood
