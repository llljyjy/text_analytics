Haven’t used this for a full week yet or put it on my face as my skin barrier is slightly compromised from an allergic reaction I had with another product :( however, this serum has the most stable version of vitamin c, so I’m super excited to see how it works on my skin. I would also say to patch test this out first before applying to your face as vitamin c can be a bit tricky for sensitive skin! :)) Love the form of vitamin c in this !
