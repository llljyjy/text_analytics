Iâ€™m so excited to try this product but it does nothing to my skin and brought flakes and breakout to my skin, it is just a moisturizer and does a little hydration, not glow at all, feels a little bit greasy when I applied it on my skin, definitely not worth 65 bucks Greasy, Flakes and Breakout, DO NOT BUY
