I don’t know if I got a bad one or something but it’s very grainy? Like when I massage into the skin I can feel grains as if it’s exfoliating my skin. I would compare the texture of the product to the tatcha rice cleanser where you have to add water to it. It’s very weird and for the price my skin wasn’t moisturized very well. I asked one of the Sephora girls to help me find something very hydrating for the under eye area and she told me about this. Tried with the under eye area and did not work so I tried the entire face and nope. So try it because everyone will have a different experience as for mine I will not purchase this ever. Grainy texture.
