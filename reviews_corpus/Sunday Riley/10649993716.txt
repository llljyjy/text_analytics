I can’t love this serum enough. It’s so lightweight once applied on the skin. I love the purple texture. Usually, my pores are a sore eye for me and really bother me. My skin gets irritated easily when I’m having breakouts which happen a lot, since using this serum I’ve seen a reduction in those breakouts and irritations. This makes my skin so soft and smooth. My pores look more refined. I love that it leaves my skin looking radiant and more youthful too! I love how this has refined my pores!
