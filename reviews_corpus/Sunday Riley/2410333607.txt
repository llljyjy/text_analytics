This is a good eye cream. What people fail to realize is that it has retinol in it so yes, it can cause some dryness at first when you’re skin is getting used to the product. ESPECIALLY if you’ve never used a retinol before. It’s meant to be used at night based on the ingredients. I use a moisturizing eye cream during the day time. If your goal is to help with fine lines and discoloration give this one a shot but you gotta use it for at least 3 weeks to notice a difference. it’s a retinol product
