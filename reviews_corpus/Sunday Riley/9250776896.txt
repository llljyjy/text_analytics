I have sensitive skin and a lot of vitamin c products can be very hit or miss for me, especially moisturizers- theyâ€™re typically super lightweight and oftentimes sticky. I really like how hydrating and nourishing this SR cream was, it had a beautiful texture and my skin loved the formula. The packaging is stunning so the unboxing experience alone felt like a treat, and this really helped me feel like my skin was brighter and hydrated. Pretty packaging; nourishing formula
