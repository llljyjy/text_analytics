Originally got this in the go to bed with me set and used it all up. Bought the full size bottle and am still having great results. I have very acne prone skin and this mist somehow seems to help keep everything in check. Iâ€™ve noticed less breakouts, better hydration/moisture retention and better texture overall. I apply every morning after washing to a dry face. I let it soak in for a minute or 2 and then apply moisturizer. nan
