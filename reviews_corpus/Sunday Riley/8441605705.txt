I wanted to try this duo for a while and am so glad that I did. Iâ€™ve tried The Ordinary retinol and lactic acid in the past. Both of those products from The Ordinary made me breakout, so I was hesitant about spending the extra money for the same category of products, but these have done wonders for my skin. I use both products at night; I apply the Luna serum first and then wait a few minutes to apply the Good Genes, as indicated by the directions provided with the products. Then I apply my regular moisturizer over both products. I only apply the Good Genes product in the morning, first thing after I wash my face or get out of the shower. I wake up with clear, bright, moisturized skin. Throughout the day I feel like my skin is getting an extra layer of moisture. Great combo of products that is easy on skin!
