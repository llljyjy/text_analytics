Where to start...... This Luna oil SAVED MY SKIN from the bumps, irritation and acne that I received from wearing a mask over the past couple of years. This Sleeping Night Oil is perfect for all skin types (even oily). I have oily skin and have come to notice that my skin does not get as oily through out the day. I love the fact that I am getting my does of Retinol to prevent and improve signs of aging. The Retinol in this product does not cause irritation on the skin. This oil sinks beautifully into the skin and does not sit on top of the skin. Luna Sleeping Night Oil is perfect for those that want to introduce Retinol into their skincare routine! Highly recommend! Try this oil at night with UFO oil during the day if you have problem skin! Luna + UFO = BFF
