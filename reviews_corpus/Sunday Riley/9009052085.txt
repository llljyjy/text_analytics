Only used it for 2 weeks, but my skins looked the best it has in a while. Never used such a fast acting product before. This product had to have been extra good because I was extremely busy during this period and usually my skin suffers when I’m stressed (acne flare ups, darker looking hyperpigmentation, overall bad complexion), but the past two weeks was the complete opposite. My skin visibly is brighter. I don’t have dry skin (oily/combination) so I can’t say whether it’s done anything for me on the hydration front, but for brightening (especially my hyperpigmentation and complexion concerns), and this product really really hits the mark for me. nan
