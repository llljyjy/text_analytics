I’ve been using this day and night and noticed a huge brightening effect in my complexion. The product does have a bit of a strong scent - I would compare it to tumeric. If you don’t mind natural smelling products, it shouldn’t be an issue but just something to be aware of. It does leave my face with a bit of an orange tint that fades quickly and honestly I don’t mind, it helps with the brightening and evening of my skin tone. It’s a great hydrator and does not pill under makeup at all! nan
