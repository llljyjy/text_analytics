I’ve been using this product for a week now and I’m so in love! I’ve always been a huge fan of vitamin C products because I have scarring from old acne, but most vitamin C containing moisturizers out there are heavy and break me out. This formula is very forgiving on the skin, very lightweight so it can wear well under makeup, and it also works wonderful as an overnight mask. It has a pleasant smell and the application tool is great for keeping your hands out of the container and off your face. Highly recommend! I’m excited to see how it works long term Moisturizing, versatile add to any skin regimen
