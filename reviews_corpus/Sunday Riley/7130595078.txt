This new 10% Niacinamide Serum is so good! The texture is thin and watery. But it’s so incredibly hydrating with bout leaving any sticky or tacky feeling to your skin. It’s loaded with great ingredients as well. I’ve definitely noticed more hydrated skin, lightening in pigmentation and my pores look much smaller. Overall, my skin looks so much healthier since I’ve included this serum into my skincare routine! Highly recommend! An absolute must have in my routine!
