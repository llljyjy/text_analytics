I have been using this newest SR launch for some time now and i canâ€™t stress enough how impressed I am with the level of hydration it provides while making my skin soft, and looking brighter more even-toned and texture overall smoother. Love love love the Vitamin c and this one really works magic! One of the best daytime moisturizers I have ever tried. My skin is dehydrated with fine lines and some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and this has made my skin overall improve! Vitamin C of your dreams
