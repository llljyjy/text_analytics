Pricy, but it does help a lot with my post acne. Also provides with good moisture, I personally do no apply moisturizer after I use this, since I have a combo skin.Brightened my dark spots and give a nice glow( you just need to wait about 10-15 min after applying it, so it would stop being sticky. Also, if you are looking to buy it, but in a biggest size, that way you get the most of product, packaging is better in the biggest version. works great for post acne dark spots
