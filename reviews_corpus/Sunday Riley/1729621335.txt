I used this after a bad experience with Korres Rose Oil. The rose oil FILLED my pores. It was not good and I felt like pored looked more noticeable. I switched to this oil and the results were vastly different. First, this helps my face stay smooth without filling my pores. Second, it never feels heavy on my face. It also mixes well with cream moisturizers. I mix with the Fresh moisturizing bomb and my face feels ten times more hydrated and smoother. No more flaking skin. helped my skin issues
