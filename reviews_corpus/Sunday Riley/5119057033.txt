As far as face oils go, I really love this as an addition to my skincare routine. It’s super lightweight, absorbs instantly and does not leave you feeling sticky or greasy. The scent is very light compared to other products I’ve used with turmeric which I appreciate. My skin looks a lot more glowing and vibrant, and I’ve noticed a more even texture after around 3 weeks. Lovely face oil with great scent and texture
