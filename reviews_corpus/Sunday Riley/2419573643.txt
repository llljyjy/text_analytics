I have combination skin with dark spots/hyperpigmentation and this is my favorite face oil EVER. I love the scent, packaging, and noticeable glow I receive when using this product. I have been using the CEO glow oil for just about a year now and my dark spots have definitely gotten lighter. I don’t wear makeup and i’m a teacher, so my face has a habit of looking VERY tired in the morning. this oil helps to wake my skin up every morning and make me feel glowing before I start my day. I use it day and night, and a little goes a long way! I was terrified of committing to this product when I first got it last year due to the price point, but i’m so glad I took the plunge! it gives me the glass skin look and it lasts/doesn’t make me look greasy like cheaper oils can do. go-to face oil
