I received a CEO Serum gifted by Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest opinion. I had very high hopes for this CEO Serum, but unfortunately it did not mesh well with my skin. I found it to feel too oily and I broke out. I continued to apply it to my skin in hopes that my skin just needed to be more time to get use to the serum, but it still didn’t sit well on my skin. I did love the smoothness and easy application of the product. There is a light scent to the serum, which I liked very much. I didn’t notice any positive changes to my skin. It was not what I expected
