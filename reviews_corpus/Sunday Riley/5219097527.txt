I think the CEO Glow could have some better results than I anticipated. I was super excited to receive this product as I’ve always wanted to try out Sunday Riley products. Face oils, in general, are supposed to be applied AFTER moisturizer to really lock in that hydration. The product notes to just use in the am/pm after washing your face. I was skeptical because I felt like there should have been more guidance on that. Is it a serum? Is it a face oil? Is it a moisturizer? Is it all in one?? I’ve tried it all the ways and steps in my routine to learn that I liked the CEO glow face oil as my last step on my skin care routine. Using it as a moisturizer is a close second. Because this has vitamin c in it- I keep a look out for brightness results. Since I use this over night I have to check in on the results in the morning… I my skin is definitely bright and supple! I don’t hate this face oil but I also don’t love it. By the way, if you’re not family with turmeric and the distinct smell, this may not be for you. I was expecting the standard “citrus” smell, but this is definitely heavy on the turmeric! So, beware! The smell sticks and of course it’s on your face so that will be all that you’re smelling for a while. I’m very familiar with the scent, I don’t have that big of a problem with it. nan
