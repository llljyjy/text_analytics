This stuff is magic. It’s pricey but my bottle has lasted a very long time. I use it alongside a serum and follow with a moisturizer usually in the daytime. I switch it around with a retinol treatment and it has worked wonders. I am in my late 30s and have always had breakout prone skin no matter what I do and this seems to be the magic bullet for me. It’s helping with texture issues and scarring and I’ve definitely seen my skin plump and lines reduced. For me it’s been a win. It’s a pricey risk but get the smaller size and just try it! If you get these kinds of results with problem skin like mine, it’s worth trying! nan
