If you are buying this product for deep cystic acne that happen around your period, save your money. this did not help my cystic/hormonal bumps which is the reason I purchased it. A store brand cream would have given the same affect. nothing special. I feel it helps with mild acne but that too you could have a found a cheaper option like pimple paste from Inn Beauty(that too is no miracle for cystic/hormonal bumps). It does have a herbal smell but I liked the smell. All in all I was underwhelmed by the product. Underwhelmed
