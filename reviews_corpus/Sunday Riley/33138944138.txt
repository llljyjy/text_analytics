I received a sample of this and knew after the first day I had to order it.  I have used a lot of acids and serums, but this one blows me away.  My skin was almost immediately brighter and smoother.  I have problem skin but have hopes that with continued use (along with my other favorite serums) my skin will continue to improve.  For those with sensitive skin, although I can feel it after the application it has never burned my skin, left it red or dried it out. A must have for brighter smoother skin
