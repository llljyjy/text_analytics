My skin has changed a lot throughout the past years. I personally as of now struggle with comedones. I was acne prone as a teenager and have gained clear skin through birth control as well as spironolactone. Still looking for something to get rid of these comedones. Using this was very good for comedones considering it dries out those follicles that way the excess oil and sebum will be prevented from clogging a pore. However, if you struggle with dry skin do not use this. Unless you are applying pure aloe vera and coconut oil on your face 3 times a day this is not the product for you. My nose started peeling and flaking after 2 days of using it. I only applied it once each 2 nights. So I started using the JUNO face oil each night and the U.F.O. some mornings, which definitely worked in my favor. I used to struggle with oily skin but with the spironolactone it has definitely taken away those oils. If you also use another acne treatment definitely do not do this because that can cause irritation and a reaction. If you struggle with pores, acne, and have oily skin then i definitely recommend this product. Definitely not good for normal or sensitive skin either. good for oily not for dry
