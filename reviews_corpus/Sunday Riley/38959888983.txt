I am actually so impressed with the quality of this new product from Sunday Riley. I love how good my skin feels after applying this to my face after washing. It helps with my acne marks and keeps my oiliness at bay. It also says my skin and keeps it from getting red. My texture looks smooth and clearer. I also loved that the bottle and drop are both made of glass. Skin soothing!
