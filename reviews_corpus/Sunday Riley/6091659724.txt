I’ve been using this serum for a bit now and I have to say I truly love it! First of all it’s not sticky at all and there is no smell which I appreciate . It feels really smooth and hydrating on the skin . It’s helped diminish the look of my pores , enhance my overall radiance and fade the look of my post acne healing marks . All in all I absolutely love this stuff and I will be keeping it in my daily routine . Worth every penny!
