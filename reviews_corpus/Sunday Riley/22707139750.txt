I wanted to try this product for a long time, so when I finally purchased it a few months ago, I couldn’t wait to incorporate it into my routine.  I was underwhelmed, to be honest.  I noticed no benefit or change in my skin, despite its cost and overall brand reputation.  I will not purchase again and don’t recommend it only because, at least in my experience (I used the entire bottle before reviewing here) using it was inconsequential to my skin. For the price, I expect some benefit, however I might as well have been spritzing pink water on my face.  It’s too bad because I really wanted to like this.  If I were to point out a silver lining, it would be that it did not upset my extremely sensitive and reactive skin.  That’s always a bonus. Underwhelming Pink Water
