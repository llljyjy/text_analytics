I have used this product before, it is amazing when it comes to brightening your skin. I love that it has natural ingredients, it makes me feel better about using a product as a routine. That being said my skin feels smoother after a one month use. I did notice some pigmentation changes in a good way. Great in your daily routine, plus it is hydrating. Great in your routine!
