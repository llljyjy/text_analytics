Ok first things first with this moisturizer - man is it orange!! I was afraid it was going to stain my nails but luckily it didnâ€™t. I will also say it is heavily fragranced, not necessarily artificial fragrance but you need to enjoy fragrance in skincare in order to enjoy this product. As with all Sunday Riley skincare though, it feels so luxurious and really brightens my skin. nan
