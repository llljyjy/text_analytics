My main skin concern is dryness, and redness and I love how this serum has really improved the appearance of redness. I usually use a color corrector in the morning, but I have realized I have been using it less and less every time as this serum is truly improving my skin!! Sunday Rilee gifted me this serum and my skin texture also feels more smooth, and the niacinamide in it helps with overall hydration! Itâ€™s a 10/10 for me! nan
