This product made my eyes sensitive to touch at first and slightly peel. I do use every night for past 2 months, so I’ve built a tolerance to it. I’m giving 4 a area because the packaging split open! I’ve never been rough with it or squeeze much, but still had to wrap it in tape. I’ll probably purchase again once it’s finished unless I find a slightly cheaper price for something equally as good. nan
