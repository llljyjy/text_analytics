When I saw Sunday Riley came out with a new product it was a must try! I am so happy with how this Vitamin C cream has improved my skin. My skin looks brighter but also so clear. I had red spots on my cheeks from being fair skin and within a week they went away. The product smells so good and feels moisturizing, applying it twice a day. I am 28 with fairly dry skin so this helped me not feel ‘chapped’ all day long. It gives my skin a dewy look which I love. nan
