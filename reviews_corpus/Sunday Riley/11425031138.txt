I love the packaging of this product! I’ve used it for a couple of days now and I love how moisturized my skin feels through out the day. It’s also helped with the texture and redness of my skin. You can use it during your day skin routine or your night routine. It has a pleasant smell too, nothing too overpowering which I personally enjoy. nan
