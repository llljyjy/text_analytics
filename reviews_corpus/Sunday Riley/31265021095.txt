Sunday Riley has been my absolute favorite brand for so very long. It never dissapoints. I adore this amazing serum. It reduced the oil on my skin, reduced the redness and reduced my dark spots. Such good quality potent serum this is and I could not love it more. The packaging is so luxurous as it comes in a beautiful box. The bottle is so sturdy and it’s made out of glass. Such nice product. The consistency is lightweight. It doesn’t clog the pores and it actually absorbs so fast. Such a nice product.  It feels very luxurious on my skin. My skin is transformed since I started to use this product. It also worth to note that I have sensitive skin but I haven’t experienced irriation of any kind either. This serum worked really well. It’s nourishing and hydrating. I couldn’t love it more! Highly reccomend. nan
