For reference, I have oily, acne rosacea prone skin that I’ve managed pretty well these past few years with minimal breakouts. My skin LOVES this stuff, I haven’t noticed any related breakouts and this stuff’s so thick and perfect for winter time. my skin despite being oily felt dehydrated and this stuff is great for that In love
