I bought this hoping it would improve some hyperpigmentation on the side of my face, but after getting halfway through the bottle, I’m not seeing any difference at all - no improvement in the hyperpigmentation, no improvement to fine lines, and no import cement in my skin overall. It’s very expensive for a product that doesn’t seem to be doing much, so I don’t think I’ll be purchasing it again after I run out. Meh
