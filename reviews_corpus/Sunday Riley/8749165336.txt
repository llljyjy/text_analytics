Gifted by Sunday Riley. The results of this cream are an excellent daily moisturizer. I also feel like my skin was less tight and around the temples looked like less visibly tight and tense. It is comparable to a rich daily moisturizer and I highly appreciate the tumeric as a skin calming ingredient.  I personally like this better on days when I wear a lot of skin care or minimal make up, my skin look plum and dewy, thatâ€™s just too illuminated to cover up.  I really like pairing this cream with CEO glow at night as well. The scent is so unique and excellently earthy.  The applicator is great to have, it assists with correct portions and keeps your fingers out of the tub. Excellent Moisturizer
