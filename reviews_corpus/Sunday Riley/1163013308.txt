I love the luxurious texture and fresh citrusy scent of this product. Goes on beautifully, sinks into skin without any residual stickiness. However I find it to be a milder vitamin c option. Several options are more effective. I use this as my winter vitamin c when my skin is drier and more sensitive. most luxurious vitamin c, but a milder option
