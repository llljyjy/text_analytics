I’ve been trying out the C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream and so far I am loving it! My skin is loving all of the hydration, brightness, and radiance this cream is giving. My skin feels so smooth after using it too! I’m definitely seeing improvements and it’s only been 1 week! Amazing for my skin!
