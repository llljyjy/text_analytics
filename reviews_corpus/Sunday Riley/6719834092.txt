After using up the whole sample bottle I had of this, I realized I needed to purchase a full size because I love it so much. My skin is dry and always flaky even after moisturizing, but when I use this oil it helps keep the dry skin on my face at bay and keep my skin smooth. I will say I have never liked the smell, but it doesnâ€™t bother me enough to not use. nan
