Love love love! Purchased 0.5 oz last summer and I repurchased more a week ago. A little goes a long way.  I apply after my serums and may follow up with a tiny amount of moisturizer. Moisturizer isnâ€™t needed and I prefer to use just the oil right before skin better+ science time smart compact and my skin looks healthy and natural. For a more dramatic look I just apply my bars foundation after. great for mature skin!
