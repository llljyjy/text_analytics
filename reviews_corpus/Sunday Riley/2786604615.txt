This water-based serum supercharged with trans-resveratrol, claims to reduce the look of pore size, surface redness, and blotchy tone. I’ve been using it a few times thus far and feel like it helps against impurities and breakouts. It stings a little bit on my skin but it’s totally doable. Liking it a lot so far! nan
