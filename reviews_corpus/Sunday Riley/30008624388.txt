This is a lovely moisturizer! This is actually the first time Iâ€™ve tried a moisturizer with vitamin c in it, and I really enjoyed it. It felt silky and hydrating on my skin, and I definitely noticed that my complexion looked smoother and brighter after a few days of using it. I also liked the spa-like scent. *I received this complimentary from Sunday Riley to try and review Left my skin soft and bright and smooth!
