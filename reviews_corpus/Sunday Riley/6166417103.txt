This is my savior nightcream. I have extremely dry skin and this leaves my skin feeling bouncy and soft when I wake up in the morning.It is very thick and very intense moisturizer so I wouldn’t recommend it for day time use. Unless you don’t plan on applying any makeup products on top of it. Saves my super dry skin
