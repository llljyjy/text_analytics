I received a complimentary CEO Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream from Sunday Riley. This couldn’t have come at a better time as I had recently been dealing with tons of acne scars that needed to be cleared up. However, after about 12 days of use I do not see a major change in brightening or lightening of scars. The smell of the product is very floral and the texture is super rich. I will be sure to finish the product and share more once it’s an empty, sometimes I takes longer to see results, but the texture of my skin definitely feels softer and hydrated. Floral Vibes
