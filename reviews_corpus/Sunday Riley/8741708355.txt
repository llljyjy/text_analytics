I recently started using this vitamin C and so far I’m really liking it! I have combination/acne-prone skin and I love how lightweight this oil feels. It layers well with the rest of my skincare and gives my skin a healthy glow without feeling greasy. My skin overall feels more hydrated and looks brighter. I’m hoping it will also help fade my post-acne hyperpigmentation with continued use. Gifted by brand. Love it!
