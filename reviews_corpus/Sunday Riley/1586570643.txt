I love using Sunday Riley B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide serum! I use it in the morning after my moisturizer and it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. I don’t wear foundation, so this product is the last product I put on my face. I’ve noticed that my skin feels soft, it looks smoother, it helps minimize my fine and deep wrinkles. I haven’t noticed any oiliness, however, since I’m not wearing foundation or powder, it does leave my skin looking shiny - especially my forehead, but I don’t mind it that much. What I love most is that this product locks in and keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. Most (if not all) moisturizers tend to wear off after a couple of hours when I use it alone. B3 Nice is REALLY Nice!
