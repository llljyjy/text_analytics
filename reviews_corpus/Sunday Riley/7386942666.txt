I had a bunch of samples to use of this before buying the full size, so I already knew I loved it before spending so much! More of a moisturizer feel than a serum, it is hydrating and gives a lovely glow. I have very sensitive skin and haven’t had any issues. It pairs well with my other skincare steps. Also, the packaging is awesome. It’s a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. I will be a repeat buyer! A Must Have
