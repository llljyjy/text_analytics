I do love the fact this is a water based serum. The reason I say that because for my skin 10% niacinamide ingredient is very strong straight on especially as a serum step. This hasn’t caused any irritation or issue with my dry acne prone skin. I’ve been testing it on on small spots where dark spots have a hard time disappearing and I’ve def noticed some slight improvements in a short time period. nan
