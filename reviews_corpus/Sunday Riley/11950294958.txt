I received this product complementary from Sunday Riley in exchange for my genuine review, so here it is — I have only been using this for a little over a week now, so I haven’t seen much in terms of long-term benefits, however my skin does look noticeably less dull/brighter. I would not say this face oil is fast-absorbing (a little goes a long way - if I uses more than 5 drops on my face/neck, it ends up looking a little bit too glowy for my personal liking. I have dry skin that usually drinks up face oils, so that is something to keep in mind). Even though it is not made with any synthetic fragrances, it still has a strong turmeric/botanical-like aroma too it that you will either enjoy or adamantly dislike. The smell stick around for a bit after applying - I actually enjoy it, although I could see some people having issues with it. I might recommend getting to smaller size to try out before committing to the larger $80 size - just to make sure it is something that works well for you. I feel like this would be best-suited for individual with non-sensitive normal to dry skin types. Brightens But Has A Turmeric/Botanical-Like Smell
