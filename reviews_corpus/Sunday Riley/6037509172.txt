I’m currently breastfeeding so I’ve been sticking to the same clean products I have been using since I was pregnant, and I decided to try a different face oil, but ever since I tried this oil on the back of my hand at Sephora it ended up irritating my skin by the time I got home. I disregarded it probably thinking it could’ve been that the tester was bad but ever since my husband spotted some random red rashes throughout my body like down my leg and again on my hand they come n go nothing serious I hope so I’ll just return it. Not sure what’s going on but other reviews seem to have experienced irritation. The oil smells very earthy and it’s of thick consistency so a little goes a long way and it comes in a cute bottle. I really wanted to love it but unfortunately it won’t work for me I’ll have to go back to my honey grail. nan
