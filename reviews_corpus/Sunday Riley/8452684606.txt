This is the first vit C serum Iâ€™ve ever loved. My favourite thing about it is the thin yet creamy consistency. When I put it on after a morning shower my skin literally drinks it. Being a lighter serum it works so well as the first layer in the morning. I follow it with a hyaluoronic acid serum then moisturizer and my skin has literally never looked better. nan
