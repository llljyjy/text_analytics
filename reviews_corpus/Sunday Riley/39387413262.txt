Purchased this in store, used one pump a day for one week and it’s gone.  I suspect they swapped the tester out and put the empty bottle back in the package.  Don’t have my receipt anymore so I’m out $80.  Buyer beware. This is not the first time this has happened to me at this Pickerington OH location, only before it was through Kohls directly. Thought it would be different since they upgraded to Sephora but it’s not. They are selling empty bottles
