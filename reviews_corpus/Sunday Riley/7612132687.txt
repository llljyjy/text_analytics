I love this brand but this product will not be repurchased. I used it 2 nights in a row. Application was amazing and the product sank in beautifully. However the second day when I applied my day eye cream it burned! I decided to take a break on the product and wear my usual night cream and it burned too. My conclusion is that 5 stars has made my eye area super sensitive and I am not comfortable with that. By the way, I have used retinol eye cream before and did not have this effect. burning under eye area
