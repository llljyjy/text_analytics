I love applying this glowy, hydrating moisturizer from Sunday Riley in the morning time as it feels very lightweight on! It’s definitely glowy but non-greasy :) Its got a gel cream consistency to it that suits my combo skin nicely! It hydrates nicely, makes skin feel soft, and after a week of consistent use I do notice a few of my discolorations lighten a bit! I’m optimistic that with continuous use this moisturizer will overall brighten, even out skin tone and firm skins appearance even more, which I’m looking forward to! Btw, it’s got a strong smell to it so people with a sensitive nose might not enjoy it. Other than that, it’s a great product! Brightens and hydrates!
