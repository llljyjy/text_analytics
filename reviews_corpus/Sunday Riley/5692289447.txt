I bought this when it was half off so even though I wanted to return it because I immediately wasn’t impressed, I figured I’d be patient and look for results after a couple months of use.CEO is a decent moisturizer but the brightening benefits of vitamin C were just not noticeable. I would not repurchase. Meh, so not worth the price
