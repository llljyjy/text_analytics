I recently got a jar of Sunday Riley’s newest product in the CEO line - C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream, and I am so happy with this cream!! I started using it 6 days ago, twice a day, and I can already see a noticeable difference. My freckles, the absolute bane of my existence, have lightened until they can be easily hidden with just a tinted moisturizer, and my acne scars have almost completely vanished. Afterglow’s combination of Vitamin C, natural collagen, and antioxidants plumped and brightened my skin to the extent my gown daughters asked me what I have been using. As I said, a noticeable difference in just 6 days. I will continue to use this brightening cream in conjunction with my normal routine, as I am absolutely thrilled with my results so far. Best Vitamin C cream I have ever used!
