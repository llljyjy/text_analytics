I was a bit hesitant and worried to try this with my type 2 rosacea skin, but I figured that since it has blue tansy in it which my skin seems to like I would give it a try. I’m glad I did! I haven’t had any issues with sensitivity, and this has made my pores smaller, and gotten rid of the blackheads on my nose and near my nostrils. Not too oily or heavy in my opinion, it’s a rather light oil. I’ve been putting this under my “Good Genes” and I have to say I’m obsessed! Doesn’t bother my sensitive skin!
