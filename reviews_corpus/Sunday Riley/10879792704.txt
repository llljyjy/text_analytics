Sunday riley goes beyond their productsâ€™ packaging. The cream is in a gorgerous glass jar which feels quite heavy while holding it in the hands. The jar is packed in the carton box that can be opened by lifting it from top. There is also a spatula for picking up/ applying the cream. It also feels very comfortable to hold and use. the texture of the cream feels very buttery and smooth. the scent is so earthy and heavenly. it reminds me jasmine or osmanthus. the scent feels very herbal in the beginning while applying it, but after absorbing into skin it turns in a very elegant and lightweight scent. the finish of the cream is satin without oiliness or greasiness. i believe this moisturizer will work as a good daytime cream for combo and oily skin. although the texture feels heavy at first, but it spreads and applies effortlessly. i applied only a toner under this cream and my skin didnt feel dry or tight. it brings enough hydration to my skin. i would recommend applying it in a small amount first and gradually adding more if you feel like adding more otherwise it can pill elegant jasmine scent, satin finish, not oily
