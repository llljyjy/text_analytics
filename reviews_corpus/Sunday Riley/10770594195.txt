Makes my face much smoother after applying this for a week. My nose area always had a bit of texture. I tried using retinols even tretinoin, but other than making my skin dry, they never seem to be as effective as this good genes. I have repurchased this over 3 times and tried the Ordinary dupe lactic acid 10%. BUT sadly it doesnâ€™t work as well as good genes, so will be restocking this whenever my last bottle runs out. nan
