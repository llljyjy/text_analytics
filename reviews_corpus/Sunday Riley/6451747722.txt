This was gifted to me by Sunday Riley for my honest review. I have loved a lot from the brand, so I was eager to dry this one out. I didnâ€™t love their other vitamin c cream, because it felt sticky and rained tacky on the skin. I like that this one feels so much creamier and makes my skin so soft. I do notice a different in the brightness of my skin too! Nice, but pricey!
