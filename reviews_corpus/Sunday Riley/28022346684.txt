This is best for experienced retinol users, I really enjoy it for closer to my under eyes when I’m doing .025% tret on the rest of my face. I would caution people to only try a couple times a week, this isn’t a nightly product. I can understand how people would struggle with this. I’d recommend starting with something more gentle if you haven’t used a strong retinoid before! This will take time for your skin to acclimate to. I have not experienced any sensitivity or dryness but I have been using tretinoin every other day for over a year, so my skin is used to it.  The texture of this is beautiful, it looks and feels very similar to a custard like in a fruit tart. The emollient quality feels exceptionally nice applying to the skin, and the applicator feels nice and cool. There’s a bit of thickness to it, like a hybrid between a gel and a cream, but it’s not overly occlusive in a way that would cause milia, in my experience. It feels slightly hydrating, very moisturizing and absorbs beautifully. It has helped quickly resolve small breakouts I’ve been dealing with near my eyes. This would be best for someone trying to target fine lines, wrinkles, and breakouts in the under eye area. It is a bit pricey, but I thought it was a well formulated product Best for experienced retinol users
