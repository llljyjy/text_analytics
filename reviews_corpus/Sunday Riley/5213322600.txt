I got this as a free sample when I spent a certain amount on one of my Sephora orders. I tried it just for fun, it’s not something I would have ever picked out at the store. I ended up being really impressed with the results, even after one use. Pores appeared smaller, my oiliness was decreased, and redness decreased, and it calms down my acne. For me, it works well with my Paula’s Choice benzoyl peroxide treatment. I ended up buying the half ounce bottle. I never spend this much on skincare but I was that impressed. Try a sample if you can! Wow
