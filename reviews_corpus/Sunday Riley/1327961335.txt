Neroli is my absolute favorite scent so applying this is heavenly, and I love the texture of the cream, it soaks in and leaves a lovely non shiny glow.  Usually I find Vitamin C creams have a sticky post application feel, but not this one, it actually makes my skin feel soft and smooth. My short term results have shown a boost of hydration and a smoothness to the texture of my skin, Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the long term benefits from this product as well! nan
