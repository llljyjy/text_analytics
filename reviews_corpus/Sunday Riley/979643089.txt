Bought this product after a strong recommendation from an employee at the store. Used it a few times and each time my skin was burning and peeling. Not to mention super dry after using this only a handful of times. I honestly think this is the worst product ever. Save your money - clearly a lot of these reviews were from people who received free product. Very fishy that this product has a 5 star review - just consider before purchasing especially if you have sensitive skin. Worst product ever
