I was gifted this product in exchange for an honest review. I love the texture - itâ€™s thick but blends into skin so easily. It has a strong yellow tint that blends into skin as well. It has a fairly strong citrus scent but this dissipates when applied to the skin. Comes in a beautiful glass jar with a spatula! Luxury Face Cream!
