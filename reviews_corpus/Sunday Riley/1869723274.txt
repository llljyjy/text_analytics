I never would have tried this if I hadn’t received a bunch of samples of it, and I’m so glad I did. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin that is super difficult to treat because most products cause a reaction on my face. In the past, vitamin c products have been the worst culprits of irritation, burning and dermatitis for me. I thought my skin just hated it and it wasn’t an ingredient I could use. Well on the sample it said it’s a gentle and stable form on vit c so I tried it. LOVE IT. I love the texture, it’s super hydrating and the glow is REAL. The smell is so pleasant, smells like a orange dreamsicle- but it’s very light and doesn’t linger. Absolutely zero burn, sting, tingles or anything. Again I have super super sensitive, reactive skin and have never been able to use vit c. No pilling either! And to my surprise, it took away two very stubborn, massive zits on my face after one day (AM and PM use). I had been doing everything I could for a week to get rid of them. My acne is hormonal so it really responded to the anti inflammatory properties in this product. Truthfully, I’ve been so exhausted and frustrated with my skin that I swore I was done with Sephora skin care and was going to start working with a professional. So truly I’m so impressed and am excited to see my results after long term use. blown away
