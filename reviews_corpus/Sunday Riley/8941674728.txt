I love this B-3 Nice 10% Niacinamide serum!I like to use Niacinamide in the mornings because of the brightening effect so my face looks more awake throughout the day. I don’t have particularly oily skin but I do have combination skin and my T-zone can be a little problematic, which this serum helps with the excessive production of oil.I have also seen a difference in my post acne/blemishes spots, as they go from looking very red and irritated to almost dissipate in the two weeks that I have been using this product. See before and after pictures! My skin looks brighter, smoother and more even.Overall I am really enjoying this serum. I use it daily, it layers well underneath a moisturizer and a sunscreen without pilling, absorbs quickly and doesn’t pill or leave any residue! Great for the AM!
