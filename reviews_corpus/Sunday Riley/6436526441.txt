I am a huge fan of Sunday Riley products so I was very excited when I sent their new  C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Moisturizer to test and review. I haven’t had a lot of time with yet, but I like what I am seeing! This moisturizer makes my skin look and feel hydrated - plus, it gives you a nice glow! I’ve added it to my AM routine since it makes my face look instantly more radiant. A New Hit
