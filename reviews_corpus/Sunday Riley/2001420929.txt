I was gifted by Sunday Riley to try this awesome serum for an honest review. Iâ€™ve been using it for about a week already and I can see a clear difference in the brightness and hydration in my skin. The formula is nice and lightweight. It soaks into the skin really nice and cleanly without leaving a greasy feeling. The scent is light and natural. I really love how luminous it makes my skin and how hydrated it feels all day. Definitely recommend. Lovely Luminosity!
