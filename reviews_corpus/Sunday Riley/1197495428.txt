Wow tried a sample with my points and I loved it. I was searching for another C since DE changed their formula. This is amazing and moisturizing. It absorbs in nicely. I canâ€™t say what is is that makes my face glow, but it does. Feels so refreshed and looks that way after apply my moisturizer. Makeup applies well. I purchased a bottle to continue using. Costly but having sensitive skin I stick with what I can. This is working and I love it. Great effect on my skin!
