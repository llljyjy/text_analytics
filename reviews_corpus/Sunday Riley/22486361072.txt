Not as good as their lactic acid. I didn’t see as much improvement in my skin as I would have hoped and I did have really high hopes after loving the Good Genes serum as much as I do. Didn’t break me out or cause irritation which is why I am still giving this a pretty high score because the formulation is really stable and feels luxurious on the skin. I am usually sensitive to Vitamin C so the fact that this at least felt nice is a big deal to me. In terms of visible results perhaps I was expecting more for the price point. It's fine not a wow
