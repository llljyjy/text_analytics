Right after I started using this product my skin definitely has started looking more hydrated, clearer, and more plump. I’m not sure what it is about this product but it just feels right in my routine, like a missing step I didn’t even know was missing. It’s been working harmoniously with my other products and I’ve yet to see any adverse effects. I try new products all the time and I fully expected to hate this product or have it be a one and done but this is definitely getting added as a staple in my routine. I hope one day they make a bigger size! Unexpected holy grail
