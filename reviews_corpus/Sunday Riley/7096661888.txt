This CEO Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Cream is packed with 5 key ingredients to help brighten, hydrate, and leave your skin feeling glowy. It comes in a huge glass jar with a double ended spatula, one flat side for scooping and the other side has a ball tip for applying under the eyes. It has a pleasant floral fragrance which may be irritating for some, but on my combination/normal skin it doesn’t! It leaves my skin with a nice glow too. I’ve been using this for a week now and although it hasn’t yet visibly brightened my skin, it seriously helps hydrate & give my skin that glow. Definitely helps with skin radiance for sure! Would recommend this for dry/combo skin types. nan
