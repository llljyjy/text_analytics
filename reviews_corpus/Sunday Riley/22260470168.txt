I’ve been using the new B3 nice 10% niacinamide serum for 2 weeks and I’m absolutely loving the results. I have very sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skin with really annoying PIH. This serum has faded my PIH acne spots (not deep enough to be scars but deep enough to have lasted about a month post breakout) and helped sooo much with overall redness and evening of my skin! A little pricey but a little goes a long with with the product so I know this will last me for a months and months, so the price is completely worth it. amazing for PIH and sensitive, acne prone skin!
