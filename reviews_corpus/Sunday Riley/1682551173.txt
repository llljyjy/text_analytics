I have been using C.E.O.  Afterglow for over a week now and I’m loving the results! I’ve used some other Sunday Riley products in the past and fell in love - this addition to the lineup is no exception! It hydrates my skin without feeling greasy and has made my skin glowy and radiant in the process. I do feel like the vitamin C has helped reduce some of the hyperpigmentation I have. The packaging is elegant and beautiful on my bathroom counter and I love the included spatula to keep things hygienic. The scent it heavily aloe-forward which isn’t my absolute favorite, but the results speak for themselves and the scent dissipates quickly. The color is this bright beautiful yellow mango shade that makes me so happy to see each morning! I can’t wait to see how my skin looks once I get to the bottom of the jar. nan
