This is such an awesome moisturizer that really does brighten up the skin. I have some very noticeable dark spots but ever since I started using this I have started to see them fade some. I also have took notice how the redness in my skin is looking less and the texture of my skin is looking more smoothed out and not so there anymore. I have holes in my face from past acne popping and I can say those holes are starting to fill in just a bit as well. I like this moisturizer and how it keeps me dewy and just well hydrated as well its a good one. Soo happy with my results so far! A great one!
