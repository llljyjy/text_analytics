Can you really ever go wrong with Sunday Riley? The answer is no. I have access oil on my nose which causes my pores to look huge and seem very uneven. I have noticed my skin is more even and pores are smaller on my nose. I also have a dark spot on my eye brow and it looks lighter. I havenâ€™t noticed anything with my redness, but I bet that is coming soon. Smaller pores are a go!
