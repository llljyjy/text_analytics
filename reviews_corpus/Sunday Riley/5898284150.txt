I love glass packaging, it always makes an expensive skincare product more of an experience. I can’t be the only one that feels this way lol. This is scented but it doesn’t linger on the skin. I loveeee brightening oil so this is a perfect alternative bc I prefer to use lotion under my makeup. The texture is thick but it does an excellent job of observing into the skin. Thick but absorbent
