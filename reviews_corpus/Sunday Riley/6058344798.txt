This oil is very lightweight and has a runny texture. You only need so little of the product. It definitely makes my skin smoother and brighter, especially over time, however, I don’t find this product to be as fast absorbing as it claims. In fact, I can only use it at night because if I use it during the day it makes my face too shiny. I can only use it in the morning on days I stay home and don’t wear make up. I don’t find the smell of this oil too strong overpowering. Really love the packaging as well and how easy it is to control the amount of product you want to use. makes skin radiant
