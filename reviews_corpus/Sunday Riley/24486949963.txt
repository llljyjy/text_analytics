My skin already feels so much more moisturized and hydrated after using this product for just a week. It looks plumper right away after use and I’ve already noticed some visible reduction in old acne marks healing too making my skin look brighter and more vibrant. I also feel like my skin is softer and smoother as well. Overall it feels really great on my skin and dries down beautifully so I’m really excited to keep using it to see the longer term results.
