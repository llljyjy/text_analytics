I really loved this serum. Absorbs quickly into my skin and from the beginning I can feel it is working through my skin to fade away any imperfections. The morning after I always wakeup with a glowy face. The only thing I always keep in mind  is not using it every night as my skin gets irritated and my pores become more visible the day after. Twice a week is a routine that worked best for me with this product. nan
