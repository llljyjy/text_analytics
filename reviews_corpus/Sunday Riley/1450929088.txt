I’ve been using this been using this face oil for a little over a week and wow! I’m a huge fan of the brand and have tried a few other products so I was super excited to add this oil into my regimen. Overall I was blown away by the results after using for such a short amount of time. I live in Houston, TX where the weather has been cool + warm over the past week and this oil helped keep my skin hydrated. I noticed in the before + after pics (added below) that my skin appeared brighter, more radiant and dare I say a beautiful glow. I received a compliment from my coworker today about how good my skin looked and I have to attribute it to this oil since it was the only change in my skincare routine. Not a huge fan of the smell, though it does dissipate after a short time period, so if you have a sensitivity to scents you should be fine. But all in all this oil delivers and I would definitely recommend. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. The Name Says It All
