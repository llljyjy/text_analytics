I am a big fan of Sunday Riley-- its most of my skin care routine and I loved adding this to my routine! It has great ingredients and its water based which is my preference for when I use my electro current facial machine! It has changed the appearance of my post Acne dark spots ( ivâ€™e used for 4 weeks now) -- I definitely see the difference!!! if you have post acne darkness this is for you
