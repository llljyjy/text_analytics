I purchased a sample with my points and I absolutely love it!! It’s glides on and seeps right into my pores. It’s so light and keeps my skin moisturized. I really enjoy the smell as well. I noticed a difference in my overall skin tone with consistent use. My skin looks and feels great! I’m still working on combating my PIH but in my before and after photo you can tell my complexion looks more even and “glows.” I highly recommend. I will be purchasing the full size bottle since it’s a must in my AM routine! I love it!
