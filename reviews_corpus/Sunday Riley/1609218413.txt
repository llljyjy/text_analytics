I’ve been testing Sunday Riley’s CEO Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C cream and so far, so good. This cream is bright orange and has a light gel texture. It smells like turmeric that has been covered up by a faint perfume, and it did stain my headband a little orange so especially at night be careful of applying this cream and laying right down. It never stained my bedding so it seems to dry fast. Anyway, my skin is very reactive to skincare (I break out like 70% of the time I introduce a new product) and after about a week there were no signs of the painful cystic acne that always seems to come with introducing a new moisturizer. I love that I’m getting a good dose of Vitamin C with no irritation or breakouts. nan
