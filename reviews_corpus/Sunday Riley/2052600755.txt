So vitamin c has been a huge help to my complexion for years but this really made a difference! I love the soft citrus scent but if you don’t like that fair warning. It’s light weight, absorbs fast and is perfect for a daytime moisturizer! I haven’t tried using this at night but will start because of my oily  tzone. I prefer lighter night cream during the summer. I wish the price wasn’t so steep but it makes sense. You see a nice glow through out the day and it’s heavenly! Excellent glow results!
