I am a long-time fan of Sunday Riley, so I was thrilled to finally try the C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Moisturizer! I love the CEO oil and serum already, so this was a natural progression to add the cream. This product claims to brighten and reduce dullness from the skin. It is a little too soon for me to speak on any long-term effects, but I love the texture and feel of this cream on the skin. It plays wonderfully with my other skincare products, and I had no issues with pilling or dryness. There is a light earthy scent, but it is not bothersome to me. I love the thick texture and I feel it is helping to rejuvenate my skin already. Bring on the glow! Glow Baby, Glow!
