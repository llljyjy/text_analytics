Sunday Riley makes some of the best skincare products around & this one is no different! The B3 Nice serum has done wonders for my skin! I have a tendency to get redness on my cheeks & after using this for 2 weeks I’ve seen a dramatic improvement! The redness has calmed down, the darker spots on my face have faded & my skin has become less oily. This stuff is so lightweight on your skin you can’t even tell it’s on but it goes straight to work! My skin also appears smoother & more balanced in general. This stuff has been a lifesaver for me! If you’re prone to redness I highly recommend this serum! Holy Grail!
