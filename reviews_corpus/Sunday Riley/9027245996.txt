One of the most gorgeous creams created. This is like the C.E.O Rich Hydration Cream’s sister. It’s a lighter gel-cream version that is perfect as a daytime moisturizer for my combo skin. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated, plump, bouncy, and perfectly prepped for makeup. The deep golden color is gorgeous and the refreshing scent makes applying this a special experience. I feel like my skin is much more even in tone after using this and it’s not as red and splotchy. I have acne-prone skin and this hasn’t irritated it at all. I’m in love! Absolutely Stunning Cream
