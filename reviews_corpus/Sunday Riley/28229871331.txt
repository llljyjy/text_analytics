I give 2 stars because I was initially excited about all the ceramides and ingredients but holy guac, after about a week of using this daily my sensitive skin got bright red and hot! My opinion is probably a reaction to one of the many extracts that, again, imo are unnecessary in the first place. Do not recommend for sensitive skin and wish I hadn’t thrown away the receipt so I could return. It’s not cheap! Definitely not for sensitive skin!
