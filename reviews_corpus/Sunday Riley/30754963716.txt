SR has been faking their reviews and I really just wanted to hate this oil  and just return this and get my money back . But I gave it a one night try , I woke up to glowing baby soft face , my skin drank the oil, the blue pigment wasn’t even a big deal It did not make me look like a smurfette . I’m two weeks into this nightly oil routine and my face looks even toned brighter pores diminished my overall skin looks polished and just so great  . I have never used retinol , this is my first and I have no redness no irritation no purge nothing . Hate to admit I love this oil and I’ll be buying again . and again . Minus one star for the steep price . hate to love this
