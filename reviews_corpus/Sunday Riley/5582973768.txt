I don’t know exactly what it is about this product but i actually love it. Since using it i just feel like my face looks better. My cheekbone look higher and my face just looks more plump imo. Although no one has mentioned anything to me about looking better, I just feel like it has made a slight improvement. There’s something about it that makes me feel good and i want to keep using it. I spritz 2-3 sprays in my hand and pat over my face and neck morning and night. The price is high. I purchased with 20% off, and will stock up on the next sale:) love it
