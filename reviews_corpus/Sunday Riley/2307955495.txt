What a gorgeous newbie. As a skincare lover this product is so aesthetically pleasing. Cream applied so easily and melts into the skin quickly. I applied it morning and night for a week and saw my skin turning for the better, first plumper, second my face color was more even and solid, skin felt nourished, hydrated and revived. Iâ€™m a huge believer in vitamin C so this cream is a great addition to my anti aging routine for all year round, and it does feel on the lighter side and I can see myself using it thru warmer months as well. Such a pleasure
