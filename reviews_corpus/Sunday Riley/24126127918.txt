LOVE this. Been struggling with postpartum breakouts and now I hardly have a breakout and my face is clear from using it after two weeks of consistent use. You only need a very little amount.  I use in conjunction with Truly’s CBD masks and Huda’s moisturizer and my skin has never looked better. It’s expensive so I bought it on sale. You should definitely try it. love!!
