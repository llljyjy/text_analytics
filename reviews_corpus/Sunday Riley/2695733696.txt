Sunday Riley never disappoints. I been using their products for a while now and I’m always impressed with the results. I love this C.E.O Glow face oil because it has a unique formula that targets my dark circles, redness, and dull uneven texture. I’m so happy I added this oil to my everyday skincare routine. It’s lightweight and absorbs into my skin really well leaving my skin more hydrated all day. The Turmeric and vitamin C are a great combination to target my problem areas. I totally recommend this product. Best Oil
