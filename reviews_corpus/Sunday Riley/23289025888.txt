So I have been using this C.E.O. Afterglow a little over a week now and I am so obsessed with it! From the beautiful vibrant color to the smooth and creamy texture that just melts into my skin. Leaving my skin feeling hydrated and looking refreshed with a natural glow! Overall I can definitely see a difference in texture and brightness! And itâ€™s now my favorite part of my skin care routine that I look forward to doing! nan
