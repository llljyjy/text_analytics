I am always a big fan of Sunday Riley products especially their face oils. They are amazing. This C.E.O. brightening Vitamin C cream didn’t let me down. It has such a smooth texture, it takes a little bit time to absorb it but it doesn’t leave sticky feeling. I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin so I always have to be extra careful with what I use. Thanks god, it didn’t irritate my skin at all. I love how it leaves my skin smoother and bouncer in the morning. It’s absolutely worth a try. Amazing Formula!!!
