I’ve been trying the new Sunday Riley CEO Afterglow and this is absolutely stunning. The cream is so luxe and satin-like on the skin. It has a neroli fragrance and is packed full of gorgeous stable vitamin c and hyaluronic acid. The aroma is a little bit strong but it does not irritate my sensitive skin at all. There’s nothing like the texture and feel of this gorgeous cream! My skin is glowing and beautiful. Gorgeous, satin cream!
