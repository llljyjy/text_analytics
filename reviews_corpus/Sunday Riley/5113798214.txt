Another great product from Sunday Riley! The Pink Drink is a great essence also super quick and easy to use. I just mist a few sprays onto my face and neck, pat into the skin then let dry for a minute and continue with my other skincare products. I do use this after cleansing and toner as a third step in my skincare routine. It feels very hydrating to the skin and so luxurious. This is definitely not just another face mist! It has a purpose, so if you use it correctly you will get results! :) your skin will *drink* this up!
