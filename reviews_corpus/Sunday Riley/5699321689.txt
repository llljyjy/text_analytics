I received this B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum complimentary from Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review. This serum has a lightweight milky texture and lovely pale lavender color with a barely-there natural scent. It helps to soothe my redness and I have noticed some fading of dark spots and overall brightening of my skin tone after using for a few weeks. I love that this layers well with other skincare products and I can use as part of both my morning and evening routines. This definitely earned a spot on my skincare faves list! nan
