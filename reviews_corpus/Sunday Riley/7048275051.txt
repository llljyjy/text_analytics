I am so confused by all the reviews!! Either people are being super critical or don’t want to spend the money on good skin care. The smell is minty and not gross at all?! My blemishes feduced within 20 minutes of using this as a spot treatment. I love. Granted everyone’s skins different but it’s certainly not as terrible as the reviews given. Loveee
