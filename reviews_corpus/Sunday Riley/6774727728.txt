I have been using this oil for almost a year and I am just now at half a bottle with the smallest size. I love this stuff. I have dry skin and it absorbs within 15 minutes. IF you have oily skin you will probably not like this. My skin feels tighter when I use it. I will continue to purchase it. $40 for the small size isnâ€™t bad and it lasts a long, long time. I use it all year and have compliments on my skin since using it. Gives a beautiful glow to mature skin. nan
