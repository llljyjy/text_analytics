I have dry skin with the occasional acne and Iâ€™ve been using this mask for years. It is very strong and drying, so you need to be careful. I have used it as a spot treatment overnight for a really bad pimple before, and it will bring the deepest under the skin pimples to a head and speed up the healing process A LOT, but if you leave it on more than 20 minutes the skin will appear reddish and sensitive afterwards. For me it works best as a spot treatment. Amazing for acne if used correctly!
