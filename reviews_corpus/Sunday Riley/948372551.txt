My skin has been super dry lately and I have not been liking the texture and redness.  I have been using this serum nightly for two weeks and my face has some bounce back to it along with a nicer texture.  I had a small cluster of redness on my right cheek that looks way better as well.  This serum feels silky when I apply it and absorbs after about 30 seconds do you can layer a moisturizer on top. nan
