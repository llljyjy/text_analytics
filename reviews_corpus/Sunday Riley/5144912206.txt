This is probably the best niacinamide serum over ever used. And I’ve used a lot!! This is lightweight and doesn’t dry out my skin. I do have extremely oily skin but in the summmer it gets so uncomfortably dry and this both controls my oil and moisturizes.  I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my skin and It has never looked better. Bye bye oily skin!
