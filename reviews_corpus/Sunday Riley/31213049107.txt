This cream is a lovely texture and a beautiful color. The scent is quite strong, but I do enjoy it. This cream delivers just the right amount of hydration- it doesn’t feel heavy or greasy but also doesn’t leave my face wanting. I’ve noticed a bit of brightening in my skin, just all around a bit of a glow. nan
