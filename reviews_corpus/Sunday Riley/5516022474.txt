Even After rubbing it many times on my face and rinsed  it off ..A LOT of makeup reside was still there. I guess you have to use micellar water first to remove all makeup and then this product, but so what’s the point on spending so much on a cleanser?I think this is good for a quick wash in the am or after workout but not to remove makeup. - not for me, I need something that does the job and leaves my skin soft.The pros- it doesn’t over dry the skin. It won’t remove remove makeup
