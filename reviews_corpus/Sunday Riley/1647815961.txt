When I discovered this line and this product years ago I was hooked. Good genes was exactly what the doctor ordered when it came to my skin. It was lovely and worked so well. Skin was dewy, brighter, hydrated and my skin looked better and better. Makeup set perfectly on top of it. I could tolerate it from the first smear. I showed it daily and stocked up during sales. NOT THE NEW FORMULA. I don’t know what changed exactly. But first wear with this new formula and I broke out with cystic acne. Yes I know that hormones etc can cause cyclic cystic acne. But this was from the product. I even continued to use it with the same results. Then I even tried it as a mask with the clay cleanser thinking my skin somehow became too sensitive for good genes. Well the same acne came around again!. so disappointed... That’s around the time when I realized they changed the product formula. It feels the same going on and my skin looks good and bright and hydrated like the old formula, But it has caused the worst cysts and acne on my face:( new formula causes breakouts
