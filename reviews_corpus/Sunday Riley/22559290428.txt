With a lot of serums it’s hard to say whether they’re actually doing something, especially after only using them for a short time. I do think this is one of the good ones! After just a couple of weeks, I am confident that it is making my pores look a little smaller and a little cleaner, and I’m also noticing less redness through the middle of my face. My Before and after shots aren’t great, but in person, I am noticing the difference. It feels nice going on, I like the look of the packaging, and my skin seems to like the ingredients. Am happy to have it complimentary from Sunday Riley and keep using it as part of my skincare routine. I will say, the neck of the bottle is pretty wide for this dropper style, which makes it a little messy if I’m not careful. Working well so far!
