I love Niacinamide serums bc of its amazing benefits to my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this one did not irritate it at all. The texture is liquidy and easily absorbed by the skin. My concern is some dark spots from acne scars which tend to be so stubborn. However, after using this for more than 2 weeks, I can finally see some improvement on the appearance! The redness around my nose also lessen! Overall, another great product from the brand! Good product for lightening hyperpigmentation!
