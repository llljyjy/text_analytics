So in love with this beautiful face oil. I love turmeric so this product smells amazing. I add the oil on my face daily and I can see how my face looks so fresh , smooth and glowing. Living in one of the coldest state in US this product is a must for a hydrating skin. Sunday Riley products are truly one of the best products out there. I love that this products is Cruelty-Free, Sulfate-Free, Paraben-Free, Gluten-Free, Soy-Free, Phthalate-Free, Fragrance-Free and Vegan. I also like some of the KEY INGREDIENTS that includes  GINGER, RED RASPBERRY, THD ASCORBATE,CRANBERRY SEED OIL, EVENING PRIMROSE, POMEGRANATE , SEED OIL, GOLDEN TURMERIC, and JOJOBA OIL. I would definitely recommend this face oil to anyone looking for a great face product and gets the job done. Amazing Face Oil
