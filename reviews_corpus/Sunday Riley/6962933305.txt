I absolutely love this oil. I have very very sensitive acne prone skin so I am always worried about introducing new skin care products but this one worked like a charm! I used it every single night and I love the way that it moisturizes my skin and makes it feel conditioned. I have been using it for about 2 months now and I am starting to notice purging from the retinoid (be ware!) but I know my skin will look incredible in the end. HIGHLY recommend anything from Sunday Riley. miracle work
