Very effective product at exfoliating your skin, giving it more glow and “life”. Perfect for dull, uneven skin, in my opinion. You literally see results over night. I was very happy with this product and loved seeing my skin in the morning. Unfortunately, this lasted about 2-3 weeks and then it was like my face got used to this product and I no longer saw the “miracle”. Not that my skin looked awful or anything, it was just “meh”. Basically, I started getting the results I normally would if I used my regular moisturizer. I’m glad it works for many (judging my the positive reviews), I wish it did for me...or at least for longer than 2-3 weeks. It was good for a while
