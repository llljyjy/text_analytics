First off, the packaging is lovely & the spatula is an added bonus - together itâ€™s luxurious. The cream is a lightweight gel consistency. It is a bright yellow, that took some added time to blend in. The scent is pretty strong, but I got used to it. It has left my skin feeling very soft. Kindly gifted by Sunday Riley. nan
