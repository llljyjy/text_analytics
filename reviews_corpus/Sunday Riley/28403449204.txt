Ok SR did it again. I have been using this for the last 2 weeks now and absolutely adore it. It is lightweight, almost runny consistency and has a beautiful purplish hue. I love how smooth it is, how fast it gets absorbed and the results. It definitely helps evening out the skin tone and improving the appearance of dark spots.The only improvement I can suggest is to make the mouth of the bottle a bit smaller - right now, the serum kinda spills a bit (if i am not careful) since the dropper has too much space when you are taking it out. But this isnâ€™t a deal breaker at all. Overall, I am in love with this serum and can definitely see myself buying it in the next Sephora sale. Beautiful Niacinamide serum - a must try
