New holy grail. I loved the OG ceo cream but this is even better… The yellow tint enhances the healthy facial glow.  It’s lightweight enough for oily skin and actually makes my pores look smoother.  The smell of this is divine. It reminds me of the bergasol sun lotion from the 70s (tatcha face wash smells similar… I need whatever this ingredient is in a perfume. It’s summery and citrusy but also sexy. Which is a lot for a moisturizer but I love it. :) nan
