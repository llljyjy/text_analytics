I’ve been using this B nice serum from Sunday Riley for the past few weeks and I like it! It’s a bit too liquidy but I love that it absorbs so fast and layers very well with the rest of my skincare, I’ve noticed an improvement in the overall texture of my skin and I’m excited to keep using it and see more results from it, I would definitely recommend it Very nice niacinamide serum
