I have no idea how something that claims to be exfoliating can also be moisturizing but here we are.  I use this every day with no issues, even around my lips which tends to be very sensitive.  I’m almost through my first bottle and absolutely see a reduction in fine lines and my skin tone looks great.  This is pricey, but I’ll absolutely be repurchasing. Worth it!!!!
