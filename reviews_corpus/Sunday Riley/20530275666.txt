Wow, this C.E.O Vitamin C cream arrived packaged like a boss, with a little spoon for better use. The fragrance is really nice and herbal, I really enjoy using it in the mornings before my makeup routine. It leaves face perfect for the day, not greasy at all. The cream sinks in perfectly. My skin is looking brighter and more smooth and supple after couple of weeks. Vitamin C is perfect for anti aging. Iâ€™d definitely recommend it. Perfect
