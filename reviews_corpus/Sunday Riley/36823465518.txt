This serum is totally worth the price! It goes on like an oil but doesnâ€™t make my skin feel greasy or break me out. It heals my acne super fast and my skin feels soft and looks glowy. The only thing is the bottle is super small so you definitely run out after a couple months of nightly use. worth the price!
