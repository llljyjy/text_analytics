The first thing I noticed when applying this moisturizer is the smell. It smells so refreshing and invigorating, it smells like fresh squeezed oranges. Immediately my skin was given the most beautiful glow.  This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling firm and hydrated. After using for some time my skin softness and overall brightness had improved.  I also am happy to use a product that is cruelty-free. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a lit from within glow. Glowing Goodness
