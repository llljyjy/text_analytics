I was lucky enough to receive a full size bottle in my first ever Boxy Charm box. I would never usually even consider spending so much on a product like this. I used it a couple times sporadically and didn’t notice much. Then decided to get serious and use it consistently. It’s been a week and I can already notice a significant difference in my skin. Redness has gone down, much smoother. I am actually blown away. I have never seen my skin look so good. I am already purchasing another full size. Never thought I would see the day I would drop $$$$ on skincare. Never thought I would be this big of a believer!!
