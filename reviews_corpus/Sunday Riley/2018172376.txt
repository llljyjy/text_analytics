I love this stuff! The smell is one you have to get used to, but it is WAY better than the U.F.O. Oil. I can deal with this one since I use it as a spot treatment, I cannot deal with/get over the smell of UFO. This is very similar to the sulfur cream I got from my dermatologist but way cheaper, as you don’t have to pay to see a doctor. The bottle does not contain that much product, but if you use it as a spot treatment it will last you a long time. I use it 2-4 times a week and have had the .5 bottle for 6 months. I just put a dot of this over a bump at night, after my night full face routine, and it’s gone or almost gone in the morning. I then cover the bump during the day with Cicapair from Dr. Jart and it’s almost always completely gone by 2nd day. Fantastic! Can be used sparingly.
