I have no major issues with my skin so I don’t think I’ve ever really been wowed by a skincare product. My skin looks pretty good no matter what I use. I don’t have a massive blackhead issue, but I get pesky little clogged pores on my t-zone that Biore strips never solved for long. I have bought tons of products claiming to clear out my pores, but this one actually and obviously delivers. My pores are just absolutely clear. Empty. There is a vacancy. Pore gunk has moved out. Sometimes I’ll see one or two little sebum plugs - ones I would not have noticed before, but now I do because NOTHING ELSE IS THERE - and I eradicate them with my DermaFlash. Good Genes does everything other products claim to, combined. It would probably even raise my child if I had one, which I don’t, which is why I can afford this stuff. SCI-FI PERFECTION
