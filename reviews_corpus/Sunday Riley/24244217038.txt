The Sunday Riley B3 Nice 10% Nacinamide serum is amazing. I have noticed with continued use the redness on my cheeks is improved, my skin texture is more even,  and pores appear smaller. There is no irritation from it. Lightweight texture that sinks right in to the skin. I like the packaging and dropper. Highly recommend. Excellent serum
