I swear, Sunday Riley can do no wrong. I added this into my morning routine, as I use retinol at night. I was nervous about mixing the two but didn’t need to be. My skin was noticeably softer and I noticed a chance in some slight pigmentation in my cheek as well- and this was only after a week or so of use. I’ll definitely continue use and I can’t wait to see what else changes. Worth it! A new everyday staple for me!
