I finished my second bottle and just ordered my 3rd. I have noticed my pores have reduced size and my sun spots have almost disappeared. Watch out to not put some near the eyes - I have put some inadvertently under my eyes several times and it caused the skin to peel and get really dry. Anyway this is a great product, it also has been helping with some acne. Does what you pay for
