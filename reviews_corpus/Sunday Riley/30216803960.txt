I was so excited to finally try this facial oil. ..but t didn’t work out for me. It has a strong and kind of pungent fragrance that gave me a headache and broke my skin out. Hopefully it will work for you but my skin is apparently too sensitive for it. My skin isn’t usually sensitive like this but occasionally does react poorly to strong fragrances, so I’d expect this to work for most people. Just beware that the scent is NOT light and citrus-y as I’d expected! Strong fragrance that broke me out
