I love everything I’ve purchased from SR. I have their AM and PM kits and have been purchasing their Tidal moisturizer for at least a year. I’m obsessed with their CEO products so when this came out, I joined the waitlist and switched as soon as it was available. This new moisturizer does not sit well on the skin. It rubs off in clumps and the smell (aka added neroli essential oil) is very strong and not something I want to put on my face. Hopefully they reformulate. Rubs off skin and added Neroli oil smells strong
