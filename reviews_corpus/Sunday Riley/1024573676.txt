I started using this several years ago when I was in my mid-30s. I love that it’s sensitive enough that I have never experienced any redness, burning or itching. Since I’ve used for many years, have no visible wrinkles, and take pretty good care of my skin otherwise, I feel like it’s done its job! I’ll keep using until I stop seeing results, i.e., wrinkles! nan
