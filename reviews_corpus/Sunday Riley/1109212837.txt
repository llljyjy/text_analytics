Feels greasy, smells awful, didn’t work- still broke out just the same. I gave it 3 weeks of use morning and night and washed with Beste.  Used good genes every few nights to fade darks spots from breakouts past. Still had blackheads daily. Still broke out hormonally on schedule. This didn’t even help with swelling, so more dark spots. Useless for me useless
