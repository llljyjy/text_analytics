This was my first product from Sunday Riley. It was recommended to me by the Real Skincare Discussion.  I started to get more acne and breakouts as I got older, but I was put on prescription creams for them. I believe this is why my skin disliked this serum.  I started very slowly with a small patch test, and when I worked up to my whole face, I broke out everywhere.  Although I used the prescription cream and this serum at opposite times of the day, I think it was simply too much for my skin.  Either that or my face cannot tolerate one or more of the ingredients.  However, I have found that if I use it on body acne as a light spot treatment, it does help with size and redness.  I have been using the serum on my boyfriend’s face instead (always putting it in my clean hands first) and any breakouts, clogged pores and blackheads have noticeably improved with this.  He gets compliments on his skin all the time, but I don’t get any of the credit for introducing him to this or any type of skincare routine at all lol.  Overall, definitely a great product to try if you have acne, blackheads, clogged pores and would like to clear up your skin without stripping it of moisture. Did not work for my skin, still a great product
