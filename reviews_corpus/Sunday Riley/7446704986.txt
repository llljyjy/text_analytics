The first thing I noticed was the luxe packaging, after that I noticed the strong tumeric scent. I have been trying it for about two weeks now, I usually tend to stay away from oils because they tend to break me out but I have been liking this one so far and its really light weight, it really gives me a natural glow that I have been needing after all this winter months. I will get it again once is done since is small and it goes fast THE oil!
