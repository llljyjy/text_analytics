I wanted to love this soooooo bad, but the smell is so awful and strong!!!!! And the AHA in it makes your skin super sensitive to the sun, so even with sunscreen on, I got burnt in the tanning bed after using this (and I have medium olive skin and usually never burn and I do not have sensitive skin) Guess Iâ€™m going back to regular tea tree oil which works great for me. nan
