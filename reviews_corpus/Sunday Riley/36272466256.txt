I like this vitamin C oil - it perked up my skin a bit and I find the smell of the turmeric to be nice! I think it’s a fine starter vitamin C, as it’s a lower percentage. Sunday Riley doesn’t list the actual percent vitamin C on this oil, but their other vit c serum lists 15% and the associate said that one is the step up from this oil. I have blackhead prone skin, and didn’t have any issues with them while I used this oil. I’ve moved on to a higher percentage vitamin C serum, but I did like this while I used it! good starter for vitamin C
