I don’t think I’ve ever tried a Sunday Riley product I didn’t like….I’ve been using a 20% Niacinamide serum from a different brand to spot treat for a while now but even though B3 Nice only contains 10 % Niacinamide, it is just as effective! The serum is easily incorporated into into my existing skincare routine and layers well with other skincare products. A lot of Sunday Riley products have an unusual and sometimes even unpleasant scent, but B3 Nice doesn’t really have any detectable scent. Not only is the serum effective at reducing redness, it also helps to unclog pore, slows down sebum production, and reduces the appearance of the size of my pores especially on my nose which is something I’ve always struggled with. I am hoping to see some brightening of dark spots with continued use.The serum is gentle and non irritating by itself but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to agree with my favorite fruit enzyme mask.
