I have been using this for about a week now. I have very dry and sensitive skin. After the first use my skin felt so much more supple. I only use it at night in case it reacted bad with my skin. So far I find I have less acne in the mornings when I use this at night. It makes my skin feel soft and less flaky. I actually really like this product! My skin is more hydrated and radiant! Love!
