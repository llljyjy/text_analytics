This moisturizer gifted by Sunday Riley is amazing, and I believe it is a great option for mature skin, it helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation and the texture of it is so nice and light. Creamy yet not heavy and neta into the skin nicely, not sitting on your skin or making it feel greasy amazing moisturizer
