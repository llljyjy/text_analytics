I had this gifted by Sunday Riley. Love a moisturizer with vitamin C! I usually have issues with hyperpigmentation so I really appreciate the power of vitamin C in a moisturizer. My skin feels moisturized and hydrated. I haven’t noticed a big difference in skin texture but I don’t really have any issues with texture to begin with. The smell kind of reminds me of a hand cream I used to use all the time which is kind of funny, but I quite like the smell. nan
