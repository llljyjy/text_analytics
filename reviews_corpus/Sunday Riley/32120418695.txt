I love how luxurious this product is. It comes in a beautiful tub with a nice spoon for application. I also love the gel cream. It feels light and refreshing on the skin. And a nice scent too. It’s awesome that it’s hydrating AND has vitamin C. My face feels hydrated and smooth and skin looks brighter. I have some acne scars and red spots that I feel like this has been helping improve. I was gifted this in exchange for my honest review. nan
