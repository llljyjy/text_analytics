Loved it at first but then as I continued to use it, my skin became irritated and red. The oil is a thick consistency and it’s perfect for anyone who wants to jade roll, but unfortunately had to return because it made my face itchy and red. The smell is light and smells like oregano, it does fade in 20 mins but can’t be quite bothersome for people with scent sensitivity. I have combo sensitive acne prone skin and I do not recommend this oil. not for sensitive skin
