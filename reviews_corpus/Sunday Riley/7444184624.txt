I really like this eye cream. It has a lovely texture; it feels thick and rich when you pump it out, yet somehow it doesn’t feel heavy or occlusive on the skin. I use this cream in rotation with a couple of others (usually this or something with resveratrol in the morning and a retinol-based cream at night), so I can’t say for sure that this has made a world of difference for my skin, but my under-eye area does seem to have fewer bags than it used to and the ones that are there are noticeably lighter in color. I initially bought this cream to keep in our downstairs powder room (sometimes I get ready down there if my husband’s in the shower). I used to use Kiehl’s Dark Circle-Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum and was going to buy a second bottle of it for downstairs, but purchased this one instead because I found it on sale and was also just curious to try it. The Kiehl’s and Sunday Riley Vitamin C eye creams have very similar characteristics and do more or less the same thing, but I found I preferred this one because it had fewer silicones in it and felt more nourishing on my skin. After using the Sunday Riley eye cream just a few days, I moved the Kiehl’s serum to the downstairs bathroom and put this one in the master. If you’re a fan of the Kiehl’s Vitamin C serum, I would absolutely recommend this as an alternative. This is now my preferred eye cream, and I think if you make the switch it’ll become yours too. This eye cream isn’t perfect, but it’s fantastic if you’re looking to eliminate bags/dark circles. If I could have, I’d have rated this eye cream 4.5/5 stars, but as that wasn’t an option, I decided to round up since I am so pleased with it. It’s a definite step up from what I was using before, and unless I happen to sample something I like better, I absolutely plan to repurchase. For a skincare junkie like me, that’s about the highest compliment I can give. Definite improvement!
