Another hit from Sunday Riley! I’ve loved this brand and it’s products for years now. The new afterglow vitamin C moisturizer has been fitting in with my brightening routine perfectly. I’ve noticed a significant brightening effect and my older acne marks have been fading away. It’s also hydrating and I love the satin like finish this has. Definitely recommend to check this new release. Another hit product!
