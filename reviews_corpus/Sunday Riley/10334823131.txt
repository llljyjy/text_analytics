I don’t know how or why I haven’t heard about this Face Oil before. I’m very disconnected and fairly late taking care of my skin, so maybe that’s why. I went to Sephora looking for a “route” on morning/night skin routine and left with this oil and a serum from the same brand. Their representative was so helpful and friendly. On the very first day that I tried I was shocked how much nicer and glowing my skin was. I still amazed how beautiful and refreshed my skin looks and feels.My only bad critic is for the scent that is on the strong side but does not last for long, so even the bad isn’t that bad. I’ll definitely buy it again and try to incorporate other products of Sunday Riley into my life. you won’t regret it!
