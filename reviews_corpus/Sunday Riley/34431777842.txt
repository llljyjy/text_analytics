I think this product is well suited for a lot of people. In just two weeks, I already saw a reduction of oiliness and an improvement of texture. I dont have much hyperpigmentation, but I imagine it would work well for that as these ingredients are just fantastic! The packaging leaves some to be desired bc its very easy to spill, but the purple is pretty. Great for oil control!
