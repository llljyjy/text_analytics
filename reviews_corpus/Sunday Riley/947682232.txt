I was using the Drunk Elephant Protini and I wanted something more moisturizing since I use a retinol under and I decided to go with this. Ok I have to agree with the other reviews the smell/fragrance literally makes me nauseous, it’s so overpowering. I can’t even figure what the scent is suppose to be, it’s just awful. Then the first use made me break out all over. I have combo skin and haven’t had an pimples since I was a teen. I decided to just wait and try again and it made my skin react worse. Waste of money will not buy again. I won’t even finish it. Maybe I will use on my feet? Do not recommend. Not for Me
