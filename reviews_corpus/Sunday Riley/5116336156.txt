I love this cream. It’s thick, heavy and smellswonderful. I have dry sensitive skin and it loves a deep skin drenching cream and this does just that. It’s perfect for a night cream, I use this with a few drops of the UFO clarifying oil at night and it’s the perfect combo. Subtle glow from the vitamin C in it also, which is a nice bonus. Nice night cream
