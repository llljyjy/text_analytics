I was excited to try this new launch. I like it besides the smell.  It has a very odd smell. It’s something I have smelled before but I can’t tell exactly what it is but I don’t like it.  The smell does linger for a little bit but eventually goes away. It goes on smoothly.  My face feels and looks good after using.  I love anything that adds glow.  It absorbs into my skin quickly. It could easily be 5 stars if it wasn’t for the smell Odd Smell
