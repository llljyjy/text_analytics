This product is gold. My skin looks so much more even and bright than I’ve seen it in so long! The scent can be a lot at first of very strong marigold, but after a few days of using it I barely noticed. Very thick consistency but rubs in like a dream. My skin just look noticeably more lively is all I can describe it as. I’ve never seen such a difference with using a moisturizer! Please ignore how funny the photos are, I forgot to take a real before photo so that’s the best I can do. In any case, you can really see the difference. The most red spots I have are by my nose and mouth which I think are sun damage and won’t ever go away, but they do look the least red I’ve seen them in years! Feeling-wise, they are much much less flaky than usual after adding this moisturizer to my regiment. I really recommend if you want to invest in a new moisturizer, especially if you have painful tricky areas like I do. Love
