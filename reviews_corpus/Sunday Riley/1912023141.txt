I LOVE this rich moisturizer. It is thick and hydrating but not greasy at all. It stays on your face. It has a gorgeous, subtle glow that instantly gives a brighter look. It smells amazing. You only need a tiny bit compared to most moisturizers so you really get your moneyâ€™s worth out of it. Rich Hydration!
