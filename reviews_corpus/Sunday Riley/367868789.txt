The products are fantastic.  I loved this as a ’get to know Sunday Riley’ starter kit, and my aging skin has never felt better.  However, I’m appalled at the packaging.  Just last night I got to the point where the pump jar of A+ would not pump anything out.  I removed the pump in order to get the last bits out with a tiny spatula, and discovered that the product is contained in a plastic bag attached to the pump, which collapses as more product is used.  So, to start, I can’t scrape out the last of it with a spatula, because it’s sealed in this soft plastic compartment.  But worse, this means the entire outer jar is just there for show! For a company that prides itself on sustainability, clean skincare, etc., you’d think they’d be smarter about creating less environmental waste.  It’s a waste of resources to produce it and generates unneeded trash.  Removing a star for this, because presumably the Good Genes pump bottle is the same way. Packaging?!  Wow.
