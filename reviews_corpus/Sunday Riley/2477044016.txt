I have a handful of Sunday Riley products for good reason - they always help improve my aging skin! This product stood out to me initially because it helps with oiliness, decreases the appearance of large pores, and decreases skin redness.  These are all things I struggle with, and over the last couple weeks of using it, I’ve been so impressed with how well it has improved the overall appearance of my facial skin.  I have noticed my makeup looks more flawless, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s due to the improvement of my pores and the decreased oiliness.  Definitely recommend! Absolutely love this serum!!
