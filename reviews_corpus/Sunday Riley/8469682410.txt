I’ve honestly never written a review on Sephora and I shop here a lot - but I felt like I had to write one because I know I was really hesitant buying this product. It is not just expensive water, and out of ALL of my skincare products, I feel this one the most - it’s instant and I can FEEL in real time it my skin tightening literally as soon as I spray it on, which is way more than I can say for any of the other expensive products I use. I use it at night before my retinol (which I’ve been using for over a year) and since adding this spray in last week, I’ve noticed a difference in my skin when I wake up in the morning. This stuff is legit Worth It
