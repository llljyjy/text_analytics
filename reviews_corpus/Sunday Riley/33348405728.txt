I enjoy using Vitamin C-based skincare products, and I was pleasantly surprised by the creamâ€™s texture and color. I like how it contains antioxidants and helps to prevent the appearance of premature aging caused by UV-B exposure. My skin loves it and is brighter and more nourished as a result. My skin is also less rough and works very nicely for combination skin! Great Vitamin C
