This cream is sooo beautiful! From the packaging to the texture and color. It has this bright deep yellow color that’s so different from anything I tried before. It’s due to the fact that it has meriglods in it. But what I love most is the quality of the vitamin C SD used in this cream, it doesn’t irritate my skin and it’s packed with moisture locking ingredients too. My skin is glowing!! I’ve been using it morning and night and I’m noticing how vibrant my skin looks and how soft my cheeks are .  This has replaced my dermalogica bilumin for sure! Yellow cream
