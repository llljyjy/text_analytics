The product itself seems pretty good.  There’s definitely an adjustment period. Lots of flaking and dryness (as to be expected with a higher concentration of retinol).  Gentle enough for the delicate eye area though; I have sensitive skin and aside from the dryness and flakes I experienced no redness or irritation.  I can’t say I see a huge difference, just a slight minimization of fine lines.  I am 39 and do not use any botox or fillers and feel like this would be good for maintenance of fine lines without the need for any needles.  I am religious about my sunscreen… so everyone is different.  I was terribly upset when my squeeze bottle top kept coming off and oozing out all over.  I don’t even keep it in my make up and thankfully so, otherwise it would be a an even bigger mess.  I live at altitude and for whatever reason this package bursts out on its own just sitting in my bathroom drawer. It is disappointing because it’s rather expensive and I’ve lost a lot of the product to this problem.  Would buy again if the packaging was better quality.  The ceramic top seems like a waste- not sure how SR claims to be sustainable, but ok. poorly packaged, good product, not great
