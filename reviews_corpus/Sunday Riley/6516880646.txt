This was gifted by Sunday Riley. I’ve been trying a bunch of products to help with my large pore/texture issues and this one has seem to help with giving my skin a more elastic look. My biggest concern with products is will my face react to it or will it react with my other skincare products. Luckily for me it didn’t. My pores aren’t large from far away but when you get closer you can clearly see them but after using this serum I’ve started to notice my pores less and less and that’s a win in my book. Also have two fairly large acne scars and they also seem to be less noticeable. Great for Pore Reduction
