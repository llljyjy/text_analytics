I thought this oil was all hype until I received a sample of this product in a goodie bag and found myself literally scraping the bottom once it was empty. Not only does this incredibly gentle oil hydrate my skin, but it visibly reduces the redness and irritation caused by my hormonal acne! My pimples usually vanish overnight, or are noticeably smaller after using this as well! I just canâ€™t go back to using my regular facial oil - this is too good. If you have dry, irritated skin, or are simply looking for a way to hydrate and soothe your skin during the harsh winter climate, this is worth every penny. Holy Grail Oil
