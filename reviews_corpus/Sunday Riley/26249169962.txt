There are just some brands that never let you down and Sunday Riley is without a doubt one of those brands. I’ve been so eager to try this new release and I’m happy to say it doesn’t disappoint. So lightweight, super smooth and silky on the skin and very aptly named as it really does leave you with such a beautiful afterglow.  I’ve seen my complexion looking brighten and more even toned with this moisturized. It layers so well with the other products in my routine. Another amazing product from an amazing brand! Sunday Riley has done it again!
