Amazing product - initially tried and loved the samples and now have added this to my regular rotation!!! I have sensitive skin and it was only very mildly irritating at first, used every other night and the results are phenomenal. Have tried ordinarys lactic acid serum and it just does not compare. Evens out my skin tone and texture, makes pores less visible/vanish, more youthful and vibrant complexion after only 1 use. I am in my mid 30s running on very little sleep from babies BUT this makes my skin look refreshed and I am confident to wear just sunscreen for the day, NO makeup needed!!! My new holy grail for a makeup free face !!!
