I’m a huge fan of vitamin c serums and absolutely love Sunday Riley so I was excited to give this a try. I’ve been using it for the past week and have been loving it. Super nourishing and definitely have noticed more brightness in my skin. The smell is a little strong but nothing you can’t get used to. Awesome vitamin c serum!
