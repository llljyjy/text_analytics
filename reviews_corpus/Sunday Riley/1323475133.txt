I seriously love this stuff! It has a light, pleasant scent and isn’t overly sticky or tacky like other lactic acid serums can be. I apply it at night before bed, and I wake up in the morning with soft, clear skin. Over time, it has reduced my fine lines and I love that it doesn’t break me out. Will continue to repurchase, this is a staple for me. GET IT
