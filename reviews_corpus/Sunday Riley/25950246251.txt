I am not really huge in vitamin c products, but I was super curious about this one. I love that this targets some of my skin concerns like my redness and dullness that I have. It seems to have helped my redness calm down and it’s working on the dullness. I need to remember to keep using it to get more effects if the product. I really enjoy how this product sinks into my skin and doesn’t leave me feeling oily afterwards. I enjoy the lightweight ness of this oil as well. I’ve been really liking this and can’t wait to keep using it. nan
