I received the C.E.O. Glow Vitamin C & Turmeric Face and that I’ve been using it every morning the past two weeks. My first impression was a strong smell of turmeric that I could detect even taking the package out of my mailbox. The consistency is thinner and didn’t run out of the dropper with two or three drops sufficient for my face. On my non-makeup days I’ve noticed a new subtle glow on my skin catching the light, especially on my shiny nose but not overwhelming for my normally dry skin. However, for 15 mL at $40, this is going to go fast and I’m not sure if the value to effect ratio is worth it with comparable products. nan
