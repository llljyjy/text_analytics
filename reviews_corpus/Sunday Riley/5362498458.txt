I am in my early 40s and have experimented with many different Eye creams. Thid one is now my holy grail! It is that good. Like most products, it takes time to see results. I’ve been using it for months now and all fine lines around my eyes have disappeared! The skin around my eyes is so smooth. I have already been using retinol products for years so my skin didn’t really need time to adjust. To be on the safe side though, I started with using it every other night. I had a little redness the first time using it but that went away quickly. I’m very happy with the results and it’s the only Eye Cream I have tried that die away with any lines I had. I definitely recommend it. Be patient and if you are a new retinol user, start with every 2 or 3 nights before moving up to every night. Best Eye Cream for fine lines
