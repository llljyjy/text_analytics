This rich moisturizer feels so good when I apply it, and I’ve definitely noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter in the short time that I’ve been using it! This product was gifted by Sunday Riley, but I was unsurprised that I loved it as I’m a big fan of Sunday Riley products! The only thing I’m not crazy about is that it has quite a strong scent when you apply it. My skin isn’t sensitive so it didn’t bother me, though the scent is strong. Overall, a great moisturizer! Great overall! Gave me glowy skin
