Overall, I think this product is helping clear up my acne but it’s slow! I don’t think I’ve noticed any changes in brightness of my skin tone unfortunately— I much prefer their oil version of this! The moisturizer is fine as a moisturizer, but it did sting my skin and make my face red afterwards. not for me
