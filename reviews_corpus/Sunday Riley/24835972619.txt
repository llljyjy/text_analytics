I received this product complimentary from Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review.I love the packaging of this product, from the box to the purple glass bottle. It’s a really nice size with a lot of product in it as well.I have combo/oily, acne prone skin with scarring. After using this product nightly for the last couple weeks, I can tell that its helping with the oil control. I can also tell that my skin is hydrated and my post-acne scarring seems less noticeable. This serum blends in really easily and my skin just soaks it all in. It doesn’t feel heavy, greasy or irritating at all. I’ve had no issues layering other products on top of it either. nan
