Loveeee this cleanser. I have been using for several months now. Itâ€™s such a nice texture and I feel like it deeply cleans my skin but still leaves it feeling hydrated. A little goes a long way. I had a 1oz version before I bought the full size and the sample one literally lasted me 3 months. This is a staple in my skincare routine. Deeply cleanses without over-stripping
