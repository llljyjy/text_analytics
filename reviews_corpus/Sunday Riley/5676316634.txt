I’ve been using this for well over a week now and 100% can tell a difference in my skins brightness and hydration! First my skin is so nourished from this and baby soft but what I especially love is that my dark dots are lightening and my face overall is getting brighter. It looks so much more radiant and glowy. I love using this in the morning before sunscreen to give my face the most beautiful healthy radiance. Can’t wait to see all my dark spots lighten up more. Brighter more radiant skin!
