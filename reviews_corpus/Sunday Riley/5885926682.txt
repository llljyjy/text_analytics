This oil smells absolutely amazing! I love how a little goes a long way and it’s just leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not sticky as I usually see the opposite with vitamin c products. I’m still trying to figure out exactly how to pair it with moisturizer but I’m enjoying the experimenting. nan
