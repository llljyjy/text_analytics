okay so I immediately thought it smelled great and was confused why everyone hated the scent? it was refreshing and felt immediately soothing / cooling / relieving to my skin. I mean it felt so nice. I used it after Kiehl’s white amazonion clay toner + followed with an ole henriksen moisturizer, and my skin felt GREAT. I can already tell that there isn’t much product in the bottle which is annoying and my reasoning for 4/5 stars. I am excited to see the results in the morning. I am using this as an overnight mask! I don't think it's half bad!
