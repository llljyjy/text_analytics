I’ve struggled with dry skin ever since I had my baby in December. I can’t believe the hydration this locks into my skin! Especially since I typically have combo skin, I always worry about being overly hydrated and looking greasy. This absolutely does not have that effect and instead brings youthfulness to my skin! Amazing!
