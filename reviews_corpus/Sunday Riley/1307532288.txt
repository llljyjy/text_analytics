1000% YES! CEO glow has completely revitalized my dry, breakout-prone skin into smooth, glowing, hydrated bliss!I’m a nurse so wearing a mask the past 2 years has completely ruined my skin. I switched over to face oils (also now using Sunday Riley’s Luna + UFO) and it has been a GAME CHANGER! I suffer from dry skin anyways, so wearing a mask dried my skin out even more + caused breakouts for the first time in my life. Every retinol product dried my skin + made it 10x worse. I put this on in the AM after hyaluronic acid and it keeps my skin completely hydrated through 12+ hours of wearing a mask. I’ve gotten so many compliments on how my skin GLOWS now. So glad I found this product! Go to GLOW
