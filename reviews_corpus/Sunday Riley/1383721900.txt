If you have KP you need to try this. I have KP on upper arms. Nothing has worked. Some products made it worse. I received a sample and I tried on my face and thought I will try on my arms too. OMG!! My arms looked immediately better. Smooth, dark spots from picking fading. I bought a full size. One pump per arm. I leave it on half hour and rinse off in shower. I don’t use soap on my arms. I just rinse arms. Every few days I use. Not everyday. I’ve also done once a week now just to maintain results. On my face works well too but skin on my face not bad so I’ve just noticed smoother feeling. I’m so happy my arms so much better. Great product a bit expensive but worth it.
