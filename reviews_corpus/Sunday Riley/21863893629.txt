I fell in love with this b Nice serum! It has made my skin so soft and moisturized. I have definitely noticed a changed in my overall tone. It looks way more even and it’s even diminishing some of mine acne scarring. The jury is still out on my dark spot. It doesn’t look like it’s done much for that. I never really had much redness, but I have noticed my pores have diminished in size which is really nice because I have a giant pores. It also goes really well under make up. A must for dry skin!
