Ive used this eye cream for years now and I love it. It works for me. It de-puffs AND brightens dark circles immediately. My only issue is that over the years the amount of product seems to be shrinking... I use the same amount every day as I always have. The bottle I started buying 3 years ago lasted me 6 months. Now it barely lasts 3. For the price, that sucks. It works, but they’re definitely giving less and less product as the years go by. Im giving 4 stars because they’re skimping on product, 5 stars for effectiveness though. WORKS. But SR is skimping on product.
