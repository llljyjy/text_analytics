I was gifted by Moon Juice a organic mood booster that may have restored have restored my faith in the organic pharma market. I am naturally a skeptic of all energy boosting products.  have restored my faith in the organic pharma market. The strides being taken with Ashwagandha in mood and relaxation are phenomenal. I’ve been taken the product for 21 days and have awoken fairly enlightened and clear headed after the first 7 days. It’s a great addition to my morning ritual or yoga and tea with no negative impacts on gut health or perception. No groggy effects just more energy and clarity which is what I need daily to be successful in the office. Moon juice !!
