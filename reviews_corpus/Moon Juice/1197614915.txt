This product was gifted by Moon Juice. This product delivers on the claims to plump skin and does make my skin feel great. I cannot get over the scent though which is why I’m giving this 3 stars. It’s effective but the overpowering scent is enough to make me discontinue use. Some people have described this as earthy so I don’t know if perhaps the one I got was defective in some way because mine smells like old perfume. The smell is so intensely chemically that at first I thought the food I was cooking at the time had gone bad before I realized it was the face serum I had just put on a couple minutes beforehand. If you can get over the putrid smell then it’ll definitely make your skin look great. Smells like chemicals but works
