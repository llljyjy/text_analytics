Longtime Sephora shopper but this is literally my first review. I just had to chime in with other reviewers about the smell. I wasn’t even able to leave the product on my face for longer than a few hours; both my husband and myself ended up with migraines and his eyes got all red and watery the way they do when his allergies act up. I appreciate that this is a “clean” product, but the smell is anything but. It’s not “natural” like other reviewers claim, unless your idea of natural is the armpit of your hippie friend who, after three days at a music festival, thinks dousing themselves in patchouli counts as a shower. And I agree with a previous reviewer who’s suspicious of what on earth could be in this product to produce such a smell, and how on earth it could be considered safe for your skin. If patchouli and Gran’s perfume had a love child…
