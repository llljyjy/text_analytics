Super moisturizing and doesn’t irritate my eczema-prone skin at all. I LOVE the scent (my husband does too), but it’s definitely a personal preference thing. I can’t stand floral or sweet scents for moisturizers — this is not that at all. It’s earthy/herbal and smells amazing to me. The only downside is that it comes in a pot which feels less sanitary than a pump, but not a huge deal. nan
