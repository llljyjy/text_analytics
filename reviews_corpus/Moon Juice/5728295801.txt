I received this product complimentary from Moon Juice to try out and share my honest opinion. I try to eat vegan at least 80% of this time and I don’t consumer caffeine like coffee or tea at all so am always interested in products that are supposed to help boost energy. Since I don’t eat meat at all or really any animal based products, I know I need to supplement B vitamins and this product makes it so easy! You just put 1/2 tsp into a water bottle and shake it up. It has a pleasant mango taste (with no weird after taste in my opinion) and is easy to drink on the go! nan
