I love how easy it was to use and the taste wasn’t overly sweet and I do like the flavor. I love the packaging, it feels so lux too. I will say for the price and amount you get, it’s really not that big. Not sure if I’ll purchase this for myself as I received this product complimentary from Moon Juice. It did give me a pick me up, similar to how coffee affects me. Good flavor, not overly sweet!
