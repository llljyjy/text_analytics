I was gifted by moon juice. I was so excited to try this plump jelly! I’ve been eyeing the moon juice products for quite some time now so I’m so excited that I finally got to try one! This serum sinks into my skin and doesn’t leave it feeling sticky or tacky. I can tell just after a few uses that my skin looks much more plump and youthful. A little bit of this goes a long way so one or two squirts is enough to do your face and neck. Highly recommend giving this a try! Love this!
