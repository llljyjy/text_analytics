Received complimentary from Moon Juice. I really love the packaging. It’s simple and not cheaply made.  really wanted to like this product but I don’t think this one is best for me. The smell is SO strong and the texture is not my favorite. The texture is a jelly like texture and it doesn’t absorb into my skin nicely or quickly. It leaves behind a sticky residue and a very potent fragrance. I wouldn’t consider this a lightweight serum. The directions say to use both am and pm but honestly there’s no way i can wear makeup over top this serum without issues. While it does have a few wonderful ingredients, that definitely may be beneficial for those who aren’t sensitive, it’s thicker texture and fragrance is definitely not for those who have sensitive skin.  There is a bit of a cooling effect upon application which actually I do like. I think this product definitely could use some improvements before I can use as a holy grail for my skin. Stinky and sticky
