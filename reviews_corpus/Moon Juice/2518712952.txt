Gifted by Moon Juice. Ok so this is heavenly! My skin thrives on Hyaluronic acid and this has been giving me such a plump and youthful look to my skin. I am 50 and need all the help I can get! It smells amazing and soaks right I to the skin without leaving any sticky residue. I really appreciate that. I am loving this and the Acid Potion. Cannot wait to try more from the brand. This and the Acid Potion are on the stronger side so if you have sensitive skin you may want to incorporate these slowly into your routine. Holy Grail HA!
