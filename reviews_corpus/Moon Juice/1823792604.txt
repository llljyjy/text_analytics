The product is decent but where in the world are they getting off charging $60 for what amounts to four ingredients? Thatâ€™s over the top. I took the list to my local health food store and got individual bottles of the active ingredients - Glutathione, Astaxanthin, and a multi vitamin containing similar amounts of vitamin E and Vitamin C) and walked out with a three month supply of equivalent supplements for half the price of one bottle of this stuff. The other listed ingredients are primarily for the purpose of fillers and binders in the capsule so the four ingredients are the antioxidant actives in the moon juice formula . Outrageous price for 4 antioxidants
