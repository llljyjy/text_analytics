I originally purchased this Hyaluronic serum and the Ordinary Brand one because I got lip filler & was told that because hyaluronic acid is what the filler is, using it externally has a positive effect.  While skeptical, this stuff really does that and I notice a difference with fullness, even 9-11 months after the injection.  I have incredibly sensitive skin (if i touch my face, it will leave a red mark for 15 minutes, and i have PD) but I took a risk and tried this on my face at night, and now it’s an absolute staple.I use the acid potion, .025% tretinoin, this, and sole cerave moisturizers (including the healing ointment around my eyes) and it’s incredible how hydrated and smooth my skin is.  I live in the desert and dry, flaky skin is a year round problem. With this routine, I’ve noticed immediate positive results bought it for my lips, now use it all over my face
