The actives acids in Moon Juice are no joke! Go slow when introducing it to your routine, but it’s SO WORTH IT! I use it every day, and the most stubborn white heads and congestion caused by constant mask wearing and acne have disappeared. Even after the first 2-3 applications I could see the amazing brightening effects. I’ve seen a lot of other message boards calling this a natural dupe of the Biologique Recherche P50 Lotion, and I would agree. Same crazy-amazing benefits with a clean ingredient list, lower price point, and cute name and packaging. Definitely going to keep re-purchasing and using this! nan
