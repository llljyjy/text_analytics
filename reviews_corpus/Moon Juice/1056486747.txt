I love the packaging so cute! The scent is strong like mushroom or some herbs, it also lingers so if you donâ€™t like scent in skin care, might not be for you. The texture is like jelly per the claim and it absorbs into skin quickly giving the hydration my dry skin needs! Wonderful ingredients and my skin feels smooth and hydrated. Gifted by moon juice. Great serum texture but strong scent
