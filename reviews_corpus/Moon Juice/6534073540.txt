Gifted by Moon Juice. This exfoliating tonic truly lives up to its name. Every time I use it, my skin always feel smooth and is left with a beautiful glow. I not only use this toner for my face, but also my underarms and bikini line to keep ingrown hairs away. I have pretty resilient skin and I use this tonic every night without experiencing any irritation. I also love the fact that it doesnâ€™t have any alcohol in it so my skin is never left feeling dry or stripped of oils. nan
