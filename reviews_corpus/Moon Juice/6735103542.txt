I started using acid peels just a couple months ago, and this is my first time using acid exfoliator. I am impressed  how this product made my skin look and feel. It did a great job unclogging my pores and making them look smaller. It didn’t irritate my skin, it stings a bit at the begging or when using first time though. My skin looks clearer with minimal pores and smoother. I’ll definitely keep using it. Complimentary from Moon Juice Smoother skin with minimal pores
