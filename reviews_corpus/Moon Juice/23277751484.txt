I am no longer interested in products that are not safe.  I’m breastfeeding and trying to conceive again and it’s been a challenge to find products made with truly natural and safe ingredients.  I’m so glad I found this serum!  The smell isn’t wonderful but it doesn’t stay on the skin, after using it it disappears so that’s not a problem for me.  It moisturizes my skin well, better than other hyaluronic acids I’ve used. Great safe serum!!
