I love the ingredients in this potion and it isn’t too drying. I don’t use it every day because I have dry skin but I like to use AHA/BHAs for exfoliation and pore tightening. The smell of this is my fave - really clean with a nice citrus vibe. No breakouts either which is a bonus for me. Great product for keeping up with your exfoliation - I recommend! Received complimentary from Moon Juice and now I’m hooked. :) Loving this so far
