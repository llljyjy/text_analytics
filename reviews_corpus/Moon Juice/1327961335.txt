I’ve been trying to reduce my coffee intake, but I really like something to sip on in the morning, and Ting has become my GO TO to get my day started.  It tastes great, refreshing and not overpowering at all, and you only need to add a small amount to your water to reap the benefits so a little goes a long way. It’s also great mid day if I’m in a little slump. I’m glad I found this supplement and most importantly it’s made from top tier ingredients so I know what I’m putting into my body. I received Ting complimentary from Moon Juice in exchange for my honest review. Great start to my mornings
