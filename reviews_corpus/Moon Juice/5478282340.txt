I received these vitamins complimentary from Moon Juice…I’ve heard many say that ashwaganda is great for people with PCOS, but I’ve always been nervous to take it because I have allergic reactions to mushrooms. I took a chance on these, and I’m so happy I did! I feel so much more energized in the morning than I previously did. I used to feel really fatigued, and this has helped with that.  I highly recommend these and will continue to take them. AMAZING!
