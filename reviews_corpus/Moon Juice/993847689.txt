I’m a fan of ALL things plumping and hydrating (not to mention a HUGE Moon Juice supplement devotee) so I was thrilled to finally test out the Moon Juice Plump Jelly Hyaluronic Serum. This is my first time trying their skincare and I’m really impressed with the results. I just had covid which evolved into pneumonia and after blowing my nose for 2 weeks straight my skin was incredibly flaky and irritated. I applied this the moment it arrived and it has been my saving grace! Within a day my skin was transformed and I just know this is going to be essential for my dehydrated, aging skin in the winter months. *Gifted by Moon Juice in exchange for my honest review. nan
