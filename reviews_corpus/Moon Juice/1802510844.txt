I take this w Moon Juice Hair and Nail vitamins, and have seen a nice difference in my skin. Iâ€™m 51 and am in the sun a lot, and I feel that this has made my skin look moist / not as dry, and has lessened the wrinkles and fine lines. Now I only see wrinkles when I smile, where I was seeing them even when my face was relaxed. Some reviewers thought they were big / awkward to take, but I have had bigger pills, and have no problems swallowing these as well as 4 Hair and Nails pills - just drink lots of water! Great skin
