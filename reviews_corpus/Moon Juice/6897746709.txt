This product was gifted by moon juice. I never usually go for supplements you drink, I find that the ones I try have a weird after taste but something about this one I really wanted to try! I am a big coffee drinker and am looking to drink less caffeine so I thought this would be the perfect pick me up in the morning + boost my metabolism. I actually really like it so far! I make my own juice and I love to add this to an orange base juice. The favor is pretty good (if you like mango) and I find I’m not as tired in the mornings (not as strong as caffeine but I’m at least I’m not jittery) Tastes pretty good
