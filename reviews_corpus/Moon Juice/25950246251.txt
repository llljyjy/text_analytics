Gifted by Moon Juice. Lately I’ve been loving anything skincare and this exfoliator is actually really nice. I love that it leaves my face feeling refresh. It doesn’t make it feel tight or over exfoliated. I also like that it as niacinamide as an ingredient. I’ve been really enjoying this product lately. nan
