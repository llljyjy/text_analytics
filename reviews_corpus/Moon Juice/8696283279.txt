I was gifted by Moon Juice and I wasn’t sure what to expect from this product but I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. It mixes well in the water and tastes good! I’ve added it to my diet for a few weeks now and it’s hard to say if I have a ton more energy from this specifically but I do enjoy the taste. It’s a little expensive for results that hard to measure. nan
