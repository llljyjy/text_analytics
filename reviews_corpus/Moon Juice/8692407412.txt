The name makes it sound a bit scary, but it’s something very opposite. The bottle looks super cute and elegant. I usually ONLY use gentle chemical Exfoliators trying moon Juice for the first time my skin felt clean and refreshed. It isn’t harsh and does the job wonderfully. I suffer post acne hyperpigmentation, looking forward to long term results of using this. nan
