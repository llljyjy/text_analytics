I absolutely love the moon juice line. What really drew me in was the aesthetic. And then I researched and really wanted to try the products. As somebody who is pretty minimalistic… I felt like this would last a long time and it actually has. I ordered the entire line last Christmas 2021 and it has lasted me until now February 2022. A little goes a long way. Here’s the thing, those who are saying they dislike to send… You really have to consider what “type” of person you are… what I mean is, if you’re someone who doesn’t like earthy patchouli-ish scents, skip this! I believe this company targets the more boho girl with its aesthetic, ingredients, and scent. It’s def not going to be for everyone for sure, but not all products are. I can’t stand any floral scents in any skincare… even if it’s great… so I get it, but be warned. Haha if you like earthy stuff… you’ll love this line. I think the products are really nice and they feel good on my skin. I haven’t had any issues and keeps my skin looking fresh. I don’t wear makeup outside if lip color (Noto is sooooo good btw) and a good mascara….. that’s pretty much it. So if you’re like me and super earthy, vegan… boho type. You need to try this stuff! Thanks and love you! Earthy girls will luvvvvv!
