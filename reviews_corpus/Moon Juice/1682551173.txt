I received Ting complimentary from Moon Juice in exchange for my honest review. Good things do come in little packages! I was really hesitant of it at first because it doesn’t smell the best, but it tastes fantastic - like mango! It dissolves very quickly and makes it ever so much easier for me to drink my first glass of water in the morning. I also love the little burst of energy I get to fuel my morning when I don’t feel like making tea. While I wish this had more than 25 servings, I really love it and hope Moon Juice comes out with bigger jars of it! The jar also makes a great reusable container after you’ve used it all. nan
