I SWEARR by this exfoliant. It works incredibly well with my sensitive skin and significantly speeds up the healing process of any blemishes or hyperpigmentation I experience. It reduces my pores and leaves me glowing. The packaging it impeccably made because it allows the product to dispense directly onto ur hands and still prevent product waste. It has lasted me super long which I love about moon juice. Unlike Osea, you’re getting your money’s worth here. I say this with the utmost respect, if this product didnt work for you, you’re not applying it properly (as in not following up immediately with a moisturizer) or you’re simply allergic to an ingredient. I love this product so much I wrote a whole blog post about it don’t get me ACTUALLY started. Holy Grail exfoliator
