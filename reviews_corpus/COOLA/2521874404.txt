I’m not sure what all the negative reviews are about. The applicator is a little strange but it’s not hard to use, it’s just not something i’ve seen before. It is very thin but it’s an oil so I just feel like that is expected. As for the taste everyone is talking about, if you get in your mouth it has the slightest sunscreen taste (again, not unexpected since it has spf) but it really isn’t anything that bad at all. It feels really nice and it gives the prettiest shine to your lips! nan
