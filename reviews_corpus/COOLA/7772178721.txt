I was hoping to love this, but it’s not my favorite. The color is a nice golden tint, but it’s uneven. Since it’s a lotion, I used my hands to rub it in which was a mistake as my hands are now a different color and streaky in between my fingers. I guess you could use a mit, but I think it would be too difficult to tell where you’ve already applied since it’s clear. I think this product could be used in between tans but I wouldn’t solely rely on it as your only source of color. It smells good though! Not My Favorite
