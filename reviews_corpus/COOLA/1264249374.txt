I love the hydrating effects of this product, it adds moisture but is not greasy. Love the protective features in terms of SPF and UVA/UVB. But I had to deduct two stars because the packaging is the worst. A pump would be so much better. As the product gets lower in the bottom, it’s harder to use the “eyedropper” style top to pull some out, but it’s also just cumbersome for quick applications. Please switch to a pump, Coola!! Great product, worst packaging ever
