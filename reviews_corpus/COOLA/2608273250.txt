Omg I’m so happy to finally see this available at Sephora! I adore this scalp sunscreen! The scent is amazing and coola if you’re reading this please make this scent available in other forms. It smells like a fresh woodsy beachy salty vibe, kind of in the same vein as Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt but like more fresh and light, perfect for days on the beach. My scalp never burns when using this product but as someone with thin hair I have absolutely applied too much and had some greasy looking hair but that is 100% user error lol highly recommend! I’ve purchased many times from other retailers. LOVE!!!
