I really wanted to love this. It smells good, doesn’t leave a white sheen and has a high SPF which are all things I was looking for. However, I am 100% confident it attracts mosquitos. I took it on vacation along with an already open bottle of an unscented sunscreen I was trying to finish. The first day I used this one, I had 6 mosquito bites after being outside for around 5 hours. The next day I switched to my grandma’s cheapo smear on sunscreen and had no more bites for the remainder of the trip. Not worth it! nan
