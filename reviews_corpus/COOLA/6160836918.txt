I love coola products generally but no where did it state this was a tinted sunscreen (comes out very beigey) and it’s very sticky on the skin (even after 15 minutes and allowing it to absorb better into my skin, still sticky) Also has an odd scent to it. Love the company and the overall ingredients and quality, this just wasn’t it and I was really looking for a good matte sunscreen like Coola used to have until the discontinued it, so I tried this one. Tinted and sticky
