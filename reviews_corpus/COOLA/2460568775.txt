I love it to top off my spf protection when I’mOff for lunch in peak UV hours. I spray myself 15 min before I leave my office. It does make a loud noise when you shake it. Also when you spritz it, you’re left with a cloud of weird scent that you must walk away from with your eyes closed. For the reviewers complaining about the spilling, I’ve been there. But now I keep it upright in a pocket inside my purse. No spills whatsoever. For the reviewers complaining about the white splotches, you must shake it vigorously before spraying-you will not get any splotches that way. Only downside is the scent. Can’t do anything about that. follow directions and keep upright, bad smell tho
