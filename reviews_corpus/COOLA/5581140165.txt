I personally loved this. I used it as my last AM skincare step and instantly fell in love.. it was such an experience and felt so nice of my skin. I made my sister try it! My face is SUPER sensitive so I really appreciate the unscented, which did not break me out. I have combo/oily skin and I felt this was nice and moisturizing. I will continue using and so far would repurchase. I have purchased one other sunscreen (bliss) like a year ago and have yet to try it so the fact I kept reaching for this says a lot! Fell in love
