The taste itself isn’t too bad. It’s a hint of sweetness and maybe a little chemically but it’s bearable. There is an aftertaste though. The only thing is that it comes off so easily so I feel like I have to reapply it over and over again. For the price I don’t feel like it’s worth it. But it feels nice on the lips. It’s just too thin. nan
