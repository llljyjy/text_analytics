A lot of people complain that this product has alcohol and that alcohol smell but it’s really needed in this formulation to make it great. It is really difficult to reapply spf over makeup especially if you prone to acne. The thought of putting anything over an oily acne prone face with makeup gives me a cringe feeling but spf reapplication is so important. Lab muffin (phd cosmetic chemist) explained that those spf reapplication brush on powders don’t give you enough spf, so we are limited in options if your wearing a full face of makeup. Supergoop makes a resetting spray but it also has alcohol and it has some pore clogging ingredients in it. According to INCI decoder, this product is the most acne safe way to re apply spf over makeup. Yes it doesn’t smell great but it’s protecting you from those UVA rays that causes skin cancer and ages you. nan
