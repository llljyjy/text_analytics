I like the concept of this product. It is important to reapply suncreen throughout the say and this product looked like a good option. I like the fact that it was a mist which would be great for all seasons. However, this has a super strong scent and unfortunately the reason i returned it. It has a tropical scent and it is STRONG. It doesnt go away and you just smell like a pina colada the WHOLE DAY. I wished they made this unscented. It also left a slight film on my face but honestly wasnt such a deal breaker. The scent however is a major deal breaker. Scent is overpowering
