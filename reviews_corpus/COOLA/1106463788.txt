I almost never write reviews but had to rave about this one, as it’s the one product that my skin cannot live without! I had been searching for a daily moisturizer that also has a high SPF and tried many before finding this one. It does exactly what it says it does - it feels refreshing to put on and is super hydrating, even in the dead of winter. It does leave a nice sheen but I love it - my face doesn’t feel sticky or greasy, it just has a healthy glow. So if you’re looking for a matte finish, this isn’t for you. It is expensive, but I’ve tried lower priced options and they just haven’t worked as well for me. So I’m sticking with it! Highly, highly recommend. A must-have!
