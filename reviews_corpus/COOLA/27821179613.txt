I found that this product worked really well. I purchased this product for reapplying my sunscreen while on vacation in Portugal, and my face didn’t sunburn once! That being said, I did apply sunscreen before my makeup (Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics), did my makeup, applied my regular setting spray, then applied this on top. Throughout the day every few hours I reapplied this sunscreen to make sure I didn’t burn and to keep my makeup looking fresh. I have oily skin and I didn’t feel like it was making me overly oily, but it definitely can build up and cause a shine by the end of the day. I wouldn’t use this as my only form of sun protection, but I found it very useful for reapplication. The sun in Portugal is STRONG, and I am very pale, so the fact that I never burned by the evening is pretty impressive. The bottle is cheaply made, and my lid cracked. The product can become messy on the applicator and can develop a build-up. Not a perfect product by any means, but if you’re looking for something to help keep your makeup on and reapply your sunscreen throughout the day - this might be a good option. Good For Reapplication Throughout The Day
