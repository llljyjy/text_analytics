good lip SPF for layering over a lipstick/balm. Noticed a lot of people were not happy with the applicator (plastic curved wand), I found it useful in not absorbing access product and useful for even coverage. Fairly expensive for such a small amount, and over time I found it to be somewhat gritty with use. I noticed no unpleasant sunscreen smell. nan
