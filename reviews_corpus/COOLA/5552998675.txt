I want to buy this again, I really do. But it ruined my counter and table and makeup stand and everything I set it on the first time around. The bottle leaks- there is nothing you can do to avoid it or prevent it. It’s not as simple as wiping it off after use. Also- If you don’t care about that beware it has a VERY chemically smell. It’s like spraying fumes on your face. I hope they fix the bottle and can reformulate to lessen the fumes. It does work for oily skin and doesn’t make you slimy like most sunscreens though. Decent product- terrible package.
