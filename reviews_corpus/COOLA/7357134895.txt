I’m legitimately so shocked by these reviews! This stuff has been such a game changer for me. I use CAY SKIN Isle Glow Face Moisturizer with SPF 45, bronzer and this on top and feel like I have some decent sun protection on my face. A few things:This has insane mattifying properties. I sweat. A LOT. It sucks. I live in Houston, where it is hot and humid as all get out. Not a good mix. This stuff keeps my makeup on and actually prevents me from looking like I’m melting. Also-- I experienced a huge hair loss and had to go on a regime to regrow it. So I have (thankfully!) a gazillion baby hairs. This not only sets my makeup but actually keeps my hair in place without looking like I used anything! No baby hairs unless I want them. Does it smell like alcohol when you first spray it? I guess? It smells more like sunscreen to me. WHICH MAKES SENSE, my friends. It fades quickly and is really not a big deal at all.For people with bottle problems-- I get it. They have some work to do. But I’m just careful with travel, and I clean the sprayer every now and then to remove gunk for an even spray. I just finished an entire bottle and was able to get every last spray.The moral of the story is, if you are a sweaty Eddie and want to look totally unbothered with some sun protection, try this. You might be as thrilled as I was. Hold up...
