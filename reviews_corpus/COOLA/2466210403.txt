I have used quiet a few sunscreens in my time, but it was difficult to find one that: is good under a face of makeup; good on its own on a normal day; good for longterm wear at the pool; and not greasy or heavy. This stuff is perfection. It checks all my marks. It behaves really well under makeup and does not make it smear or wear off sooner like some sunscreens can. It isnâ€™t drying or heavy, it is moisturizing while also sinking into the skin well and does not leave any oily residue or heaviness behind. It works really well at protecting the skin even if I am at the pool for hours under the sun at the hottest time of day. I really love this stuff, a little bit goes a long ways and it does the job it is supposed to. I would heavily recommend if you are searching for a good face sunscreen. A wonderful sunscreen that does it's job WELL!
