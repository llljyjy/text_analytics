I have rosacea and very fair skin and live in the hot, humid climate of southwest Louisiana. Daily sunscreen use has been a priority for me for decades now. This sunscreen is my go to and has been for several years, so much so that I always try to keep a spare bottle on hand. It applies like silk, and is one of the few sunscreens I’ve ever found that is truly invisible on the skin and does not impact your makeup. It’s slightly moisturizing without being greasy or heavy, and I cannot imagine using anything else. Great product. Holy grail sunscreen
