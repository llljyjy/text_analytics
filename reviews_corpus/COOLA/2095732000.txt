I love this sunscreen, it has an amazing smooth and buttery texture that leaves your skin looking and feeling soft and supple. It is not overly greasy as many sunscreens can be nor does it start to peel after re-applying it which is great. However, I will note that if you use this daily and re-apply your sunscreen throughout the day this runs out really quickly. I have had mine for barely a month and it is running out. Kinda disappointing at this price point but I guess that is to be expected if youâ€™re re-applying it. Great sunscreen, runs out quickly
