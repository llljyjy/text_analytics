I almost never write reviews, but this product deserves one. As I said in my title, it’s my go to sunscreen. I was struggling for a long time to find a sunscreen that wouldn’t pill under foundation, and here it is. It’s so easy to layer with skincare and makeup, I’ve never had an issue with it causing pilling. I also love the glow that it gives me, but if you have oily skin and you’re looking for something that doesn’t exaggerate your natural glow, you might want to keep looking. All in all, I love this sunscreen, and I hope they come out with a higher SPF version soon! My go to sunscreen
