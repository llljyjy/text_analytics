Overall a nice product. The smell is pretty bade althoigh not as bad as some other comments say. The consistency is definitely thicker than I am used to but mineral sunscreens usually are especillay when you are looking for a matte finish. This has some pigment to it so it does even out the skin nicely and it wear BEAUTIFULLY undermakeup. You can feel it on you skin but I will take the few cons for the overall finish, protection, and that it plays nice with other products. Will Keep Using but Some Cons
