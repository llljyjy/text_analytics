It pains me to write this review because Coola sunscreen products are amazing. But this sunscreen setting spray, although a great idea is just awful. It smells like I am spraying my face with alcohol—literally. I have to hold my breath because it’s hard to breathe after spraying my face. If Coola removes that horrendous alcohol scent I would definitely try again. But for now, it’s $30 down the drain. Unbearable Alcohol Scent
