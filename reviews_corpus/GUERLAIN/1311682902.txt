This seemed like an amazing product and I wanted to love it. Like really wanted to love it. I tried it once and broke out from it. I figured my skin just needed to adjust to it. I tried it for a week and constantly broke out from it. It might be the right product for some people but unfortunately not for me. I did receive this product for free and am posting an honest comment. Ok product
