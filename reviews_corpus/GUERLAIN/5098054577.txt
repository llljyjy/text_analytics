I have a very similar serum/essence for less than $30 that is way more effective than this. There is so much fragrance in this product and it leaves a sticky feeling on my skin. After a month of use, I didnâ€™t notice any positive difference. It actually made my pores appear larger which is obviously not ideal. The packaging is beautiful, but for the price absolutely not worth it in my opinion. High Price does not equal High Quality
