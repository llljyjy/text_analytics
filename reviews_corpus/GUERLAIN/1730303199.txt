I love this serum. I am 5 months postpartum and my fluctuating hormones have destroyed my skin. My skin has been uneven, dull, full of acne, greasy. It’s made me really sad. Paired with a good exfoliant, this serum has saved my skin. It has made it more even in texture, more balanced, has erased fine lines and has made my skin radiant. After using this just once I noticed a different, and using it consistently this serum has saved my skin. I love the texture. I thought it would be greasy but it wasn’t. It’s easy to spread and yet gets absorbed quickly and isn’t sticky. It’s easy to wear under moisturizer and makeup or on its own. I did find the scent too strong and overpowering. I wasn’t too keen about that. I would still highly recommend this. Love it!
