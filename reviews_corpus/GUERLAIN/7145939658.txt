Guerlain Abielle’s Royal Double R Advanced Serum has some seriously luxurious packaging. Two chambers hold separate products that pump into your hand at the same time to really boost your benefits. The bottle works well, and easily and the golden bees are beautiful. I don’t always rave about packaging because honestly it sometimes feels you’re paying premium prices for a mid product in a nice bottle, but I don’t feel that way at all about this serum. The product matches the bottle. I love the scent. It’s a fresh scent with a hint of honey that reminds me of classic products I love best. And it has left my face super soft, plump, fresh, and absolutely GLOWING. I cannot say enough positive things about this one. Run and buy it. New favorite!!
