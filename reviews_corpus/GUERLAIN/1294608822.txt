I received a sample of this in a Sephora gift box at Christmas.  I ignored it until about 2 months ago.  I have very dry, flaky, sensitive skin so it’s nerve-wracking to try anything new and I have to be careful with “natural“ products because a lot of times they are plant based and due to allergies they tend make my face an absolute disaster.  I fell in love instantly.  My skin is no longer dry.  I use it in the morning and before bed after my toner and I have eliminated any need for face creams.  My skin has improved noticeably in the 2 months since I’ve been using this product.  Blemishes clear up faster.  The fine lines are diminished.  My skin has a glow I don’t think it has ever had.  I am sensitive to strong smelling products, to me this is a strong scent, but the results are worth it! Dry skin fixed!
