Upon application, I feel immediately hydrated and luminous; not to mention, it layers extremely well under other products. It sinks into the face without sitting heavily on top, but it doesn’t completely disappear to the point where I feel like I’ve just splashed some water on my face. It is the perfect base layer for any skin care regimen. A must for skin care routine
