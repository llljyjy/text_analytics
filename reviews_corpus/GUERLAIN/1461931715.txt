I was glad to see that such a pricey product did show results right away. The first morning after using this serum my skin felt noticeably smoother and less textured. I especially found it effective with the Guerlain watery oil. I think this is a great entry retinol product as itâ€™s effective without being harsh. I am able to use two pumps morning and night with no peeling. I only docked a star because the packaging feels a bit cheap with the bulky plastic pump. Nice and effective
