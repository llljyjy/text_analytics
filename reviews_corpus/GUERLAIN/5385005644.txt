Before trying this my skin was very dehydrated. If looked dry with all my makeup formulas and look lackluster. When I first started using the serum I needed 3 pumps just to feel hydrated. Hydration and luminosity was instant. Within a week or so  of daily use I was down to two pumps for face& neck application. I can truly see how the serum improved the look of lines on my skin and gave a bounce of suppleness back to my cheeks. I love the subtle scent and the pump packaging. I’d definitely try more of this line as I’m confident in its any aging abilities. Supple skin
