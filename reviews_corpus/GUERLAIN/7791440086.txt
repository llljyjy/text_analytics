I wanted to use this for about a month before I posted any thing about it to see if there was any differences. I actually really liked this product. The smell of it reminded me of my mothers perfume. It is very fragrant I really like how the two compartments come together to become one products. I also really like the bottle. It is very luxurious and looks great on my sink top. Gorgeous bottle and stunning product
