Not only is the packing and product it self so luxurious but it smells divine as well. The scent may be strong to to some but slowly disappears as your skin soaks it in. I used this for almost two months straight and I can say my skin is so happy. The texture is so smooth and creamy, and the cream it self is extremely hydrating. It kept my skin looking flawless and my acne at bay. When I didnâ€™t use it, I noticed my skin slowly transitioning to feeling and looking dull and dehydrated. I love everything about this cream and will definitely continue to use it and repurchase. Luxurious & Rich Serum
