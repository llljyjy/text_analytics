First of all, the bottle is beyond beautiful. I was excited to try this out since Guerlain’s products are out of my budget. It smells amazing! This must be what heaven smells like. The 2 formula comes out of the pump and you warm/mix it up in your hands to apply on your face. It doesn’t feel sticky like most serums do. My face feels soft and the texture has improved after a few uses. nan
