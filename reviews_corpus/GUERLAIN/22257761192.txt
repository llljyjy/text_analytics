This product actually surprised me - I wasn’t sure if it was right for my dry/combination skin but it ended up being such a delight to use and gave my skin such a healthy, glasslike glow! I will absolutely be repurchasing for the slight exfoliation and beautiful sheen it gives my skin. Highly recommend this if you’re looking for that special extra step of serum in your standard routine. Perfect!
