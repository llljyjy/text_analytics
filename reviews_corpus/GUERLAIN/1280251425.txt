Love this serum by GUERLAIN which has a powerful mix of ingredients including Ouessant and Ikaria Honeys which leave skin feeling plump, hydrated, balanced with improved texture and radiance. The packaging is beautiful and every time I apply it feels like I’m giving myself and skin a treat. The serum is scented which I enjoy but if you’re sensitive to fragrance you may not. It’s lightweight, soaks in well and wears great under additional products and makeup. This is one of my favorite serums right now. It’s been fun watching it transform my skin! Winner!!
