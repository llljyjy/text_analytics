This is a very nice watery serum that helps give a little bit of glow and is good for dry skin, my problem with this product is the price.  For less, there are many Korean serums that work just as well if not better.  For me this serum is not worth the price, it is nice, but for me its not worth its price tag. Watery quick absorbing serum, not worth the price
