I do notice a Radiant Glowy look after using the serum which I absolutely love I also noticed that it does pump out my fine lines. I’ve only used it for a week and a half so far I will come back after a month but I was required to write the review now. I don’t know that I would ever pay $225 for a serum that doesn’t give me a full facelift. This is equal to most of their service that I’ve used and I just am not kidding the experience or the reason the price point is so high Nice serum
