This is by far one of the best, if not the best, serum I’ve used. I have very dry skin and I’ve learned that I need to use both water-based products and oil to make my skin happy. This serum is the perfect combo of both. It’s also silicone-free which is a nice bonus. It leaves my skin very soft, hydrated, and overall healthy looking. I use it after a toner and before a moisturizer. I am prone to very stubborn clogged pores on my nose and chin and while this doesn’t clear my pores, it doesn’t make them worse either. The texture is very light and thin. It has little floating balls within it that breaks apart easily in your hands. I’m not sure what ingredients are in them but it does work better when I make sure to include a few. I do find I have to shake up the serum so the balls are evenly distributed before I use the dropper. Now for the downside, this has a very strong perfume-like scent. I debated taking off a star for the fragrance but honestly this serum is so great I didn’t. I have very sensitive skin and the fragrance hasn’t caused irritation, it just smells strong. It’s rare to find an expensive skincare product that’s worth the money but I’m on my third (maybe fourth?) bottle of this stuff and will continue to buy it. While expensive, one bottle lasts a few months and I use it twice a day, so it lasts awhile. If you have dry or dehydrated skin, I would definitely try this! Love this serum!
