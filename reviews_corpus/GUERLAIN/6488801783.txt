I made sure to test this product for at least a month before leaving my review. I used it diligently, morning and night and sometimes in combination with the watery oil. I find that it really did make a difference in my skin. It’s not overnight and it’s not super dramatic, but my dullness went away and it’s a great gentle exfoliator. You really have to decide if the cost is worth it to you because it’s quite pricy. Soft, glowy skin
