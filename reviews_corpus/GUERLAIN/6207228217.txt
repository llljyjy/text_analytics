I am on week three of using this product and I am very satisfied with the results. First off, the packaging is super lux. Heavy and beautiful. The product itself is creamy and rich but feels light and hydrated on my face. When I first started use by it I needed a bit more than one pump to feel hydrated but now one pump is the perfect amount to make my skin glow and look great!I still have fine lines but that’s Mother Nature not the product. Bottom line is that it’s delightful and I’m happy with it! Really lovely
