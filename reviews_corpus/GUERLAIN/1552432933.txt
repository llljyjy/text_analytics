I was recently gifted Guerlain’s Abeille Royal Double R Advanced Serum by Influenster in return for my honest review. And while nothing quite floats my boat like a good old tube of Retin-A…this product and formulation is noticeably powerful!! The beautiful glass bottle is not only pretty on the eye, but it houses 96% naturally derived ingredients as well as AHA’s and BHA’s to combat a whole source of skincare issues. I have been using this product twice daily for 2 weeks, and I have noticed a huge improvement in my texture, tone and clarity!! If you’re on the fence, get off it, and go get yourself a bottle!! Your skin will thank you!! Glass Bottle of Youth
