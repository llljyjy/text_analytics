I have older sensitive skin. I am still dealing with hormonal breakout, oiliness, dryness, and fine lines. I try a product and it seems fine, but then my skin freaks out. I never know if it just me or the product. This cream seemed to calm down a lot of issues, making my skin more consistently good.  There is a scent but I find it very pleasant and it is not noticeable after applying. It is pricey but worth it to me. I bought this with my own money after I had tried a sample from a different store. Recommend. My new favorite
