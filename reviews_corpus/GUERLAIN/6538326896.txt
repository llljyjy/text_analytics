Im heading into my 30s so I wanted to splurge on more high end products to keep any fine lines at bay. Unfortunately with this product (so far since the purchase) it hasn’t been working as well as I’d hope. I havent seen too much of an improvement on any fine lines I’ve developed which would’ve still been fine with me if this balm was moisturizing enough. It has a weird greasy feel when you put it on your face and it sort of sits there. Giving it 3 stars because Im not done the entire jar (maybe it’ll be better with more time), I like the smell of the balm and the jar looks beautiful. Not super worth the price tag
