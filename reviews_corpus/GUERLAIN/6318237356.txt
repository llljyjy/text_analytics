I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I LOVE this stuff! I started out using it at night and in the morning under my make up. I like the smell so that didn’t bother me. After a couple weeks I thought my face looked oily as the day went on so I changed it and just used it at night. It made my face feel refreshed, clean, and glowing. I went out of town for a week and accidentally forgot to take this.. I was so upset and couldn’t wait to get home to use it. It is a little pricey but I love the way my skin looks while using it. 100% BUY
