I’ve been eyeballing the abeille royale set for months and finally caved. Its the first cream i try in a long time that works it’s magic super quickly like after just a day. My skin was dry for the longest time and nothing seemed to help it except this. Your skin feel dewy but oily and smooth and soft and amazing! I pair it with the youth oil and it does absolute wonders I’ve even gotten a few compliments lately that i look more relaxed and I’m SURE it’s because of how glowy my skin is hahaha! Absolutely worth the price
