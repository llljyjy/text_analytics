Disclaimer, I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this serum daily for the past 3 weeks, and I’ve noticed some pretty positive results. Pore visibility! I’ve always been sensitive about how visible my pores are, and that has been the biggest change I’ve noticed! I agree with other reviewers that it absorbs very well, and doesn’t feel heavy post-application. I also agree that it is heavily perfumed, which typically bother me HOWEVER I actually really the love the floral-y/clean scent and it typically doesn’t last long for me (think spa-like). I also notice that my skin is slightly brighter and I’m hoping that will continue with more use. Finally, 5 star packaging and dispenser. The honeycomb details read super luxe and I’m into it. Consider me obsessed!
