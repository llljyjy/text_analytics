I got this as incentivized. The package is really wonderful with very nice gold color and it gives the image that this serum very ’royal’. The texture is thick but really quick absorbing into my skin. It has fragrance but it does not bother me at all. The main ingredient is honeys and royal jelly. It claims that a skincare program with Blackbee Repair technology which helps stimulate the key mechanisms of the skin’s revitalizing process to help continuously correct wrinkles and loss of tissue firmness. Since i do not have wrinkles yet so i can not let you know that it helps wrinkles, the frimbess yes maybe little bit as i feel my face become plummpy and firm which is i love it. This is worth to try and buy Nice to try as a serum
