I have loved using this in my morning routine for a littlebit of extra pampering! The formula feels so soothingand soft on my skin, it doesnâ€™t leave an oily or overlyhydrated residue, it just makes me feel like I havenaturally glowing skin! Though the price tag is higherthan I typically spend on skincare, I think the splurge isworth it as a little goes a long way. Super Silky
