First and foremost this product looks and feels extremely luxurious. From the packaging to the product itself it is very beautiful. The fragrance is lovely (like a perfume) A little goes a long way so the bottle should last a while. It absorbs well and does feel moisturizing to the extent that I donâ€™t feel the need to put anything additional on after. It is definitely making my skin purge a bit but that seems common with the ingredients. I have only been using the serum for a few days but can absolutely see that my skin is lifted and bright in the morning. I look forward to seeing more results after longer user.I received these products for free from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. Gorgeous product
