I’m 27 and I have combination skin that is prone to redness and texture issues. I really liked the way this made my skin look after using it for the last few weeks. I have a static wrinkle across my forehead that’s been trying to take hold and some lines around my eyes. I feel like this helped soften the texture of my skin as well as diminish any noticeable signs of the lines. It also just feels like the most luxe product. It’s gorgeous packaging, smells nice and brings me back to that feeling of being young watching your older sister or mom putting on her skincare and wishing to be as put together as that. I love it and will be using it for the foreseeable future. Splurge Worthy Routine Regular
