I LOVED this product. It sinks into your skin so easily and leaves a light layer of hydration.  If you have dry skin, this will likely be too lightweight on its own. My one gripe about this product since it is a lightweight watery oil, you will finish it really quick. The consistency is so thin that it is super easy to go overboard with this item. This fullsize bottle only lasted me a month, and for that pricetag itâ€™s genuinely not a sustainable product for me. A guilty pleasure for sure if you want to add something special to your skincare routine but if you are looking for a skincare staple, this is not it. nan
