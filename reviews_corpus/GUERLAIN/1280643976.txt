I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The fragrance is a little strong but I don’t mind it! The only downside is the product caused me to breakout immediately and in abundance. I’ve been using this on targeted areas instead of full face to prevent further breakouts. Beside the breakouts, it gives an instantly smooth appearance and a nice vibrant glow. Skin Plumping & Glowy
