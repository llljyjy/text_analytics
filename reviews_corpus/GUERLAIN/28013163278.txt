First off, such a pleasant and light honey scent! I’ve been using this serum in my nighttime skincare routine for the past week, and I’m loving my results so far! A little goes a long way, so each bottle will last you a while. It’s fantastic for plumping fine lines, yet firming and tightening the skin as well. It makes my skin look so dewy, bright and youthful after I use it! nan
