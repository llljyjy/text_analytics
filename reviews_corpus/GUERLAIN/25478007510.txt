I’ve been using this serum for just about 30 days and I’ve noticed my skin is more radiant, smoother and my pores even look much smaller. I even noticed the fine lines around my eyes starting to slowly disappear. It doesn’t leave any sticky residue and leaves my face nice and hydrated. It has a kind of sweet floral scent but fades pretty quickly. It also layers extremely well under other products. Guerlain’s Double R serum features a double canister, so each ingredient is preserved separately. One side, which holds the white honey concentrate, focuses on radiance; while the other, containing resurfacing AHAs and PHAs. It also has the added benefits of honey and royal jelly which is famous for its repairing and anti-aging properties. This product contains alcohol so it’s not the best choice for people suffering from certain skin conditions. I’m a sucker for nice packaging and this didn’t disappoint. The bottle is simply gorgeous and I love the little bee detail on the side of the bottle. This is on the pricier side, ranging from $165.00 - $225.00 but it’s worth it. I’ll definitely l be purchasing this once I start to see I’m running low. Simply amazing
