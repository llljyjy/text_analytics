This packaging is gorgeous! It reminds me of Hollywood glamour with this sitting on a makeup vanity table in a boudoir. Since the top ingredient is Glycerin this feels more like a serum to me rather than an oil. It feels super light as a person with oily skin and doesnâ€™t make me feel greasy at the end of the day. The oil has a strong floral scent which might be overpowering to some people but I like it! It adds to the glamour of it. If you want to splurge on yourself this is your product :) Luxurious!
