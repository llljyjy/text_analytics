So I received this full size serum from Guerlain & Influenster for free in exchange for my absolute honest review. That’s what I’m going to give you.This serum is very luxurious and makes you feel special when using it. The bottle is beautiful, but what matters is what’s on the inside. This formula is two different types mixed together through the pump. One side looks like straight honey, an the other side has other goodies within the formula. I think this serum is very very hydrating, but also very sticky. It sits on your skin an never melts in hardly. You don’t even have to wear a moisturizer if your normal or dry skin. I wouldn’t even recommend to the oily skin folks. You won’t like this formula. It feels like honey is on your face, so I’d advise to use this at night. I actually like how my face looks like a glazed doughnut after applying. If your sensitive to scents, this might be a bit too much for you. The scent is very strong, but does go away after a little bit. A lot of people were complaining about the scent. It reminds me of rich old lady in the best possible way. Overall, I like this product, I just need to use it longer to actually see results. It’s not for oily skin. It is sticky also.
