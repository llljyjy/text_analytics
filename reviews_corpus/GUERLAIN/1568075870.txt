The Guerlain Abielle Royale Double R Advanced Serum leverages royal jelly from uniquely preserved environments. I personally prefer products that use ingredients made from honey. Honey has so many healing properties and has been utilized for centuries by cultures across the globe. I loved the divided delivery system on this product. The white honey concentrate delivers intense soothing moisturizing while the yellow side delivers AHA’s  and PHA’s. PHA’s are fruit based acids that bring the benefits of AHA’s and BHA’s to target sun damage, aging and firmness of skin. I’m 45 with mature skin and wish that I would have invested more in skincare earlier in my life. However revolutionary products like these provide a wide range of benefits for individuals of all ages. My skin feels more soft, supple and radiant after utilizing this product consistently. I will say that the fragrance on this product is significant but I had no issues, reactions or outbreaks while utilizing this product Grown by Nature, Perfected by Guerlain
