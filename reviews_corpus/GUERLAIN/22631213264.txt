Love everything about it save for the fact that it causes me to have really bad breakouts. I never breakout. Quite disappointed by that fact. I love Guerlain. I have really dry skin and I needed something hydrating under my foundation. Love to mix this with the new foundation but Iâ€™m not thrilled about the new skin condition. Sad. Wanted so badly to love it.
