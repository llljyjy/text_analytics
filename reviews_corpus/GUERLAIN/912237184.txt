Im sorry but I couldn’t get past the scent. It’s so strong and nausea inducing. If you like perfumy face products you might have better success. I put it on the back on my hand bc I didn’t want it near my face, the texture was super sticky and did not absorb quickly enough. Skin was tacky. I can’t imagine this working well under other products. Maybe I got a bad one, but would not buy. I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Instant migraine
