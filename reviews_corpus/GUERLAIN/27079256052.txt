Fancy and luxe. I do enjoy the scent and it feels hydrating on my skin, I will say it has a slightly sticky residue that I don’t enjoy on my hands and like it doesn’t get absorbed right away. Good for my face overnight and that’ll be my main use. Thanks for the opportunity to test and review Influenster. Luxe face oil
