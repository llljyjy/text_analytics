Disclaimer: I received Guerlain’s Abielle Royale Double R Advanced Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. Can we talk about how GORGEOUS the bottle is? And the scent is divine. If there’s anything I love as much as new hair products is skincare. And baybeeeee I am in love! This one product has replaced 3 of the serums I currently use in my skin care routine. The price point is a little high, as this is a luxury skin care product, but a little goes a long way and it’s definitely worth the ticket. It’s also a Clean at Sephora product which I love. This product tightens, firms, and gently exfoliates, I noticed an immediate glow and refined pores immediately upon application. I have oily skin, and I love that the serum is made for all skin types, and give a dewy glow without giving shiny penny. If you can manage, I’d definitely splurge and get some A treat
