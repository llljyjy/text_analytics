I really like the texture of this product  its not too oily or watery,  it melts into your skin right away and leaves it feeling super moisturized. it gives it a nice glow to it, and seems to make it more soft and even looking. throughout the day I’ve noticed it makes my skin seem more bright and youthful  , and people have been complimenting my “glow“ , (and this product is the only thing different in my skincare routine ). it smells high end, like a classy perfume  and looks pretty on my vanity as well. good quality product and I can’t wait to see the results after finishing this bottle! beautiful glow!
