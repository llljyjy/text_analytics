After trying this serum for awhile here are my thoughts! First of all, Wow! The bottle is super super pretty and super elegant... There is a bee on each side of the cap! The double compartment bottle is so cute and it’s environmentally friendly by keeping it in one bottle! The products are two super pretty shades of yellow/gold! They almost look like honey! The product says it needs to be warmed in your palms before applying it to your face and neck. So, after doing so and appling to my face, i was surprised that it felt kinda sticky.. so that was not really great. The scent wasn’t overwhelming or bad, it was nice and subtle.  Pretty close to immediately, my face felt firmer. This is my first time trying anything from this brand before, and I do have to say, i do like it so far.. this serum is great. I can’t wait to see if i actually have some really noticable results.. it says some should be seen in a few weeks, when following the instructions. So I’ll definitely be back to update as i go keep using in the coming months.. So far, I’d definitely recommend this serum... Super elegant!
