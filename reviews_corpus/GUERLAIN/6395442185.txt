First off I have to acknowledge just how pretty the bottle this comes in is. It looks great and I’ve had no issues with the pump at all. I did have a hard time wanting to use this regularly though because the scent was kinda off putting to me personally. Its really strong when you first apply the serum. When I did start actively trying to use it more regularly I did notice my skin felt softer and more hydrated after some time. I’m curious to finish off the bottle and see how I feel about the product then. nan
