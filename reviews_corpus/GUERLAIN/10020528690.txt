I received this product free in return of my honest review from Influenster and Guerlain. This was my first time trying this (higher end) brand of products and wow! This serum is incredible. After my first use I could tell my skin really needed it. My skin became super soft, hydrated, and it glowed! This product adds a beautiful vibrant tone to your skin without looking greasy and cheap. It very light on your skin and has a nice stronger (scent) too! It says to warm the product up between your fingers so it’s applied easier and I will agree it goes on a lot better that way. My pores seem to be a tad bit smaller/not as noticeable after using it for a week (night/day) which was is also a plus. I can’t wait to see how this product transforms my face over the next month! I would recommend this product to those who are in need of a beautiful glow and immediate hydration. Definitely worth the money.
