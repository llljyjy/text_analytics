The packaging of this serum is AMAZING.  It has such a luxury look to it.  There are also two portions of the serum that combine when you dispense.  I loved the gold details and there’s a little bee at the top.  The product was easy to use and felt great when applying.  There was a nice scent.  The only drawback was it took a while to sink into my skin so couldn’t apply makeup right away.  My skin felt amazing after using for a week and I would recommend!  I noticed a difference in fine lines after about two weeks. luxury moisturizer!
