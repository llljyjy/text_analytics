I got this about a month ago, and I wanted to try it out for a good enough time to find out if it’s worth it or not. Well let👏🏼 me 👏🏼tell 👏🏼you! It’s definitely worth it! I wish I had before and after pictures to show the difference. It has definitely made my skin look smooth and my pores are smaller. I got sunburned one day and the next day my face was practically healed. The redness was gone. I love it! I use it it the morning and before I go to bed. I saw a difference in my skin about a week after using this product. 100% recommend! Pricey but definitely worth every penny!
