Within a week of using this serum, I noticed a brightness to my skin that I hadn’t before. I wished I had taken photos before I started using it because then I would be able to actually compare, but I definitely sense my skin is glowing. The serum is also supposed to tighten skin; mine isn’t loose but, as an almost 47 year-old woman, I’ll take any preventative measures I can. I enjoy how silky the serum feels and easily it absorbs. I’ve been using it day and night and it has worn well under my makeup without any pilling. It is pricey and, although I’m thankful to have been gifted this product, I’m more than willing to pay for quality skincare. This serum feels like luxury skincare should...luxuriant. So far I’m enjoying the Double R Renew and Repair Advanced Serum and look forward to seeing what longer-term effects the serum might have in store for my skin. Good as Gold
