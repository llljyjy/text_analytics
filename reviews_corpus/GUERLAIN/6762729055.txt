I got a free sample from Influencer to try & OMH. Definitely luxurious. I used it at night & appreciated that the fragrance wasn’t over powering & it wasn’t super sticky. I also didn’t wake up with breakouts.I couldn’t justify this for daily use because of the price tag but would love to add it to my supplies. Luxurious & brightening!
