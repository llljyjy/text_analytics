I was gifted the Youth Watery Oil from Influencer and Guerlain. On my journey for glowing, clear skin I heard a lot of buzz about the wondrous stuff made by bees and its numerous benefits for the skin. Guerlain’s exceptional formula offers the richness of an oil, the lightness of a lotion and the power of a serum. Enriched with nourishing microbeads that melt quickly to moisturise the skin, leaving it silky and super soft without weighing it down. I could write an entire essay on how beneficial honey is for the skin, so I really love this natural formula being the first protective and repairing layer in my moisturizing regime. I found that it dried a bit tacky on its own but paired perfectly with my daily moisturizes, leaving my skin supple with a dewy, natural glow. I used it for over a week, morning and night, under my regular moisturizers and I am astonished by how youthful my skin looks! Guerlain delivers on everything this magic potion promises – renewing radiance, anti-aging, and anti-puffiness, while plumping up all the right places! I can smoothly apply my make-up over it beautifully, but now that I’ve discovered the Youth Watery Oil from Guerlain, I’ll be showing off my healthy and glowing bare skin more confidently!The packaging is splendidly regal! Fit for a Queen! The fragrance is surprisingly slightly strong, but in the most delightful way! Instead of smelling like a flower, you’ll smell like a field of wildflowers! The potency of the fragrance does diminish once you’ve applied your usual moisturizer. This must have been what Angelina was wearing the day she was photographed being kissed by thousands of honeybees! They must have thought that she was a big, beautiful flower! On a Sweet Journey to Bare Skin!
