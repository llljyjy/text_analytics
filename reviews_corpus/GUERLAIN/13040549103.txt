I really enjoyed this oil! It is very light so I had no trouble fitting it into my skincare routine and it even works well with my rosacea. It is the perfect balance of anti-aging and plumping without feeling too heavy. It does have a distinct smell that I’m not a huge fan of but it goes away quickly. The price is pretty hefty but I only use about 4 drops for my entire face so I won’t have to replace it often. I found it to be comparable to the Fresh rose oil serum but even lighter on the skin. This is a beautiful product both inside and out and the dropper is easy to use. Lightweight and nourishing
