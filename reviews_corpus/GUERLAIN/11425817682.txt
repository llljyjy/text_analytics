I received this product free to review. I wanted to give this product a hard time. I didn’t want to believe the hype. At the price point, I was expecting a lot. This serumPerforms. My skin looked firmer and glowy upon the first week of use. The fragrance is one I associate with high end skin care and the packaging is fancy. The ingredients soaked into my skin well and I had no adverse reactions or redness  with my sensitive skin. My only concern is that once I near the end I am questioning how much of this rather expensive product I’ll be able to get out of the container. But a pump of this product is good for my whole face so I have quite some time until I hit the bottom of the bottle. The price HURTS. But for the sake of this review - it is a great product.
