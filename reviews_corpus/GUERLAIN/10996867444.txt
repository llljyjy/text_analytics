I’ve been using the Guerlain Abielle Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil for almost two months now. I have dry, dehydrated skin and this has really helped to improve the look, feel and texture of my skin. I use a few drops in the morning and evening before my moisturizer. It almost seems like it won’t be enough product but it pats into the skin nicely and absorbs quickly. It feels lightweight - no heavy or greasy feeling. After a couple of weeks my skin looked noticeably more hydrated, plump and glowy.  Despite being 95% natural ingredients, it is heavily scented. I personally didn’t mind, but you might if you’re sensitive to scents. Lightweight and moisturizing
