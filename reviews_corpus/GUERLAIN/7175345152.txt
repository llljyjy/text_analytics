This watery oil is made up of 95% naturally derived ingredients including four sustainably sourced honey, Commiphora Oil, and of course Guerlain’s iconic Royal Jelly. This unique formula instantly absorbs into your skin and helps to improve signs of aging while boosting its radiance and hydration..I love the look of the beautiful glass bottle which is equipped with an easy to use dropper. The golden micro-encapsulated droplets of Commiphora Oil scatter throughout the bottle when lightly shaken which gives you just enough in each application. The texture is very light and almost water-like and applies effortlessly onto your skin. It is highly scented which I thoroughly enjoyed but may cause issues for those with sensitivity to fragrances. .I’ve been pairing it with my daily moisturizer and I feel like this oil complements other skincare products beautifully. It is very hydrating on its own but I do need to use a bit more product than instructed to completely cover my face. Upon applying this oil gives you a beautiful glow that seems to last throughout the day without leaving it feeling oily or tacky..I’ve started to notice an increase in plumpness and radiance over a short period of time, and have started to see a slight improvement in the texture of my skin, including fine lines and wrinkles. Im loving this oil so far and excited to see the results after extended use. Loving this oil so far!
