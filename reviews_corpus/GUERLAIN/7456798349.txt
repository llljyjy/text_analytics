So I’ve spent a LOT of time thoroughly using this in a multitude of applications. I didn’t know any details or cost until a few weeks of using. First off, packaging is incredibly bougie and very well done. The scent is something I’ve begun to love to smell. It’s reminiscent of a light Chanel No5 floral air about it. It doesn’t cling to the skin and stay strong but just during the initial application. It has a very nice texture not too thick, not too thin. My skin is oily and I was leery of how it’d do due to that. My face feels like it went through a mini spa treatment. Skin is a bit tighter, pores minimized, skin is plump and dewy at the same time, and the softness this leaves is incredible. Yes the price is a bitter pill to swallow but Sephora offers satisfaction guarantees. I do plan on buying this again. I use Tatcha for everything so this will be implemented for after my Tatcha Tonic. TLDR;This stuff is incredible! Please try this! Seriously I am beyond picky and have wasted thousands upon thousands on products but this is a new staple in my regiment. Oily and Picky…YUP it’s for me!
