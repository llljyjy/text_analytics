I loved this item when I received it. It was so pretty, it was like gold in a bottle. It gave Paco Rabanne 1Million vibes when I saw the bottle that it was in. It smelled great and it did plump the skin, but it had other things that came with it that has yet to go down. For us with sensitive skin this product is not for us. After the 3rd use I discovered a HUGE pimple right under the opening of my left nostril and it has not gone away. It has been 3 weeks and this HUGE thing is still here. My initial reaction to the product was itchiness. My face became extremely itchy so I cleansed my face and the itchiness went away. I reapplied the product and the itchiness returned immediately. So those with sensitive skin stay away, but for those that do not have a sensitive skin, I strongly think this product will do exactly what it says. Not For Sensitive Skin
