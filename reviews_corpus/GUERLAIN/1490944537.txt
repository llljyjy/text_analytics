I was so excited to receive this! Serums are a MUST in my routine - and absolutely worth the money. You can definitely customize your needs with them, too, because that’s where it’s at. I’ve been using this for about a month now. First - there is a LOT of product in this bottle. I probably use about 2 pumps at night, which covers my face and neck. I layer it over their Youth Watery Oil, otherwise I feel like it doesn’t cover as well. But that may be me. It definitely gives my skin an instant glow. I have noticed an improvement in texture, glow, and appearance over the last month. I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated my skin at all, maybe one pimple here. I didn’t give it 5 stars because I am not a fan of the smell - it’s very perfumey. I really wish they hadn’t added scent/made it unscented. Glowing
