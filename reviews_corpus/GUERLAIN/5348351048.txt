This serum is DECADENT. From the moment that I opened the box, I was blown away by the packaging, serum, scent.. everything! This serum feels expensive and luxurious. It feels so silky on my skin and has already improved the brightness and texture with only a couple uses. Plus, it looks so beautiful on the bathroom countertop. I can’t say enough good things about it.. Highly recommend if you want to try a luxurious serum that you’ll actually see results with! Also love that it’s “clean” beauty! so luxurious!
