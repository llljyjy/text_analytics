I loved that this serum was very lightweight and hydrating. It blended in so easily. The smell wasnâ€™t too overwhelming. It was a very thin consistency. A little went a long way. Loved that it gave me this beautiful healthy glow while also helping my dark spots dramatically reduce in appearance overtime. Glowy Healthy Skin!!!
