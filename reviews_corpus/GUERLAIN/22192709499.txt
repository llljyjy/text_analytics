ADVANCED YOUTH WATERY OIL -ABEILLE ROYALEI was gifted this magic in a bottle.I was impressed with the beautiful packaging and thoughtful healing substances that went into creating a product for women’s skin. Skin care at a young age is so important, which is something I adopted in High School. As I have gotten older my desire for youthful looking skin is a top priority. I think this product is it!I had complete strangers complimenting me on my “radiant” skin. One of my best friends asked me if I was doing Botox because my skin appeared flawless. This was after 7 days of use .The watery oil has a lovely texture … just be careful the first few times I used it I did a full dropper which was too much .It has a lovely smell too.My skin feels hydrated, looks radiant and smooth.I highly recommend it.
