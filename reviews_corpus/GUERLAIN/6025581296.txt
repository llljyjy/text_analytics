Thank you so much INFLUENSTER and Guerlain for allowing me to sample this serum and the accompanying Advanced Youth Watery Oil complementary in exchange for my honest opinion. As you can see the packaging is absolutely gorgeous and very much luxurious. I love the concept of a double action serum in one bottle. This does smooth and hydrate. I’m not sure about lifting yet. Maybe further down the line I will see that effect. This is a lovely product and I certainly am enjoying and I appreciate the opportunity to try it. I would not have purchased this on my own but I don’t think I would even after trying it because I cannot justify the price tag. I have other products in my rotation that perform the same or better for less. Very beautiful bottle and formula!
