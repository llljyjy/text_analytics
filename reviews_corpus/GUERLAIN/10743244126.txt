Loved the smell of this product. I would describe it as pretty floral with hints of spice. I apply about 2 to 3 pumps throughout my face and neck every night. My face feels refreshed and moisturized after applying. My skin is normally sensitive, but I saw no issues when using this product every night before bed. Floral scent perfect for use every night
