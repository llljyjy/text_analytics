I have to say I really love the luxurious packaging… 10/10! I’ve been using this serum in the morning and during my nighttime skincare routine for the past week. I really like the honey smell - it’s not overpowering. A little goes a long way, so each bottle will last you a while which is good considering the price. I have not noticed if it is lifting my skin yet, but my skin does feel firmer and it helps make my skin look dewy. Would recommend
