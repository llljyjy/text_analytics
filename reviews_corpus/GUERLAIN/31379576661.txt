I absolutely LOVE this serum from Guerlain! It has two different serums that combine only when you use the product, which makes it even more cool! The texture is very light and absorbs quickly. It has a very light sweet scent from the honey, but nothing overwhelming at all. This makes my skin soo unbelievably soft and smooth! It honestly has tightened my face after using it for over a month now which seems crazy for a skincare product, but this one really works! It also doesnâ€™t cause me to breakout or anything like that. I will definitely purchase this in the future! My new must-have serum!!
