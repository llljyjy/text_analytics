Guerlain is a luxury brand that is known for their Youth Watery Oil. I was excited to try the Double R Advanced Serum and it did not disappoint! I was extremely interested in the science behind this brand so I did a deep dive. The serum itself contains AHA’s & PHA’s formulated from white honey concentrate to restore radiance to the skin and the Blackbee Repair Technology helps restore the skin’s renewal process. The double glass bottle is the real innovation: it perfectly preserves the active ingredients up to the last moment and offers a significant reduction in plastic. It is also eco-designed and incorporates from at least 20% recycled glass. The serum’s claims hit every mark! My skin felt rejuvenated, renewed, my pores less visible, and an extreme amount of radiance was restored. Even the application suggested to be used in an upward motion and it is an experience. I am in love with this brand! Luxury Defined
