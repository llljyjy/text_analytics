I received this product to try a few months ago. I’ve been using it almost daily as part of my night routine and have been loving it. At first glance I was a little worried it was a pure oil, I have very sensitive skin and oils can sometimes make me break out, however the name Youth Watery Oil is very fitting. This product was not heavy at all, doesn’t leave my face and neck feeling oily and absorbs almost immediately! Very happy with this product and will continue to use! A game changing product!!
