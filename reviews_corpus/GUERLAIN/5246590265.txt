Love love love this serum. It seems amazing. Beware if you donâ€™t like scented skin care, this is not for you. I used it mostly in the night time and it left my skin so soft and glowy in the morning. I really felt it working on my fine lines and wrinkles. It really helps smooth out your face. The design the bottle made it very easy to use and the dispenser allowed for the perfect amount every time. nan
