*Received via Influenster complementary for reviewing purposes * Can’t say I notice a difference in appearance for my skin, but the moisturizing properties make the product for me. I tried it on it’s own without moisturizer and my dry/normal skin type felt baby skin soft! Scent is a little too much, and HOLY PRICE TAG! That being said though, if you’re willing to spend 250 a pop on a single skin care product it’s worth a shot. Influenster review
