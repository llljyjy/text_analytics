First and foremost I would like to thank Guerlain and Influenster for allowing me the opportunity to try out this incredible serum, I am elated and so appreciative. This serum is incredible. Immediately after applying my skin felt soft, hydrated and happy. It is also a well balanced serum for my skin, in that it gives me a nice glow without leaving me greasy or matted. It has excellent penetration into my skin and feels very weightless for how creamy and luxurious the serum is. I definitely agree with the online instruction that you want to warm it up between your fingertips after you pump it out of the serum container. The only thing I have not really noticed about it is the pore refinement. I have not noticed a huge difference in pore size or quality but that could be something you need a month or more of use to see. However, in terms of skin repair, that is another added benefit of this product. The moisture in my skin feels nicely sealed in after I apply this serum. Last but not least the packaging is beyond fabulous and this serum will look very chic and luxurious on any bathroom counter. I highly recommend this product. Amazing
