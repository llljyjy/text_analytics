I received this from Influenster but I don’t want that to impact your thoughts on this review. I have normal skin that runs dry in winter and oily in summer. I tried this serum during summer so I wasn’t sure how it would make my skin look. It worked great! I didn’t feel oily at all or sticky. My skin felt plump and hydrated. I got a few compliments on my skin and this was the only thing I changed so I totally recommend Love it!
