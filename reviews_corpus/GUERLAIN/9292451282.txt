I wanted to love this, but the fragrance is just too much. I feel like I’m spraying perfume directly to my face. It is also weirdly a little drying on me, which I don’t totally hate because I’m very oily but I wasn’t expecting it. Overall it’s just an okay product, I probably won’t buy this on my own and stick to my shiseido serum for now. nan
