I recently received this product for free from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this product! Since hitting my closely to 30 I’ve become incredibly conscious of my skin and the gradual decline in its elasticity and brightness. I like to experiment with trying different skin care ranges and particularly those designed to tackle the signs of aging. I’ve used the Guerlain product in the past but never used one in my regular skincare regime until now. Guerlain Abeille Royal double serum comes in a super handy and very easy to use pump dispenser with a rather satisfying view of the product inside so it’s easy to see how much you’re using, The gorgeous bottle is made up of 2 serum parts. The serum itself smells delicious and is a liquid gel consistency, not at all oily, greasy or sticky, which soaks in well to the skin leaving a lovely dewing glow. The concentrate instantly hydrates and feels very comfortable on the skin. I have dullness skin, and see some wrinkles at the moment and over the space of a few weeks use I have seen a definite improvement in clearing the spots and less frequent break outs which is a wonderful confidence boost. My skin most definitely feels softer and smoother, more nourished and generally more fresher and dare I say plumper. This is a great concentrated serum in a decent sized bottle which used sparingly will last a long time, a little definitely goes a long way. I love this serum so much! Gorgeous serum
