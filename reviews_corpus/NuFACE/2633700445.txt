This is my first review I’ve written for Sephora and I felt like I need to do so just for this device, please do not buy this for the money. I bought this last fall and like many other reviews, the device stopped working within the first month.  It would turn on and then immediately turn off using the large attachment. I emailed NuFace on troubleshooting and solutions and they provided zero assistance. It also didn’t give any results after prolonged, daily use. By far, one of the worst wastes of my money, ever. I have regret buying this and wish I had saved the money and used it towards professional services as now I have a device that simply does not work. Stopped working after a month
