The power button stopped working after two years of fairly infrequent use, rendering it completely unusable. Since it’s outside of the one-year warranty, all NuFace offered was 20% off a new device (probably not). I enjoyed it while it worked and did start to notice a difference during the brief windows when I had time to use it a few times a week, but it is simply too expensive to be so poorly made and unreliable. I’m going to look into other products like ZIIP or Theraface if I decide I want another microcurrent device. Absolutely not worth the money
