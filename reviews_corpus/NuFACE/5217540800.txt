Read the reviews about it cracking and thought I would buy it anyway and be extra careful with it, nope it cracked. And neither Sephora nor NuFACE offered any solution/refund/replacement after 3 months.......says a lot when they don’t stand behind their product. Don’t waste your money!! Should have listened to everyone else.....
