This is my second (I knocked my first off the counter but didn’t want to live without) and really, it is a great little boost to one’s skincare regimen. I feel like my eye area is instantly brighter and tighter when I use it, I can tell the difference myself and I tend to get more compliments too. The lip flick technique works as well! I don’t know why so many said they didn’t see results, perhaps they are younger than I or were expecting something more dramatic. Subtle but great!
