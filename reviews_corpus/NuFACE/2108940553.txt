This product was a little pricey but when it comes to skincare it can be nice to indulge. The serum is great that it comes with too. I actually bought this with less of a goal to line smooth and more of a way to upgrade gua-sha method. I’ve been using this like a lazy gua sha and the device does most of the work for you. I also notice improvement in texture and I like that you can use it with any product. It’s not necessarily practical for everyday but it feels like a nice treat for your skin and is relaxing. If it goes on sale or you have a discount it would be more worthwhile to buy. nan
