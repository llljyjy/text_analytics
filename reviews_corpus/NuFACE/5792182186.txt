Bought for fine lines. Gets super hot.. almost cant hold to your skin. Now the glass (or whatever covering) Is cracked. I didnt even use it much before the cracks formed. Poor design. For what we pay, would be nice for NuFACE to recall or offer free replacements. Surely im not the only one... Cheap & Not Worth It
