I’m loving using Kiehls Retinol Fast Release Night serum. It was very different product with having to add the powder to serum. But I really like the concept. I have combo skin and I’ve been applying it at night. My skins great in the morning.  I’m seeing  some results. It soaks in my skin very quick. There’s no scent to it. Thank you to bzzagent  for allowing  me to try it. Retinol is Awesome.
