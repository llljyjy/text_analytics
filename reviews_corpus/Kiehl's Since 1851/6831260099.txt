I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I know I can only speak for myself, but my results were amazing and fast! I’m pretty sure the recommended use was morning and night, but if I applied in the morning I did notice that in the average daytime usage I would accidentally get a small amount too close to my eye or sometimes a small amount in my eye almost and it would irritate me, so I only use this before bed now, but WOW does it work! I am very fair with dark circles under my eyes and this product not only hydrates under my eyes but also brightens them! I noticed a difference just within the first few days of using. Although this Kiehl’s eye serum might be a little on the pricey side for some, I think to me this may be worth it and I am definitely considering repurchasing. I love it! Thank you so much, Kiehl’s!! IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!
