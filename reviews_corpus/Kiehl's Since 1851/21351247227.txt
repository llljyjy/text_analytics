So, wow, after over 3 months of using Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution every night, I see such a difference... I didn’t even realize how many dark spots had developed on my face. Now I notice how clear and even and bright my natural skintone looks! I don’t even use a full coverage foundation anymore! Its so nice not to have to worry if someone sees me when I don’t have my make up done. If you have dark spots from aging, you definitely want to give this a try! Highly recommend... Clear, even, smooth, bright skin!
