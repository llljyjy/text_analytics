I was frustrated with dark circles and frankly had yet to figure out a good under-eye concealer solution. I have had a lot of luck with Kiehl’s products, so I decided to try this out. I use it twice a day, and, with a few weeks of use, I have noticed a difference in my under-eye pigmentation. It is not entirely gone; however, it has faded to a light enough range that I don’t feel self-conscious going without under-eye concealer. My caveat is (1) I have not noticed major differences with puffiness and (2) a little goes a long way. The product sort of spreads after application, so if you apply to much before bed it may “bleed“ up closer to your lash line than you like. If you are prone to eye irritation, I recommend applying with a light hand and not all the way up to the lash line. Effective for Reducing Dark Circles
