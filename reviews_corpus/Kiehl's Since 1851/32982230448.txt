This is the best spot corrector Iâ€™ve ever used.it helped keep my skin clear and appear more bright and glowing.My post acne spots didnt stand a chance against this potent serum.within just a week or so I saw results and used as a spot treatment is also very effective.a little goes a long way as the serum spreads very easily on the skin and doesnt leave a residue feeling after being absorbed.I usually can have post acne spots up to months even after it clearing up,but this serum has changed that completely.Now I will have a completely faded marks in just around a few days and have had significantly less breakouts with this serum too.
