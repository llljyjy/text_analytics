I received this product for free from BuzzAgent for my honest review. I’m a huge fan of all Kiehl’s products and when I received this in the mail I was super excited. I love how you go around the entire eye and it has an immediate cooling effect to the eye cream. It has all the ingredients that I would want in an eye cream. So far it seems as it’s working good! This is my second week in trying this eye cream out! I love how it brightens underneath my eye and takes away any kind of darkness that I have showing. So far this has been a great eye cream to have and looking forward to see the full effect and get even better results. Kiehl’s Eye Zone Eye Treatment
