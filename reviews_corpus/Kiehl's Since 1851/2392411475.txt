While this mask doesnâ€™t get fantastic reviews (and I am someone who always reads reviews before buying) I decided to take a chance with this product. I am not disappointed; this mask is definitely moisturizing with no scent. Any review that says this mask smells weird is lying; there is absolutely no scent. One of my favourite masks
