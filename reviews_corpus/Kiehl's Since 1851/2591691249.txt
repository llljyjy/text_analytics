Out of all the retinol products  I have tried, this product is by far the strongest. It did make my skin look nice, smooth and glowing,  but its important  to be careful  because  it also  made my skin peel. I like the fact that the product came separated from serum to retinol  powder, ready to mix after  opening  box. I would recommend  this for people with oily  or aging skin. Strong!
