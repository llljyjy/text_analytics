i ABSOLUTELY recommend this moisturizer!! it feels so smooth and amazing on the skin and leaves your skin feeling so soft and hydrated! i have oily/combo skin as well as very sensitive skin and it works amazing for me! but if you have the same skin type and this doesn’t work for you i would definitely try the gel cream version it’s oil free!! absolutely amazing!!
