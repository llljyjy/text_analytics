Unfortunately, I don’t see any improvements to my fine lines under eye. I’ve read you’ll need to continue using to see more drastic changes, and maybe this is the way! Texture is thick, so only press out a tiny pinch for your under eyes. The other concern is breakouts under eye, as this is silicone heavy so recommend to stop using if it does. Overall, Kiehl’s products don’t disappoint, and I will just have to continue using this to see the improvements. Barely Any Improvements
