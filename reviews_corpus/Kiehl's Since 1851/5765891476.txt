The Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream feels very hydrating to the skin but is very highly fragranced. My skin is combo and leans dry/oily depending on the season of the year, and tends to not like highly fragranced products. I patch tested on my arm and it got a little pink/red. I decided to go ahead and try it on my face with a light hand and most of my face got a little pink after about 15-30 minutes. My skin did feel very moisturized though. I would stay away from this moisturizer if you have any sensitivities to fragrances, otherwise it does feel like a very hydrating moisturizer. Highly Fragranced
