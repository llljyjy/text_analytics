I have tried to use retinol many times, but always end up stopping because it dries my face out  and I can’t commit. I like fast results, but retinol is something your face  needs to get used to. If used slowly and correctly you will eventually see the benefits. With this being a fast acting retinol, I knew to introduce mySkin to it slowly. So I started off using this every 3 days. My face has become a little dry but it’s manageable with a good moisturizer. I find retinol easier to use in the summer than winter even though you need to be super careful in the sun. I am still only using every three days and I’m another week or two I will move to every other day and eventually everyday. I know this is a great retinol because just with using 3 days I have already noticed the little bit of hormonal acne I have in my chin clear up. I Am fully committed to using this entire product and can’t wait to see the results. great retinol if used correctly
