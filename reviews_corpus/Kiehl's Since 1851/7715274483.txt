Pleasantly surprised by how effective this cleanser is while still being mild enough for when I’ve got a rough situation with my very sensitive yet acne-prone skin. I actually felt unimpressed with this product at first but inadvertently over-exfoliated my face one day and needed a super mild cleanser. This came to the rescue and I’ve been using it ever since! My only complaint is the smell. Yuck! It SMELLS “chemical-y” like it’s got tile cleaning agents in it or something. I know it does NOT have those types of ingredients but smelling like it is awful enough on its own. The only reason I didn’t do four stars was because this product is truly amazing and effective — DESPITE the smell.And no, the smell doesn’t linger! This came to the rescue!
