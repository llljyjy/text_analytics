I really liked Kiehlâ€™s Retinol Fast-Release Night Serum. I find the overall design related to mixing the powder to be very cool and well thought out. The idea that this retinol is freshly mixed is an interesting one. As for the serum, I really liked it and found it non-irritating as well as effective. nan
