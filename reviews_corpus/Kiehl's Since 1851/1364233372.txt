Loved this eye cream esp for dry skin but I really wish they would bring back the pump applicator… The pump applicator made it so much easier to use and always dispensed the perfect amount. I didn’t mind sharing my eye cream with other people when I had the pump but the jar is less hygienic. Other than the fact that it comes in a jar, it really is the best moisturizing eye cream for dry skin. Great eye cream but wish it didn’t come in a jar
