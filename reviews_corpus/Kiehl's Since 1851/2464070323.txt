I have used several other brands of retinol, but I never really saw a difference. Kiehl’s I saw a dramatic difference in 4 weeks. My skin texture was amazing and less red. I had seen my dermatologist during this period and she noticed a significant change of skin, and asked me what changed in my skin care. I told her about the product and she told me to keep using it. I love it. Very easy to use. Not your Traditional Retinol Serum….. Amazing
