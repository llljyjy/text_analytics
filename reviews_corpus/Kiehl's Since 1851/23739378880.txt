This product is pretty expensive and so expected more from it.  I’ve been using it for a few weeks and haven’t really noticed any difference in my skin versus my regular retinol serum.  It’s an interesting concept having to mix the powder into the serum and got a little messy but nothing major.  For the price, I wouldn’t buy this product unless I start seeing results. Maybe it's too soon to tell...
