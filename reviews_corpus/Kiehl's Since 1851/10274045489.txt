Overall, I really like the Kiehlâ€™s Ultra Facial Overnight Rehydrating Mask. It definitely hydrates really well and left my skin feeling soft. It seemed a little thick but smooths on nicely and is not heavy at all. It does leave my skin feeling a tad oily. I am not a fan of the smell, although it is very faint and not an overly fragrant type of smell. I would say it is a great product to have on hand, especially in the winter months. Hydrating Mask
