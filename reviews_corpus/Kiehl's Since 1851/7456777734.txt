I really like the texture and consistency of this cream. A light, silky gel-like cream that is very light and refreshing. Not heavy and good for oilier skin types wanting some moisture without the weight. My main issue with this is because it is a cooling cream, there is a tingle, and for me the tingle is far too similar to the tingle I experience when I am having a bad reaction. I do have sensitive skin and while this does not necessarily irritate my skin (I don’t wake up with any adverse effects morning after application) the tingle from the cooling is too jarring as it gives me the same feeling that I get when I am having a reaction. 3.5/5 as I think it’s a really good moisturizer but just not for me. Good moisturizer - just not for me.
