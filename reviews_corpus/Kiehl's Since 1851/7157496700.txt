this is a great alternative to prescription retinol cream. I like that the active ingredient is housed separately from the gel base, and the customer will mix them together when ready to use. this ensures that your serum is always fresh and potent. I thought that was a very clever idea for a retinol product. The serum is easily absorbed and has no scent. it does cause some initial itching, but that subsides after the serum is dry. I do get some peeling around the nose area, which tells me this product actually works. excellent option for a strong OTC retinol
