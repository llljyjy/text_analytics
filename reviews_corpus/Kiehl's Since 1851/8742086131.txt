I’m quite the skincare guru, and have done a plethora of independent research into ingredients and products. I truly rave about Kiehl’s products; their ingredients are clean, the products really speak for themselves, and i’ve been using the moisturizer and serums for a couple years now. This sunscreen leaves no whitecast, moisturizes for the everyday use, and doesn’t clog my pores with thickness or leave any nasty blackheads/breakouts. I will emphasize this is a lightweight moisturizer; so if you are someone with very dry skin I would consider layering with something a little thicker, but if you have dry/combo this is the one for you. Sunscreen + Light Moisturizer = Take my Money
