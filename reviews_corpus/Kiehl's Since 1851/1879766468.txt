I normally struggle with dry skin especially during the winter.  I already own some Kiehl’s products and had great results so I was super excited to try this as part of a free sample program. This mask is ultra rich and hydrating that melts into your face. It doesn’t have a fragrance which is nice to prevent further irritation to my skin. It makes my face feel nice and supple without feeling clogged or weighed down. I would avoid using too much as it can make your face feel rather tacky due to excess. A little does go a long way as the semi solid melts into a nice creamy texture when applying. After using it for one week, my face did feel smoother and radiant. This will definitely be incorporated into my skincare routine and maybe even daily during the drying winter. nice and hydrating
