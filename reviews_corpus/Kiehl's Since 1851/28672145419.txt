Kiehl’s had quickly become one of my favorite skincare brands. I am spending a couple of months in Omaha, and I quickly found out that my skin is not made for the bitter cold air. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream is light and fluffy. It has done a great job of moisturizing and hydrating my face without clogging my pores and causing acne. Love it!
