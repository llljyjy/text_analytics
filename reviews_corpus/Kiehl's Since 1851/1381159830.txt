I received a sample of Kielh’s Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Face Mask with 10.5% Squalane expecting average results but I was blown away. It’s so rare for me to give something five stars, but this product is worth it. First off, the ingredients are clean, which is so important these days. Who wants to put nasty ingredients on your body’s largest organ- your skin! Next the smell is divine- it’s clean, classy and simple, no overpowering perfumes or harsh smells. The texture is amazing- it’s this nice balm, that once you start rubbing it in, turns into this oil that literally just melts into your skin. After just the first try, I woke up with noticeable results- that much sought after dewy glow! After a few weeks of using it three times a week, my results have been even better! For the price, this product is a total steal- this one container is definitely going to last a few months! nan
