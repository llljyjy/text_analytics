I was surprised when I first opened this how airy the product would look (but I loved it).  The formula itself was a bit thicker than it looks, but it still is very easy to apply.  It did not feel like I had too much on my skin and I did not feel greasy or anything after applying.  I woke up in the morning and was pleasantly surprised how soft my skin felt.  And I did not inherit a lot of new breakouts as I sometimes do with new or thicker skincare products.  I will definitely continue to use. Good Cream
