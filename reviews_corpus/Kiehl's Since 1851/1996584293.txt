This is such a great moisturizer! In the cold months my skin needs more moisture and this cream has helped so much. It doesnâ€™t have a scent and applies smoothly to my skin. The texture is lightweight but keeps my skin hydrated. I have oily skin and I love this moisturizer. Compared to other products this moisturizer is one of the best. My husband is also a fan and uses it as well. He has very dry skin and this moisturizer works for both of us. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for some hydration during the cold months. My favorite!
