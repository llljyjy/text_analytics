This cream has been the best for my dry winter skin! I was a little worried at first with how thick it was when I applied it but the longer it soaked it had a nice smooth finish. Donâ€™t let the first impression of oiliness scare you away. Say goodbye to dry flaky skin! I would recommend for anyone battling that winter skin. nan
