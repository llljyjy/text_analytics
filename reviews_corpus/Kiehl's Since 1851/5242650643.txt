I received this as part of a promotion. This is a hard balm almost like coconut oil so you do need to rub it between your fingers to warm it up. A little goes a long way with this product. It is hydrating and makes my skin feel nice and plump in the a.m. it absorbs well and really feels like it is strengthening my skin. good
