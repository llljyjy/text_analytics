If you want to level up your slugging game, this is a must. This overnight mask is a very thick balm that, once applied to your skin, begins to melt, sink in, and work it’s magic! I wake up in the morning and, voila! Plump dewy skin. The directions say you can wipe off but I probably won’t try that. Unlike slugging with aquaphor or vasaline, this product doesn’t leave an ultra sticky goo that gets all over your pillowcase and hair. It will leave a layer of moisture that looks wet so definitely a night time product( unless you use the wipe off method). No added fragrance, non irritating, great for sensitive skin. My only complaint is I wish it came in a tube to preserve the product better (I’m not a fan of open jar packaging). up your slugging game
