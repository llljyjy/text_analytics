The Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is a great moisturizer for my skin that feels rich yet not greasy at all. I like that the product  is environmentally friendly from the formula to the packaging itself.I apply a thin layer to my face before bed, and can notice a nice, supple feeling to my skin when I wake up the next morning. Non-Greasy Hydration
