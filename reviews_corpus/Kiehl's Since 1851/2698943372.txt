At first, I wasn’t sure this was for me however I’m glad I kept going. Like many retinol formulas, you may go through an uncomfortable period if you haven’t used them in a while. Kiehl’s more most mild compared to others I’ve tried. First use was very slightly uncomfortable and had some peeling. Again, completely normal but I wasn’t sure how this would turn, however often my second use, I knew this one was different. My skin feels and looks so healthy, no reactions and no more peeling. nan
