Iâ€™m happy to keep using a luxury product if its actually worth the price tag. Out of all the Kiehls products this is only one I keep using. I love their products but am less sure they are always as a good as some more affordable. I have never used an eye cream that is as hydrating as this one. It really wakes up my eyes and changes  the look of them in the morning. Works really well
