I’m really enjoying Kiehl’s Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum. I’ve always found Kiehl’s to be a great, trustworthy company that makes great products and this one is no different. I like how I got to mix the serum and powder together to create a fresh product. I did get a little red the first week but not enough to stop using it. I just doubled up on my moisturizer and was fine.  It’s been four weeks and my skin is glowing. The fine lines are definitely plumped and less noticeable. I would absolutely purchase this item and recommend it to anyone interested in using a high quality retinoid. Also, this serum is fragrance free so anyone sensitive to scents can enjoy this too! nan
