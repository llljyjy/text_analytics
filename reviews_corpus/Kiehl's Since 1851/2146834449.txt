Kiehl’s is a good quality brand. This serum goes light and doesn’t leave you sticky and dries quickly, I usually apply it after brushing my teeth at night time before going to bed, by the time I am in bed the serum is already dry so it doesn’t mess with my pillowcase! I love you get to mix the retinol with the liquid, so you know you are getting the freshest mix! One thing, when using retinol, don’t forget to wear sunscreen the next day! This serum works if you are consistent! Some fine lines and one small sun spot are gone for me! I love this! Wrinkles and a small sun spot begone!
