This was gifted to me by BzzAgent and Kiehl’s to give my honest review. I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I’ve been really enjoying it. My skin is noticeably plumper and softer. It has a lightweight, airy formula, yet intensely hydrating.  This has definitely become a staple part of my nightly skincare routine. Not only have I enjoyed it, this has become a favorite of mine. I have loved everything I’ve tried from Kiehls. I highly recommend this! I will be repurchasing after I finish it. Super hydrating, lightweight moisturizer!
