I have oily skin. I cannot use anything but lactic acid or glycolic acid at night No creams No oils!!!. if you have oily skin like me, do not use this at night only in the day . Im in my 30s so I’ve been trying alot of methods. I’m telling you. don’t cream/oil at night if you are oily and are continuously breaking out. try lactic acid 10% from the ordinary before bed > wash your face first. oily skin
