I had the opportunity of testing Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide and absolutely loved it! I haven’t been able to find an eye cream that did not leave my skin feeling sticky and eyes irritated until now. It absorbed nicely and didn’t cause any irritation. The skin under my eyes looked less puffy and tired. Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream left the skin around my eyes feeling supple and my fine lines less noticeable. Kiehl’s Eye Cream  is much better than any eye cream I have used in the past. I highly recommend Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide and have a new favorite. Goodbye dry skin and tired eyes! Best Eye Cream Ever!
