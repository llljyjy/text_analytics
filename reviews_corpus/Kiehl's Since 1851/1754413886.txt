I really like the packaging of this product. Having to incorporate the active ingredient makes me feel confident that the product is fresh, and the way the the product comes out, it makes me feel like the product will remain sanitary. I have relatively sensitive skin, but I have not experienced any irritation with this product, which I have experienced with other retinol products in the past. In my time using it, I think that the product has been effective. While itâ€™s hard know for sure without going through a bottle or two, I do feel like my skin has been more glowing and my fine lines are less noticeable. Great Packaging, Seemingly Effective Product
