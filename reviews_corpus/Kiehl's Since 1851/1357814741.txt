I must have super dry under eyes. This particular Kiehl’s eye cream did not keep my under eyes moisturized. I found them ’parched’ several hours later, also leaving behind my makeup dried out, in that area, as well.I used this ’Super Multi-corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream’ for several months and did not notice a difference in wrinkles or skin texture. Nor under eye brightness. This functioned as a run of the mill eye cream... on me. Like the eye creams that worked well... in my 20’s.As with any product, ’your mileage may vary’.I found better efficacy with Kiehl’s “Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing & Dark Circle Diminishing Vitamin C Eye Serum“Clearly... I need extreme level help! LOL Meh... didn't work for me.
