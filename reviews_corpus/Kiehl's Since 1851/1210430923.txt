I have dry skin, and usually love thick creams. I’m in FL, so I also try to find products with SPF in it for days I don’t spend a ton of time outside. This is a thick cream that doesn’t sink it. It literally rolls up on my face if I touch my face, or want to put makeup on. It also SMELLS horrible. It’s not scented strong like perfume, it just smells BAD, like glue or something. I wanted to give it a shot because on paper it sounds great, and now I’ve missed my return window. What a waste of money. I can’t handle the smell anymore so I’ll see if anyone in my family wants it I guess... Smells like glue, rolls up when applying makeup
