Just started using it after over a month using other products. I wanted a simple no or low fragrant hydrating mask that I use on the weekends (I follow Youtuber’s LABeautyologist’s method of hydrating-toning my face after each step and applying an exfoliationg mask then a hydrating mask for extra hydration) and this looks like the right one for my oily combo acne prone skin. I usually get the one from bolden but wanted to try something else. Too early to see if it makes a difference and mind you i don’t plan on using it all the time in order to save product but I am liking it so far. This is my first kiehl’s product. nan
