I used this product for 12 weeks (morning and night) and I am sad to report that I have not seen any results. The dark spots I have are the same color and size as they were before I started using this product. I do like that it absorbs quickly, doesn’t feel greasy, and it hydrates my skin but that’s it. I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty (I have about 1/4 of the bottle left) and update if I have miraculous results. No Results Seen
