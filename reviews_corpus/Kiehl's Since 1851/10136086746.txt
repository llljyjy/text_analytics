I have heard great things about Kiehlâ€™s products, so I was excited to try this barrier cream. I live in a really cold and dry environment, so this is perfect for me. It has a nice thick texture that blends in seamlessly with my skin. I can feel my skin just drink this up, and it is so soothing! A little goes a long way too, so the bottle should last for a decent amount of time. I have been using this day and night, and it makes such a difference in how hydrate This is it!!
