The lavender scent is nice and calming, perfect for my PM routine, and the way this absorbs into my skin so completely is really wonderful. My skin is left with an almost silk finish.  Not oily, or greasy feeling at all, but very moisturized.This cream seems heavy, but is actually a light weight once applied on the skin. It is such a nice soft texture.Love the heavy blue glass jar this is packaged in. All around this is a really nice night cream, and a little bit goes a long way nan
