No I didn’t see a difference in my dark circle reduction, mainly because I don’t have bad dark circles, I did see a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I really enjoyed using this product and still have some left so I’ll finish it up before I purchase it. And has a small scent but nothing that’s recognizable when you put it on or noticeable. It doesn’t sting my eyes nor does it feel too heavy for the area. I like that it’s gentle but seems to be effective. Would buy again and again
