This was my first time trying a dark spot corrector.  I have a handful of dark spots that have been annoying me for a while. I liked how I could apply it before my moisturizer and it was very simple to apply. It had a slight scent I wasn’t too fond of at first but now it doesn’t bother me. I will say I did notice a difference in the dark spots but they are still pretty visible to me. I’m going to continue to use it in hopes it just takes a bit longer and i do have a decent amount left in the bottle. I know so many years worth of dark spots aren’t going to disappear overnight and I’m willing to continue the usage. nan
