This product was different than any I’ve tried before because you actually mix the powder with the serum before using the first time. Kind of an interesting concept, although not quite sure how I feel about it. I was worried it wouldn’t apply well because it seemed to have a bit of a gritty texture, but that wasn’t an issue at all and it went on smoothly.Love the glass bottle and the window on the side that allows you to see how much product is remaining. Also appreciate how easy it is to dispense the correct pea-sized amount. I didn’t experience any irritation or redness as is common when starting a retinol product, so if this is a concern or something that has turned you off of retinol before, it may be worth a try. nan
