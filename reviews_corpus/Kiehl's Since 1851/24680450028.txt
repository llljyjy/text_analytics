With face mask usage and dry winter weather, my skin has become more sensitive and drier than before. I started using this cream mainly to hydrate my skin and usually apply it at night. My skin has become healthier than before and so far I liked this product. Only issue is, which could be cause of my dry skin, it penetrates into my skin quickly and skin becomes dry again. Usually, I use moisturizer after one application of this cream to both hydrate and retain the moisture. Definitely works! nan
