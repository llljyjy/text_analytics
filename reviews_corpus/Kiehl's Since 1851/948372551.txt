This is a great option for sensitive skin.  It has no fragrance and the lightweight formula did not break me out.  It is perfect for oily or normal skin but may not be enough for dry skin, especially in the winter.  The next morning, all of the moisturizer had absorbed and my face was so smooth. nan
