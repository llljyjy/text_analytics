I’ve been using this product for a few weeks after receiving it as a sample to test and review. Overall, it’s a gel-like texture with minimal scent which doesn’t seem to bother my eyes, which is appreciated since I’m very chemical sensitive around the eye area. I’ll keep trying it and see if I see any results. Not sure of results after a few weeks
