I really like this eye cream. It has a very smooth, silky consitency that goes on easily and absorbs quickly. It feels a little slick, but it’s not greasy at all. I have been using this product for about two weeks, and although I haven’t noticed any major changes, I do think there are some subtle improvements to the skin around my eyes. I really like that this eye cream is for use on all areas around the eyes; the brow bone, under eye, crows feet, and eye lid. Often eye creams are targeted for a specific area. This is not a problem for me, but if you have dry skin around your eyes, there may be other products that are more moisturing. Overall I like this eye cream and I will continue to use it. Great, Multi-Purpose eye cream
