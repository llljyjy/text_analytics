This is my first time using a product that contains retinol so I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’m very happy that there were instructions to help get me started because I wasn’t expecting to do a little mixing to get started but it was easy! Overall, I feel like there has been some reduction in my fine lines. I’m also noticing that my dark spots are less noticeable. I wasn’t expecting that but it is definitely a pleasant surprise. This product will definitely be one I add to my night time skin routine. nan
