I like the light citrus-vitamin scent. All you need is a small amount. I felt some firmness and I haven’t experienced any redness like similar product, but haven’t seen any results in wrinkles. I removed a star because I personally didn’t care to mix the powder in the solution on my own. It was confusing at first to figure out how to get it in without wasting any powder. nan
