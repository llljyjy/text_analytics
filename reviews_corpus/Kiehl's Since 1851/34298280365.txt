I received the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream from Bzzagent for my honest review and I am overly excited with just how awesome this cream is! It is so light and fluffy and goes on with a matte finish but it’s like no other I assure you!! The second I got it all over my face and neck my skin felt softer than I think it ever has! It absorbs so quickly, it’s not greasy and when I woke up the next morning my skin was still soft and just as smooth as when I first applied it! Being 46 makes me self conscious at times because of course I worry about wrinkles and fine lines but after using this for the last three nights I can already tell how it softens the fine lines I have starting around my eyes. I wish I could describe exactly what it feels like because you would definitely be in love. There is no scent to it and I love the baby blue jar and the color of the cream, it’s a very, very light purple tint and I swear it looks just like a cloud at dusk when the sun is setting. I can’t brag on this product enough, I am so happy I was chosen for this and I am even more excited to see the results at the end of every week! I highly recommend this cream if you are looking for a great product without being oily or greasy!! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!
