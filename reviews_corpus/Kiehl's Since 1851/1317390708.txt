Another home run for Kiehl’s, and another product I will be purchasing again. I love this cream. It really is lightweight, yet sinks in beautifully. My skin feels softer, more hydrated, and just feels renewed when I use this product. I do have super oily skin (I’m a greaseball, it’s bad y’all), and my face does feel a little oiler when I wake up after using this, but it’s worth it for how soft and glowy it leaves my skin looking. It does also appear to be helping with some of my fine lines. It is scented, but it’s such a clean fresh scent in my opinion that it doesn’t bother me at all, but do want to point it out for those that prefer unscented products. A little goes a long way, so this jar will last me a while, which makes it cost effective. Another hit, and a new staple in my nighttime beauty routine. I highly recommend giving this cream a try, you won’t be disappointed! nan
