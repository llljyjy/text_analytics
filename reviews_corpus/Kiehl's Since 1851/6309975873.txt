I liked mixing the 2 serum components myself. It made me feel like I was using a fresh product. I have been using Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum on my face, neck and chest. At first I tried using it every night. The skin on my face got flakey and a little dry. I now use it every other night and I am very happy to say that the Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum does not irritate, burn, or redden my skin. My skin feels soft and smooth. I do plan on trying to apply it every night. I will be patient and continue to use this serum until the container is empty and I excitedly look forward to seeing the results, especially on my wrinkles. I highly recommend this serum, especially to those who have experienced strong skin irritations from other retinol serums and had to stop using them, as I have. Soft, smooth skin
