A great standby that I always come back to. If you love moisturizer like I do (dry skin New Englander), this is a tried and true formula that is thick but not greasy. I think this is in the middle in terms of being light weight vs heavier occlusive. I use this at night because I really like SPF in my moisturizer for daytime (plus sun screen!). It’s AWESOME for reactive skin (soothing and hydrating, I don’t really have sensitive skin just reactive and this is very calming). I tend to use this when for a nighttime routine with a lot of active ingredients since it’s clean and simple, I’ve never had an adverse reaction. I also love YTP adaptogen and Biossance, but this is more bang for your buck in my opinion. CeraVe is great if you’re looking for a lower price alternative. Tried and true for dry reactive skin
