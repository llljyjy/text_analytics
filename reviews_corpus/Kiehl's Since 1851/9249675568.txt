I could go on and on about how great this face cream is. This is a lightweight, fragrance free moisturizer that doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue, blends into my skin with little effort and provides 24hr hydration. My skin gets painfully dry in the winter and often cracks. This has made all the difference. It doesn’t leave my skin looking red or feeling irritated which is a nice change as I tend to have sensitive skin. Additionally, this moisturizer doesn’t clog my pores and is paraben free! nan
