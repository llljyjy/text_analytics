I really like Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum.  It’s so easy to use, I love how you get to mix it up and it dispenses like a dream!  My skin did have a little reaction at first but nothing like I have had with other Retinol products.  Since starting this, I feel like my skin glows more and just looks more refreshed.  This has been one of my favorite Retinol products so far. nan
