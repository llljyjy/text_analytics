Sure you can’t except miracles from a product and for deeper correction you need more invasive procedures, but when it comes to minor correction it’s works pretty good. After day on the beach I had freckles all over the face, Kiehl’s dark spot solution helped me to correct it faster than if I didn’t do anything. And overall I like my skin tone more after usage. Works for me
