I think I have finally found the holy grail of daily moisturizers for those of us who suffer from sensitive skin!!! I have lupus and rosacea so have to be extra careful about what I apply to my face. I have been using this twice a day for the past two weeks and not only has it not caused any reaction but it has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin. It feels very lightweight with a pleasant smell and like that you also donâ€™t need a lot of it. If you have sensitive skin I would definitely say to give this moisturizer a try!!! sensitive skin holy grail
