I was thoroughly surprised by how well my skin reacted to this product! It was a little strong or better yet stingy at first but my skin quickly adjusted to this strength of this retinol. I had been using another retinol product for months and after switching to this one, saw even smoother skin with smaller pores in a significantly quicker time frame. I really liked how you  had to mix the powder with the actives to the serum, to me that made me feel like was getting a fresh product. The smell and texture was also enjoyable too! I would highly recommend. Impressive & innovative!
