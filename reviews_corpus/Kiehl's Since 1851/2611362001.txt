I’ve tried all kinds of serums and creams for under my eyes, and I instantly fell in love with this one! It’s not always easy to notice differences between one eye treatment and another immediately, but this stands out.  The texture and thickness is SO smooth, but not buttery like a cream - a super rich serum. I woke up the first morning and my under-eye bags feel so much smoother and softer than they ever have. Powerful Is Right!
