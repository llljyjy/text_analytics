I wanted to like this product, I used the 14 day trial. It made my eyes water, and it made my skin around my eyes look drier after a few uses. My husband kept telling me I looked tired, and asked if I was getting enough sleep as I had puffy bags under my eyes which I wasn’t prone to. Very disappointed, as I really need a great moisturizing eye cream that is global (for lids and below eyes), doesn’t cause milia and doesn’t burn. I have tried every price range and would be willing to spend more for a product that worked. (After trying almost everything at Sephora, I found a drugstore brand that is terrific for sagging and wrinkles, it is global, but doesn’t really moisturize) Disappointed with Kiehl's
