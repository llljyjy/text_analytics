I’ve recently started seeing eczema rashes pop up on my face, arms & legs. I’ve never experienced this before. Regular face lotions weren’t cutting it to help re moisturize my inflamed skin. This has been my go to. It’s thick, but seeps into the skin well, does not leave any greasiness or shine. Non scented. I think I’ll be stocking up on this. I have dry skin & live in a cold climate for reference. Saving my skin this winter
