I’m so glad that I got to try Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum! I’ve been using it nightly for about 4 weeks, and there are definite improvements in the fine lines around my eyes and lips. The serum is surprisingly gentle and has not irritated my skin at all. This product is unique because the retinol is packaged separately from the serum, and you combine them yourself before the first use. The consistency is light and it absorbs quickly without stinging or burning. I’m really pleased with the results so far! nan
