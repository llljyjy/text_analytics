This is my favorite serum, I definitely recommend it.  The serum comes with a retinol capsule that you have to add to the bottle, its easy to do.  Its a pump style bottle and gives you just the right amount each time.  It takes very little to cover your entire face.  This serum has made my face soft and smooth, and I have noticed a decrease in the wrinkles, they are less visible.  The serum is not greasy or irritating, it absorbs well and can be used with other products. nan
