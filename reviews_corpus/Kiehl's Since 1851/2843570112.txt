I received Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution 1.0 oz., as an incentivized gift from Bzzagent. It worked only the darkest of flaws on my skin. It did not entirely remove the flaws, but did make them significantly lighter. It applied nicely with no sticky or oily residue. It was completely odorless. I was hoping it would improve my overall skin tone and texture. While it absorbed quickly, it did not improve any texture concerns. I’d recommend this product for anyone that has serious dark discolorations. I would not purchase this for myself for 1oz at $60. nan
