This is a decent eye cream. I like the lightweight gel-like texture and zero fragrance; both factors suited the delicate and sensitive skin around my eyes. I didn’t notice much change in my skin aside from general moisturizing. Also, when I used it on my eyelids as well as under my eye (as directed), I did get a couple of minor blemishes on my eyelid, so I stopped using it there. For that reason, I would recommend it for undereye use only; however, I didn’t notice any major results, especially considering the price. I do think it’s worth a shot if you are needing an undereye cream, as it did not irritate my skin in that area. Comfortable Eye Cream; Unsure of Results
