Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is so deeply nourishing and exhilarating to all the senses.  It’s a great addition to my nighttime ritual and I have found a holy grail.  The light blue cream smells lightly like a moonlit night.  It’s very dense but light and begins absorbing immediately upon contact with skin.  I have noticed a significant improvement on my skin first thing in the morning.  It’s clear, and it’s plump and glowing.  My skin drinks this cloud stuff up.  It really works it shows in my skin,  I look younger.  I look, brighter.  I look, happier.  I enjoy my skincare rituals so much.  I use this cream as the last step after washing and applying thinner products like toner, essence and serums.  It really seals it all in.   I have had no breakouts and no clogged pores, no acne as a result of adding this to my routine.  The packaging is also ultra cute, the deep cobalt blue jar imparts a relaxed feeling before bed.
