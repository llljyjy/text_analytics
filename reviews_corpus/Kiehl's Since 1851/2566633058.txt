This night moisturizer is everything necessary for hydration and firmness in a jar. This moisturizer had a whipped texture that is firmer and richer than most moisturizers I have tried in the past. When it goes on to the skin, it feels more like a rich balm, but it quickly melts into the skin and leaves a matte finish on the skin instantly. You can instantly see the moisturizer diminish pores and fine lines. Skin looks a lot more firm and plump by morning. The moisturizer is lightly fragranced and is not overwhelming, and it does not linger for more than a couple of minutes. In the course of a week, my skin looked visibly more hydrated, plump and healthy. I will definitely be purchasing this cream, and I strongly recommend to individuals that have issues with loss of firmness, elasticity and hydration. firmer skin by morning!
