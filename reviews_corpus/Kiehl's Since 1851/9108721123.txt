My favourite mask ever. Just purchased my second jar. Itâ€™s a little expensive but well worth it in my opinion. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated, helps with redness, and I also find if I have a pimple it really helps the swelling go down and it looks so much better the next day. Highly recommend! FAVOURITE!!
