Love this new cloud cream from Kiehls. The lavender scent is calming and the blue tone of the cream has relaxing feels about it. The is thick but applies to my skin in a thin but very hydrating layer. I love to pair the cloud cream with the midnight concentrate at bedtime for maximum results. Supple Skin
