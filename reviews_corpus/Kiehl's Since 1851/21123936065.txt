The worst mask in the whole entire universe !!! I bought this mask , used this mask , threw this mask away . You literally can’t even apply the mask to your face . It’s chunks of green everywhere . I tried warming it up between my hands hoping to thin out the chunks but no . It doesn’t even feel moisturizing . Get an avocado and some oil and put it on your face that would do a better job than this . There are no high quality special ingredients either . I basically threw my money in the trash along with the mask . Do not recommend unless you want to get a so called friend a gift . You know the kind that u have to pretend to be nice to but really hate . Ughhhh
