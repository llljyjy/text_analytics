I have never used a product with Retinol before so I had to start with this product slowly to get my skin used to it. I started out using it twice a week and I didn’t have any burning or irritation. I have just started using it every other day now. It goes on smoothly but the consistency is a little bit more watery then I was expecting. I haven’t really noticed any results yet but I wasn’t using it the recommended amount at first so I am hoping that now that I am using it more often I will start to see results. Undecided but Hopeful
