I have used so many different eye creams and most of them I find unimpressive,so I really didnâ€™t expect much from this one.However I fo really like this eye cream.I love the gel like consistency and it absorbs really fast I can tell a difference in the fine lines around my eyes after using it daily for a couple of weeks.Hopefully the longer I use it the more results I will see.Definitely would reccommend and before I run out I will purchase some more.Thanks bzzagent! Great Eye Product
