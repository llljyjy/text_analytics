This is a great moisturizer, but it’s so expensive and you need a lot of it. I went through the 1oz (which actually isn’t even a true ounce) jar much quicker than other moisturizers. It made my skin soft, but wasn’t anything revolutionary for the price. I’ll be going back to my First Aid Beauty moisturizer. Good, but pricey
