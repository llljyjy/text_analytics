I received this cloud cream from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. When you first open the jar you’ll notice that this has a very cloud like whipped texture. It’s very creamy and thick without being greasy. There is a light scent so it’s nothing that bothers me. After using this in the PM you’re left with beautifully moisturized non-greasy skin in the AM. I can see this being a fabolous winter PM moisturizer. It’s really like nothing I’ve ever tried before. It’s really good stuff! Cloud cream indeed!
