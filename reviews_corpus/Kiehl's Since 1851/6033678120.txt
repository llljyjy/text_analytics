This works great! The fragrance is light and pleasant. If fragrance bothers you this is light so it may or may not bother you. I enjoy the light smell. It moisturizes well but it did leave my skin tacky, which I did not mind. If a slight tackiness bothers you, you may not like this. I will be buying this when it runs out and I will recommend it to my family and friends! Works great!
