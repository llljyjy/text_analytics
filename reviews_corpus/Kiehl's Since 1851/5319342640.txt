I really enjoyed this product. I loved the dispensing mechanism (you press the bottom to dispense) and I liked the little window on the side so you could see how much product you have left. As for the product itself, it didn’t have much of a scent and didn’t leave my skin sticky or tacky. It was drying for my skin but that’s expected with retinol. I really like the way it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I’d definitely recommend. Loved!
