This is the most innovative product I’ve tried in a long time.  Kiehl’s really changed the game with this component. It comes in two parts so it gets mixed fresh yet IG was designed so there is no pouring to worry about. You just snap two pieces together and shake.  The formula is thin and soaks right in. I can’t speak to results yet but I have no doubt it’s doing what retinol does (retinol is a slow and steady wins the race type product.) I do think $80 is pricy for retinol and I usually don’t pay that much.  In this case I got it for free in exchange a review. game changing component.
