I love this product so much. My skin feels so great the morning after I put it on, I  use it every other day. I have been using another retinol product but started searching for something different after that product changed packaging and in my opinion became criminally wasteful with the excessive plastic packaging that was completely unnecessary. But perhaps it was a good thing because it led me to find this new product by Kiehls! To be completely honest I’ve only been using it for about a month so to make claims about the effectiveness of the retinol is it really possible because retinol takes about six months to see a difference but since I know my skin responds well to retinol I am a concentration in this formula is similar I’m not too concerned that it’s not going to work. What I am so impressed about Is how well the peptides and the ceramides are working on my skin. I’ve literally forgotten to put moisturizer on twice after using this product and my skin still feels super moisturized in the morning. I’m doubly happy because now I’m going to phase out one of my peptide moisturizers now that I’ve got this! I seriously love this product
