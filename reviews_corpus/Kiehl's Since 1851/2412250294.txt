It’s expensive but worth it. This moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs into the skin, does not sit there, no flakes. I have really dry facial skin, once i use this, my face feels so good and hydrated, takes away dry spots and flakes. Ok to use under makeup as it absorbs into the skin. This moisturizer instantly feels like it nurtures my skin, and definitely helps diminish the look of the “fine lines”.Definitely hooked and worth the price. nan
