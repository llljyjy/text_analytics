I received this product just in time for Winter in Wisconsin and it has been a life saver. Itâ€™s super thick and hydrating and my skin is so moisturized in the morning. It has taken away the flaky dry patches of skin on my face. My face is noticeably softer after using this in just a short amount of time. Hydrating!
