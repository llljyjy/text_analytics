I’ve been using Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night serum for a few weeks now and I can truly say I am super happy about this product. First of all, thecway you have to mix the ingredients together was fun and unique but super easy. It is easy to dosage via push button and it spreads easily and dries up fast. No greasy feeling on the skin like others do. My skin feels softer and definitely hydrated and healthy and it doesn’t only feel smoother, it looks firmer too. The only thing i did not like that much, was the smell. But overall I am completely satisfied with the serum and would definitely recommend it. Keeps what it's promising! Great serum!
