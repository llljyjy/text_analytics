This cream is super thick and rich, but doesn’t feel heavy or goopy on my skin, which is such a major plus for me. The texture is really interesting and the scent is light and fresh-floral, not overpowering at all. After the first night my skin felt more moisturized than with most products I’ve tried, and after a few nights (and occasional days) of use, the rough/bumpy patches on my cheeks and forehead seemed to be getting smoother and keeping a moisturized feeling through the day. nan
