Now that winter is TRULY here, I’ve been on the hunt for a decent sleeping mask to hydrate and get my skin back to normal. I can’t use anything too rich in the daytime as that means foundation will end up oxidizing as my skin can get quite oily. And with this I unfortunately just can’t get past the consistency - it’s very thick, almost like petroleum jelly and just sits on the surface of my skin. I’m used to sleeping on my side but once this is on I just dare not as it will end up all over my pillowcase. Have also tried using a really tiny amount but awoke to dry patches/flakiness which means it wasn’t enough, yet any more is too much. Can’t seem to find a middle ground with this one! Ingredients-wise there isn’t a great deal in here, it’s basic and simple stuff - good for those who have skin sensitivities and have to avoid many ingredients but not for those who are looking for a state of the art formulation, which this sure isn’t! Definitely more suited to drier or very dehydrated skin types.
