I love this eye cream! I am a huge fan of niacinamide and it’s benefits and this cream makes it so easy to get those results in such a sensitive area. After 2 weeks I’ve noticed a much more even tone, and a refined look to my entire eye area. I’m excited to see results from the whole jar. A little goes a long way and I see this lasting for a few months at least. I did start out using it every other day because niacinamide can be one of those actives you have to build up to and this method worked well for me. I definitely recommend it and I suggest alternating this with the “Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum“ for fantastic results! A+
