Let me start off by saying I have super sensitive skin and eyes so it’s really hard for me to find an eye cream that works and doesn’t irritate my eyes. This is by far my favorite eye cream that I’ve ever tried. It absorbs quickly and smooths my skin to create a really great foundation to apply makeup to without ANY irritation. I’ve noticed fewer creases and softer under eye skin in just a few uses. I’ll absolutely be buying more once this jar runs out. Great Under Makeup
