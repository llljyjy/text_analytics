I love this cream. Like other reviewers I wouldn’t use it under my makeup as it’s heavy. That being said I’ve used it for over a month as a night and I have seen results. I also have extremely sensitive skin. This is so soothing! It also took at least a week for my skin to get used to it (it’s very moisturizing) LOVE!!!!
