Amazing product that actually works. After only a week you will notice improvements in your skin around the eye area. Let’s start by talking about how silky and easily spreadable the eye serum. It literally feels like silk in your hands. A little definitely goes a long ways so use sparingly, and it is very easy to spread. After a week in it I noticed that my eye area looked smoother and brighter as well as less puffy. I don’t really have dark circles, but I did notice that my skin around my eyes was more even as far as the tone/pigment. I also noticed that the puffiness around my eyes was very minimal. And last but not least my crows feet were smoothed/erased out. Definitely loved this serum and highly recommend it. Wrinkle eraser
