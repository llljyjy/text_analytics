I received this product to try for my honest opinion, I gave the item 4 stars but I would say it’s more like 4.5 stars.  I have very sensitive skin and I had zero issues with this product. It goes on smooth and you don’t even need to use a lot of the product to get good coverage.  I used the product primarily under my eyes but found that the fact I can use it on my actual eyelid very intriguing.  I did notice the skin under my eyes looked a bit brighter and the lines were less pronounced so all in all I’d say it was a successful trial.   Kiehl;s is a trusted brand and relatively clean ingredients which are things that are important to me.  Would I buy this product, yes.  Would I recommend this to my friends, yes I would.   I will continue to use until I finish the container and will probably buy it once I’m out. Successful trial of a new to me product!
