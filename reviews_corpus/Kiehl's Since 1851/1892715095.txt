The product is very runny as the name suggests. I found it spreads easily upon application and does not leave a white cast. The product does need a few minutes to get absorbed but I did not find any pilling even if I applied the SPF right after my skincare routine. It smells like your usual sunscreen, not especially unpleasant but lingers throughout the day. I got the product when it was on sale, but I donâ€™t think it is worth the regular price. nan
