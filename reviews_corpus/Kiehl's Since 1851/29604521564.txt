I started using the Kiehl’s clearly corrective dark spot solution about 12 weeks ago and I’m in love with this product! I use it first thing in the morning followed by moisturizer, and then some SPF for the day. Then at night time I use it followed by moisturizer before bedtime. I started to notice a difference in my skin just after 1 week of using this product! I don’t have anymore dark spots on my face, my skin is clear from acne, and my skin is smooth and shiney. I faithfully use this product every single day and I will continue to use it! I’ve tried many high prices solutions and none of them have worked as well at kiehl’s! Works like magic!
