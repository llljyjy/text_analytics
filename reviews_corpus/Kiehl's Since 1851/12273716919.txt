I feel like I truly started seeing results within a week of using this serum. The fine lines around my eyes have been greatly reduced, and the deep set line by my mouth is definitely diminished. I loved that I had to mix the ingredients before use because then I knew for sure that it was fresh ingredients. I wouldn’t say that I have sensitive skin, but I was very surprised I didn’t experience any irritation when I started to use this. The serum is light and hydrating which again was surprising as I had assumed retinol would dry out my skin. I would 100% recommend this retinol serum. Excellent Retinol Serum!
