I really loved reviewing this Kiehl’s ultra cream moisturizer! It has a silky texture, and also feels lightweight. It has great benefits, like fragrance free, no minerals, no sulfates, and non-comedogenic! After using, my face feels and looks softer, brighter and smoother. It doesn’t clog my pores or cause any breakouts. I used the cream morning and night, after cleansing.I am definitely going to continue using this product in my daily skin care routine, and I absolutely would recommend this ultra facial cream to friends and family! Thank you Kiehl’s for an amazing product! Awesome facial cream
