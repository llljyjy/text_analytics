This is a quality and effective product. Don’t expect it to perform miracles though! Overall, it smoothed out the texture of my skin and gave me a less worn-out look. It doesn’t do much for already established wrinkles, but helps fine lines and blemishes. It also smoothed out areas where I had scarring. My skin did experience some sensitivity when I first began using it, but that went away after a week or so. nan
