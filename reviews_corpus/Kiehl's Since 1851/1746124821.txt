I’m an eye cream skeptic and find that most of them make absolutely zero difference and are a waste of money, but this one is the exception. It’s an insanely good value for money considering how much other brands charge for half an ounce, and how SO LITTLE of this product is necessary per application. I’ve had sample jars (.25 oz) last me six months. It’s rich and ultra moisturizing, but has a water-in-cream texture that stops it from ever feeling heavy and greasy. The skin around my eyes literally glows when I use this, because my skin is so refreshed and hydrated. To top it all off, my concealer goes on easier and looks better throughout the day. I absolutely love cosmetics and am always excited to try new things, but I am loyal to this product like I am to none other. Will repurchase forever. nan
