Finally, an eye cream that does what it claims!  I’ve tried many under eye treatments, but this is the first one that actually gave me the results I was looking for. The first week of use, my under eye area was softer and smoother. After about 3 weeks the dark circles were barely visible and the puffiness was gone. A full month in and my skin is firm and dramatically improved. I’m a believer!  I enjoy using this morning and night as a part of my skincare routine. A small amount of product goes a long way. I highly recommend Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum. nan
