I received a sample for this product and have been using it for a few weeks now. This product made my face feel plumper more toned. It feels moisturized and soft. I could see a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I thought the mixing process was a little odd but the product itself works well. I did also notice a difference in the texture of my skin it feels smoother. I recommend trying it. Made my face feel great
