I have used this for 2 weeks, and my skin looks great! My brown spot has faded, my fine lines lessened, and it is working on my deep wrinkles!  It doesn’t smell which I love!  I really like how you know it’s potency because you are the one adding the powder!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!  It also didn’t sting my face like I thought it would! Go ahead and try it!!
