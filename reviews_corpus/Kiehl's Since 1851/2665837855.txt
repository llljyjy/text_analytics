First off I absolutely love the texture of this cream, it definitely feels like a cloud. I’ve been using it at night and have been loving the way it feels on my skin and the smell (kind of reminds me of lavender)The only downfall for me is that I wish it was a little more moisturizing on the face after it’s applied but I do love this product. nan
