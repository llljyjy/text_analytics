This is a great product! It is truly more of a mask treatment than everday night cream. I have been using it every other night and sleeping with it on, and in the morning my skin looks hydrated and softer. I read other reviews that it doesnâ€™t rinse off well, however I do not have this problem. I will continue to use this and am buying for my sister as a gift too. Love it! Great Night Treatment!!!
