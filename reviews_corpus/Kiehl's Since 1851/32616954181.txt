So this product came in as advertised in a white container. I opened it and in a surprisingly but pleasant way, i was pleased by the odor. It does not feel artificial or heavily scented. almost unscentedThe first noticeable thing about this product is how smooth it feels on the skin. It really does feel smooth and silky to the face. No signs of abrasive substances in it. In just over 7 days of usage, i can notice how much clearer my skin is. I was already doing well with my new routine but this definitely has taken it to the next level. Compared to my previous facial cream, it is a tad more expensive, but honestly this is one of those scenarios where it would have to take a gargantuan price difference for me not to buy this again. Best facial cream i have ever tried.You hear that? best facial cream i have ever tried. #1 question to always answer with reviews: would you buy this product again? absolutely.
