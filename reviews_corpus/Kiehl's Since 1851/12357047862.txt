When investing in beauty products, sometimes it’s hard to know the quality or freshness of what you’re getting.  Kiehl’s Is one of my favorite brands and I basically love everything they do. I like to incorporate retinol into my beauty regimen, especially at night since skin can become more sensitive to UV exposure. The packaging is amazing.  I like to keep this product on my nightstand and use it as a step in my nighttime beauty routine on clean dry skin.

This serum is worth it’s weight in gold and I highly recommend it! getting. Worth it  - Get it today!
