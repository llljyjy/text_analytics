This product did not irritate my skin at all, so I was able to use it nightly with no problems. My skin looks refreshed after 2 weeks of regular use, and it feels nice and smooth.  Itâ€™s an interesting product in that there is a separate serum and powder that you mix before using for the first time. Gentle Retinol Treatment
