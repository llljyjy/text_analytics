I love this night serum. The fact that you add the active ingredient upon arrival makes the product seem fresh and thus more effective. I’ve had zero irritation from the kiehl’s serum, unlike other retinol creams I’ve used in the past. The serum behaves nicely with my other products and sinks in beautifully. My skin looks smoother and more clear. I just received a compliment on my skin this weekend, and this is the only thing that’s new. I got this bottle as a sample, but I plan to buy again. It’s pricy, but seriously effective. gentle and effective
