I have dry combination sensitive skin and Kiehl’s products always work for me! I currently use their cleanser, toner and ultra facial cream and was very excited when I was sent this mask in exchange of my honest review. I use this 3 times a week, alternating days with my retinol and I love it! I can tell a difference in my skin’s hydration and my skin is always glowing even in winter (which is crazy amazing)! It feels much softer to touch, supple and even fine lines are less noticeable. It’s a rich balm texture that’ll melt on your hands so initially I was worried it would break me out cause of how rich it is but it doesn’t and works amazing for my skin. Also a little goes a long way!! Adding this to my skincare routine!
