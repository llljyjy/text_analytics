I loved this night cream (used as the very last step of night routine). The first time I saw it I was scared of how rich and  dense it was, I used to use a night cream that I thought was dense but this one seemed like another level. To my surprised. It applies so easily and so smooth that it does feel like clouds. The smell is there, very relaxing like lavender and rosemary and I was afraid of irritation but it didnâ€™t happen.  You need more than what you think because it absorbs really fast. The feeling after applying is like baby skin, so velvety. The best part? No sticky or oily finish and waking up to a subtle glow that just makes me want to try the entire line of this. I Received this product for free from BA in exchange of my honest review Baby face!
