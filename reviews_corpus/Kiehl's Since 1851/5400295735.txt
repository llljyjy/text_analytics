I cannot say enough positive things about Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Glacial Glycoproteins. First things first, the smell. It is clean if anything. Not really a smell at all, and I like that. I tend to be really sensitive to things with a lot of scent, but this was great. Next, it is SUPER light weight. I have tried a lot of different moisturizers, and this one has to be the lightest I have felt. It is super light on the skin too, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t doing its job! My skin is freaking awesome right now. I really wanted to try this to see if it would bring back the “bounce“ to my skin, and it did, in about 2 weeks. I have never been more in love with a moisturizer than I am with this one. Also, as a person who tends to have oily skin, this is a miracle worker. My face didn’t get as “shiny“ throughout the day as it usually does with other face creams, and that made me even happier. I would give this product to everyone if I could. Face cream from the Gods!
