I have been using this for weeks now and have saw some improvement especially with the lines on my forehead, which is so frustrating to me! It really is effective! I like that this comes with a capsule that you screw on to the bottom of the bottle and crush and shake up yourself, so that makes the wonder of the shelf life a bit more non- concerning. Ive been using products containing retinol for a long time, and this is up there with being one of the best that I have used! It soaked into my skin rather quickly. I felt the little tingle that a good retinol will give off, so that tells me it is working. It is doing its job. At 1st, it did tend to dry my skin out but with the cell turn over, that’s to be expected. I have used this every night (I’m not sure if as a beginner you would want to start out using this every single day) and I have noticed results! I honestly can’t tell you anything I’ve found about this thats not to like! nan
