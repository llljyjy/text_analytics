This product is amazingly good for my skin! I have dry skin and this mask helps me a lot during harsh and dry winter weather. This mask has a thick, like cleansing balm texture with no weird chemical scent even though is fragrance-free. I’ve tried all 3 ways to use this mask, my most favorite one is the overnight mask. You don’t need a lot of the product to cover your entire face, apply it just like you apply your moisturizer. It melts into your skin once you give it a gentle massage and leave it overnight. The next day my skin look moist and hydrated. I’ve been used 3 times per week and I’m impressed with the results, no more dry flaky skin even after you wash your face with the cleanser. Recommended especially for people with dry skin like me.  Amazingly good for my dry skin
