I was looking down mmm for a mild facial cleanser to use during my rosacea flare ups. I can’t say enough about this product! I like the fact that  it comes in non plastic packaging, less waste and easy open. Second, when I first used it, it left my face soft yet thoroughly cleansed, not dry or parched. I don’t wear a lot of make up but it dissolved well what I was wearing. It’s non scented which I like and creates a nice, foamy and rich lather. This cleanser might just be my go to 100% of the time. Try it, you’ll love it!
