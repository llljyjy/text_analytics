I received this sample in exchange for an honest review. I have dry skin and I knew that my basic everyday moisturizer wasnâ€™t strong enough for nighttime during the winter. I love how this smells (so fresh and clean) and melts into your skin. It feels luxurious and not greasy! While i initially broke out, after three weeks of regular use (3 times a week) my skin feels great. It is much less dry and feels brighter and fuller. This is exactly what I was looking for! I also put this on over my night serum and it has been working well. Awesome thick moisturizer for dry skin!
