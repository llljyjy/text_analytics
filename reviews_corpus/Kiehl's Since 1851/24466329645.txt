This is definitely a cream and not so much what you typically see as a ‘serum’. The texture is just like whipped butter so it’s really smooth and even seems to provide a slight warming sensation when applied. I didn’t notice drastic changes in any fine lines but it played well with other skincare and makeup. Don’t think I’d purchase this for the price so far, and I’ve been using almost daily for two months or more. I don’t struggle with dark circles or bags under my eyes though so can’t speak to that. Good not great
