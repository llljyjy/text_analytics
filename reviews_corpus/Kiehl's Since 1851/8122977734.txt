I used this product a few times and I always get red spots on my cheeks from this cream. The other Kiehl’s products don’t do that. The scent is heavy and the texture is thick. I don’t find it smooth. It bunches/flakes on my skin when I move it around. I will stick with the daily ultra facial cream for my dry skin. Below average
