The cream is really thick and dense. A little goes a long way. It has a minty smell to it which makes you feel like spa-ish.Its really thick so the hydration part is fully satisfied. Doesnt let the skin dry till morning for sure.I would buy this product for dry skin days and recommend this product to my friends or family. Thick dense cream
