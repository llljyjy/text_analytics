I am under 40 but feel like my skin looks closer to 50.. okay joking but not really .. No life, dull, lines etc and I’ve tried numerous creams, serums etc in the past and for the most part I saw no change or not enough to make it worth any price. Many of them made my skin irritated and caused breakouts as well.  When I got this product to try I loved the airiness of it and the super light texture. It feels so smooth and fresh on my face and neck and within just a couple of days I noticed my skin was actually brighter! I couldn’t believe. I definitely recommend this cream! Definitely saw a difference
