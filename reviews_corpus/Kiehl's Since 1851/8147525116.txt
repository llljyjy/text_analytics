Title says it all. When I first received this product, I will admit I did use it sparingly. However I decided to buckle down and use it twice a day for the past 8 weeks. And after consistent use I will say I did notice that my under eyes are slightly brighter, and the fine lines from rubbing my eyes too much (yes, I know how bad this is for you) seemed to be lifted. Would I buy this again? Yes, I think over a longer period of time it will do exactly as promised. Was it an overnight miracle product? No, but then again nothing ever is. nan
