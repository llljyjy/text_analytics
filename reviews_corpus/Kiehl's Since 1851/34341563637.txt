The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane is awesome for making your skin appear more plump and moisturized. There is no smell so no worries about fragrance irritations. It is a bonus that the moisturizing power lasts 24 hours.Compared to other products I’ve tried, the product is either too think or too thin. This is just right. It allows for a smooth transition and your skin absorbs it really well without it feeling heavy and weighed down.I am going to do additional research to see if there is a facial cleaner of the same brand to utilize the complete system.I would recommend this product to my friends or family.
