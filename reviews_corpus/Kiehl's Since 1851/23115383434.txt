I love Kiehlâ€™s, but had never tried the Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum. I am very impressed. This specific serum made the area around my eyes noticeably softer and I noticed some reduction in my dark circles. This was also a great consistency, as it stayed put on my eye area and I was able to rub it in nicely. great serum
