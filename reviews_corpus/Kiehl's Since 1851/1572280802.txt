I hate writing negative reviews. But for this eye cream I don’t get why this is so highly rated. If your skin is even remotely wet or had product on it, the cream will just sit on your skin and it kind of separates and just feels weird. It’s super thick which is nice but for the money there are better creams out there. I will be returning. save your money
