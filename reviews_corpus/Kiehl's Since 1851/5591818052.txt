Overall good basic moisturizer but I would expect a little more oomph for the price. Pros: fragrance free, creamy, moisturizing, non-greasy and absorbs well. Doesnâ€™t pill.Cons: stung a little on my post tretinoin, sensitive skin. Not enough moisture for the whole day if you have dry/very dry skin. *got the product for free as a review as part of buzzagent Solid basic moisturizer.
