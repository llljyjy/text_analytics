I received a sample of the Kiehlâ€™s Super Multi-corrective Anti-aging Eye Cream, and I was very impressed! I love the rich, creamy texture, it spreads easy but is thick enough that you only need a little dab to cover your entire eye area. I have very dry skin, to the point where it can be tight and painful,  this offers relief in that delicate eye area. I think the area also looks more plump and smooth. I have already purchased more of this, I definitely recommend this product. Really delivers
