This product feels great on my skin. However, the jar only comes about 80% full. This is hard to tell because there are air pockets underneath the surface where you may not see. When I buy a jar of anything, whether it be the grocery store or premium skincare, I expect the container to be full. At a $65 premium price this is frustrating and is false advertising.
