I received the Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum complimentary for my honest review. At first I was kinda put off by the fact that I needed to mix the retinol into the serum, but it wasn’t too difficult. I did keep that bottom portion on for a few days as to not waste any of the serum. I know the serum is meant more for helping reduce the appearance of wrinkles, but I found it to decrease the coloring of acne scars and other dark spots on my skin. It left my skin feeling smooth. I was definitely impressed that there was a noticeable difference in my skin in just a few days. I’m excited to see the long term results. The serum retails for around $80 which is pricey, but I would buy it based on the results I have seen on my skin. Visible results in just a few days
