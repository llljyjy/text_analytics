Phenomenal! Every time I think Kiehl’s has topped every other skincare line by doing something amazing, they go and top themselves! I use everything from Augustinus Bader to La Mer to Neutrogena and this has given me results that others have promised. I haven’t had any skin aggravation, no terrible smell, just results! Thank goodness bc I had just about lost hope! Goodbye 11s & expression lines & good riddance! I highly recommend! I am 43 going on 30! Kiehl’s Since 1851 Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum…my new Best Friend! 40 What?!?!
