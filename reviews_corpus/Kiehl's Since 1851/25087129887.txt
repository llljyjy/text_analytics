I absolutely love this product, especially in the cold, dry winter months. A little goes a long way, and it provides full, moisturizing coverage. Not greasy - long-lasting and light. I recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin. My skin is usually combination, and it does not cause oil or breakouts. Love for all seasons and skin types
