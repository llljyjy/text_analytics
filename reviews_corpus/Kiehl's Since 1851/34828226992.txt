I kept seeing this on my feed, so I am finally glad I got to try it. The product absorbed quickly and I like that there is no strong smell. It is not greasy and my skin feels hydrated without it making my skin feel heavy with product. No breakouts that I noticed...I still have to see how it does in the coldest Chicago weather *Fingers crossed* but I have hope for it. Good product overall, I can feel the good quality ingredients. LOVE how my skin feels!
