I am halfway through this bottle and I like it a lot, but it is not a miracle worker. It has been gradually lightening my dark spots and been good for wrinkles and acne too (it has salicylic acid). I love having a product that does these things and DOESN’T leave a heavy feeling on my face. For that reason, I would purchase it again. But, it probably isn’t the most effective product for any one of these things. Great but not a miracle worker
