I’ve been using this eye serum for over a month now, almost 2 and I have been pretty impressed. I don’t typically use any eye cream so this has been an addition to my route that I am really liking. A little goes a long way, I just pump a tiny amount on my finger and use that for both eyes and it leaves them feeling smooth and very hydrated. It has a silky, creamy texture and I will use it at night on a bare face as well as in the morning under my makeup, and it layers good. I haven’t seen a major difference in dark circles, but I feel like it does brighten my under eye and I feel more awake looking. The bottle is nice and the pump works well. I will continue to use it because I really love the hydration it gives me. Hydrating and silky
