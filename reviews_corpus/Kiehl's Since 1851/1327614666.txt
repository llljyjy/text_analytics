I really like Kiehl’s Avocado eye cream because its thick and moisturizing, so was hopeful for this one, but for some reason, I can’t seem to find an eye cream that doesn’t irritate my eyes. They look worse after using this cream. Sadly, will have to return. Another eye cream that's too strong for my skin
