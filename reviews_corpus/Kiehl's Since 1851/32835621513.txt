I love the Kiehl’s brand. Everything that I’ve tried from them has been of great quality and has done my skin so many food things! This product is no exception. The consistency of the serum is very creamy and feels like a regular eye cream rather than a sticky serum. You really don’t need a lot of it as it spreads very evenly and thinly once you start to massage it into the skin. I will say, when I started using the product, I didn’t have very noticeable dark circles (in my opinion) but as I used it for several weeks, I noticed that my under eyes in particular started to look brighter and the fine lines started to be less prominent as well! I wasn’t really expecting much from this product as most eye creams haven’t done anything for my eye area other than hydrate. This product is definitely good if you want to lighten those dark circles around your eyes. I can’t say however, if it’ll help out those who have extremely dark circles, but it’s definitely worth a shot with this product in particular. Non-Sticky Creamy Serum
