I was extremely excited to try this hydrating mask from Kiehl’s in exchange for my honest feedback, because I have been on tretinoin for a few months now. I regularly have flaky, dry areas on my face that are not cute! So, when I got the chance to try this out, I jumped on it. It’s so.. rich! That’s the best way to describe it. The high percentage of squalane in this mask hydrates my skin beyond belief. I applied it the first night and couldn’t believe how soft my skin was the next morning! And after using it 3 times in one week, the flaky areas on my facial skin are basically gone! Finally I found a mask that is truly nourishing and hydrating to my in-need skin! I would recommend this product to anybody with dry to very dry skin. I definitely wouldn’t have been able to use this before tret, when my skin was very oily. I got this just in time for the harsher cold weather. I also love how big the jar is! Perfect for people on Tretinoin!
