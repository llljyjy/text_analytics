Like most things in life, consistency in using this product is key. The vitamin C helps brighten dark circles while the hyaluronic acid reduces fine lines. Iâ€™m a night owl and would rather miss out on beauty sleep than making memories, so this product is essential for my skincare regimen! All I use is two pea sized drops (or less), and after using my eye cream for 8 weeks there is still 1/2 a bottle. The packaging is very professional looking too. nan
