I was recently sent Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega Rich Clod cream to try out and provide my feedback. I love using rich creams at night to help keep my skin moisturizer and help repair all the sun damage that my skin incurs during the summer and this is exactly what I get from this face cream.  It comes in a jar which I prefer and has a slightly blue tint that is unlike any other creams I have tried in the past.  I like that the face cream contains Omega 3 and 6 to help strengthen your skin barrier and although the cream itself is very rich, it’s also lightweight and doesn’t feel heavy on your face. I also really enjoy the light scent and my skin stays hydrated all through the night. Like a dream
