This is my first time using a product from this brand and oh my goodness, this will not be my last! Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Omega Rich Cloud Cream was SO soft to the touch and the lavender smell made it such a great night time routine for me. My skin literally drank this and when I woke up, it was visibly smoother and hydrated but not overly moisturized to where I look oily. I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily in the southern heat with humidity and this is a perfect go to for a night time moisturizer. I will be buying this! Amazing!
