I’ve been using this product twice a day, almost every day (did forget a couple of times). And while I have noticed a subtle difference in appearance of some finer lines around my eyes, it doesn’t seem to help as much when concerning the dark circles. That being said, some of that is genetics, which can’t usually be fixed with just a cream. Giving this product a 3, it does work some, and maybe I just need more time with it. Otherwise, it goes on nicely under makeup, and doesn’t feel super oily or heavy. I might recommend this product, if it weren’t too expensive. Ok, not great
