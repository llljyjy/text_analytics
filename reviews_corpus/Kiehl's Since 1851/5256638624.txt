I have a lot of dark spots on my face that are hard to cover with makeup so I was very excited to try Kiehlâ€™s dark spot solution. I used this as often as I was able and have started to notice a big improvement in my skin. My dark spots have lightened enough to the point that they almost blend right in with the rest of my face. I am impressed! Big improvement!
