I have been looking to add Retinol serum into my night-time routine and kiehl’s retinol fast release wrinkle-reducing night serum is a good starter serum for that. I didn’t like the mixing of powder capsule into the serum step much Because you have to make sure that consistency is right. At first, I have started using it twice a week in the night and once my skin got used to it, I am using it thrice a week. I always put a moisturiser over it.  I haven’t noticed much of the difference in the fine lines but it did make my skin softer. I am giving it more time to see how it works. Good starter retinol serum
