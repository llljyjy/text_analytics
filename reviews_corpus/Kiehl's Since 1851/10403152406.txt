The ingredients list in so great. It’s short and has all the good stuff! The squalene is emollient and locks in all the mmoistur. I use this in place of an evening moisturizer, or on top of a moisturizer if I’m really dry. I have oily and acne prone skin on my Tzone so the salicylic acid in this is perfect for me. Doesn’t feel heavy and sinks in within 30 minutes. It feels like the LRP balm when I first put it on, but this has better ingredients for my skin needs. Great amount for the price too! Definitely recommend!! Great ingredients and very moisturizing
