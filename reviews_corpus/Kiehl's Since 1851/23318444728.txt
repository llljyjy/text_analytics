I received this product in exchange for my honest review and after using it for a week straight, morning and night, I am definitely in love! I suffer from really dry skin during the harsh winter cold and I can definitely tell a difference between appearance and feel of my skin. Its super easy to use and apply. Its thick which is nice because it absorbs slowly which is what my skin needs! A Must Have for Dry Skin!
