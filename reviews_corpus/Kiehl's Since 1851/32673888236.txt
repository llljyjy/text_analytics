Excellent at helping to reduce the fine lines.  Had the crow feet lines appear and I had been looking for a way to help them look better.  I had a chance to give this a try and glad that I did! Smooth feeling and very pleasant to apply. A little product goes a long way. Good a making lines look minimal!
