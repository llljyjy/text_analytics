Night creams are just a dime a dozen right? Wrong. Not all nighttime moisturizers are created equal, and this beauty from Kiehls is definitely a leader of the pack. I was gifted this cream to sample in exchange for my honest review from @kiehls and @bzzagent. And folks, I am SHOOK. It’s so hard for me to find a rich moisturizer that has a silky finish instead of a greasy one that still gets the job done when it comes to keeping my dry skin happy. This cream does that and then some! I wake up to skin that feels renewed, with a finer texture that looks plump and healthy and just feels downright amazing. I definitely think this one has earned a spot in my long-term rotation as a holy grail moisturizer. I haven’t tried one this good in a long time- and I doubt I will find one this good again anytime soon! If you are on the fence, give this dew from heaven a try. You won’t regret it! Holy Grail Night Cream!
