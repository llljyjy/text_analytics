Kiehl’s retinol fast release wrinkle reducing night serum is a really good product.This product is hydrating and gentle on the skin . It’s was easy to apply and the texture was very stable. Some of my finer lines did go away but it did very little to my more developed wrinkles. It’s a great product to minimize your wrinkles but does little to wrinkles that are more prominent. I was also happy on how firm my skin got . I would recommend this product to family and friends. Gentle on the skin.
