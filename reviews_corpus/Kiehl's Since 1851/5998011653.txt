This moisturizer doesn’t get enough credit. I have very sensitive skin, I’ve broken out in hives and irritation even from biossance products which is supposed to be as natural as you can get. This moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated all day without having to reapply and never bothers my skin. If you’re still on the fence, try a sample and I promise you won’t look back. Highly recommend.
