I’ve definitely seen results in the texture and hydration of my skin after using this product 3x for a week. The formula is super interesting as a balm that melts into a cream/lotion, similar to a cleansing balm. I was worried this would cause the mask to feel greasy and oily, but that’s not the case at all. I don’t find that it easily transfers on my pillow. I love that it’s fragrance-free and made for sensitive skin, but it does have a smell to it that is almost silicone-like. I noticed it a lot more the first time I used it, but I became more used to it over time. The benefits I’ve seen are definitely worth putting up with the slight smell. Moisturizing, but not greasy!
