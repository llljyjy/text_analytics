I was given this product as a free sample through BzzAgent. I struggle with facial dryness, especially in the winter time. I can honestly say it works wonders when it comes to moisturizing my face. Only downside is, all that moisture causes me to break out with white heads. I never really get white heads anymore, as Iâ€™m a 25 year old male with a consistent routine. I definitely plan on adding this to my night time routine. It is quite pricey though. Worth every penny though. For the first time in my life, people are commenting on how good my facial skin looks, regardless of the white head out breaks. BzzAgent Free Sample
