This cream has a pretty baby blue shade and the scent of a lavender field. It looks like it could be very heavy but upon application it absorbed easily into my skin. I have really dry, sensitive skin and I did notice a slight burning sensation initially. It could have been the essential oils...It did calm down after a few hours . My skin felt hydrated in the morning. Lines looked softer and plump. Other than the sting I felt it was a good product...but maybe not so great for sensitive skins. I received this complimentary for my honest review. Soft and Plump
