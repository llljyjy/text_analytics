I really liked the Kiehl’s eye serum. If you’re looking for an eye moisturizer, this is not it. It’s more of a treatment. Seeing it was labeled as a serum, I expected it to be thin. It’s actually more the consistency of a primer. By the way, it works beautifully under makeup.I loved everything about this vitamin C for my under eyes. At about 4 weeks I noticed my eye area was smother. My makeup looked better and I didn’t need to do as much camouflaging in that area. It takes time to work, which for me says it’s not a gimmick…It’s working to provide results. I would definitely recommend it!!!! Very good!
