After the first week I have absolutely loved this product.  I am not new to retinols so I went in with a daily application not expecting to have any peeling.  Well.  I definitely had peeling and flaking which as weird as it sounds, I was so pleased with.  No new products Ive used have produced those results which leads me to believe this is a stronger product and is targeting deeper than others.  Such a fan.  Will continue to use and purchase Initial Shed to full on glow
