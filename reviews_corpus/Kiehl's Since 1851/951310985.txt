Love this eye cream. I use it daily in the AM under makeup and concealer. I do need to let this sink in a bit before applying makeup. Recently ive been doing the following:  apply this eye cream in 2â€™layers. Let skink in while i do my hair. Apply smashbox undereye primer. Let sink in. Apply tarte undereye corrector  amd lancome concealer. Pat out w finger. Set very lightly w laura mercier powder. As long as i work quickly to set i love this combo! great eye cream
