This is genuinely the best moisturizer i’ve tried to date, and i’ve been around the block. I got this as a free sample last year (I don’t remember if it was from Sephora though) and after using up the tiny container it was an INSTANT re-buy (I got the 28mL). The first thing about it is the lack of smell: It literally, and when I say literally, I mean it, has not a hint of any fragrance or scent (not even that plastic-ey smell some fragrance-free products have) which is amazing for my migraine prone self. Then, the texture! It’s smooth, does not leave any traces, any gross oily feeling and no dryness. It really is lightweight but that girl HYDRATES like crazy: I was able to go both summer (it’s light enough, and does not sweat off your face or leave a film over it) and winter, which leads me to my last point: its’ efficacy... Every single winter, I struggle with super red, dry patches on my chin and cheeks from how dry it is outside, and i’m so so so glad to say that this year was my first them thanks to this moisturizer. Actual lifesaver. It feels good under makeup, under your mask, with no makeup on, in the sun, in the cold, that ish is universal frfr (it also does not block your pores or make pimples worse, at least for me, it’s super gentle). The only downside would be the price, since it’s unaffordable for most regular students to use as a daily moisturizer, but overall, I’m satisfied. Genuine lifesaver (and skinsaver)
