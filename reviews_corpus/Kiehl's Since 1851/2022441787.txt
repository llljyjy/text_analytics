So far so good. I knocked off a star because I didn’t like having to mix the formula myself and feel all the mixture didn’t come out of the small portion so I don’t even know if I have the complete formulation correct. This seems to leave room for human error. I do know that this has caused zero irritation and normally retinols irritate me and I have to introduce slowly. Seems I can use this nightly without issue. Can’t really speak to results as it hasn’t been long enough - couple weeks. However, they claim results in 5 days! I think that is an outlandish claim for any product to make and they really should reel that in. This product does glide on smoothly and feels moisturizing. I do follow with a moisturizer. I tried to attach two videos to show how I messed up at first then got it together but am only able to upload photos. The product does easily pump out bottle and glides on smooth. It seems I’ll go through this in about 6 weeks time. Pretty quickly using about 3-4 times per week night. For $80 idk if I’ll purchase Non-irritating/Did I mix it right?/Extreme claims
