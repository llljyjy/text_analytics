This was my first time trying this brand. I liked the consistency of the cream and the way it applied. I also felt that my skin still felt moisturized in the morning. I also love that itâ€™s listed as a clean product. My only note to make is that it does have a somewhat strong lavender scent, which i enjoyed, but some may not. smells great
