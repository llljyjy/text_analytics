I’ve been using this serum for a couple of days now and though I’m still waiting to see visible improvement, I haven’t had any redness or reaction to the potency of the retinol. I also love the idea of mixing the powder and base myself for a “fresh” formulaSo far, everything I have tried from Kiehls has been nothing but top tier and works wonders for my skin. For anyone interested in buying this, I’d recommend to read the Q&A section.I would definitely recommend this night retinol. nan
