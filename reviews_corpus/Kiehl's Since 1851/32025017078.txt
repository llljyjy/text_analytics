I’ve been trying dark spots solution for about 12 weeks, and in those weeks I’ve seen my skin brighter and my dark spots fade away. I’ve had some dark spots and hyper pigmentation around my chin area for a while and some acne scars that just didn’t go away.  Since I start using this product I’ve seen the dark spots on my chin area diminish.. I love how finally they have started to fade away, were you almost can’t see them anymore. Nothing would cover up those dark spots. So I’m really happy that this product has worked. I use it as a spot treatment on my face, neck and chest.. so far I love it and will continue using it. Loving this dark spots solution
