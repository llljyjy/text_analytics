I like this product a lot more than other retinol products I’ve tried so far. I definitely have noticed a difference in my skins texture and fine lines. You really only need to use a small amount to get the job done. My sensitive skin handled this product very well which I was relieved since that’s not always the case. I will be purchasing this product once I’m out as I’m happy with the results so far. I would highly recommend this product. Amazing new retinol serum by Kiehl’s
