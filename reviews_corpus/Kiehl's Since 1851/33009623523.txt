I knew from the name that this was a cloud cream, but actually seeing and feeling the texture in person was insane. The actual product feels like marshmallow fluff and it’s so soft. It has a light lavender fragrance, so if you’re sensitive to it allergic to fragrance, keep that in mind. However, if fragrance doesn’t bother you, then this is a wonderful night cream. They aren’t kidding when they say that it absorbs easily into the skin. I learned from my first use that you need to dot this around on your face with a finger tip rather than putting it directly in your hands first. This absorbs so fast into the skin, without hardly any effort. It just sinks right in. Come morning time, my skin looks refreshed and hydrated, but not at all oily. I have dry skin and even though I love hydrating night creams, they can leave my skin a little shiny in the morning. This doesn’t do that. Honestly, so long as fragrance doesn’t bother you, I would recommend this to anyone with any skin type. Absorbs Like a Dream!
