I haven’t had a lot of time to really test it out but I like it so far. I haven’t noticed much of a difference from the few weeks of trying it every other night. I do like the consistency, texture, and the way it feels in my skin. I don’t know if I would recommend this product because of the price but if I notice dramatic changes then I might. I haven’t had any reactions from using it either. So far so good …
