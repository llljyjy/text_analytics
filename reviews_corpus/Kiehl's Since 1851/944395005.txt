If you like LRP Tolierane or the like you’ll love this. My skin: dry, itchy, red, sensitized. Even in the sub tropics we get colder weather and less humidity which wreaks havoc with my skin. This is a thicker cream meant to repair and protect the skin’s barrier so not for oily complexions. The colloidal oatmeal, beta glucan and absence of fragrance make this an excellent choice for sensitive and dry types. A small amount goes a long way and the effect is relatively immediate. I recommend layering this over a hyaluronic acid serum for extra moisture, especially overnight. One caveat: it won’t layer well under liquid foundation or primers; this is due to cream vs water based products. Dries to a matte finish and is very comfortable on the skin regardless. I’m a licensed esthetician and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to clients. Relief for sensitive skin
