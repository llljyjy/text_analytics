I really enjoyed this retinol serum as it made me feel like a scientist putting it together! After having the chance to use it for just over a month, I’ve already noticed the effects. I have a few dry spots especially on my forehead and this product has helped reduce those areas. While 2 weeks isn’t enough time to see any anti-wrinkle effects, this is a really enjoyable serum to use. It absorbs well too. Great Retinol product to try
