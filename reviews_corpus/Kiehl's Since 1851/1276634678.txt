This is a gentle but effective serum.  My skin is often sensitive to retinol but it was perfectly fine on this. The experienced no redness or rawness from it. I did have mild flaking, but I slouched them off gently in the shower and it revealed baby soft skin underneath. The instructions for attaching and mixing the active ingredients were simple and easy.  I also like it that the dispenser is completely closed so there is no air contamination.  I took off one star because I find myself using quite a bit of product to cover my face and neck,  so if budget is an issue this product could improve.  Overall,  it was a good, effective serum and I would recommend it. Gentle but effective
