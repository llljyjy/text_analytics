I love love this serum. Not once did the serum irritate my skin. The serum is nice and thick and goes on nice and smooth. Once applied, there is no sticky feeling. I have noticed some fine lines around my eyes starting to fade. It only takes a little bit at one time during the application. Give it time; you will begin to see some results! Amazing Serum!
