Honestly I’m terrible about using eye cream twice a day but I have used this at least once a day and definitely see reduced puffiness and darkness and the fine lines under my eyes are gone! I was worried after reading reviews that said it dried their skin out but I didn’t experience this at all! It had a nice consistency as I applied it but also absorbed quickly. I’ve tried other vitamin c eye creams that felt sticky after they dried but this just left soft skin and is my favorite I have tried in a long time. Definitely keeping in my routine and planning on buying more when this runs out. No more fine lines!
