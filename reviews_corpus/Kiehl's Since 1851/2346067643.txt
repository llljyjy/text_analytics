it is moisturizing and feels very very light on skin . Inside the jar it is very cloud like light texture feel to it . spreads great on skin and no white cast or greasy feel .I am not sure if anyone noticed but it makes my skin glow which it doesn’t claim to. not GREASY but glowing, the kind that i haven’t experienced yet without a light weight feel . every time i use it i get compliments and the glow is a bonus of course. it is great under my foundation as well doesn’t pill and hold on to foundation nicely. I have been using it for 3 months and no complaints so far. i am loving it
