I’ve just started using this and it seems alright so far in terms of hydration and dealing with occasional puffiness.  A little different from the usual eye cream that I usually think of but a little bit is all you need.   Someone at a local Sephora helped me find this item and while I appreciated their attention and advice, they also commented that this would be suitable for my yellow skin tone.  I’m not sure how the lighting in the store made me appear that day, but I actually have an Olive skin tone.  Will try not to think negatively about the comment but Sephora needs to train their staff to understand that not all Asians have a yellow skin tone.  In fact, there is a wide range of colors and tones. nan
