Took off 2 stars for 2 things primarily:1. This is NOT reef friendly so I wouldn’t recommend bringing this along with you on beach trips. 2. This pills under makeup. I suggest only using this when you’re not going to put any foundation on because it will leave little white particles all over your face as you try to blend out foundation. NOT Reef Friendly!
