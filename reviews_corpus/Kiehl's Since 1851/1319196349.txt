The Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum is truly amazing. I’ve been wanting to try a retinol serum for a long time. I’m 45 and I notice that my wrinkles, skin texture and tone has really changed and gotten worse. When I look at picture from even a couple of years ago, I look so much older. I love Kiehl’s products because of the quality and ingredients. The Retinol, is such a high quality serum. You mix 2 parts together, so it’s extremely fresh when you get it to use. I love that. It’s gentle and feels so nice on your skin. I love that it stinks into your skin quickly with out leaving a greasy film behind. My skin was left feeling nice and I could put moisturizer on after about 5 mins. I noticed such a difference after a week, I was blown away. My wrinkles we absolutely not as deep as before the serum, my skin looked plump, brighter and even my pores were more refined. The texture of my face was smoother and just felt softer. I will definitely be repurchasing the Kiehl’s retinol serum, I was so surprised to see a visible positive change in my skin. I experienced NO negative reactions. I really hope people try it, I feel like it’s worth it. Amazing Retinol Serum
