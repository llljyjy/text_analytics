I really love this everyday facial cleanser and itâ€™s perfect for everyday use and is gentle on my skin. I only knocked a star because I tend to still have diet on my face when I use my toner after. Some of that may still be makeup residue which means I should probably also be using a makeup remover prior to washing my face. Also, this is NOT drying at all on the skin. great everyday face wash
