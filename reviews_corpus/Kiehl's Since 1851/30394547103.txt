It was neat how you had to put the capsule into the bottle to get everything started.  The instructions to do that were super easy to follow.  The product is gentle enough to use everyday and I can see results from using it only a few weeks.  Make sure to apply sunscreen with use as that is a warning on the label.  I am very fair and did not seem to burn any quicker when using this. Great addition to nighttime routine!
