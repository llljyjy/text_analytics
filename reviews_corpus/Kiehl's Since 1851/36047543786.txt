I am giving it 5 stars although my full 12 weeks to see results aren’t up yet.  I did get it for free from BzzAgent and it does feel really nice and refreshing to put on, glides on easy without a greasy feeling.  It does have a strong smell of alcohol though, and although it doesn’t irritate me it might for someone else, just thought I’d share that. nan
