Iâ€™ve tried so many eye creams in my 38 years and have found only a few that have worked for me, this being one of them. (I did try a patch test, due to my sensitive eyes, 24 hours later with no reaction I applied it along with my normal skin care routine). Upon initial application the eye cream was thicker in consistency, but easily spread over my skin, it sank in after a few minutes and worked well with my other skin care, it did not pill up like some denser creams can, or irritate my skin or my eyes. My eyes looked and felt moisturized. I use this cream at night time only since it is on the thicker side. Thick & Hydrating
