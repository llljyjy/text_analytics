I was selected by BzzAgent to try this Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream sample. I was treating her for more than 10 days. This product is incredibly creamy. It is excellent to apply it at night. Moisturizes the area around the eyes well. In my eyes I only eliminate the dark color that I had in the eyelid and in the dark circles. I visibly improve the small wrinkles in the corner of the eyes. It didnâ€™t help me in the brow bone area. I think it is an excellent product, but maybe it lacks something that can help with the lifting of droopy eyelids and that eliminates or visibly helps the bags under the eyes. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity of having been selected to try such an excellent brand and product. This is my most sincere review. Very Good Product!
