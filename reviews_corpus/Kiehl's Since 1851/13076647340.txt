For a while I had noticed that my eyes always had that tired, lack of sleep look—the crows feet were getting worse as well as the dark circles…nothing I tried really made a noticeable difference! But after a week of using Kiehl’s Super Multi-corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream I saw improvement! Finally!!! It’s been a month now and my dark circles are almost nonexistent and my eyes just look younger and well-rested all the way around! Thanks Kiehl’s, for making growing older so much more beautiful ! nan
