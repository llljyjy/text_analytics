My wife loves this cream. it is not greasy, light, makes the skin supple. The cream, in comparison with others, noticeably wins in its composition and effects on the skin around the eyes. perfectly moisturizes and nourishes the skin. without leaving a greasy trace on the eyelids, does not roll into folds. I would recommend this cream to everyone I know. Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream
