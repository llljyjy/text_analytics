Results in 2 weeks is unheard of, until now! I’ve used a number of eye creams over the years & while they all provided moisture I didn’t see much else & the times I did, it was temporary as the cream had light reflecting particles. This doesn’t camouflage your concern it actually treats it. This Keihls eye cream has evened the tone of my skin around my eyes, brightened the shadowy looking darkness at my inner corners & practically vanished my fine lines as well as firmed the skin around my eyes! I’ve been using 2x daily for just over 1 month, and while it is pricey at this rate I don’t ever want to be without it. It absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave a tacky feeling to your skin, doesn’t migrate into your eyes if you start sweating and wears well under makeup. *Pics provided taken with back camera on iPhone 11 Pro in natural daylight with no filter, no makeup, and no photo editing* Real results!
