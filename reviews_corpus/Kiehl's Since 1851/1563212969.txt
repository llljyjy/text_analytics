One of the most effective eye serums I have ever tried, period. Yes it does have dimethicone in it, but it didn’t give me any problems. It’s been almost two years and with day and night use I had no milia growing. And I did get milia from quite a few other eye products. I used to have a visible line under my left eye and now it’s gone. GONE. I also didn’t notice any new developments of fine lines, especially considering I have awful sleep schedule. This is a keeper and I will be buying this eye serum as long as they don’t discontinue it. My 4th bottle.
