As I enter my 40’s my skin is starting to change so continuously looking for products that give you the most bang for the buck.  While I have tried everything from moisturizers to peels and other store-bought items, I have recently found the importance of using high-quality products and the difference it really makes.  When finding out what is needed for my skin for “top 3“ I found that Retinol was on the list so tried the Kiehls Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle Reducing Night serum.  1) I found a night serum to be the best way to go since you do not have to worry about a greasy face but 2) this product glides on great and ensures you wake up with a fresh glow.  The product goes far and has little to no smell which is great.  I have noticed a plumping with some of my fine lines, especially around my lips so this product checks the boxes!
