High hopes but the overnight mask just sat on my skin and didnâ€™t absorb at all. Tried it as thin layer, then next time thicker layer. The regular face cream works well for me but the mask was a fail. I gave it to a friend in hopes it may work for her. Disappointed since product didn't absorb at all
