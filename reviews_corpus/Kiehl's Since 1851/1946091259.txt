After using for 12 weeks I didn’t really notice a difference with my dark spots. I tried on acne scars as well and didn’t see a difference. It does make my skin feel great and it adds a glow while absorbing quickly so I liked that because I have oily skin and have to be careful with serums. There is no smell which is also nice. Didn't solve dark spot problem
