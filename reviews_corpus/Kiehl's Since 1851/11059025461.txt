Great lightweight moisturizer! Leaves your skin super soft and moisturizer. However I don’t think it’s a great moisturizer for the cold months. For warmer weather/ summer months this would we a great choice. I also think it’s best used as a daytime moisturizer than a nighttime one, I would recommend something a little heavier due to the fact that our skin loses moisture as we sleep. nan
