I really like this product - Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution. It feels very refreshing and smooth on my skin. I love the scent as well, and that’s it in a glass bottle. I’ve been using it for a few months now and I definitely see the results, my skin became brighter, smoother, and dark spots got less visible and my skin became clearer overall. I have sun-damaged skin and dark spots post-acne, and I see week after week how my skin is improving when I use this solution. Also, my skin is pretty sensitive and this solution is not irritating at all, it feels so fresh, light, and absorbing. I like the ingredients and consistency as well. I received this sample complimentary. Love it!
