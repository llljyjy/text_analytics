I was recently gifted an amazing product by Kiehls that has been saving my skin this Winter! Mutuals, I give you... Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Face Mask with 10.5% Squalane!This fragrance-free hydrating face mask is a miracle for dry skin! It locks in moisture and strengthens the skin’s moisture barrier overnight. It’s super intensively hydrating and isn’t only great for winter, but has been helpful with my tret/retinol nights!This overnight mask has a very interesting  balm-to-oil texture that melts into the skin to prevent excess overnight moisture loss. Its lightweight and absorbs quickly.  It does have a bit of a chemical smell that quickly dissipates so it’s nothing to worry about IMO. The benefits def outweigh this little “meh“ - I wake up with hydrated and healthy-look skin each time I use this! Plus, it doesn’t take much to get the appropriate coverage so this pot should last A WHILE!This mask is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging! Winter Skin Savior
