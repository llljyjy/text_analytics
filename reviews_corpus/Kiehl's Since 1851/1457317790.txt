Iâ€™m always on the look out for the greatest! I have tried many face creams that are usually just okay, when I tried a sample of this cream I was impressed that it seem so simple, but as soon as I put it on my face, I noticed how hydrated my skin felt without looking greasy, not only did it look that way in my skin I could it feel it absorbed well into my skin and even eye area. I was ingredients are impressive as well! Will continue to use!! simple yet effective!
