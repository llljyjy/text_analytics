I didn’t start developing dark circles under my eyes until I was in my late 20s. I have tried almost everything to try to get rid of them and nothing worked! That is until I tried Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Eye Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum. Even after a week and a half I started noticing a significant decrease in the darkness of my under eye dark circles (which usually look like I have 2 black eyes). Even though it’s a serum, it’s a little thicker so it’s not runny and super easy to apply. A little bit goes a really long way. It has become apart of my skin care routine in the morning when I first wake up and at night right before I go to bed. I will definitely buy this product again after I run out. It’s amazing to actually find something that works for dark circles after trying so many products that didn’t work. I will definitely recommend this product to everyone that asks me about dark circles under their eyes. Dark Circles Be Gone
