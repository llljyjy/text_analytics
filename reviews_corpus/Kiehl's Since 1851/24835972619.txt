I received this product complimentary from Kiehlâ€™s in exchange for my honest review. My skin is already accustomed to retinol use so this product is perfect for me. I love that this particular retinol serum is fast acting. I also really like the packaging and how you have to activate it by mixing the retinol and serum together. This product caused no pilling, irritation or dryness on my skin. It blended in very nicely under my night time moisturizer. I can tell that my skin is clearing up and appears healthier. nan
