I am glad to have been reintroduced to try kiehls. I love midnight recovery line. I have tried other products like eyecream and serum in past and very happy to use this Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is very rich and nourishing but lightweight. very hydrating face cream . Has a light clean scent. My skin is normal to dry First time I used it, it appeared thick in jar but fluffy and lightweight , absorbed instantly I felt my skin is hydrated and glowing right away. It’s not oily and the skin feels hydrated. woke up with healthy looking skin. With few weeks of daily use my skin is healthy looking and softer. I want to use it more to see if there are any visible effects for lines. I would recommend the product and suggest to use daily and give it time to see the difference. I will definitely replenish once I am out of it. love it
