First of all I think it’s fun and different that you have to “finish making the product” by blending the two mixtures together. Makes for a fresh on the spot product. After the initial use I had a bit if redness on my cheeks, however it went away shortly after and it did not sting or burn in any way. After a few days I did notice that the fine wrinkles around my eyes were much more faint, along with my forehead wrinkles. My skin feels soft and the longer I use it the better it feels.  I will continue to use this product and will recommend it to others. Super fresh and it wreaking works
