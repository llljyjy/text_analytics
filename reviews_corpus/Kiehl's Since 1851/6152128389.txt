I am a firm believer in Kiehl’s masks, so when this dropped I was eager to try it out. WOW! This is everything I wanted for a soothing, skin restoring formula. Easy to apply and rinsed off easily enough with warm water. Only a slight scent, which I was grateful for because I am not an aloe fan. I’ve tried many other masks similar to this from other brands and can genuinely say this is the most pleasant user experience I’ve had.I was shocked at how 10 minutes with the mask made my face look lovely! My redness had decreased, even around active breakout sites, and my skin felt smooth and plump. Definitely a great one to do before an event as it makes you look like you’ve already got a layer of foundation on!My combo to dry MASSIVELY SENSITIVE skin loved this, and I think it would do great on oily skin as well. My mom, who has extremely dry skin, liked this but said that she preferred the avocado mask from this brand when asked to pick the two. Regardless, we agreed this was worth the buy! Does everything it claims and more!
