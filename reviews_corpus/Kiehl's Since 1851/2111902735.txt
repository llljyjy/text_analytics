These reviews are varied. Itâ€™s a reminder that everyone has different skin. I have super sensitive eyes and most eye creams give me eczema with flaking. Not this one!  I love it. It is super moisturizing but absorbs well. My makeup goes on very smoothly over it without pilling. My new go-to! Love it!
