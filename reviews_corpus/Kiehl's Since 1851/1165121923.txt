I’m not super into these night time specific products and don’t usually go for them, I was INCREDIBLY surprised with this product. Texture - thick creamy mashed potato like texture (weird I know but it’s the best way I can describe it, I think it’s the shea butter base)Scent - minimal to nothing which is important to meNo mineral oils or silicones, also important to me.Loved putting it on, felt really luxurious. Felt comfortable layered on top of my regular night time routine. When I woke up my skin looked really clear, the tone was even, I had a beautiful glow and people asked me throughout the day if I had gotten a facial over the weekend!! This product has officially become a part of my forever routine. GLOWING & FLAWLESS OVERNIGHT!
