I received this product as a free sample, and was instructed to use it for 12 weeks consistently.  I am so happy that I was given 12 weeks of use before reviewing because after that amount of time with consistent use I saw noticeable results.  At this point my overall complexion is brighter, more even, and my dark spots are more faded.  After about a month of use, I was starting to see an overall brighter complexion, but two small dark spots on my cheek that I am self-conscious about were still present.  I intentionally used the product on my whole face, and then every morning placed an extra drop on each dark spot.  It took time, but I am really, really pleased with the results, and I truly feel that my skin looks healthier, brighter, and more even.  I have reduced and even stopped wearing concealer in places I wore it before.  I would highly recommend this product and most likely will purchase it.  It takes time, but it is worth it! Consistent use gives great results
