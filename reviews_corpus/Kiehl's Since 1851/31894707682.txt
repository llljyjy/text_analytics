I was skeptical of this product before receiving, but the first time I put it on, it had such a silky feel that I knew I was going to like it even if it didn’t do anything for my dark spots... But my skin does look better than before! It didn’t make the spots vanish, but helped to lighten them quite a bit. And honestly, I don’t feel the need to put on moisturizer as often when regularly using! Loved the Feel!
