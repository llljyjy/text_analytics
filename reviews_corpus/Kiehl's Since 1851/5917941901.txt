This has a thick consistency to it and it doesn’t take alot of product to get full face and neck coverage. I have dry, dehydrated skin that drinks up a good moisturizer and this one applied a tad tacky, but once it was rubbed in, it felt nice and made a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin.I love the blue glass jar it comes in and the cream itself appears to have a slight blue tint to it. No scent with this, which I was hoping for a faint scent since it has all the botanical blends in it. But for those who don’t enjoy scents in their skincare, no worries here.Overall, it’s a nice one, a little pricey for the amount of product & I do wish they’d incorporate the refill pods bc even though glass is recyclable, it takes a lot of energy to produce so I hope they change over at some point. I like the thickness of this but wished it was a little less creamy and had more of a gel like application. However, for truly dehydrated skin, this does the trick for me.  #gifted Cloud Cream
