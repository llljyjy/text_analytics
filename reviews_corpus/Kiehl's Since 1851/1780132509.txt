This product works really well by targeting very fine lines and overall skin improvement. I was very impressed that I could notice a difference in such a short amount of time. I started to see noticeable changes after about 16 days. I did not give it a full 5 star rating because there’s a bit of “work” involved before using the product. You will need to open two small bottles and combine/mix them. The bottles are designed for this, but I still spilled some of the precious serum. I wish I didn’t need to play chemist and it was just ready to go, especially given the purchase price. I do feel that the results were so good that I’d still recommend this to my friends and family. Fountain of youth?
