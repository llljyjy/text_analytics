Been using Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide for few weeks and I am happy with it so far. I liked that its light and not greasy. Fast absorbing and doesn’t cause any irritations. A little goes a long way and my eyes seem to look less tired than before but hoping to see better results in the next few weeks as I continue applying it. Good Product
