I like Kiehl’s products and I was very excited to try the Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Face Mask with 10.5% Squalane. The mask is of the thick consistency and I used my fingers to massage it into my skin. I didn’t need to use a lot of product and had a full coverage. The mask is not sticky so I don’t have any problems sleeping with it on me. My skin is well-hydrated and smooth after using it - exactly what I need in dry Arizona Great overnight mask
