I have been impressed with this serum so far. It’s gentle on my skin, no irritation like many retinol based products can cause, and I do notice a positive change in my skin softness and softening of fine lines. I don’t have any major wrinkles so I can’t speak in how well it works on deep wrinkles but for those that are starting their aging journey and starting to see the beginning stages of those fine lines and light wrinkles this is definitely worth the try. nan
