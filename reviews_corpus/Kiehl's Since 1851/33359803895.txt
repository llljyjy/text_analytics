I hate that I actually like this product, for such a high price you only get a small container of it so I try to only use it in the morning, I dont think i’ll be buying again because I wasnt expecting it to be so small. I dont think luxery moisturizer creams are worth it, after this is out i’ll continue using my huge tub of cerave moisturizer cream that I bought for $15. I have extremely dry skin and this feels super light. I recommend only if you dont mind paying the high price! Great Moisturizer Cream
