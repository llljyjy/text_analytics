I received the Kiehlâ€™s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide to try. It was thick, cooling, and not greasy, so you just needed to use a little to cover the eye area, and it worked great. Very refreshing and worked to help make the bags under my eyes a lot better looking. I will be looking to buy this again, and recommend it. Great!
