I was impressed with the first use of this product. It is so creamy, emollient and feels wonderful underneath my eye, around the corners, on my eye lid and clear up to my brow bone. My eye lids were always flaky and too sensitive to use other products. This instantly hydrates and brightened making fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable. I did not experience any redness, drying, sensitivity or discomfort. it is a bit pricey but the results are worth every penny. Amazing results
