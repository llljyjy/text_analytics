This cream surprised me. I wasn’t expecting it to out perform my favorite brand but it did! I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Especially if you have dry skin or live in a climate that gets cold. I have an oily t zone and this is the perfect winter night time moisturizer.  Give it a try if you haven’t! New winter go to!
