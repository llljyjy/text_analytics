love this product! i have pretty dry under eyes and have issues with concealers creasing on me. i take a small amount of the eye cream in the morning, rub it between my ring fingers, and apply under my eyes. it adds a healthy under eye glow and creates a hydrating base for concealer!! remember a little goes a long day so dont over do it with too much product under concealer:) glowy base for concealer
