As someone who is very fair skinned but also prone to dark circles, I was excited to try this product. I have very sensitive skin, and I was excited to discover that this product did not irritate my skin, and felt good being applied. After a few weeks, I noticed a significant difference in my under eye area. It was brighter, less red, and smoother. nan
