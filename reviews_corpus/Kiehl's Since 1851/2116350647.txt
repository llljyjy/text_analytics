I love the lightweight whipped texture of this cream that sinks right into the skin with a velvety feel and smooth matte finish, no shine or greasiness at all. This would be great for summer months ahead! It hydrates really well without being heavy or tacky. Also, this cream has a calming lavender scent. I wouldnâ€™t recommend it for sensitive skin though as it contains lavender oil. nan
