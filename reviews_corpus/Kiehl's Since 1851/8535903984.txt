I love this moisturizing cream!!! I have tried both Laneige Water Moisture Bank (this one is really great for my skin too) and Skinfix Barrier Triple Lipid Peptide Cream (this one is my least favorite, it felt a little heavy) but I will stick with Kiehls. It doesn’t leave any scent and it’s lightweight. I felt that being moisturized also lasted with Kiehls. Two thumbs up! Love this!
