Winter has arrived along with low humidity and cold temps which causes dry skin. This cream is your solution! It has a similar consistency to a makeup primer. It smooths and hydrates the skin quickly. It is so moisturizing that it can be used alone, but I prefer to use my favorite moisturizer first so that this product ensures that it stays on.
