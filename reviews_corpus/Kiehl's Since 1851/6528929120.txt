I’ve been using this eye serum consistently morning and evening for several weeks. I can definitely tell a difference in my dark circles. They are lighter. Serum glides on smoothly. Soaks in easily. Doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. This is the first time I’ve used an eye product and actually seen some lightening! Definitely recommend. One bottle lasts a while too. Will be purchasing more when I’m done with this one! Great eye serum!
