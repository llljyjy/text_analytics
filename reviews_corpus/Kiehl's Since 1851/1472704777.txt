I love sleep masks, but Iâ€™m often disappointed the next morning when I wake up. My face feels like I just put on an average moisturizer. However I am now obsessed with this product. I use it about three times a week, for the last several months, after my Retin-A. I wake up to buttery soft skin and my skin seems to love the equal and.  For me this mask is so worth the money!! obsessed!
