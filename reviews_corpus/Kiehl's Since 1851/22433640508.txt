I have been using Kiehlâ€™s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide for over two weeks, morning and evening, and it really works! It is easy to apply and safe for sensitive skin. The cream very fast absorbing and light, so it can be worn during the day under make up. Good value for the price too. The eye cream gave my eye area a much youthful appearance. I am impressed and will keep using this. nan
