I have been using this product since I received it in the mail and I have to say that I am really loving it! The winter has been bitter cold in New England so far and I am constantly battling dry skin, especially in my face. This product has been so helpful in keeping my face moisturized and protected. I love that it does not feel greasy and I especially love that is has no fragrance as I do not need any unnecessary chemicals on my face. I will continue to use this and would recommend it to friends and family. Thank you to BzzAgent for the option to try this item in exchange for an honest review. Definitely loving it!
