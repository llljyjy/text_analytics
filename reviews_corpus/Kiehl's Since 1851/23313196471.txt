I had friends that religiously swore by Kiehls while I was using Tatcha. I switched over and the results were phenomenal at a price I loved! I found it to hold well on my skin and protect it during the long walks in the cold through NYC! For the first winter of my life, my skin did not dry out even after long shifts! I am so thankful and I will definitely recommend this to anyone in the city! Simply soft perfect radiating skin! No breakouts! nan
