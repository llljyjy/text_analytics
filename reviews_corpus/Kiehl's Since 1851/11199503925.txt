So I have sensitive, dehydrated skin and this gets much much worse from late autumn to early spring. I used to use first-aid cream but this year I decided to go back to Kiehl’s and I just love it. It does a great job keeping my skin moisturized without any skin troubles.  I don’t get usual itchy and tingly skin even after a full day outside. Would highly recommend this to anybody especially during winter time. Love this
