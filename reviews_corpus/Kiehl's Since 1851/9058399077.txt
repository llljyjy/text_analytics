This is love at first sight. The moment I put this on my face, I knew I would love it. The cream has cloud-like, whipped cream texture that glides on smoothly and effortlessly on my face. It doesn’t leave my skin greasy or sticky at all, while keeping my skin hydrated overnight. I love pairing it with the Kiehl’s milk peel toner as the moisturizer has skin barrier friendly ingredients to maintain my skin barrier. With this combo, my skin feels so soft! A must have for summer
