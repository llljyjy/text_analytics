I normally don’t do reviews FOR ANYTHING. Not because I feel like my opinion isnt valuable or anything, but because I usually don’t feel strongly enough about a product/company to even WANT to share my opinion on it. THIS IS DIFFERENT. Kiehl’s IS DIFFERENT. This is not like any other retinol product I’ve tried before. Right off the bat, the packaging is great; sleek but simple and straightforward. The directions are precise and easy to understand. Now the product? It feels slightly cool, very light/lightweight, and incredibly silky. Imagine the texture of heavy cream; It’s liquid and runny but slightly thicker than milk or water. The texture of it and the feel of it on your skin is so delightful, I find it hard to put into words. The ONLY reason I took one star off is because I would like to see more results. That’s just me being EXTREMELY picky/hard on the product and looking for perfection. I will say though, since I started using it LOTS of people have made compliments on how my skin is looking, so perhaps I am not just too critical of the product but of myself as well. Bottom line? GO GET THIS PRODUCT. It is yet another winner from Kiehl’s. Kiehl's For the Win!
