I’ve tried this and the vitamin C eye cream, and this was far better. I’m not a fan of eye creams, but this was nice. I didn’t experience any eye irritation, it went on smooth, absorbed quickly, and didn’t cause my tinted sunscreen to pill or act weird. I didn’t notice any visible changes, but it felt nice. Felt great
