This cloud cream has a nice lightweight whipped texture. But when I put it on it takes a while to sink in. My skin feels like it has moisturizer on it but I haven’t really noticed it more plump or hydrated. The smell is a bit too strong for me. I usually enjoy using kiehls products but I’m not impressed with this one. nan
