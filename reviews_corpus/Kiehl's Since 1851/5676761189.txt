I have been loving this cream/mask from the moment I started using it. I use it 3 times a week and my skin has been supple, smooth, and very hydrated. It does not leave my face oily at all and it does not cause any breakouts. The texture is more of a cream, it is not sticky or oily. The smell is a bit annoying at the beginning but it quickly goes away. This mask leaves my face hydrated for the whole day. My skin has been sooo good after using this. I love it and highly recommend it. nan
