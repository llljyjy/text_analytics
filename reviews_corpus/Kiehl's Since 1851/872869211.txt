I wanted to love this.I buy rather expensive eye cream but I am always on the lookout for a cheaper option.I am 55+ years old, and this product was just not moisturizing enough for my aging skin.I can’t say I wouldn’t recommend it because I suspect it’s just more suited for someone with younger skin. nan
