I used the Kiehlâ€™s Fast Release Retinol Serum every other night for a few weeks. While the large lines across my forehead have not shown much difference because they are deep and genetic, I have seen a difference on a blemish spot on my cheek. It is still slightly red, but this product has smoothed out the texture which another retinol product that I have used for years has not done for any spots. This product leaves my skin feeling smooth in the morning. I do notice that if I use this along with other products my skin seems tighter in the morning, but it is nothing a little moisturizer cannot relieve. I would recommend others to try this product. (The product was received in exchange for an honest review.) nan
