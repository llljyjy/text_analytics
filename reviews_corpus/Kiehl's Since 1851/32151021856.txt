I started applying this product because one of the Sephora advisor adviced me .. I have melisma on my skin so she recommended me . After applying for 2 weeks I feel like I got more melisma and my skin becomes more darker . I brought a big bottle with spending I think 145 dollar but I don’t know how to return it . Please don’t buy this product if you have melisma . I would give 0 rating but that option is not available . nan
