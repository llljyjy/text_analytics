I was looking for a hydrating, simple formula to use over retinol and this really delivered. I love it so much that it replaced my morning cream too! Lightweight but super hydrating, pairs well with my favorite actives, and layers nicely under makeup. I also appreciate that it is (relatively) affordable considering the fact that I go through it pretty quickly. Best Hydrating, No-Fuss Cream
