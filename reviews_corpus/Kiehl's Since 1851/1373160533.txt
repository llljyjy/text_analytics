I like this new serum from Kiehl’s a lot! It comes with a capsule of retinol powder that you mix into the silky serum so you know that your bottle is freshly mixed and effective. It’s a little more potent than the previous Kiehls retinol serum - maybe start with that one if you’ve not used retinol before and then graduate to this one. I’ve used lots of retinol products and I found this to be comfortable to use, it didn’t leave my face red or irritated. After a month’s use, my skin looks smooth, firmer, and has an even glow. It’s great! Freshly mixed for efficiency!
