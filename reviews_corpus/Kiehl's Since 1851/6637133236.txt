The proof is in the pudding, or the name in this case! This cleanser definitely gives me a deep cleaning. The scent is is a fresh citrus scent that does not linger for too long and smells great while washing my face. A little goes a long way. This usually lasts me about six months with daily use. Definitely recommend. Great for my Oily Skin!
