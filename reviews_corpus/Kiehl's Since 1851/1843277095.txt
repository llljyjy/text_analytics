I really enjoyed using this facial cream because I found it to be very moisturizing but also very lightweight. I’m used to using heavier creams that take forever to dry. This product is perfect if you’re wanting great hydration without being or feeling greasy. It dries quickly and makes your skin look wonderful. I really liked that it didn’t upset my skin and provided enough moisturization for my extremely dry skin. I also liked that it didn’t have much of a scent at all as heavy scents can bother my skin. Overall, I would definitely buy this cream in the future and recommend it to friends and family that have dry skin like myself and are in need of some extra hydration. Great Lightweight & Hydrating Facial Cream
