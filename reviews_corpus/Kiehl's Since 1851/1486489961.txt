Thank you to Influenster and Kiehl’s for the compliment products to test and give my honest opinion! This product was so much fun to get and set up! I loved the process of mixing the ingredients and activating them! The formula is very easy to use! I take a pea sized amount on my fingertip. I then dot some on my forehead, cheeks, chin, and neck. As with most retinols, a little goes a long way! I haven’t had any adverse reactions with my trial. That being said, it’s really too soon for me to tell you about my results overall. Gentle
