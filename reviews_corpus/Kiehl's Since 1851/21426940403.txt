The Kiehlâ€™s Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream is really nice on my dry skin. It is a thick and luxurious cream that makes my skin look and feel more healthy. I ive in the desert and it really causes me to struggle with hydration in my skin. I use the Barrier Cream at bedtime after my regular moisturizer in the cooler months and as my moisturizer during the warmer months. Nice Barrier Cream
