I have been using the new  Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide for a week now. I have to stress just how amazed I am by the results I’m experiencing, and how fast I began to notice them. I’ve tried many products over the years in my skin care routine, but  Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide is hands down the most effective cream I’ve ever used, and the best part is it’s made by a company I already love & trust.
