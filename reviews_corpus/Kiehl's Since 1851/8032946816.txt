I received this product in exchange for a review. I wouldn’t say it’s a miracle product but it’s definitely different and slightly better than most overnight moisturizing masks that I’ve used. It sits on the face much more pleasantly. It’s slightly greasy but in a way where I don’t feel like stray hairs are getting stuck to my face, or feeling any discomfort. It doesn’t dry, get cakey or crack. There’s not a strong scent, if any, and you don’t have to use too much to coat your whole face. As far as moisturizing goes, I tried this for a week straight and there was an improvement in myskin overall, but again it seems just a bit better than some other products I’ve used before too. It’s not a miracle product but I could see many people being happy with this. I would buy it again. Above average moisturizing mask
