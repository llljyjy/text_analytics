Amazing for dry skin in winter! I was already a fan of Kiehl’s for moisturizing and I use the ultra facial cream as my daily moisturizer.  I had been using the Laneige sleeping mask, but it just wasn’t up to the task of dealing with my even dry over since it’s winter in Wisconsin skin. Enter this little jar of miracles. No more scaly skin when I wake up or little bits flaking off throughout the day. Wind chapped cheeks are no match for this as it sooths and smooths. The texture is a bit odd at first reminding me of putty in consistency and smell. Once I had it in my hands it quickly began to soften and it melted into my skin as I applied it. I love that it doesn’t have the tacky residue or an overpowering scent that seem to be a requirement for too many overnight/sleeping masks. If you aren’t used to using a truly fragrance-free product this could be a little off putting at first. This definitely isn’t something where they are using a naturally fragrant ingredient and calling it fragrance-free since it doesn’t have a chemical “fragrance” added. This is truly fragrance-free so there is nothing scenting the product in any way. I can see why that could be an issue if you want your products to smell good; however, if like me, you are super sensitive to smells (I couldn’t last an hour in the Fresh rose sleeping mask because it was just too overpowering) than this just may be the mask for you. must have for winter
