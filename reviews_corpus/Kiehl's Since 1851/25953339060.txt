After using this eye serum for close to two months I can say I am thoroughly impressed. I’ve used multitudes of many other eye creams and serums and have never had the level of positive effects I’ve received from using this serum. There are a few benefits that I noticed after a week or so of use: a slightly brighter and more radiant under eye. But it was the effects I noticed after about two months that sealed the deal. It was almost shocking when I looked in the mirror one day and realized how much my eyes had changed. They went from some crows feet, some fine lines, and dark circles to almost all of my fine lines had diminished and my eyes looked whiter and brighter all around. My eyes looked similar to how they did when I was in college! It was shocking and a really amazing result, but it didn’t happen overnight. This is the kind of product that you need to have patience with and be consistent with for it to work appropriately. I wouldn’t expect overnight results. But if you have the patience you will be very happy with the result. This has become my holy grail and I will be repurchasing it time and again when it runs out. Holy grail status
