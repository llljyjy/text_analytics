First things first as i opened the seal to the cream i noticed the cream is packed all the way to the top of the tub now that was so satisfying.... i applied the cream after cleansing  and im in love!!!! The cream is so soft and smooth my skin absorbed it very well my skin feels so supple the cream has no scent but it somehow still smells fresh and clean if that makes any sense its soo good i wanna use it all over my body im gonna use this one up and once its done im buying some for sure. Im in love!
