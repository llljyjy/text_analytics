I live in Michigan and my skin tends to get extremely dry in the winter to the point where I canâ€™t even wear foundation because it looks so awful with my peeling skin. After just a few days of putting this on in the morning and at night my skin is no longer peeling and I am able to wear makeup again. If I continue to see these results I will definitely be repurchasing! nan
