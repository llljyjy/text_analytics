I have been using this product now for about 2 weeks and in such short amount of time, I am already seeing results. I was a little puzzled at first when I read the instructions and saw that I had to mix the powder, and got overwhelmed, but to my surprise, the process was fun. I have been using this serum once a day, 3-4 times a week and can already see my face refreshed and rested and my small wrinkles appear to be ironed and flat. The best part is that it didnâ€™t have any burning sensation and no smell. I will definitely keep using this serum as soon as I finish this bottle This works!!
