So far so good! I recently tried the super multi corrective anti-aging eye cream and although the size that I received was a little small, I did see a little bit of a transformation around the small crows feet rearing their ugly heads. I didn’t see a huge change in the amount of time in which I used the sample, but it was enough to prompt me to want to buy the product to try it for a longer period of time. I like the consistency of the product, I like that there really isn’t a smell so there’s nothing overwhelming about it. I didn’t find that it made my eyes burn or anything like that. I would recommend it if you have concerns with wrinkles around your eyes, dark circles or other common aging issues that crop up. Try it!
