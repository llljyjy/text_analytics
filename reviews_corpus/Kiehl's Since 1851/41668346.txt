This retinol serum was very fast-acting due to its potency. I followed directions and limited use due to my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way so I’d be mindful of application if you’re not used to using retinol. I saw results within 2 weeks of using consistently, mostly in my skin’s texture and tone. Great formula! fast results!
