I have been using Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution for about 2 months now and yes, I do see a difference.  Really happy about the result.  I have just one dark spot on my nose from being in the sun without sunscreen on -I will never do that again.  The spot has been on my nose for 2 years now, it bugged the crap out of me as I see it every time I look in the mirror.  You just could not miss this one spot on my nose.  This product did lighten this dark spot.  Firstly, it turned a little red, and then it suddenly became less visible.  I used it every morning and night.  I would dab any extra on my finger onto my acne and red cheeks, and it worked there too!  Less red and acne scars less visible.  This stuff is definitely worth the purchase.  I am impressed.  It is quite expensive, but you really don’t need to use a whole lot to get the results.  I used just one drop, as I only put it on that one spot on my nose. It has good viscosity and dries within a reasonable time.  I would like to try it on the back of my hands as yup, did not wear sunscreen on my hands neither and now there are plenty dark spots.  Will update once I experiment with my hands. Does work!
