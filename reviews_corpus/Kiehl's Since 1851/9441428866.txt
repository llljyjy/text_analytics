I have had oily skin my whole life but lately I’ve been noticing more and more dry patches all over my face. I was hesitant to try a heavy cream for fear of looking like a human oil slick, but I have been using this cream for a month now and it has truly changed my skin. It doesn’t make me oily. It hydrates the dry patches so that my foundation doesn’t flake off. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I absolutely LOVE this stuff. This is officially my new winter holy-grail moisturizer! nan
