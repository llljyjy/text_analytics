I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent and Kiehl’s in exchange for my honest review. I’m very disappointed with this cream! The texture is rich, and it isn’t completely absorbed by the skin. It felt heavy and greasy. Also, it has a strong scent that I can’t stand. Unfortunately, I won’t continue to use this product and would not recommend it. Disappointed
