3 words: This Is It. Iâ€™m skeptical of a lot of skincare products, was skeptical about this being worth the price. and honestly, I love some Kiehlâ€™s products but dislike others. But the pictures and reviews were good. After using this product for about 9 months I can 100% vouch that it has both long term and immediate effects of using it. I notice skin turnover, softer and more moisturized skin and just overall less imperfections. Iâ€™m turning 30 and have gotten very slight fine lines on my forehead that you can only see really close up ðŸ˜‚ this product fills them in and makes my skin healthier looking the very next day. i have noticed when I get lazy about my skin care and my skin quality deteriorates, it starts improving noticeably after just one night with this. My girlfriend, who is also skeptical of skincare claims and costs, tried this and fell in love as well. She is very frugal but agrees it is worth the cost. And for the value, you need to know that I have been using this about 3 times a week and my girlfriend using once every week or two and it has lasted over 6 months. worth it and more.ALSO highly recommend for the fact that it also has ceramides and peptides, compared to other retinol products that are just retinol based. This offers multiple factors that promote skin health. I would 100% recommend this to everyone, yell it from the rooftops, this is a game changer and probably best regular use skincare product I have ever gotten worth the price and more
