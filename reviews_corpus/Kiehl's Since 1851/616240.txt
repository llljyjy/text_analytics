Nice lightweight and moisturizing eye cream that helped make my eye area look brighter and smoothed out crepe-iness underneath.  I don’t have a lot of problems with dark circles, but I do think this helped me look more awake - like I had a full 8 hours of sleep.  I have another eye cream that is a holy grail item for me which is why I could only give this four stars, but if I didn’t have that for comparison, I would be very happy with this cream as a first choice.  I really liked the texture and that it didn’t feel heavy or greasy, or irritate my eyes. Feels light but gives powerful results
