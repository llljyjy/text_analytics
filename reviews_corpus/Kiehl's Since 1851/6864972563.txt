I received this as a sample and, although I liked it, am glad I didn’t shell out $55 for it. It is a nice formula, not too greasy... Absorbs well & quickly for when I’m in a rush to get my make-up on. I’m not sure I saw any reduction in fine lines or dark circles. There isn’t anything I disliked about the product... Just didn’t see any benefits worth the $55 price tag... At least not yet! Not sure it's worth the price
