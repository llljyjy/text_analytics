I have really seen a difference in how soft and moisturized my skin is after using this.  I’ve tried other toners and they always made my skin feel parched or irritated. Now, if I skip using this toner each day, I notice my skin is itchy and dull.  I’m on my 2nd bottle....the bottles last a LONG time, too! Makes my skin happy
