I’ve been testing out this serum for about 6 weeks. I started by using it only every 4 days to help my face adjust to using retinol. So far my results have been very promising! While I can’t say that I’ve seen a huge reduction in wrinkles yet, I can say that my skin feels smoother and more firm and plump feeling. I haven’t experienced any redness or peeling even when increasing my usage to every other night. I will be continuing to use this serum. I also love that you get to mix this serum yourself, so you know exactly how fresh it is. It’s a great idea and the directions were easy to follow. Great night serum!
