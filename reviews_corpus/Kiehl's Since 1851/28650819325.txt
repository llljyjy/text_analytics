i’ve developed super dry and sensitive skin after using adapelene gel for almost two years (great for acne, not for hydrated skin), and this is the only moisturizer i’ve tried that hasn’t burned my skin and really hydrates my skin. great texture and no scent. i use this mainly at night and it has prevented waking up with flaky, peeling skin. great for dry/sensitive skin while using retinoid
