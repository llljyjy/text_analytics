This Serum really intrigued me! It’s the first time I’ve ever used a product where you mix the product yourself and I think it’s a fun and unique concept but more so, I love that you know its mixed fresh when you use it.I’ve been using this at night over the course of about 2 weeks but I haven’t worked up to nightly yet. I’m giving my skin time to properly acclimate to a new product. I am happy to say I’ve noticed a improvement in my skin texture over all and a decrease in fine lines around my mouth/lip area! Overall I’m very happy with this serum and would recommend it! Be sure to use a sunscreen during the day while using this product. nan
