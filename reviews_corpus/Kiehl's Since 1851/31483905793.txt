I tried the eye cream for a little over a week.  Maybe I’m still too young for this one.  I don’t know...  I’m 35.  Or maybe I’m at the right age to start worrying about the aging process but I didn’t see a great difference.  The cream however is very smooth and goes on perfectly.  It’s very silly but may be a little too much for the hot summer days here in Texas.  I would recommend for the cold days or at night though!  I’ve never tried Kiehl’s products before so it was definitely great trying their products for the first time.  I got this as a sample and I was happy with the product itself.  Definitely looking forward to trying more of the Kiehl’s products! It Was A Little More Than Okay
