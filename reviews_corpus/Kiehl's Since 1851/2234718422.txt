While this makes certainly delivers on hydration, the texture is just so bizarre. I have dry skin so I am used to thick buttery creams or nourishing oils. This mask is more like grease. When I wake up, there’s still a layer on my skin so I’m not sure if it actually sunk in or was just more of a occlusive barrier. Overall it does work and so little is needed, one jar would last a year! this is a strange product
