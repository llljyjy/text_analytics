My skin absolutely loves this product. It soaks in and moisturizes without feeling greasy. It does have an oil compound to it so I was pleasantly surprised that it soaks in so well. The fragrance is divine. Spicy and exotic, like I expect a Moroccan bazaar to smell. I will forever have this as part of my skincare routine. I use it after a hyaluronic toner and right before my heavier moisturizer. LOVE My skin is in love
