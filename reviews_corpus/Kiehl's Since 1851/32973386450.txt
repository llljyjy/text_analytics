An anti-aging eye cream that is clinically shown to visibly lift, smooth, de-puff and brighten the eye area to correct visible signs of aging around the brow bone, eyelid, crow’s feet and under-eye. Paraben-free and fragrance-free. I’ve been using this eye cream for a week mornings and evenings. The gel texture of this cream helps it to go very smooth around the eye area and absorbs quick. Its anti-aging ingredients, collagen, peptide and niacinamide are great to improve fine lines, dark circle and under eye bags. Considering the small size, it’s a bit pricey but definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a nice and effective eye cream. Nice ingredients
