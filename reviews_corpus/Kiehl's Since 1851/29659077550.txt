The Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream by Kiehls is another excellent product in their range. The hot Florida sunny weather made my skin irritated and itchy starting a couple of months ago, and I’ve been trying hard to get it under control. After one application of this cream, my skin was soothed and drastically calmed down. I’m no longer annoyed with the itchy and uncomfortable skin the sun brings. It is a very balmy but lightweight cream,  soaks in fast and does not leave you feeling oily. perfect for daytime use. Try it over another moisturizer overnight for that extra hydration. A great cream - I will repurchase it. Must have product
