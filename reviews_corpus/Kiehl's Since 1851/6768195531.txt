I REALLY wanted to like this product but it just doesn’t not work well for my skin. The ingredients sound marvelous though. I find that this was not moisturizing enough, much too light. I have a pre-existing health condition that causes my skin to dry out sometimes and unfortunately this cream was no match for my occasional dry skin, which is a shame because Kiehl’s makes great products. If you’re curious about this product, see if you can get a trial size first before committing to a full size. I wanted to love it but....
