I have used this product religiously for 2 months and I can see my dark spots have lightened. They are not completely gone but are definitely less visible. I love the texture of this product, it very lightweight and doesn’t feel sticky or oily on face. It has vitamin C which brightens the skin. Overall it’s a great product. Reduces dark spots
