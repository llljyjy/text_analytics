I honestly thought I wouldn’t love ANOTHER product designated for night time, boy I was wrong. A little bit goes a long way with this one as it’s super rich in it’s creaminess. It’s kinda similar to their Ginger/Hibiscus Night Mask but easier to blend in + it has the aroma of lavender to help induce a calmer state of mind before sleeping. I always look so refreshed in the morning when I use this.PS. It pairs nicely with the Midnight Recover Concentrate! So RICH & dreamy!
