Kiehls’ Fast Release Retinol is a revolutionary product. I’ve had other retinol products where the product eventually changes color very quickly. This usually means that the active ingredient (retinol) is no longer as effective as before (or is just downright no longer effective). This is why I was so excited to see Kiehl’s new product that allows you to unlock the active ingredient right before you actually start using it instead of letting the active ingredient break down in the bottle even though you have not yet started using the product. Besides this creative preservation of the retinol, I also love the product because it is effective. After using this product for a while now, my skin is smoother, my dark spots and scars have lightened a little, and my fine lines are less visible. Of course, I wasn’t expecting this product to make my skin perfect, but I am so glad that it has improved my skin! Also, the bottle itself is fantastic because it allows you to easily control the amount of product you want to dispense. This is such an excellent product, and I highly encourage you to try it, especially if you are looking for a good, effective retinol product. Amazing Retinol Product!
