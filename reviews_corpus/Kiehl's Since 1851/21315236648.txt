If you want hydration without leaving your skin feeling oily, this Midnight recovery Omega rich Botanical Night Cream is for you. It has a smooth texture and absorbs quickly. I also love that the formula is green, and the packaging is made from post-consumer materials. I apply the cream at night, and it deeply moisturize my face cream while I sleep as it contains Omega 3 & fatty acids which visibly renews the appearance of the skin when you wake up. I have used other overnight cream before, and nothing beat this one which is so relaxing with the lavender scent it has and make you feel like sleeping on the cloud. I highly recommend this product; it is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way and you will see the result within a week of use. Perfect Nighttime hydrator
