There are a few Kiehls beauty products I admire but this Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution is NOT ONE OF THEM! I was so excited to see a change in my brownish band across my forehead atleast lighten some what but even after a FULL MONTH I saw NO CHANGE at all! The only attributes this product has going for it right now is the feeling of it, it glides over your skin and melts into it with no stickiness. It also has a very pleasant scent that’s light and flowery, but without it’s main goal being met these two things are kind of pointless. Still the Same
