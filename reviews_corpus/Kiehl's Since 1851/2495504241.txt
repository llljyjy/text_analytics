I adore this product as a face sunscreen for day to day use - it’s lightweight, sits well under makeup, doesn’t streak, and since it is so thin it’s easy to apply. However, Kiehl’s recently changed the design of the lid and my favourite product has become a nightmare! It leaks excessively all the time, wasting a great deal of product - especially when travelling, and during transport it will seep out and soak your makeup bag and other products. Please bring back the previous lid, Kiehl’s! Great product, leaky package
