I wasn’t too sure about the consistency when I opened the bottle, but don’t let it fool you! This stuff is super light weight and very hydrating. I was fortunate enough to receive this as soon as it started getting very cold out/snowing. This cream helped keep my skin from chapping, and healed what had already chapped overnight! Super hydrating!
