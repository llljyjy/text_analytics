This cream has done wonders for my dark circles under my eyes however I have recently come into some allergy issues so I had to stop using it hopefully when I start using it again it will do the wonders that did before that it did the first time lighten up the dark circles under my eyes. I wasn’t necessarily looking for it’s a remove wrinkles or anything because I don’t really have any or that many wrinkles I don’t think I really have any wrinkles so I was looking for this product more for the removing the dark circles under my eyes and now that I been dealing with the allergy issues for the last month I’m hoping that these dark circles that have been around my eyes now just go away for the most part.
