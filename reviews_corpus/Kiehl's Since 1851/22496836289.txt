I was a bit skeptical about this lotion because it is very thick.  It seemed more like a hand cream.  But, after warming it in your hands and putting it on your face it absorbed nicely without being heavy or feeling like your skin is just plastered.  I live where it gets to -40 in the winter and chapped cheeks and very dry skin is a constant.  Most moisturizers actually sting when your cheeks are that chapped.  This one was soothing and instantly healing.  I also used it on my 6 year old and again, instant relief. Instant Relief
