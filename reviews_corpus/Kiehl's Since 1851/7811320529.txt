After giving this some time of trying, I can say I have noticed a slight difference in the overall color of my under eye. I  can’t really say it has kept up with my usual eye cream, but the texture itself is very light. I would recommend if you’re looking yo have more hydration for under your eyes, but doesn’t do much for the dark circles. nan
