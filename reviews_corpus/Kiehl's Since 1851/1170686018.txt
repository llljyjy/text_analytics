I really like this retinol!  I would compare it to the high end retinol’s I’ve purchased in Med Spas.  I noticed improvement in my skin tone and texture within a week or so of using.  I also really like that you mix the product when you get it.  It makes me feel like it is fresh for me.  A little bit goes a long way, so this will last me quite a while. nan
