I tried the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream. It claims to be a daily balm to cream formula to relieve and intensively repair skin’s moisture barrier. It contains key ingredients of colloidal oatmeal and Beta-Glucan. This product is great for dry skin prone to distress and discomfort. First off, I have used several barrier creams in my skincare routine, and I’m highly impressed by Kiehl’s formula. It is definitely a balm to cream product. It comes out of the tube in a thick balm feel, but when it goes to the skin it becomes this luxurious cream. I had no reaction from this product. It retained the skins moisture, and it created a healthier skin barrier. It didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. The results to my skin were hydrated, healthy, smooth, nourished, and relieved. I have a tendency to get drier skin in the winter, and I have to really overwork to maintain a healthy and hydrated skin barrier. This barrier cream from Kiehl’s does an exceptional job keeping my skin healthy, hydrated, and free from that greasy feel. I would recommend this product to anyone with a tendency to get skin on the dry or sensitive side. I’ve used this on my face in my nightly routine, and I can absolutely tell a difference in my skin when I don’t use it. My hands are currently starting to show signs from the winter, and I’m going to try and heal that with this product. The great thing about this barrier cream is it’s great to use anywhere you experience dry or sensitive skin that needs a barrier repair. I love that it contains healthy ingredients for the skin like Colloidal Oatmeal, the formula works as stated, repairs and improves barrier health, and it doesn’t leave the skin greasy, only hydrated I have no cons for this product. I would definitely buy this again, and I highly recommend it! Barrier cream healthy hydrated skin repair
