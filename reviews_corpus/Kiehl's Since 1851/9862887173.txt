This is a great lightweight moisturizer and it really lasts 24 hours. My skin changed since the first time I tried it on. I have a combination of dry and oily skin, and it is also sensitive, but this product works for me much better than other brands. It makes my skin very smooth and with a nice texture. I will definitely continue using this product and I recommend it to friends and family. Awesome product!
