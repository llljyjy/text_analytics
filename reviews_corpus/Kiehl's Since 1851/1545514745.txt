This was quite lovely! I was certainly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Like others, it was thick and hydrating without feeling too greasy and oily. I do tend to prefer a more gel-based consistency than what I consider more white, opaque, and lotiony types, but this was still nice with its cloud-like consistency. Iâ€™m still quite devoted to my regular moisturizer but like having this as an occasional night time option. The smell is lovely and calming as well. I would definitely recommend this to other, and already have sold my mom on it as well. Still an overall great product by Kiehls, particularly for sensitive types. Lovely!
