I was sent Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream for free in return for this review. The cream has a very strong lavender smell. The lavender does smell more on the medicinal side rather than synthetic which does make it more enjoyable. The cream applies like a cloud. It has a very slight mousse texture. Once on the skin it appears to fade the appearance of my pores. It didn’t feel greasy or overwhelming. I typically applied this after my usual nighttime cleansing routine and found that the next day my skin did look hydrated and brighter. I only removed stars from this review because my skin is very sensitive and sometimes moisturizers tend to irritate it. I did break out minimally but this is honestly a usual occurrence when I introduce moisturizers into my routine. Anyone that does not suffer from sensitivity or acne will probably enjoy this.
