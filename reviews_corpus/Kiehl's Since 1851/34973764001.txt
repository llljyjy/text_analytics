I am 72 yrs.-old and my facial skin has been changing the last few years. I wanted to try a moisturizer than what I had been using. After getting purchasing mini size of this product I liked it and wanted to give it more time to see how my skin would benefit, so I bought this 1.7 oz. jar. While I don’t think it’s making a marked difference in my skin, it is still a good lighter weight moisturizer. I put this on immediately after washing my face when my skin is still very damp, but  I think applying some other product to the area between my eyebrows and forehead before using this is the only thing that’s going to help with those deeper creases. I like the fact it is fragrance free, isn’t loaded with parabens and glycols, and has only 2 alcohols listed. Ultra Facial Moisturizing Cream with Squalane
