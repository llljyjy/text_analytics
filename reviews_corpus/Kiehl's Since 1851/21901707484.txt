I love this facial cream! Its super creamy and lightweight and feels great on my face. It doesnt feel greasy or heavy and once I put it on it immediately absorbs into skin making it feel renewed and hydrated. I love it. Within 2 days of use i could tell the difference; my face had its natural moisture restored and wasnt dry and dull anymore- it was moisturized and bright again! Awesome!
