I personally have never use any types of product targeting dark spots. Over the twelve weeks trial period including this product in my daily morning and night routine  I didn’t see much of an effect on my skin until within a few weeks. The consistency is just right and the application is nice and smooth with a cooling sensation. I would say the benefit of owning this product is about a 50-50 chance of working of hyperpigmentation, acne scars, and dark spots being visibly reduced. I would recommend purchasing the smaller bottle to test run however personally this product isn’t for me. nan
