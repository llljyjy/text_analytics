I absolutely love this overnight mask. By far one of the best products I have purchased at Sephora. My skin is quite dry especially in the winter months but using this makes my skin so super soft and healthy looking. You can tell by the consistency of the mask how hydrating it will be. And a little goes a long way! nan
