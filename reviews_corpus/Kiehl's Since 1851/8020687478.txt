I’ve been using this product daily for about 2-3 weeks now and definitely feel like my skin looks more radiant and refreshed. However, my one complaint for this product is the smell. To me, it smells like vomit to be completely honest. I’m trying to get over it because the product is working so well, but if you are sensitive to smells this may not be the product for you. works great, smells terrible
