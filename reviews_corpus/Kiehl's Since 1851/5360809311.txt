okay so i got a small version of this with my Sephora points I guess you can say travel size. I literally noticed a difference after the second use. It really works. I get small sun brown spots on my forehead in the summer and they were practically gone after the second use. I use it only once a week now. Would highly recommend this! Anyone else notice a difference by the second day?
