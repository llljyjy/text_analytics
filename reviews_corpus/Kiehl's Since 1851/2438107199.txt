First off this retinol treatment truly stands apart from any other I’ve ever tried and it’s because of the creativity & innovative design and concept that totally works and is very easy to use. It is fresh and that alone makes a huge difference. You use a pea size amount once per day so it lasts a while. There isn’t a defining scent that is irritating or lingers and I like that it’s a neutral scent. I have been using for a week now and I’m definitely able to tell a difference in my skin.  I’m so glad I tried this! This will remain a must have in my skincare collection Very Unique!
