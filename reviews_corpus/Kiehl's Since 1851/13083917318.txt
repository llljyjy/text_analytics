Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum It is a wonderful product, why do I say this?  easy: in the first three days I began to see how my face began to peel lightly and delicately but without drying it out, (I used it only at night, in the morning I used a moisturizer).  Now my face looks bright, moisturized and  smoother.  I noticed a small difference in the reduction of lines but a big difference on other aspects. Is a product better than other brand. I recommend and definitely I’ll buy it. Very satisfied
