This is a nice retinol at the price point, nice packaging with a bit of fun mixing the the product on your own, but be careful when doing so! Serum feels light and non sticky feeling with a lovely light scent. I’ve used for a few weeks and noting a bit firmer all over and brightened skin. Slight peeling on forehead area and nose but that’s expected for me from a product like this! It has improved fine lines and larger looking pores all over so will continue to use this one! Surprised by this formula!
