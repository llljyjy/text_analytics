This eye serum did a great job with reducing my dark circles and making my eyes brighter. The product is more of a cream than a serum, which I liked. A little goes a long way. I liked how my under eyes felt moisturized and not puffy. I used this product morning and night and felt it was a product I could easily add to my skincare routine. nan
