The scent is awful.  PTR changed their Vitamin C formula so I was looking for something else.  This got great reviews and I like the product but cannot deal with the smell.  It goes on smelling like motor oil and fades to a very strong self tan smell that doesnâ€™t go away.  It overpowers my makeup scent, perfume, and lingers on my skin all night.  I wake up to self tan smell.  It is too much.  Almost ready to throw it away.  Made it through half the large bottle so far.  Too bad since it seems to do the job but the scent is a dealbreaker Scent is overbearing and lingers
