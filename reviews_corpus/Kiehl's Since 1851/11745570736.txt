I haven’t used too many eye serums so I was a bit skeptical as I haven’t had great results in the past. After only a week of using this product I noticed many changes around my eye res.  There was a noticeable difference with the reduction of some fine wrinkles (crows feet) that I had.  There was also a very pleasant lift around my brow bone (my eyes are a bit sunken so the results are quite dramatic).  All in all I will definitely be adding this product to my rotation and recommend it to anyone who needs a boost around their eyes! Hydrated again!
