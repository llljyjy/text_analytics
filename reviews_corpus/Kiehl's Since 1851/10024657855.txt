I know the point of this cream is to hydrate and provide a moisture barrier, but I really don’t like how thick this cream is. It works just fine, but I just can’t bring myself to continue to use it. I was worried that it would block my pores and cause me to break out; it hasn’t, but I still can’t get used to the heavy feeling of product on my face. TOO Much of a Barrier
