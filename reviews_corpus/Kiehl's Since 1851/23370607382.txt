I have been using Kiehl’s corrective dark spot solution for over a month now, and I have noticed visible changes to my skin since using this solution. I’ve always has some hyper pigmentation issues, and my skin can appear blotchy at times, well this solution has minimized some of these issues. My face is brighter, and looks more refreshed, I am pretty amazed about how well this product really works. This solution lasted a long time, and I still have a half of a bottle left. I like the consistency, and how light this solution feels on my face , the formula is a watery gel- like substance and a little goes a long way. I will definatelly be telling my friends and family about this! amazing
