I prefer lighter moisturizers during the day, especially for the hot summer months, but my dry skin craves more dense and mask like moisturizers at the end of the day. I love the thick, whipped, mousse like texture of this cream. Even though it is thicker than some of my other nighttime moisturizers, it does not feel heavy on the skin. When first applied it feels refreshing and cooling which was a nice surprise. Omega-Rich Cloud Cream absorbs nicely and forms a protective but not greasy layer on top of my skin which helps to lock in moisture. Whenever I use the cream as part of my nighttime routine, I am greeted by smooth and hydrated skin in the morning. I can even skip my day time moisturizer!This cream does have a very light herbal, lavender scent but you almost have to stick your nose into the jar to smell it. nan
