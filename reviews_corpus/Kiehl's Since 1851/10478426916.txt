I did receive this product for review. The first time I used this, I noticed the scent. Itâ€™s lightly scented of lavender. It felt nice going onto skin and dried down nicely. It took care of a spot that has taunted me for YEARS!!! Seriously...it is truly amazing! While I do think this is a little pricey, I would recommend it, especially if you have some of those old acne scars that have refused to leave lol Worked miracles
