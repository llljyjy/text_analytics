No wonder Kiehl’s has so many great reviews. This cream is very moisturizing and works well for my semi sensitive/combo skin. It isn’t heavy, it’s very lightweight and my skin absorbs it in the best way! I’ve used it in the summer and in the winter. I will continue to order as long as they make it. face cream staple
