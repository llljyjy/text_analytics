I really like this toner… as the name mentions it is gentle. Maybe a little too gentle for me.  I wasn’t sure I was getting a good exfoliation. But this is perfect for someone with sensitive skin. I like that this didn’t break me out and that it was soothing. I’ve been using for about 2.5 months consistently and I have a little less than a quarter of the bottle left. I would continue to use and purchase again. I may look for something a tad stronger for the evening. A little goes a long way
