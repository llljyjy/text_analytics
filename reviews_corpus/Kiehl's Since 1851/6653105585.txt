I used this day and night and loved how hydrating it is. It didn’t necessarily remove fine lines but did hydrate them so well, that it plumps them and they seemed smaller. I have dark under eye circles from thin skin so the purple blues didn’t really fade. It only pilled under one of my daytime products so it’s not great under all of them. It spreads like butter though! It’s so smooth and creamy. You need very little to apply. This will last many months! Creamy hydrating
