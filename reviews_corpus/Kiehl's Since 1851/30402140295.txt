From the start I loved this retinol, mixing the dry powder to the serum ensured you have the freshest product and as an added bonus you are able to use up every last drop because the bottom of the bottle unscrews. I started out using the serum a couple times per week and after experiencing no side effects I increased to daily use and still this was gentle on my skin with no adverse effects. Retinol takes time and after around 6 weeks I did notice some of the fine lines around my eyes were diminished, I have yet to notice anything on my forehead but I am definitely hopeful it will help. nan
