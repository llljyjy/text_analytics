I love to use Kiehl’s products and the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is no exception. Their skincare works for my facial skin which is a mix of normal, oily T zone at times, and dry patches..sometimes with adult acne and sensitive at all times.. so basically totally moody skin.. This cream has a cloud like texture hence the name I guess.. texture feel very good.. how a face cream smells tells a lot about - this one smells great. It also came sealed which is important for my for hygiene reasons. It feels natural and hydrating on my skin. It is a night cream so more is hydrating than a typical day cream..but is still very lightweight compared to some others... but works on my moody skin too and does not give me any breakouts.. compared to other night creams, this is one of the best I have tried and this may become one of my go-tos! working with my sensitive skin was really a big deal for me and also being hydrating but so much that I cannot use it.. also a jar will last me a long while.. after using it for few weeks I can say my skin feels younger (some fine lines have faded) and rejuvenated Another great product from Kiehl's
