I found this cream to cause some brief stinging around my nose, I’m not sure what exactly causes that. Because of that I will not repurchase, but otherwise I thought it was decent on the rest of my face. However, for the price in general I don’t think it’s a good value for just a decent cream. sing mysing my nose, otherwise ok
