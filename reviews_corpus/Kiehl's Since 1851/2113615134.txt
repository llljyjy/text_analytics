The nerd in me geeked out when I first received this retinol serum because I felt like a chemist doing an experiment mixing the powder and liquid to create this serum.  (Don’t worry, it’s fool-proof). This step actually made me confident that the serum was fresh and I didn’t have to worry about how long it had been sitting on a store shelf.  As for the actual product, I have been using it about every other day alternating it with my exfoliator for about two full weeks.  I can already tell a big difference in my forehead lines.  I have deep creases that I constantly fight with and even botox won’t completely get them.  I took a selfie the other day and was amazed that they didn’t look as pronounced and I fully attribute that to this Kiehl  product. Amazing!
