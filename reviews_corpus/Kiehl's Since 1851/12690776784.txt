Kiel’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is a must for your nighttime routine! As your last step in your beauty regimen this velvety cream  locks in moisture and keeps working all through the night so you wake up with beautiful soft nourished skin. This cream has a nice light herbal scent, it’s thick and luxurious but melts right into your skin and has absolutely no heavy, greasy feeling. It sinks deep rather than sit on the surface leaving behind a baby soft velvety surface. A huge plus this cream is made with natural ingredients and rich in Omega 3 and 6 so don’t have to worry about what your putting on your skin. In the mornings since I’ve been using this cream my face looks amazing. My face is noticeably softer, plumped and healthier and fine lines are much less obvious!! Excited to see the results with my continued use, definitely recommend this cloud cream to anyone looking for a nourishing nighttime moisturizer that is light and luxurious. Rich, Luxurious, Nourishing Night Cream!
