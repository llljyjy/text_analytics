I bought this because i saw a few dermatologists recommend this. I used to use the DE peptide one. However, this has become my new favorite moisturizer (and cheaper)!! I have very oily skin but dry patches in certain areas due go tretinoin. I apply this at night and it leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. I typically don’t apply this during the day because it does make my oily skin look even more oily within an hour, however, if I’m going to put makeup on, I’ll moisturize with this and it leaves a great smooth base for my face products. I just use a powder to deal with any oiliness which i usually do either way. nan
