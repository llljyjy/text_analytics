I just went through a small trial size of this from my 100 points, and it has made SUCH a difference to my skin. I pick my face a lot and I have redness and scarring as a result. Within a few days of using this the redness from a more recent breakout has faded SO much to the point where I donâ€™t feel uncomfortable in public without concealer or foundation on. The only downside to this working so well is now I have to add something pricey to my cart lol Helped improve scarring redness!
